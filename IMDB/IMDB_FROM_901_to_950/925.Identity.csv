0,TheLittleSongbird,"If it weren't for the confusing final solution, this would've been a perfect thriller",9,3 September 2009,"A truly excellent film in my opinion, riddled high with tension and unnerving edge. It also makes the audience ask many questions, and on the most part, the film excels in answering those questions. Director James Mangold ensured there were plenty of tense moments and wholly convincing shocks. I can't count the number of times I was out of my seat or biting my nails, and the murders were very brutal, well most of them were. The camera-work was fantastic and quite possibly the film's main merit, the story(on a parallel with And Then There Were None, but with definite plot differences) and the performances from the likes of John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Jake Busey and Amanda Peet were nothing short of superb. And the film's length and pace were just right. My only problem with Identity, which was nearing to perfection, was the final solution, I did find it confusing and a tad implausible. But overall, it is a taut and solid thriller, that ticks almost all the right boxes. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Identity
1,Leofwine_draca,Murder mystery with an outrageous twist,6,4 August 2016,"An intriguing whodunit, a murder mystery, packed with shocks, violence, gore, and death, but oddly respectable thanks to the strong casting, which makes this movie a lot more entertaining than it might have otherwise been. Now, the success of this particular film hinges on a major plot twist towards the end which, however, is largely guessable if you consider the clues and the evidence leading up to it. I'm not sure whether I like this twist or not, but it does make the film different; without it, it would have appeared to be just another run-of-the-mill slasher. With it, it sits oddly on the borderline of being original and being extremely cheesy. I'm content to sit on the fence and say I enjoyed the film on its strengths alone.Such strengths include a number of effective shocks (sometimes, this film veers close to FINAL DESTINATION territory in the sheer shock value of the death scenes alone), good music, and developed characters. The casting is excellent, with the dependable John Cusack putting in a typically strong performance and Ray Liotta stealing all his scenes as an aggressive, intense cop (no surprises there). Other familiar faces show up – Alfred Molina, Rebecca De Mornay – to add strength to the show. For the most part this is entertaining murder-mystery stuff, moving from one strong and violent moment to the next; the twist somehow makes it all seem silly, but I'd say its worth a look anyway.",Identity
2,SnoopyStyle,well made murder mystery and then ...,8,9 October 2014,"Psychiatrist Malick (Alfred Molina) is treating mass murderer Malcolm Rivers. It's the night before his execution and he's being transported to a hearing to determine his sanity. Meanwhile another part of the movie centers on an isolated motel. It's a torrential rainstorm in the middle of the night. George York (John C. McGinley) brings in his injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and finds motel manager Larry (John Hawkes). Ed (John Cusack) the chauffeur distracted by spoiled actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) had run her over after the Yorks broke down by the side of the road. Con woman Paris (Amanda Peet) hit a telephone pole and knocks out the land line. The motel is cut off by flooding. Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall) are newlyweds as well as corrections officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) are also stranded at the motel. The prisoner escapes and people starts dying.The movie starts out as two related stories of a escaped killer. That is something a little bit off about the scenario but it's never quite obvious. For example, the movie doesn't need to go back to Dr. Malick if this is a simple slasher flick. The characters are all a bit specific. The total isolation seems too convenient. The movie seems to be a good B-movie with a lot of solid actors for the first two acts. Then it becomes something even more.",Identity
3,claudio_carvalho,An Original and Intriguing Thriller,9,25 June 2004,"In a heavy rainy night, ten strangers are trapped in a road motel located over a former Indian cemetery with its weird manager Larry (John Hawkes). The group has to spend the night in the place, and is composed of former detective and driver Ed (John Cusak), who is driving the spoiled actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay); detective Rhodes (Ray Liotta), who is transporting the prisoner Robert Maine (Jake Busey); the prostitute Paris (Amanda Peet), who is traveling alone; the young just married couple Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); and Alice York (Leila Kenzel), George York (John C. McGinley) and their son Timmy York (Bret Loehr). All the nearby roads are flooded and without access, and all the means of communication are not working. Meanwhile, a meeting composed of Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina), the Defense Lawyer (Carmen Argenziano), the District Attorney (Marshall Bell), the Assistant District Attorney (Matt Letscher) and Judge Taylor (Holmes Osborne) are deciding the fate of serial killer with multiple personalities Bailiff Jenkins (Joe Hart), who is convicted to death penalty on the next day. Wow, what a great surprise! This movie is indeed an original and intriguing thriller. I dare to say that it is impossible to solve the mystery without a spoiler. The excellent cast is supported by a great screenplay and direction, and the viewer keeps guessing what is happening along 90 minutes and the genre of this movie (horror / crime / mystery / suspense?), until the last scene, where the plot is satisfactorily resolved. Highly recommended. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Identidade' (`Identity')",Identity
4,claudio_carvalho,Excellent and Intriguing Even When You Watch It For the Second Time,9,21 August 2004,"Today I have watched ""Identity"" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent and intriguing film. There are two versions in the DVD, and I selected the one with scenes that were cut in the final edition (the other option was the theatrical version). Now I paid more attention on the details of the plot, trying to identify flaws in the screenplay, but the story is very tight. There are many extras in the DVD, including deleted scenes, making of, filmography, comments etc. It is amazing the filmography of John Cusack, composed mainly of good movies. I keep my initial vote (nine).Title (Brazil): `Identidade' (`Identity')",Identity
5,kosmasp,Right there! Where? There!,9,15 September 2010,"Even if you have watched the movie, you might not understand my summary line. Still I hope to get a nodding smile from at least one person who has figured it out. Speaking of which, this is something that a lot to do with the movie at hand. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favour, do not read too much about it, more than this is a thriller, with quite a few twists and story turns.You might not understand why some things are shown, right from the start, but you will come to understand as the movie progresses. The wickedly fantastic script does a great job in conveying dialogue, character and story. And it is delightful to see, that they could get good actors to be in the movie. It's one of the movies, that were entertaining from start to finish. (at least for me)",Identity
6,lee_eisenberg,Like nothing that you've ever seen before.,10,5 October 2005,"Here's a little question for you: what would you do if you were trapped in an abandoned hotel with several other people, and one by one, you started disappearing? To throw a little wrench in the works, what if you all may or may not have a connection to each other? To further play with things, what if there's a man in police custody who may or may not be connected? That's the premise of the mind-blowing ""Identity"". Ed (John Cusack) is the central character trapped in the hotel...or is he? And just what is the case with mental patient Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vance)? This is the sort of movie that makes you question your own sanity.",Identity
7,jboothmillard,Identity,4,5 December 2006,"From director James Mangold (Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, Knight and Day), I remember seeing this film once before, but I probably didn't fully grip to grips with what was going on, and was unsure my opinion rating was accurate, so I watched it again. Basically psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina) has discovered a journal belonging to his patient Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who awaits execution for the murder of several victims in a motel, and through flashback we see the horrific events take place. The ten strangers who end up at the motel in the middle of the night during a stormy night are limo driver and former cop Ed Dakota (John Cusack), cop Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting serial killer Robert Maine (Jake Busey), attractive prostitute Paris (2012's Amanda Peet), newlyweds Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); family in crisis with father/husband George York (John C. McGinley), mother/wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and son Timmy (Bret Loehr) and 80's movie star Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay). All have ended up at the motel, and soon enough they realise they are all in danger as they are being killed one by one by an unknown psycho, and after he killed Maine they confirm it is not an obvious person. They do at one point suspect the motel's owner Larry (John Hawkes), because he has all the keys to the doors and all the knowledge of each room, but he is killed as well ruling him out too. We found out towards the end however that all the characters we have been watching are part of Rivers, he suffers from extreme dissociative identity disorder, meaning that he is playing out what happened in reality as all the people he killed. In the end, we do see a conclusion to the in his mind story, the authorities conclude that Rivers should be placed in a mental institution, and we find out that the personality that was doing all the murders was Timmy, and he (Rivers) did manage to kill all the victims, including the final victim who supposedly got away. The cast of well known stars all do reasonably well, the killing spree format does okay, and the conclusions of how it all happened are near enough alright twists, all in all though it isn't exactly something I need to see again, but it's not a terrible murder mystery thriller. Okay!",Identity

The movie keeps your interest all the way but the bad news is that most of the characters are profane and unlikeable, especially the women in here. The ""ladies"" are brutal! John Cusack, as ""Ed,"" has the most interesting role, followed closely by Ray Liotta's ""Rhodes."" Neither of those two characters had last names in this story.",Identity
9,ma-cortes,"It's a good film full of suspense , thrills , intrigue and lots of killings",7,21 September 2004,"The movie centers a motley group who are looking for shelter in a deserted motel , being caught up in a severe rainstorm and stuck at the strange place , located in the desolate Nevada. They are strangers from all different walks of life : a limousine driver escorting a tarnished television star, parents with a young son whose marriage is broken , a policeman transporting a dangerous convict, a gorgeous call girl, a pair of young newlyweds, and a nervous motel manager are shut themselves up during a rainy night . But , the hosts have been murdered one by one . Who's the killer ?.The film is a fascinating whodunit, we have got really intrigued from start to finish . The storyline has a twisted plot and the final has an extraordinary surprise.The flick is inspired by Agatha Christie's classic novel : ¨Ten little indians¨ that has several cinematic adaptations.In the movie there is suspense , thriller, noisy action , emotion and a little bit gore when the assassinations happen.All the cast is nice, but interpretations from Rebecca Mornay and Pruitt Taylor Vince are specially riveting . Alan Silvestri musical score and Papamichael cinematography are atmospheric and adequate. It was shot on a huge sound stage at Sony studios in Culver City .

10,moonspinner55,Passable talents slumming on a second-string feature...,4,1 September 2006,"Twisty, but overextended, exhausted plot about a string of deaths centered around a group of people at a motel who share an eerie connection. Talented director James Mangold is just biding his time with this lackluster material, which plays a bit like a stretched-thin episode of TV""s ""The Twilight Zone"". Once it's understood that the subplots and the editing flourishes are just gimmicks, the film's tricks become that of self-parody, with over-the-top murders. Not badly made but, aside from John Cusack, there isn't a hint of cleverness in the casting: Amanda Peet works very hard, but poor Ray Liotta looks burnt-out. Rebecca De Mornay is merely around to be laughed at--not a good way for an actress to make a comeback. Disappointing thriller has a few jolts, but too much outright silliness. ** from ****",Identity
11,blanche-2,10 Little Indians Meet at the Bates Motel,8,3 January 2012,"I rented this on Netflix, and I didn't realize it was a ""Thriller"" (horror movie!). I am NOT a horror film fan. I decided to give this film ten minutes and if it grossed me out, I was turning it off.I was not prepared for this stylish, well-written, well-acted film that was low on blood and high on suspense and mystery, beautifully directed by James Mangold. The stars are first rate - Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca de Mornay, Clea DuVall, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, and Alfred Molina.The story concerns ten people stranded at a run-down Nevada hotel in the middle of what can only be described as a monsoon. They start dying one by one, and near each body is found a room key, starting with number 10. And I have to leave it there so I won't spoil it.I figured some of this plot out early on, thanks to years of watching mysteries and suspense films, but that didn't take away from the film's intensity or other various twists that occur. Even if you've been watching films as long as I have, you won't be prepared for some of what happens.Really excellent.",Identity
12,Quinoa1984,"Identity is Mangold trying to do something of a Stephen King work, which has it's hits and misses",5,26 April 2003,"Identity has one of those spectacular starts to a suspense movie where a bunch of characters wind up in the same place due to a series of shattering, if overly-fantastic, set of circumstances.  A family driving in the car gets a spare tire from a shoe on the road dropped by a woman, the mother steps out of the car and gets knocked by another car which has an ex-cop as the driver and the passenger as an actress.  They go to a motel, where also a cop is transporting a prisoner.  But then things start to happen...The suspense works when the performances do, which is a good lot (maybe half) of the time thanks to the usual style of Cusack, Liotta, and even supporting players such as McGinley and Busey.  Yet, the other half of the time, which makes up the third act, comes off as hokeyness.  There is intrigue in what unfolds in the psychological aspect, but there's too much of a feeling of the story becoming convoluted.  It's basically a try from the director of Copland and Girl, Interrupted, to try for a Stephen King type of story- the ending should remind viewers what I mean.  Possibly worthy for a future night viewing when nothing else is on.  C+",Identity

Due to the torrential downpour, these ""Ten Little Indians"" must take shelter at a Nevada motel resembling the one in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and run by twitchy manager Larry Washington (John Hawkes).""Identity"" is an imaginative and thoughtful updating of tried and true suspense formulas. You'll want to see it in ""widescreen"" but will also be given the choice of two viewing options - the ""theatrical"" and ""extended"" versions are offered as options. My advice is to see it in ""theatrical"" first, although ""extended"" will be tempting. The film is enjoyable on several levels, and the ""extended"" version will be more fun during a second viewing, when you're examining plot points, performances, and production style. The ""extended"" version includes a scene that implicitly gives too much information, due to its placement.A terrific ""motel set"" was built for the picture, and is fantastically detailed. Production designer Mark Friedberg, art director Jess Gonchor, and set decorator Cindy Carr should have been nominated for ""Academy Awards"". The broken tiles, drain pipes, 8-tracks, and jigsaw puzzles are among the thousands of parts assembled for the décor of ""Identity"" and its crowded psychosis. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael make Michael Cooney's story look brilliant, complimented by great editing from David Brenner and music by Alan Silvestri. The ensemble cast is a great character study.******** Identity (4/25/03) James Mangold ~ John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes",Identity
14,Coventry,Who'll stop the rain ?,7,23 September 2003,"Every week, I read two movie magazines. When it comes to new movies, they mostly agree in their reviews. Except for Identity! One magazine said it was really good and filled with pleasant surprises. The other one said it was dull and rather predictable. This really meant I HAD to see this one. I finally did now and I must say I tend to agree with both my magazines. It sure had its predictable moments but that didn't spoil the fun for me. And it's one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. SPOILERS MAY APPEAR FROM HERE!!!! WATCH OUT WHAT YOU READ !!!Now, this is hard to explain but Identity is predictable while it's surprising. The whole ""motel-mystery"" has its flaws and it's overall predictable indeed. But inside this story, there are still a few pleasant surprises to discover. SUPER SPOILERS HERE!!! Come on, of all people who claim they saw right through the plot...who can honestly say they suspected Ray Liotta to be an escaped villain ?? Or that Larry wasn't the real motel owner ?? END SUPER SPOILERS ! ( still small spoilers, though ) All people who claimed they fully figured this movie out after half an hour are lying. Even if they did have a good idea about the motel thing ( as did I, by the way ), I suspect they were still stunned by the whole wraparound story. You have to be pretty psycho yourself if you understood this from the beginning. So, in general, a very good story and a nice change in the average supernatural thrillers we get nowadays. END SPOILERS !!!Now for my favorite part of Identity. The flawless cast. Allow me to start with the side characters which were still played by known and very decent actors. John C. McGinley for example. Ever since Platoon and Wall Street I thought this guy was a very good actor but he never seemed to broke through. That's a shame because he truely is underrated. Clea DuVall is also in this movie. Whatever happened to her? I really thought she would become a great actress real soon but she still has to be satisfied with smaller roles. She isn't really cute but she's a damn good actress. One of the best in her young generation. Jake Busey is always a pleasure to watch. He sort of repeats the role he had in the Frighteners and this fits him very well. The leading actors are just great. Ray Liotta has always been a favorite of mine he proved again that he is worth this status. Never a bad word about John Cusack neither. He's outstanding as usual. In fact, I think it's his third best role next to Pushing Tin and Grosse Point Blank. I enjoyed Con Air as well, but I hope he never tries to be an action hero again. Intelligent comedies or psychological stories fit him better, in my opinion. I don't really care for Amanda Peet, but I guess she did a good job. At least, she was less annoying than in The Whole Nine Yards.The whole setting reminded me of Alfred Hitchkock's masterpiece PSYCHO. Only this manager is more funny than Norman Bates. Psycho proved that it's possible to create a unique atmosphere in an abandoned motel but furthermore there are few relations between these two movies. The constant rain contributes as well to this great setting. Well made, more than enough suspense, great acting and tones of creepy sequences. That's really all I can say about it. Oh, I can say I fully figured out the Sixth Sense when I first saw that one but NOT Identity...I guess that's a good sign.",Identity

In a pouring down rainstorm 10 unrelated travelers find themselves seeking shelter in an isolated motel and proceed to die, one by one. Right when you think you have figured this nightmare out; one big revelation puts things closer to making sense.

16,hitchcockthelegend,"His story's so unbelievable, I think it just might be true.",7,3 May 2019,"Identity is directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney. It stars John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amada Peet, Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vince. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr.Inspired by Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, Identity pitches 10 characters trapped at a motel who begin getting killed off one by one...If you are going to do yet another take on Christies superb literary source then at least bring some freshness, so how nice to find that Identity does in fact ironically have its own. Set up is suitably in keeping with murder mystery shenanigans, there's major flooding and our host of characters are bound to a shabby motel run by a shabby John Hawkes. On the edges of the frame we have another story where multiple killer Malcolm Rivers (the wonderful wobbly eyed P.T. Vince) is under interrogation to test for insanity to stave off his impending execution.Mangold uses flashbacks to put the various characters at the motel, in how they came to be there. There's a creative ambitiousness about how Mangold constructs the pic that draws you in, which come the finale will either have you satiated or stupefied. The murder sequences are very well put together, with a couple being well ghoulish, and it's a very impressive cast of actors working their way through the formulaic but fascinatingly cheat free psychological murk.It's not as smart as it thinks it is but this has enough of an absorbing pull, and no little intelligence, to lift it higher than many other Agatha 10 copies. 7/10",Identity
17,jotix100,Finding one's own personality in the rain at the roach motel...,7,1 May 2003,"James Mangold is an interesting director to watch if he has the right material to work with. This film, as written by Michael Cooney, who is really the less talented  of the Kaufman brothers, as we saw in Adaptation, is not for the faint hearted.There are enough gory details to keep the viewer at the end of his seat wondering what new whacky twist will happen next. To say that it is confusing to the average person, is to put it mildly. Perhaps, as some writers to this forum have expressed, it might be better on a second, or maybe a third viewing since most clues fly over our heads not knowing what to make of the many ""personalities""  a person can have and be at the same place, at the same time. Watch out for the Ides of May!Any film with Ray Liotta and John Cusack will be worth the price of admission. They always deliver. Both are in top form here, even though they might even share the same personality. The rest of the cast was good too. It was a surprise to see Rebeca De Mornay in the very brief role of the egotistical actress who doesn't get a chance to star in her next film....The only thing missing was the limited presence of Taylor Pruitt Vince, who has appeared in other Mangold directed films and has nothing to in this one.",Identity
18,Doylenf,The plot is based on a combination of several past thrillers...,6,11 October 2009,"IDENTITY is really a case of stolen identity. It borrows heavily from a number of other thrillers by using elements of them and stirring them up into a new blend of chills.Many are cliché ridden elements: a savage thunderstorm at a deserted highway motel in the middle of nowhere, a number of people who realize that they are being killed off one by one, a couple of authority figures who only appear to be what they are, and several other twists such as having the chief suspect being completely innocent. There are shades of Agatha Christie, ""Psycho"" and several other stories that must have been the inspiration for the plot.But sadly, the film is badly marred by some senseless revelations and a completely baffling twist ending that is surprising but unbelievable.Good for any mystery fan who likes a story that makes you think, and well acted by RAY LIOTTA, JOHN CUSACK, ALFRED MOLINA and others, but misses being taken as a serious thriller by quite a wide margin.",Identity

There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery).  There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack.  What's happened to him?

21,poolandrews,"Average murder mystery, I guessed two thirds of the ending...",5,10 January 2008,"Identity is set in Nevada late one night during a fierce rainstorm & starts as limo driver Edward Dakota (John Cusack) is driving actress Paris Nevada (Amada Peet) across a remote desert valley, suddenly he runs into a woman named Alice York (Leila Kenzle) who was standing in the highway after her car got a flat tyre. Together with her husband George (John C. McGinley) & young son Timmy (Bret Loehr) they stop at an isolated motel to get some help, there they quickly realise all the roads are flooded & the telephone lines are down & that they will have to wait it out until the morning. Various other assorted people turn up from police officer's to a couple who were recently married, soon after the decapitated head of Paris is found & it becomes clear there is a murderer amongst their number as the dead bodies start to pile up at an alarming rate...Directed by James Mangold Identity is for the first seventy odd minutes an Agatha Christie style whodunit as various character's are killed off under mysterious circumstances in some sort of isolated location, it has the intrigue, the mystery, the red herrings & story traits one expects from a typical whodunit. I love murder mystery whodunit's, I really do from the likes of classic telly detective show's like Quincy (1977 - 1983) to Columbo (1971 - 2000) to Midsomer Murders & straight out-and-out horror film whodunit's like Scream (1996) & I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) as well as dozens of imitator's, I have spent many an hour in front of my telly trying to work out who did it, why they did it & how they did it. I don't usually get it right but I usually do have fun trying to figure it out. Anyway, here we have Identity, which is a mixture of horror & straight laced detective drama which when all said & done like any good whodunit stands or falls by the strength of it's twist ending which I personally don't think is that good. It starts off fine, an isolated location, a torrential thunderstorm which strands several people all of whom seem to be hiding things or have hidden agenda's, then the killings begin & it draws you in as you just instinctively want to know who is responsible. So far so good. But then about twenty minutes before it's end Identity turns it's whole story, it's whole plot, all the character's & literally everything that has happened to that point on it's head with a frustrating twist which I didn't like. I understood it but I just didn't like it. In my opinion this twist cheapens everything that has happened before, it ruins the story & makes it almost pointless. Also I have to say that I guessed who the killer was, I was sat there watching Identity & thought who would the makers feel was the least likely person to have done it & went for them & I was totally right! Not why 'they' actually did it or how 'they' did it but I guessed their identity within twenty minutes. I also anticipated the plot twist involving another character exactly which didn't help matters since apart from one huge twist I pretty much had Identity figured out. Also, was the body of the dead motel owner ever explained? The eventual killer couldn't have possibly killed him...Director Mangold does alright, there's a decent atmosphere, there's some tension & one or two jump out of your seat scare moments as well. It's just a shame about the twist which I honestly didn't think worked, it made sense & I have no complaints there but I was just expecting more & the murder mystery side of things was too predictable for me although I'm not saying for one moment everyone who watches it will figure it out because I'm sure lots won't. There's a decapitated head in a tumble dryer but otherwise not much gore & the murders happen off screen.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 which sounds a hell of a lot of money to me, I thought it was one of those low budget films which relied on some sort of extreme plot twist to gain attention but 30 big ones puts this up there as a pretty big budget Hollywood flick. There's good cast here including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Alfred Molina, Jake Busey & Rebecca De Mornay who all put in good performances.Identity is a good murder mystery for seventy odd minutes but then sort of collapses in a really hard to swallow twist ending which for me ruined everything that had happened before it. The killer is too obvious as well. Good & an interesting film to watch once but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again & I certainly couldn't recommend it.",Identity

The plot of a group of people being stranded at a motel during a rain storm is the starting point of a tale that should end about two minutes before it does.(The last two minutes are stupid fill in the blanks stuff its not needed and could be considered almost a cop out) I would love to tell you whats going on but I think the less you know the better it is. Although I am looking forward to seeing it again because its a good thriller even if I told you everything.Forgive me this is a really good movie that I want to discuss with someone who's seen it simply because there is so much to love and its so well made despite the bumps in the road. I will have to corner people in my office and chat the movie up....If you like thrillers see this movie.Three and a half stars how good is it? I stopped sorting photos to watch this baby....,Identity

However, the first twist made it into an interesting psychological drama. This twist was not enough to sustain the movie though, and the second twist just seemed gratuitous, for the sake of a climactic ending.Reasonably entertaining and intriguing though, despite all its faults.Performances are so-so. Amanda Peet is about the only actor/actress that shines. John Cusack and Ray Liotta should be the stars but just seem like they're trying too hard. John C McGinley is irritating in his role - he should stick to comedy.",Identity
24,Boba_Fett1138,Horror with brains.,9,3 May 2004,"I watched this movie without having an idea what it was about. It surprised me and I enjoyed it very much. It's recommendable to watch this movie without reading or hearing too much about it at first. I think that way you'll appreciate the movie more.It begins as a kind of drama then it slowly turns into an horror movie, a thriller and a supernatural thriller. The way the story is build up is unique and works surprising well. Unlike many other movies from its genre, the story is complicated and plays a significant role. Horror with brains.The movie never seize to surprise. The movie is full with plot twists, from beginning till the end. Highly recommendable for people who like to be surprised by a movie, even though real smart people already see the ending coming from miles away.There is a nice Hitchcock like atmosphere and some great characters played by highly talented actors. Another significant difference with other movies from its genre.Let this movie surprise you.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Identity
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just when you thought twist-movies had improved... *minor spoilers*,7,7 June 2005,"I picked this movie up at Blockbuster after having been recommended it a long time ago. The beginning looked somewhat promising, and I enjoyed the use of a non-linear time-line. The way the many characters were brought together was even kind of clever(even though it's basically just a bunch of people driving in cars at the same place at the same time). Most of the accidents in the beginning was kind of dumb and even a tad staged; most of them seemed to have been easily avoided if the drivers would just pay attention to the road instead of doing everything else at once. Don't consider that a spoiler; it all happens within the first five minutes or so. The plot quickly turns into a regular 'Who Done It', with even the least attentive viewers being able to figure out the order in which order the people get whacked. The pacing tries to be intense, but fails to be so past the first ten minutes. I could barely keep paying attention to it. Up to the very end, this seemed to be a well-done and pretty but ultimately very pedestrian mystery-thriller, with no real surprises. Then came the twist. And it got so much worse. Not only was the twist easy to figure out and a horrible cop-out, it ruined everything the movie had built up(as little as there was) to that point. It kicked down every brick of the foundation of the film. Even worse, the film goes on for about fifteen minutes past that. And here's the real kicker; there's another twist. Even more painful, and even more predictable. You have been warned. If you still have any wish to see this movie at any point, I will objectively review what I haven't reviewed already. The characters are diverse and interesting, and they have a fair amount of development each. The cast does contain some very talented people, unfortunately, too few of them are given anything to do. Jake Busey and John C. McGinley are criminally underused. The film contains a few genuine scares and some decent enough guessing of the killer's identity. I recommend it to fans of the actors and people who enjoy the genres. Just be prepared for a pitifully bad twist ending. 7/10",Identity
26,view_and_review,Identity keeps you guessing until the end,8,13 March 2007,"A group of seemingly random individuals are stranded at a motel one stormy night and they eventually come up dead one by one. You come to realize that these people are actually representative of each of Malcolm River's identities, and one of them is responsible for killing the others.The movie is surprisingly captivating as you watch to find out who is killing off each of the identities, and which identity will prevail. It is made more compelling because as you get a look inside the head of Malcom River (Pruitt Taylor Vince), he is at the same time in front of a panel that is to decide whether he should be given the death penalty for his crimes, or be put in an insane asylum. A good job is done to keep you guessing until the end, both on the eventual verdict and the eventual prevailing identity. This was a very good movie that flew under the radar.",Identity
27,neil-476,Intriguing and thoughtful suspense murder thriller,8,5 July 2011,"After a rather puzzling introduction sequence we find ourselves in the company of a motley group of individuals all of whom are stranded at a remote motel when bad weather washes the road out. There is some friction between them - not unexpected - but it doesn't seem sufficient to explain away the disappearance of one of their number, subsequently found dead. Is it one of their number, or someone else? Then another member of the group dies...All this seems familiar enough stuff and, indeed, it is. Up to about the halfway mark. Then we realise that the fact that everyone is trapped here has some significance, and the movie goes in a direction which - to me, at least - is entirely unexpected.A decent cast, headed by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, play this for all it's worth. The material might not convince in other hands, but it is in safe hands here, and a film which starts out by pretending to be one thing and ends up as something quite different succeeds very well.Highly recommended.",Identity

One by one they become victims of a psychotic killer whose identity is not disclosed until the very end. Because it keeps the audience guessing it manages to keep up the suspense and utilizes the dark, stormy environment to achieve an exciting climax. Good performances are accomplished by John Cusack (""Ed""), Ray Liotta (""Rhodes"") and Amanda Peet (""Paris""). But I think the best acting was done by John Hawkes as the motel desk clerk, ""Larry"". And while it has no major faults, I would have preferred to see more of Rebecca De Mornay who played the self-centered actress named ""Caroline Suzanne"". But that's just my personal preference and it doesn't impair the movie to any real degree. In short, this is a very nice film that retains interest from start to finish. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a movie of this genre.",Identity
29,ferguson-6,"Here Honey, you hold the room key",6,28 April 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Highly anticipated ""thriller"" that for the most part, fails to deliver.  More slasher than thriller.  The psychological aspect held great promise and intrigue, but was handled poorly.  Director James Mangold continues with his run of disappointing films, including ""Kate & Leopold"", ""Girl, Interrupted"" and ""Cop Land"".  He does have some visual style, but lacks the ability to add substance to his work.  Cusack and Liotta are strong in their roles, and Amanda Peet is surprisingly effective as the young dreamer.  The always great Alfred Molina provides excellent work in relief, and an almost unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay has a quick turn as a a woman who ""used to be that actress"".  Gotta love those that can poke fun at themselves.  Speaking of fun, many of the death scenes generate outloud laughter from the audience due to the unbelievable nature.  Overall this film steals from the best - Psycho, The Omen, The Sixth Sense, Carrie, The Fury and Ten Little Indians.  The problem is those were all very strong scripts that were filmed brilliantly, whereas ""Identity"" seems to avoid the one topic that could have provided the film with its own 'identity'.  Focus on the internal battle of personalities could have been the key to setting this one apart.  Instead, it is just another slasher with a nice cast.",Identity

What the screenplay needs is multiple good story points. It begins fine with characters introduced as well as events surrounding their arrivals. We have the family with the injured passenger. We have an ex-cop driving a snotty actress in a limousine. We have a cop as well as the killer he is transporting, as if that isn't obvious. We have the eloping couple that bicker like guest from The Jerry Springer Show. Finally we have a hooker named Paris (how nice). One graphic incident after another with images of characters being hacked to pieces, hit by cars, bludgeoned to death, shot to death, etc. We are even given the image of a baseball bat emerged from someone's mouth. That is about the height of intelligence in this dead beat film. Director James Mangold makes good use of locations but this is no Cop Land. Actors are like roll call from limo driver John Cusack to cop Ray Liotta, to Peet with a case of money, to psychotic Jake Busey who escapes, to Clea Du Vall as a whiny bride. This is a roll call in shame with actors capable of better things than this. They assemble in single file until their time to be picked off has arrived.

Is there any narrative structure?....Identity is one of those films that you really dislike for some unknown reason, but keep going back to because of all the praise its received. So after my fifth revisit to the film, it finally became clear to me, I couldn't care less about the characters because there wasn't one likable thing about any of them.Yes, that may be something to do with the twist, but not one sympathetic character out of any of them? Pert may be some peoples answers, but she gets to much aggression from multiple people, that by the end of the second act, she becomes the aggressor herself.Cusack, usually brilliant, just appears to be on autopilot the whole way through the film, and Liotta's trademark shouty authoritative schtick is becoming more and more tiresome as his career choices.So that's the film, a group of unlikeable characters stuck in a hotel, with insufferable weather, and attitudes.

And back when it first came out, I was a lot more engaged by the big reveal at the end than I am today. For a while, I wasn't sure if the problem was a bad script or just that it doesn't hold up on rewatch. It's the script.It's got good ideas, they're just poorly executed. People die off in the most contrived ways (you know how it is: you may not have seen a death coming, but you feel cheated after it happens).

37,JamesHitchcock,Two good films spliced together to make a bad one,5,23 January 2008,"The twist- a sudden, unexpected development- is a common plot device in the modern cinema, especially in thrillers. Unfortunately for scriptwriters, most of the classic twists have been so over-used that they no longer come as a surprise to the audience. It no longer seems original to reveal that, for example, the hero's girl or best friend is really in league with the villains, or that a police officer investigating a crime is in fact responsible for committing it, or that a character believed to be dead is still very much alive.Of course, the fact that a particular twist is so hackneyed as to have become a cliché does not prevent film-makers from continuing to rely upon it- ""Reindeer Games"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" are two examples of modern thrillers likely to leave audiences with a ""seen it all before"" feeling. The challenge to the really inventive scriptwriter is now to come up with as novel or outlandish a twist as possible. ""Identity"" is a good example.The setting of the film is an isolated Nevada motel. (Motels, in the cinema, have always seemed sinister places ever since Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", set in the neighbouring state of Arizona). A sudden and violent rainstorm brings together ten strangers; the motel manager, a spoilt, arrogant movie star and her chauffeur (who turns out to be an ex-policeman), another policeman and the convict he is escorting, a prostitute, and two married couples, one of them with a young son. The mother of this boy has been injured after being struck by the film star's limousine.One by one the members of this group start to die violent deaths. One of them must be a killer; the question is ""Which one?"" The film seems to be a traditional thriller along the lines of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", challenging the audience to work out who is the murderer. We can, for example, rule out Caroline the film star (first to die), or the convict (too obvious), or his police escort. (His violent, aggressive personality also makes him a too-obvious suspect, and in any case ""the policeman did it"" was a plot line famously used by Christie in another of her murder mysteries).Intercut with the scenes set in the motel, however, are scenes set in a courtroom. The judge, prosecution and defence lawyers and a psychiatrist are discussing the case of a convicted murderer named Malcolm Rivers, who has been condemned to death. The psychiatrist claims to have new evidence about Rivers' mental state which could save his life. Rivers, however, is not one of the group at the motel, and cannot possibly be responsible for the killings there.Then comes the twist, which shows what the connection is between the two seemingly unconnected plot lines. It is revealed that none of the events at the motel have ever taken place. The characters gathered there do not exist outside Rivers' mind. He suffers from multiple personality disorder, and each of the characters at the motel represents one of his many separate personalities. The supposed ""killings"" represent a struggle between these personalities for dominance. His psychiatrist believes that at the end only one of his personalities will survive- the personality responsible for the real-life murders committed by Rivers.This is certainly an original twist. The trouble is that as soon as the truth is revealed it renders everything that has gone before essentially meaningless. It becomes difficult for us to care about the people in the motel, or to concern ourselves about which one of them is killing the others, once we realise that they are no more than the fantasies of a madman's sick mind. This is a pity, because the motel part of the film is actually quite well done- highly atmospheric with some good acting contributions, especially from John Cusack as Edward the chauffeur and Ray Liotta as the policeman escorting the convict.""Identity"" contains within it two potentially good films, one a murder mystery, the other a courtroom drama about the battle to save a mentally ill killer from the death penalty on the grounds of insanity. Unfortunately, these two good films have been incongruously spliced together to produce a bad one. 5/10",Identity

Identity falls into the second category, and sadly, I don't believe, enjoyed the acclaim it deserves. It is a crafty thriller, in a world where few exist. It succeeds in areas usually left untouched in other thrillers. And its third act doesn't leave off on a botched cliffhanger.It is a dark and stormy night in Nevada. We see a family of three drive along an empty road before getting a flat. The man (McGinley) and the woman (Kenzle) get out of the car to attend to it and it isn't long before a limousine driver (Cusack) taxiing a brash and brazen actress (Mornay) strikes the woman, knocking her out and leaving her bleeding uncontrollably. While this is happening, the couples' kid (Loehr) witnesses it all.The road is flooded both ways, so the gang winds up heading to a seamy motel, run by John Hawkes in a well nuanced performance. Throughout the night, numerous other people show up at the motel such as Ray Liotta, whose character is transporting a convict to another prison, a prostitute (Peet), and a newlywed couple (Duvall and Scott). They believe that their presence in the same motel on the same night is a coincidence, until more information is revealed.All of this seems to be fine, until people start disappearing one by one. Experienced moviegoers may discover who it is before most. I was expecting Identity to have a great first act, an intriguing second act, but a phoned-in, cliché-ridden third act. On the contrary; every act in Identity is taken care of and the writing throughout the film is polished ecstatically.The performances are not overacted, with probably the one of the hour coming from John Cusack; an actor who I've always been pleased with. He captures the role of the everyman extremely well, and always seems to play the character who is sophisticated and tries to keep everyone controlled and collective. I think between Identity and 1408, he always has had problems with motels.Identity is a crafty, and well-done thriller, motivated by lively performances, slick writing, and a final act that wraps everything together nicely. It goes on the shelf not side-by-side cheap, inferior thrillers, but next to films like Jeepers Creepers and Joy Ride. I like to call this shelf ""underrated and unsung.""

Before long, a series of murders begins to whittle them down. But all is not what it seems.The defining factor of Identity is its twist-in-the-tail ending. It seems to have divided audiences on account of this. But I for one think it works really well. The idea of the dramas playing out being the strange fruits of some sort of conflict within the mind of a maniac with a multiple personality disorder is quite a good one and allows the story to go off in over-the-top directions with the fall back that it is after all not real and the imaginings of a psychologically troubled individual. For this reason I guess you could argue that the story could have dipped into even more surreal ideas if anything - events do seem a little more generic than they needed to be given the opportunity the central idea allows for the story to go wild and unhinged directions. The main narrative is effectively a combination of a whodunit with some slasher movie elements. It's not a classic and it could have used its potential better but it remains a nicely original take on a traditional genre nevertheless.",Identity
43,sddavis63,An Effective Twist In What Seemed To Be A Cliché Movie,7,9 October 2010,"For at least three quarters of this movie you think you're watching the same story that's been done over and over again in various settings. A group of complete strangers have been forced together by a set of strange circumstances and coincidences and - wouldn't you know it - they start to get killed off one by one. Ho hum. OK. You know what you're in for. It's nothing special because it's been done so many times before, but there's a reasonably effective mystery as to who's actually doing the killing and so you settle in for what you expect will be a passable if utterly unspectacular movie, made a little bit better by a pretty good cast, headed by John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. Then comes the twist - truly one of the more effective (because it's so unexpected) twists I've ever seen in a movie.We knew from the beginning of the movie that a serial killer was a part of the equation. He's being transported to a hearing the night before he's due to be executed for his crimes, and a car accident makes him one of the strangers, and the obvious suspect - until he, too, turns up dead. But who could have expected the actual twist. None of it is real. Everything is taking place inside the mind of the serial killer, who actually has multiple personality disorder and is receiving some type of treatment designed to bring his various personalities ""together"" at the same time so that they can kill one another off - including the one responsible for committing the serial killings. Sure. It's probably nonsense, but still I was taken completely off balance by that one. It was completely unexpected and - as far as I'm concerned - quite ingenious. My only quibble with it is that perhaps the ""twist"" was introduced a bit too soon. Once it was revealed it seemed to take away some of the drama of what was happening, because now we knew that it was all inside the killer's head, and that none of the actually murders taking place are actually taking place. Still, the movie manages also to end on a bit of a ""twist"" note. Things are still not exactly what you expect - the identification of which personality is actually the serial killer is a surprise.The movie left things a little bit open at the end, making me wonder if a sequel (never made) was on the minds of the producers. Whether that was or not, this turned out to be a decent little thriller; much more entertaining than I expected it to be at first.",Identity

And even as I watched it, none of it seemed familiar, only I knew some things in advance of their reveal.

45,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It doesn't stick the landing.,6,24 July 2019,"'Identity (2003)' sort of gets worse the longer you think about it, in a way, thanks mainly to its silly ending that tries to get in one last, somewhat 'edgy' shock but ends up feeling cheap, pretty nonsensical and, frankly, downright goofy. It's not just the ending itself that causes this retrospective souring, for the movie's true nature - revealed towards its final third - almost delegitimises the overall experience. In and of itself, this twist is a perfectly fine - though, very early-2000s - way to wrap up the plot, tying together the piece's otherwise apparently disparate halves in a relatively natural and, even, fairly clever way. The issue comes when you realise that this reveal actually makes the mainline 'whodunnit' stuff ever-so-slightly superfluous, especially when paired with the true ending that throws everything into question from a writing point of view. When taken as a whole, with everything on the table, the picture doesn't feel as though it knows what it really is or, even, what it's trying to do, I suppose - aside from take the audience on a 'guessing game', horror-themed roller-coaster. In the end, that's perfectly fine. That's all it is, though: fine. It could have been a lot more, a thriller that keeps your brain whirring long after its credits have rolled. In the moment, the movie is entertaining enough and it keeps you suitably engaged. Its puzzle pieces all fit together nicely and it doesn't cheat, per se - until it reaches its final reveal, which relies on, essentially, hidden information and, thus, feels cheap. I will say that I figured out its most major twist far before the piece ostensibly wanted me to, but that's not so much an issue as a testament to the fact that the jigsaw is solvable and, therefore, satisfying (until the final reveal, that is). It's also a testament to the fact that it's all quite generic. Ultimately, it's meant to be experienced and then forgotten, lapped up by an audience that love a good twist whether or not it makes absolute narrative sense or adds to its overall cohesion. It's well-made, enjoyable and almost entirely forgettable. 6/10",Identity

47,ThomasDrufke,Doesn't Quite Stick the Landing But Still Very Good,7,22 June 2020,"The 'Bad Times at the El Royale' before that existed movie, Identity, is a mind-bending mystery involving a group of people stranded at a motel in Nevada in the midst of a terrible storm. In other words, the perfect elements for a mystery writer. Luckily, the film never dives too deep into over-the-top storytelling like it easily could but rather a dark psychological undertone, reminiscent of Nolan's Memento only a few years prior. The only problem is that with any mystery, the film is only as good as its final reveal. Identity's is solid but not nearly as satisfying as it builds itself out to be. Still worth watching.7.3/10",Identity
48,CuriosityKilledShawn,Engaging thriller that deflates halfway through,5,8 August 2004,"Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness. It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from a film written by the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.

The story plays on the viewer's expectations, but takes things to another level when the facts don't seem to add up. Thus, another level of mystery is added, and its basic ""And Then There Were None"" outline becomes much more complicated.An interesting cast, highlighted by John Cusack--- as Ed, a limo driver diverted from transporting an actress because of a flooded road and an unfortunate accident---does a fine job.

This movie is a must see psycho-thriller even though some of the psycho-jargon is clearly clinically incorrect. Some people will have a problem with the ending, though it's must viewing by any beginning therapist - it has an important, vitally important message. John Cusack provides his always reliable performance. While Ray Liotta, unfortunately continues his long progression of finding his character stereotypical roles (one of the only drawbacks in this movie).
This ""Twilight Zone"" surreal experience is a feast for the eyes because it relies not so much on gore and explicit in your face splatter, but on a more subtle but hard edge visual treat of hints, suggestions, eerie music, tight shots that all make for a classic thriller of the 50s.

If you agree with the previous two statements, then Identity should be the next movie you watch.Riddled with amazing performances and character building, Identity starts off dull. Then, it tells the story of 10 people who get stranded in a motel perfectly through co-incidence and while the camera flashes the cause of events, you'll give it a wry smile. What unfolds is a series of mystery-filled occurrences which are enough to keep you hooked. The scientific/medical approach also polishes it and moreover paints the errors off the plot which mainly focuses on crime- investigation. Jaw-dropping bloody sequences & few deep dialogs makes me rate it 8.2/10!I agree the conclusion is kinda hard to understand, but if you look closely, there is a 1:3 chance that you can predict what is what.

This thriller, patterned after ""And Then There Were None,"" gets off to an intriguing if silly start, as a convoluted premise is used to gather the victims at the motel. In fact, it has the makings of a delicious black comedy, but that's a road not taken. As the victims start falling, the film becomes increasingly ludicrous until it reaches a mind-blowing, idiotic resolution.

58,zkonedog,Not The Movie You Think It Is,9,12 March 2017,"AT face value, the conceit of this film seems like the set-up for every suspense picture ever made: A dark and stormy night, a collection of characters who congregate at a gloomy motel, and one by one they start dying off. While the film performs well inside of that characterization, it forgoes the traditional ""reveal of the killer"" in the end in favor of a much more mind-bending conclusion.To not spoil things for the masses, the amazing twist near the end is roughly akin to what the TV show LOST has done over the span of six years. When LOST first started, creator JJ Abrams tricked us into thinking it was a show about a group of plane crash-ees trying to survive on an island. Six years later, the show is dealing with time-travel and the entire fate of civilization. Though ""Identity"" doesn't quite go THAT far, it follows a similar tract by not even closely resembling (at the end) the movie you thought you were watching in the beginning.What keeps this movie from just being a curiosity, though, is that even after the jaw-dropping reveal, it still manages to wrap up the pseudo-plot line quite nicely. Basically, you can still be satisfied with the film even if the shocking ending doesn't do it for you.Thus, if you are a fan of mystery/suspense thrillers and revel in big twists at the end, you will watch almost the entire final credits in a state of shock. Plus, even if you don't like huge plot surprises, the ""fake' storyline will still keep you on the edge of your seat.",Identity
59,johnnyboyz,"Although well shot and unfolded, the film is too ambiguous and not concrete enough to satisfy the basic of requirements in its genre.",5,13 January 2008,"I can certainly see what writer Michael Cooney and director James Mangold were trying here with Identity; a thriller-come-whodunit set in an isolated motel in the back o' beyond, but to me the end result falls flat and it falls sort of its attempted goal. I think Identity is a refreshing attempt at a genre that, let's face it, has been done close to death with numerous persons all gathering at a required place in order to be picked off one by one.The characters seemingly doomed in this particular tale to not submit to the usual stereotypes but they manage to take part in and create a series of annoying trends that have you dislike them. I suppose I was expecting characters in the form of: the black guy; the sluttish girl; the sexually active couple, the male of said two-some takes an attraction to the sluttish girl and vice-versa; the wise old character and some sort of stoner in his twenties. For the film not to have this sort of a cast of people was a relief but to have the ensuing story revolving around what we're given owes a lot to characters and their, quite frankly, stupid behaviour at times with people storming out and acting like children despite a killer on the loose. It is not until the authoritarian figure of former cop Ed (Cusack) tells them to stay put, like children at a primary school, until they all settle down.And then there is the character of Ed; an interesting one at that solely for the reason the twist that this film has revolves around him, but I won't say any more. What I will say revolves around Ed as a character and how the film is told from his point of view. This is no spoiler because the film makes it obvious to any active film watcher watching Identity since the film is told from Ed's point of view. We know this because he has everything a nice guy could have. He's nice, good natured, kind, educated and is involved in practically every scene. When someone is bleeding, he is the one that knows how to stitch them up; when someone dies, he's the one that does the police work and when everything needs to be sorted out and people need to be calmed down and organised, he's there to steady the ship. Ed is so fantastic that he is even able to tell us how much a room at the motel actually costs for one night since it says so on the billboard at the entrance; let that be a clue.Following the obligatory start this film has during which the phones don't work (obviously) and the electricity fails after a while, the film would have us transported back to a board room where officials argue over weather to execute a mass-murder. The question that I, and probably the film, fail to grasp is: are the events at the hotel even real? Is any of it actually happening and if so, why are we even seeing it? Yes, Identity is sort of a film about stuff that didn't really happen, or did it? This is no Usual Suspects but it so desperately wants to be given a suspected criminal is in a police station telling us all what's what. Regarding the actual killer who you will only know if you read this after having seen the film, I cannot fathom any incentive for said events to happen and said character(s) to do what he/she/it/they did. It just doesn't make sense but then again, it is age old memories of a psycho, isn't it? On an aesthetical level, Identity works but its narrative and consistency with what's what doesn't make sense. Towards the end of the film, one girl even states that the whole situation is 'like something out of a movie'. Too true as she goes onto state that in 'said movie' people were gathered at a certain place because they all had something in common. Now, providing this person even existed in real life or whether she existed through imagination alone; how the hell do you explain what she actually says actually forming the basis for the film's final act? Either this is incredible sloppy writing where they have rather obviously run out of ideas and are actually using another film to bail them out OR it's a clever piece of writing where the person having a supposed flashback is mixing up a film they might have once seen and using it to carry out the conclusion of the nightmare. This raises two questions: 1. How would a death row inmate be able to recollect a film they MIGHT have seen years ago and be able to adapt it into their own fantasy? 2. What film was it they're thinking of? My guess is 1945's The Spiral Staircase which I saw several months ago but it is a very, very long shot.Like I said, the person is able to inform us what the motel's rates are. Based on this, it seems they're also able to recollect everything from the colour of the curtains right down to what people were wearing and driving since we're seeing it. But then the argument again surfaces: did any of it even happen? There are enough incidences of reality being broken to suggest it didn't. While Identity isn't an awful film, it is a confusing and an ambiguous one; one that does not have a satisfying enough pay off to warrant a re-watch and one that fails in what it tries to achieve. Not an embarrassment for all involved but one that will get some people rather excited.",Identity

And it hits the nail perfectly, and later hits you in the head several times until you have no choice but accept it.I watched this movie after 6 years of it's original release and I'm very sorry about it; I mean, I had the chance to watch it before but I was reluctant due to my hatred towards Hollywood's idea of making Horror and Thriller films.The plot starts as any 90's slasher and then with the correct pacing, moves to be a whodunit Thriller, and ends up being a thrilling roller coaster mixed with tension, excellent dialog, and nerve tensing twist situations.I can't give you details because it would be very unfair for those who haven't seen it but, I want to convince people like me to watch it...please read.I'm an avid Horror moviegoer and I watch anything related to the genre, and for those who are also hardcore fans, please give this Hollywood product a chance; you won't regret. This is a clever, thrilling, violent and emotional film.You will find great acting specially from super badass Ray Liotta, the always talented John Cusack, the super sexy bomb and my wife (I'm living a dream OK?) Amanda Peet. The rest of the cast is excellent; even Alfred Molina is extraordinary even that he has a few on-screen minutes.The Direction is perfect because it's stylish, has some wild camera angles, and best of all, it keeps developing under a dark atmosphere. Excellent settings and special effects. Plus the gore though minimal is good.The ending will leave you wondering ""what the hell?!"" but in a positive manner. Expect a really good Thriller with excellent ingredients of Horror, Mystery and Suspense. The most important situations will make you feel sad, horrified, but something important is that you will think really hard and feel for the characters. Now, that's a very complete visual experience.This should be a cult classic soon.",Identity

Eerie dark music. Add a who dunnit story and you have got ""Identity"".When I am doubting if I wanna see a movie I usually check the director's other work and in this case that was the key reason to go see ""Identity"" because director James Mangold made: ""Heavy"" with Liv Taylor, ""Copland"" with Robert de Niro, Harvey Keitel, ""Walk the Line"" with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. All of James Mangolds movies are excellent. Although I must admit that ""Identity"" has a rather cheesy slasher side to it that wasnt in his other pictures, but judging ""Identity"" as a cheesy slasher movie it is good and really enjoyable. James Mangold also made ""Logan"" recently. If you liked that you will probably like this as well.I really can recommend this movie if you wanna see a dark full on suspense movie with a great whodunnit theme. I give it a well deserved 7.

64,jzappa,"With a World of Better Direction, This Could Have Been a Lot Better",7,28 October 2008,"Identity has the wild unpredictability of the essential horror film, set at a timeworn motel in the middle of nowhere. The only guests have only stopped there because of the same freak accident. Alas, it falls through every cliché trapdoor on the blueprint, entirely preventable ones, too, ones that won't open unless you consciously open them, and its wild unpredictability is relegated to merely an offshoot of its absurdity. We still have fun, and, yes, it is still eerie sometimes, but it too much wants to be our friend. It has a star-studded cast of actors we love, the way it gets to its mindblow twist is through a ridiculous and completely avoidable contrivance in dialogue and moreover, the score is too often superfluous, signaling what we are supposed to feel, and as a consequence we don't have to feel it if we don't want to. The film would have been much more effective, far-fetched points and all, if the tension were allowed to grow genuinely rather than be explained by the underscoring.It has been too long since we've seen the unbelievably sexy Rebecca DeMornay in a mainstream film. Had her performance in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle not been a wake- up call for filmmakers, the very kind that like to makes movies like this? Ray Liotta can by now play this kind of role in his sleep. Alfred Molina is hardly a part of the action and does not get to have the kind of fun as he does with so many other roles, but that is no matter for us simply to joy in seeing him. There is also the character actor John C. McGinley in a high- strung dramatic role, having never before been boring anyway. So this seemingly ambitious psychological thriller has star power which results in our immediate enjoyment instead of our deep involvement.Yes, we are truly wondering how this and that could possibly happen, or who could possibly be responsible, and if so, how? Its script is one step away from being ludicrous with cheap pseudo-impressive buy-offs, but depending on the audience, one could either take the bait and be wowed or laugh out loud at its final unraveling, which is what I did. Basically, you can see that the certitude lies in the hands of a skillful enough director, and, with a world of better direction than James Mangold's, this could have been a lot better.",Identity
65,FiendishDramaturgy,Toned Down and Cranked Up Rethinking of Sybil.,9,1 October 2003,"I'll warn you right now, I'm telling the whole story, so if you don't want to know the ending, the twist and the inside details, then don't read this!!!I normally don't tell the whole story like this, but this movie is such a psychological mind game that I have total respect for it, and feel the need to share.Malcolm Rivers has been convicted of six murders. They show you the details and give you the basic information via news clippings and the like in the very beginning of the movie during the opening credits, so pay attention. He is clinically insane, and only twenty-four hours from his execution. The governor's office has granted him a last minute hearing by a judge who is none too happy to have been called out of bed in the middle of the night to hear a case upon which he has already ruled.Meanwhile, the cast of characters is introduced. It is pouring down rain, the phones are down, a prisoner in transport has escaped and a woman lies dying in the room off the motel office. There is friction from the very beginning, as one character causes an accident while another character runs over the wife of yet another character. And this is only the beginning.As the characters develop, you begin to get a feel for who they are and what they have been through; the development is really quite good.One by one, the motel visitors are found dead and one by one, your list of suspects begins to narrow.Jake Busey (the escaped prisoner) runs and runs away from the hotel, but when he spies a structure lying off in the distance, he crashes in to discover he's BACK at the hotel! A metaphor for John Lennon's ""Nothing is Real"" theory. Jack Busey is really very good. They don't give him near enough work, in my opinion. He's every bit as good as his daddy.The survivors must determine the common factor which has led them all to the hotel. Amanda Peet begins this process, and it takes a while before the others join in. Meanwhile, they are trying as hard as they can to determine what is happening and why; who is killing these people off.As the guests realize that they all have the same birth day, you pan to Malcolm Rivers's hearing where you discover that he is a multiple personality with several distinct personalities.His personalities ARE the guests of the hotel. As each personality is exposed to Rivers's base identity, the alternate personality is ""murdered"" in his own mind. The whole movie is a working metaphor for what is going on in Malcolm's mind. This part is presented as a ""twist,"" and it definitely takes you by surprise.The writing and direction are absolutely brilliant. Awesomely presented and believably portrayed by all involved. This is a genuine work of art.But as everything seems to be winding down and the sidewalks are rolling up, you discover that the personality who committed the murders has indeed NOT been ""killed."" You don't discover until the end of the movie, what is going on or why. It was possibly one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. It rates up there with ""The Game,"" and ""Fallen.""I can't bring myself to tell you which personality is the murderer. But it will blow you away! This was a total masterpiece of psychology, horror and suspense.I give it an 8.6/10 from...The Fiend :.",Identity
66,bsmith5552,Thinker's Thriller!,7,31 October 2003,"When you watch ""Identity"", you immediately think of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"". While its similar in theme, Director James Mangold adds some interesting psychological twists. The story is essentially about ten strangers who are thrown together at a seedy motel on a rainy night somewhere in Nevada. First we meet the motel manager Larry (John Hawkes) who is contemplating a slow night as he gulps down another glass of whiskey. At various stages arrive, the York family, George (John C. McGinley), his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) who has been involved in an accident, and their young son Timmy (Bret Loehr). They are followed by a limo driver Ed (John Cusack), his passenger an over the hill actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and a hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) whom they picked up on the road. Also taking refuge from the storm is a newly married couple Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). Finally a police officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) and his prisoner (Jake Busey) arrive. Suddenly, gruesome murders begin happening as the ten begin to turn up dead one by one, by one means or another. The comment element is that room keys in descending order from 10 to 1 are found on each of the victims. The murderer remains a mystery although you may have your own suspect(s). Running parallel to this story is one about a last minute hearing for a convicted mass murderer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in a chilling performance, who is to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince a judge (Holmes Osborne) that his patient was not responsible for the crimes that he was accused of due to newly discovered evidence. What this has to do with the main story becomes clearer as the movie progresses. The acting in this movie is top notch from top to bottom and the direction is excellent. I'll give you a little advice though. Pay attention to the opening credit sequence. It will help explain things once you have seen the ending. The DVD release has an alternate ending with an additional scene but it adds little to an already exciting thriller.",Identity
67,dfranzen70,Killin' em wetly - but great ending!,7,16 September 2003,"On the surface, Identity seems like a cheap knockoff of an Agatha Christie paperback. You know the type. Several disparate types are stranded on an island or in an old mansion or a broken-down hotel, and it's raining cats and dogs outside, and wouldn't you know it, but they're being picked off, one by one. But beyond the obvious setup, this isn't anything like And Then There Were Young or its myriad imitations. This has a few twists, including an outstanding one right near the end. Several people wind up at a ramshackle motel in the middle of nowhere. It's pouring rain. The road's been flooded both ways, so no one can get out. Among the stranded are a limo driver (John Cusack) and his employer-actress (Rebecca DeMornay), an irascible cop (Ray Liotta) and the convict he's chaperoning (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple, and a man (John C. McGinley) and his family, complete with a mute son.Pretty disparate, all right. But trouble's afoot from the get-go, as Cusack, blinded by the torrential rain, runs over McGinley's wife, causing severe injuries. As the woman slips in and out of consciousness, Cusack must rush to the hospital to get an ambulance (phone's out, of course, and she can't be moved). But then it's flooded, see, and... well, everyone winds up back at the motel. Sometimes thrillers explain themselves a bit too well - and too often - and the viewer has too much of an idea what's coming. Telegraphing what's to happen to a character is one of the biggest flaws of most thrillers, and if the viewer stops and thinks about the movie, the movie's sunk. Once thought enters the viewers mind, the holes in the plot are as familiar as Swiss cheese.But the plot in Identity holds up very well, thanks in no small part to a great cast. Normally, in ensemble pieces like this the cast is comprised of once-great or once-pretty-good actors, people you've heard of but not lately. But Identity's cast is peppered with names familiar for their recent talents, and not their tabloid prowess. For instance, what's Cusack doing here? Isn't he slumming? Yes..... and no. It's a murder thriller, but he elevates the movie far beyond its rudimentary whodunit origins.Cusack's great - I've yet to see him be awful - but he's not the only one with a bravura performance. Liotta's turn as the cop is gritty (he's no stranger to the role, playing a similar one in Unlawful Entry) and ultimately believable, and McGinley's a lot better than the underwritten role he was handed. Also shining is Peet as the hooker - I've never really liked her, but she did a good job with a good role.And the atmosphere is wonderful! It felt like it was raining in my apartment. I jumped when they jumped, and I cringed when they cringed. That's good camerawork.The good aspects are the ending, the ending, the acting, the ending, and the atmosphere; the bad aspect is the middle stuff, as a lot of the movie is slasherific. But the ending is excellent, in case I forgot to mention it. The only thing I will tell you is that the standard ""everyone dies"" mantra begun by some guy named Shakespeare or something doesn't hold true here.
My score: ***",Identity
68,kevin_robbins,This is an underrated modern day masterpiece,10,2 November 2021,"Identity (2003) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline involves a man on death row being transported one rainy night when the road floods and the officer transporting him has to pull over to a hotel filled with people experiencing the same issue. A series of unfortunate events start happening around the hotel; meanwhile, the characters feel strangely connected but they can't figure out how. This movie is directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line) and stars John Cusack (Cell), Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), Amanda Peet (The Whole 9 Yards), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights), John C. McGinley (Scrubs), Clea DuVall (The Faculty), Jake Busey (Starship Troopers) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Constantine). The storyline for this movie is absolutely awesome and a brilliant blend of character development, fantastic setting, a well written script and a complex web that's intertwined but not too hard to keep up with. The cast in this movie is outstanding as is their dialogue and back forth. The horror elements are so good, intense and gory while doing a great job of hiding the killer's identity. I found it easy to root for multiple characters in this film while thinking multiple characters could be the killer.

This movie start of with bang and it dose not let up, this is action packed from the start, there are a lots of twist and turns in this movie, ,With one huge shocking twist in this movie, Which I never saw coming at all, the twist worked really well with rest of the movie.This movie had a great cast, they were all outstanding in this movie.I would not say this movie is Scary or anything however it dose have one or good nasty so-what gory death scenes in this movie.Since I Saw this movie, I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.

70,meeza,Tough to ID this one!,6,12 July 2004,"`Identity' valiantly tries to replicate an identity of various Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful classics. However, the results for the most part is an identity crisis. Ok! Let me get to `Identity's' identity: several unrelated group of suspicious characters hibernate to a highway motel on a rainy evening (`Psycho' anyone?) and before you know it the body count commences. I am sure you can identify with some films that present the same violentiosco plot. The actors in `Identity' are renowned and easy to identify: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, and Rebecca De Mornay. However, this acting ensemble was mostly middling here. `Identity' was suspenseful in several homage Hitchcockian scenes. However, the problem was that Director James Mangold became a bit psychotic with the multitudinous repetition of them. Mangold turned out to be `The Man Who Knew Too Little' about direction in this project. He was `Notorious'! `Identity' identifies several suspenseful elements of effective storytelling, but for the most part this one was for `The Birds'. *** Average",Identity

72,dwpollar,Complex psychological thriller...,7,21 March 2004,"1st watched 3/20/2004  - 7 out of 10(Dir- James Mangold): Complex psychological thriller that ends up being a story-within-a-story. I don't want to give away too much so all I'm going to say is that this is a well-done scary movie that starts out as a drama about a bunch of people and how they end up stopping at the same motel and then 1-by-1 those that are present start dying.  Eventually we find out that they all have something in common(I'll leave that for the viewer).  The director does a good job of re-directing our focus so that we have no idea what's going on until the final surprise half-hour.  Known for his cop movies, this is a departure for him but he does an excellent job with the material.  The acting is credible enough but it's the story that's really the star in this movie.  It's similar to a TEN LITTLE INDIANS type of plot but it doesn't go the same direction.  All-in-all this is scary well-done escapism with a twisted ending.",Identity
73,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Superb shocker with a hell of a twist,8,13 September 2015,"Identity is a nasty little shocker with more than a few tricks up its blood soaked sleeves. It rides on a daring concept that only becomes apparent in the final ten minutes of the film, but it's a shattering revelation that floors you. Up until then there's enough nerve spiking tension and plenty of good old fashioned suspense to keep you perked. Its a classic, Hitchcockian setup: Various wayward strangers find themselves stranded at an isolated interstate motel during a torrential rainstorm that wipes out phone reception and forces them to wait out the night. Pretty soon one of them is brutally murdered by an unseen assailant. Then another. And another, until they realize they are being picked off by a savage killer. Sounds like a generic premise, I know, but bear with me. This one shakes you up all to hell when it's finished with you, and will leave your thoughts racing and your arm hairs on end all night. John Cusack plays the bitter ex cop with a tragic past, Amanda Peet the hooker with aspirations, Ray Liotta the tough guy cop (who else?) escorting a weirdo convict (Jake Busey), John Hawkes the auspicious motel proprietor, John C. McGinley the timid family man, Rebecca Demornay the snobby actress, William Lee Scott and Clea Duvall the young Vegas married couple. Is one of them the killer? Or is someone outside their circle preying on them? There's also fine work from Alfred Molina, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Holmes Osborne. As far as guessing game psychological thrillers go, I dare you to arrogantly proclaim the outcome of this baby halfway through; it's just that creative, taking our expectations and strangling the life out of them, the resulting narrative a serpentine treat that pulls the rug from under our feet and smothers us with it. Pure, unfiltered suspense firecracker of a flick.",Identity
74,drownnnsoda,"A Smart, Cleverly Constructed Film.",9,24 November 2006,"""Identity"" starts off telling the separate stories of ten strangers who coincidentally wind up stranded in the Nevada desert during a torrential rainstorm. Among them are a limo driver, a snobby actress, a police detective transporting a convict, a married couple and their young son, a prostitute, and many other assorted characters who happen to be in the same situation. They all, oddly enough, end up at a small little vacant motel in the desert to escape from the rainstorm, among them being the wife of the married couple who was hit by a car and severely injured. As the night goes on and the strangers begin to know each other a little better, someone begins killing them off one by one. They begin to suspect the convict is responsible for the brutal slayings, but the murders continue throughout the night and each of the strangers learn that they all hold a mysterious secret...I don't want to give to much of the plot away so that's all I'll tell you, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with this film. I saw this movie back during it's theater release a few years ago, and I was blown away by it all. It's really a great film - not just a great horror film, but just as a film in general. The story to this film is amazing, I have to give some serious credit to the writers because it was so well done. This has to be one of the most original films of it's type, and for that it succeeds very well with me. As the film progresses toward the shocking conclusion, pieces of the puzzle begin to come together in a way that you wouldn't have even imagined before. There were some really scary sequences in the film also that were very well-directed, especially the bathroom attack on the Ginny character - scared the hell out of me. The performances in the film were also excellent, and the film boasts a fairly impressive cast - among them being John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, Rebecca DeMornay, and others. Each of the performances were great, the cast was perfect and played their characters very well.The setting for this movie was perfect - the small, cheap little motel is a perfect backdrop for all of the gruesome happenings. In fact, it reminded me a little of the infamous Bates Motel in Hitchock's classic ""Psycho"", the similarities being that the motel was in the desert and the overall layout of it all. Is it a reference to ""Psycho""? Possibly, I can't really say for sure though. Along with the all of the pluses mentioned above, the cinematography was really excellent, the film was shot very stylishly. Everything was very washed down, dark, and ominous, a perfect manner for this film to be presented in, giving it a much more mysterious feel. The bottom line is, ""Identity"" is one of the smartest, cleverly constructed horror/thrillers in quite some time. It was creepy, mysterious, had me wondering throughout the entire movie, and the conclusion that tied everything together was a real shocker. Definitely give it a look, you'll be pleasantly surprised. 9/10.",Identity

The film is full of surprising events and many red herrings that keep you guessing until the end who is the one behind the brutal murders among ten very diversified persons that have randomly met in a cheap motel as it seems.The very twisted ending will divide the viewers into two groups. Those who like original psycho thrillers with weird conclusions that request some reflections and are not that easy to understand will definitely like the final which is rather hard to predict. In fact, the ending leads to two conclusions and one of it was very easy to predict for a genre connoisseur as I am but the second and more important part is quite impossible to find out.Those who like more traditional crime movies with police investigations and many clues that finally lead to the murderer in the end might find the ending too complicated, too difficult to understand and overall too weird.Personally, I liked the ending as it left me one some reflections and thoughts. It's simply different from what you're used to and I like this experimental courage of the script writers. This doesn't mean that the ending is complete nonsense or as surreal as David Lynch movie, it's still all rather logic to explain.If you are a fan of dark psycho thrillers and the famous ""Ten Little Indians"" concept and if you're not afraid of movies where you need to do some additional intellectual efforts to understand everything, you will definitely adore this flick that has no truly visible weak points apart of it short length and a couple of stereotypes that are introduced in the beginning.",Identity

However, the film tends to take on too many personas in the process, concluding in a explosion of different genres and styles. While the film did have some very interesting ideas, it tried cramming too many within the 90-minute run time. Maybe if they had stayed on one straight line, it would have garnered an 8/10 from me.

84,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Murder Mystery with a Twist,9,3 August 2020,"This is film an interesting film for me. For whatever reason, I didn't see this until an ex, who had it on DVD, said we needed to watch it. She had a John Cusack fetish, so that was probably why. My second viewing is with my girlfriend Jaime, who loves this movie as well and it also was one I needed to revisit for The Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis here is stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one.We start by listening to tapes from an interview. We eventually see that it is Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) that is listening to them. He is a psychiatrist from what I'm gathering. He is assigned to a patient that is due up for execution, but some information from the interviews and a journal reveals new evidence. The district attorney, Marshall Bell, is woke up and he's irate at his assistant DA, Matt Letscher, for letting this happen without him knowing. The prisoner is being transported to the secret hearing and he had no idea until now. It really isn't the assistant DA's fault though, this is all happening fast as the execution is tomorrow. So an emergency hearing is called.We then cut to the desert. There is a couple with a child traveling. The stepfather is George York (John C. McGinley). Along with him is his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and her son Timmy (Bret Loehr). George has an OCD-like issue and Alice or her son doesn't really talk much. They get a flat tire and they pull over to fix it, which he's surprised to see a high-heel shoe caused it. We then get to see it belongs to an escort of Paris (Amanda Peet).Also out here in the desert is Ed (Cusack). He's driving for an aging actress of Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay). She isn't very nice. When her phone dies, she asks Ed to check the bag next to him for a battery. It is raining badly out so he isn't paying attention when he hits someone. It ends up being Alice. He is trying to find a hospital, but the path is blocked by water. Also all the phones they find don't work which is thanks to Paris. She backed her car into a pole trying to avoid a flooded road on the other side.These people converge on a motel that is run by Larry (John Hawkes). Also coming there is a newlywed couple of Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). They're not getting off to a good start as they're doing a lot of fighting. Also coming to this place is a police officer named Rhodes (Ray Liotta). He's transporting a prisoner, Robert Maine (Jake Busey). Not everyone is who they seem though and when these people start to be murdered one by one, they have to get to the bottom of this before it is too late.Running concurrently is the meeting in the conference room. The judge who already heard the case is Taylor (Holmes Osborne). The prisoner's defense attorney is Carmen Argenziano and he thinks that along with what Dr. Malick has to say, they cannot execute his client. The question becomes, how are these two stories connected?I have to say that coming the first time I came into watching this film, I had just had a vague idea of what it was about and didn't know what was going on for most of it. When I say that, I mean it as a good thing since it was not predictable and it had me guessing until the end. There are a lot of details that I left out of the review, because it would begin to give away what happens in this film and I feel I cleaned it up even more with this update. This is definitely a movie that is good even with a second viewing. I will admit, I didn't remember how it played out, just the basic premise.How this is constructed is something that really works for me. With that first viewing, it is pretty much how I left my recap of trying to figure out how they're connected. We know that there's a criminal that is being escorted to the hearing so it seems to connect with what we're seeing. It goes beyond that though. Everyone we meet has something to hide. Ed used to be a cop and notices things that Rhodes is doing don't necessarily fit for someone in the profession. He could just be sloppy though. Paris has a bunch of money. Larry is nervous about people going to certain room. It is just things like this that as you learn more; you see how the pieces fit together.The setting is also really good as well. You have a motel, in the middle of the desert and it is a horrible rain storm. The movie gives you clues to the truth, even from the beginning. It is some what of an adaptation of Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians' and plays like a neo-giallo film to be honest. I say this as we get red herrings and the characters are picked off until we get to the truth.This is aided by how strong of a cast we have here. I know many people don't really care for Cusack, but I think he's good in this movie. Liotta is solid as well and what really works for him is just his outburst. Peet is quite attractive. She also works well in this movie as I'd say she is the third lead. Hawkes, DuVall, Molina, McGinley, Scott, Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince, De Mornay and the rest are just solid as well. There isn't a bad performance in this movie if I'm honest.Aside from that, it would really just be the effects to cover. We don't get to see much, but there are a couple scenes where people are hit by moving vehicles. I thought they looked good. We get to see the after effects of deaths that do as well. The rain also looks quite real if I'm honest which adds a lot to the claustrophobic feel since they can't get out. There is something I'll hint at here, there are some unbelievable things. Disbelief needs to be suspended a bit as we have nightmare logic. To finish this thought up, the cinematography was well done also.Now that's all I really wanted to go over with this movie. I think it is one that holds up after multiple viewings. It is an interesting neo-giallo/Ten Little Indians type film. Where this movie ends up though is great. I love the concept and the acting is strong to get us there where I don't really think we get a bad performance. The setting and the circumstances that keep them there is included here as well. No issues with the effects or how this was shot and the soundtrack fit for what was needed. I'd say this is really good movie and would recommend giving this a viewing to horror and non-horror fans alike for sure.",Identity

87,rosscinema,Familiar but well made,7,11 May 2003,"This is one of those films that thank god doesn't meander to the shallow thinking of teens and young adults. It stays true to the script and original story without having a predictable (For the most part) ending tacked on. Here's a story that definitely is not what it seems. Story starts out with John Cusack as Ed. A limo driver and former police officer that is driving a movie star named Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay) but its night and its in the middle of a violent storm and Ed accidently hits a woman in the road. Her husband is fixing a flat and their son Timmy (Bret Loehr) is in the back seat. They drive to a motel and try and use the phone but all the lines are down and the next town is 30 miles away and they cannot drive out because of the flooding. Others soon arrive because of the storm like a prostitute named Paris (Amanda Peet), A young couple who just got married, and a cop named Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey). They are all stuck and later the prisoner escapes. It doesn't take long before some of the group start popping up murdered or disappeared. Meanwhile, another part of the film has a midnight hearing on a killer who is scheduled to die the next day and his doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince the judge that he is insane and didn't know what he was doing. The film is directed by James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land, Girl Interrupted) and this is another good effort by him and he's slowly building a pretty impressive resume. I was one of those thinking that I was walking into just another thriller but this film is definitely not that. Instead, as the film unfolds it give you twists and turns that seemingly go into a strange direction until you find out what the real source of the story is. But even when you understand the basis of the story it gives you reasons to think. Fairly clever film is somewhat familiar like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode or maybe something by Brian DePalma so even though it keeps you guessing it dawns on you that similar material has been done like this before. It doesn't detract from this being well directed and shot. The cinematography is well handled with the constant rain being the main source for establishing an effective mood. All the actors are up to the task but its the direction and script that the emphasis should be laid upon. Good effective thriller that has a lot more going for it under the surface.",Identity
88,nycritic,Smart B-Movie Thriller,8,4 February 2006,"As the norm, B-movies have a certain freedom to show on-screen what big-name productions shy away from, and thanks to this, they can retain a near 100 percent truthfulness to what they're trying to tell. IDENTITY, an effective little movie that became the sleeper hit of the first third of 2003 is one of those clever stories. Taking a cue from Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"", one of the few of her stories which have failed to make an impression on the big screen, director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney bring forth this apparently predictable but surprising slasher-thriller about ten strangers, neither of them related to each other, who during a heavy storm converge in an out-of-the-way motel in the middle of nowhere. That it becomes evident that there is more to every one of these people than first value would suggest is just the icing on the cake. When they start getting picked off one by one, paranoia sets in and the remaining survivors try to uncover the killer's identity.Waving in an out of this suspenseful story is the tense battle between a psychologist trying to save his patient from certain death. It becomes known to us that he's a mass murderer, and a former cop, but to talk more about this would be 'murder' to anyone who hasn't seen this clever story. More so because there is a crucial plot point which ties both the events in the motel and the inquisition. As a matter of fact, much of IDENTITY occurs in a deceptive non-linear way. The manner as to how the main players are introduced, with the actions of one affecting the course of action of the other, going back and forth before getting into the meat of the plot, is downright tight.Mangold is one of the newer directors whom I'm getting acquainted with and in the process, enjoying his work. His rendition to the slasher genre is hard to classify at times because a lot of the movie is an intense character piece where every one of his players are people instead of plot-types (while initially appearing so). Having a large roster of big names and lesser-known names helps, too, because it misdirects the viewer into believing that an actor known for playing a certain type of role will repeat a performance here, but Mangold is looking for something else aside from entertaining. It seems to me that his intentions are to twist a well-known genre and take it to an unexpected ground without cheating his audience a la M. Night Shyamalan. And because all the little giveaways are there, cleverly hidden in their plain exposure, no one can say he cheated for shock value. I loved IDENTITY, with its dark colors and late-night horror movie values, and can't say there wasn't a moment when an actor didn't nail his or her presence.",Identity
89,Rob_Taylor,Thoughtful and entertaining,9,29 May 2003,"Wow! Finally another movie that makes you think about what you're seeing as opposed to presenting you with endless special effects. Not, perhaps, as thought-provoking as Memento, but enjoyably brain exercising nonetheless.Having gone into this movie, as I prefer to, with no preconceptions, I assumed it was a simple whodunnit. I was pleasantly surprised to find the greater depth and plot twists involved. Actually, even as a whodunnit, forgetting the real plot for a moment, it works pretty well.There are more red-herrings in this movie than the North Sea fishing fleet has, so be warned that whatever you think is going on, probably isn't.All of the characters have decent roles. There are no Star Trek ""red shirt"" security men here, waiting to be killed off. No one whom you think from the start ""he's dead"". The killer could be anyone, no one person stands out head and shoulders above the rest.Every time you think you know what's going on, the rug is pulled out from under you and you have to start over again. The final revelation is elegant and thoughtful and, whilst it trivialises much of what you've just watched a bit, it is nevertheless an original idea and made me glad I went to see this film.Sadly, because of it's nature, this is a one-view film. Although it may be worth watching again to see if you can spot the clues to the truth of the situation. And it's certainly a good film to watch with someone who hasn't seen it, just to watch their reactions.Well worth a watch.",Identity
90,eric262003,A Thrill Ride With Lots of Substance,9,5 March 2012,"As of late, one of the things that irks me about thriller films is that it offers lots of style and nothing more in between. Thankfully ""Identity"" isn't one thriller that fits in that category as it provides for you a compelling dark and provocative story, complimented by an ensemble of talented performers and an atmosphere that will likely send chills up and down your spine.The story takes place in a cramped little motel on a dark and dreary night. Ten strangers show up in the motel who may have been brought here by coincidence or does their presence stem much further than that? They think they're safe in this cozy little motel, but then they gradually discover that one-by-one, several people were getting hacked left, right, front and centre What may seem like it's just a crazed murderer on the prowl just randomly killing people for kicks, the boiling point goes far more macabre than any of the individuals could imagine. Were these strangers chosen randomly or did they know that they were doomed from the start? Granted, I had my doubts when I first saw ""Identity"" in the theatres nine years ago. I thought it was just another mindless thriller with another repetitive predictable ending. Well it turned out I had to take my words back on this one. The craft by director James Mangold by utilizing various plot twists succeeds in demonstrating the ins and outs of how a thriller movie should be done. There is a cornucopia of frightening scenes that might inspire you to sleep with the lights turned on if you're watching this movie alone at night. It's also not at all ashamed of playing games with your mind and represents itself in a very confident matter. Some of the well known thespians featured in ""Idenity"" include the always versatile John Cusack, Ray Liotta with his perpetual menacing demeanour, Amanda Peet with her combined beauty and charm and Rebecca DeMornay with her solid delivery of lines. They all shined splendidly in their respected roles. But it was Cusack who surprised me for being a capable actor in a thriller movie.The DVD has a few little extra tidbits added in for further information about the movie and some extended scenes that were left out in the theatres. However, the extensions are really not worth mentioning. Even the alternated ending was really all not worthy to take note of either. But it's the theatrical version that one should see, but if you're curious about the extended versions well I'll be the last person to stop anyone from seeing it. And as usual there's the deleted scenes, the wonderful commentary, and of course the little featurette to go behind the scenes of the movie.""Identity"" is a break from the monotony from the god-awful excuses that have the audacity to label themselves as thrillers. The film offers 90 minutes of chilling scenes that will surely make your eyes pop out and you tongue hang out. The script was brilliantly edited and the cast was very impressive. Those who were doubtful of the how this movie will transpire (guilty!) it will have you think twice before you count your chickens. The mind games continually progress throughout the movie as you'll be mesmerized by everything that was showcased on the screen. This is truly the thriller among thrillers and will manipulate you to watch this again and again.",Identity
91,Matt_Layden,Great cast in this predictable and yet surprising film.,8,14 February 2005,"When a nasty storm hits a hotel, ten strangers are stranded within and as they begin to know each other, they discover they are being killed off one by one.This is a really dark film that succeeds in confusing you and gets you wondering whodunnit, I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way. Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively. The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise. I figured out that they were all different personalities, but did not see Liotta being a convict, or the kid being the killer.The direction of the film is seemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambiance created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels.The acting was decent, of course Liotta is as always the hot tempered guy about to blow in every scene, Cusack gives a great performance as always and I was surprised by Peets performance, she hold up with the other great actors on the set as if she had the same amount of acting experience with them. The chemistry was really good as well between the characters, even though most of the time they distrust each other.I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). This is a film that tries to throw a twist in and actually succeeds with it.",Identity
92,winner55,"almost a great film, but with cheap lousy ending",8,9 December 2007,"This is in many ways an excellent movie. Although it pretends to be deeper than it really is, it is still smart, stylish, extremely well made, neatly paced, with strong performances from all the actors.Yet I must lodge a complaint. It's the ending. Difficult to explain what goes wrong here without revealing it, so I'll write in generalities. By the end of the film, when the pieces at last begin to fit together, we come to feel some compassion for the characters that we know are essentially decent and we learn to wish the best for them. The ending betrays that, and is thus annoying and disappointing. Whatever first went wrong with the killer here happens yet again. Life's just a joke, after all, and a rather cruel one.This is not only unfair to the characters, but to the audience as well. a less violent ending would not have betrayed the heart of the film, but would instead have reached the depth the film pretends to seek.Definitely worth the trip, but might be more satisfying if you just skip the last five minutes.",Identity
93,slayrrr666,Entertaining modern slasher,9,10 October 2008,"""Identity"" is a much better mystery/slasher than expected.**SPOILERS**During a torrential rainstorm, Ed Dakota, (John Cusack) manages to bring George York, (John C. McGinley) and his son Timmy, (Bret Loehr) to Larry's, (John Hawkes) motel in the middle of nowhere to help them seek shelter after a hit-and-run accident. Realizing that Paris, (Amanda Peet) Rhodes, (Ray Liotta) Ginny, (Clea DuVall) Lou, (William Lee Scott) and Caroline Suzanne, (Rebecca De Mornay) are all trapped at the motel as well because of the storm, all the normal ways of escape prove futile and decide to ride out the storm. Suddenly realizing that they're being killed off one-by-one in a series of gruesome murders, they suspect everyone has a motive for the killings, and as their numbers dwindle, they race to solve the killings and get away from the hotel alive.The Good News: This was a lot better than expected, and delivered a lot of good parts. One of the better parts is the fact that this one has a really great atmosphere that makes it really feel really great. The torrential rainstorm going on the background is mostly responsible for this, and the way it works is rather intriguing. By having the characters constantly going into and out of it and appearing completely drenched in the rain, and combined with the way that the mystery plays out is perfect at keeping the suspense up. The setting of the film, where they're at in the motel and the way it's lined out, it allows for a bunch of suspense and tension, and with the way the film allows the killer to be revealed, manage to make the film feel really tense and suspenseful. The way that it does work around the mystery of the killer angle is perhaps the best part of the whole film, as it's what makes the whole thing come together. By enabling every single one of them the opportunity to be tagged as the killer, it puts all of the film's focus into the clever tricks to do this. The gag about the names, birth-dates and the room-key version is all done rather nicely and all of these are apart of what helps the film along with it's impressive way of bringing along the suspense in the film. There's also the way it reveals the killer, which is one of the single most shocking ones in the genre, being one that's never expected nor feeling like it's there merely for the sake of a twist. It's nicely shocking and actually works, using the montage to great effect and coming up with some nice scenes. The last thing here is that the kills aren't so bad, and actually work nicely within the film, being unique enough that they're an overall nice collection which is really good to see. There's a baseball bat rammed down the throat, a couple are run over by cars, one of whom is rammed into a wall, there's a vicious stabbing in the stomach, a nice decapitation and a multitude of gunshots, among others in here. It's a healthy enough collection to make a really nice selection of kills here. All of these here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There wasn't too much really wrong with this one. The main flaw to this is the way that the film seems to plod along with it's pacing. Although it never once feels dull or boring, there's no real surge of adrenaline running through the scenes in here to really make it exciting or over-the-top, and while this keeps moving along nicely, none of these are really all that engaging and that means things just happen here, not the proper kind of reaction needed for a film like this. The other flaw to this one is the fact that most of the film's kills are off-screen, meaning that the kills are all reduced to mere splashes or aftermath, and the ones that are shown on-screen aren't all that graphic, making the aftermath the one part here that gets the blood over. These here are all the film's flaws.The Final Verdict: There was a lot better stuff in here than expected, making this one enjoyable and highly recommended. Look into this one if you're a fan of the genre, love your slashers with mystery or fans of the creative side, while those who aren't that into any of those should heed caution with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",Identity
94,brando647,Cool Twist on a Familiar Thriller Theme,8,30 October 2012,"IDENTITY takes a concept that we've seen countless times before and puts an interesting new spin on it. It's got its problems, but sports a mostly solid cast and a cool enough twist to make it stand out as a fun thriller. It starts as your usual ""Ten Little Indians"" style thriller, with a group of seemingly random people brought together in an isolated location before they begin dying off one by one under mysterious circumstances, but IDENTITY has a unique twist (that I will try to avoid ruining here in case you haven't seen the movie). The events are set in a desolate Nevada motel in the middle of the desert where a rainstorm has stranded 10 strangers for the night: Ed (Cusack) is a limousine driver transporting a washed up actress with an attitude, Paris (Peet) is a prostitute on her way to Florida in an effort to start a new life, Rhodes (Liotta) is a police officer moving a serial murderer between prisons, Ginny (Duvall) and Lou (Scott) are miserable newlyweds, and the York family is searching for help when the mother is run down by Ed's limo in a horrific accident. The storm has flooded all roads out of the area and soon visitors are killed in bizarre ways and paranoia settles in when they realize the killer could be any one of them. Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated story, a man convicted of multiple homicides is given one last opportunity to plead his case with a judge in hopes of staving off a death sentence.It's tough to mention any parts of the film that either worked or failed without wandering into spoiler territory so I'll try to keep it vague story-wise. For the most part, it's a cool movie. I love movies set in a single isolated location (in this case the motel) because the location becomes it's own character. Here is a creepy, worn-out motel with it's buzzing neon sign in the middle of an empty highway, run by a scrawny, strung-out out man who has his own secrets. The rain is a constant presence, adding to the horror movie vibe. Without the ability to jump between locations, a movie like this is forced to turn to its characters for the story, so the movie really rides of the cast and their performances to carry its weight. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamicheal do an awesome job of giving the movie it's foreboding atmosphere and the cast make an otherwise ""been there, done that"" story feel fresh. John Cusack is an awesome character actor and you can pretty much count on him to keep it interesting, and Ray Liotta has pretty much made a career out of playing cops/criminals so his turn here as the short-tempered Rhodes isn't a stretch for him. There are a few other good performances out of the supporting crew (mostly Amanda Peet and John Hawkes, as the shifty motel owner), but the rest border on annoying and over-the-top. Then again, John C. McGinley is almost always over-the-top, so I guess he can be forgiven here.The main draw of IDENTITY is, of course, the big reveal at the end of the second act that ties everything together and explains the logic behind it all. In theory, it was a cool twist and it adds a lot to the movie. It's something we hadn't seen done before and I can appreciate any movie that gets creative with old ideas. The problem was in the execution. I can forgive any other aggravation or annoyances with the movie, but the final reveal is just too laughable. So, in a way, the movie is really cool up until the final five minutes. The end just spoils it. Anyone who has seen it would probably agree. I can almost see why it was written that way, and it sort of makes sense. But that doesn't make it any less amusing and, since this isn't meant to be a comedy, sort of ruins the vibe. IDENTITY is a cool movie despite its flaws. I hate to say it's forgettable but it's just one of those movies that sank into the background soon after its release. I'd forgotten about it until I saw it sitting on my shelf collecting dust and gave it another viewing to see if it held up. And it does, pretty well. It won't wow anyone and it might make you chuckle at the end, but IDENTITY is pretty good overall.",Identity
95,moviewizguy,Clever Movie,8,18 March 2006,"There are basically two plots in this film: One is that 11 people are stuck in a motel because of a rainstorm. These are the 11 people: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager. Then they get killed one by one. One of the 11 people is the killer but who? The other story revolves a psychiatrist who is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. Both these story will create a twist at the end that would leave you speechless. Well, maybe not.This is an ingenious horror thriller with many plot twists and surprises. The beginning is quite clever where the camera stops at one point and goes to the past to show you what happens. The way the people are in the motel feels claustrophobic. No cellphones work and no cars will go over the flooded roads. This isn't a brilliant thriller but it's good enough to be a great movie.John Cusack's and Amanda Peet's acting are great. This is an intelligent thriller so you might need the brains to understand the twist. Well, maybe not. It's quite easy to follow, really. Although the twist might not be satisfying for some, it is really satisfying for me.This is a great thriller. I've seen many and this one is unique.

96,Luigi Di Pilla,Real shocker,7,21 March 2004,"IDENTITY is a very good idea how a horror thriller should be done. It achieves very much suspense from the beginning till the end. There are many puzzles to solve but it keeps you anyway asking if there is a logic for all these victims. Here is perhaps the weak point of the movie but hey it is just a movie and that must not be always a realistic one. If you have enough fantasy and imagination you can enjoy it. I think the director developed the story deep enough or too much. Perhaps some scenes could have been deleted. I have to admit that there was a surprisingly end that lets even open for a sequel.

A stormy night assembles a lot of characters in a motel: a couple and their kid, a driver who has knocked down this couple's wife, a girl who is traveling to work in an orange garden, a policeman who is taking a handcuffed convicted killer who was about to be executed but whose lawyer has managed to get a judge's reevaluation of the case on the ground of his mental insanity and a young couple recently married. Add to them the motel manager, a young man not very convincing. This leads to a lot of murders that keep occurring successively. There is a permanent heavy rain outside and since the characters keep walking in and out they are wet to the skin.

99,tomsview,Tricks itself,4,30 January 2013,"There have been a number of films that paint their characters into corners from which there seems to be no escape, only to produce a wild card to get them out, often in the form of an identity or personality shift such as in ""Lost Highway"", ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". However, I think the identity shift / multiple personality wand can only be waved so many times before it becomes not just predictable but also annoying. Movies that resolve convoluted plots in this way run the risk of cheating the audience. ""Identity"" might just be the film that uses this get-out-of-jail card one time too many. The movie had me going for a while. As the credits roll, a psychiatrist makes audio notes about the case of a serial killer, Malcolm Rivers, who is to be executed the following day. Dr. Mallick, played by Alfred Molina, is attempting to have Rivers reassessed as mentally incompetent. The scene then shifts to a Nevada motel during a violent storm. Thanks mainly to Alfred Hitchcock, most moviegoers know that booking into an isolated motel on a rainy night is one of the most dangerous things a human can do – on a par with exploring active volcanoes or surfing 100-foot waves in the mid-Atlantic. A number of seemingly unconnected individuals make their way to the motel seeking shelter. Among them are characters played by John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet.After a number of murders, the survivors realise that a serial killer is picking them off one by one. At this point, the story is pretty much an updated version of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"". Then comes the zinger! It is established that everyone in the motel, dead or alive, shares the same birthday. How can this be? They all arrived at the motel by accident without any pre-planning. The reason is simple – they are all the same person! All the characters are manifestations of Malcolm Rivers' schizophrenic psyche. Did I slap my forehead and say how clever is this? No, I thought what a total rip-off. The story moves at a fast clip until the end. This is just as well, because the holes in the film's logic are big enough to drive a motel housekeeping trolley through.We also know from watching movies that serial killers are never guarded closely enough. There is virtually no straight jacket, prison cell, nor any medication that will keep them restrained for a whole movie. They always escape and the body count goes through the roof. Although ""Identity"" puts a twist on this unwritten law, we know by this time that the filmmakers have no shame and will use just about any trick to wrap the whole thing up. The movie does provide a couple of good shocks. Sadly, although it goes for a slam-dunk at the end, ""Identity"" simply bounces out of the court instead.",Identity

101,DeeNine-2,If this were a book it would be psychobabble,4,18 January 2004,"This is really a mess. One wonders how such movies get made. James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians.""The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly. Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated. John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds. The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead. The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc. They insult each other a lot. Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc. As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being ""trillions to one"") we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or... You guessed it. It's all a....But I can't say. We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold. (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.) At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it. Otherwise, hit the off button and watch reruns of ""That 70's Show.""(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

102,dunmore_ego,Identity Cleft,7,29 July 2005,"More than a murder mystery. More than a psychological thriller. More than a horror movie.With most viewers being either misled by the similarities to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"", or just pompously broadcasting their knowledge that this movie was inspired by such, they seem to have missed the point that this was not a ""murder mystery"" per se, but rather, a finely-crafted journey through the mind of a multiple personality during the course of purging his violent personas.I believe that premise (and its attendant ""twists"") were a TEENSY bit much for audiences to comprehend. Even taking into account the fact that film-makers construct films of this ilk to the whims of ""test-audiences"" and ""focus groups"", (read as lowest common denominators, i.e. swineherders), this particular case still elicits misunderstanding, even WITH the kindergarten paint-by-numbers explanation in the final minutes.It seemed to be a Patrick-Duffy-shower-scene cop-out, but director James Mangold and writer Michael Cooney, were using sleight-of-hand to misdirect viewers through most of the film.I envision those loose-lipped test-audiences (comprised of societal castes who have nothing better to do with their Tuesday afternoons) believing that the movie was taking place in real time, only to be chagrined when it is revealed that most of the action was occurring in a psychopath's disturbed mind. Instead of appreciating WHY this filmic device was used, they immediately wished they'd spent their Tuesday afternoon downing that Haagen-Daaz tub and watching McMillan & Wife explain every last G-rated detail to them like they were the last retards on earth.Ten guests are flood-stranded at a Motel: among them, Rebecca deMornay, almost unrecognizable with her ample boob-job and burgundy hair, playing a character whom she is assuming the mantle of with each passing botox-ed day - a woman who ""used to be that actress""; Amanda Peet, whose stage direction was kept simple - ""Back that booty up some more, honey!""; John C. McGinley playing against type as an uber-dweeb, Jake Busey playing *exactly* his type  uber-psycho; Ray Liotta  always darkly mysterious One by one, these refugee guests start dying all Agatha-Christie-like.Intercut with this storyline is a somber eleventh-hour appeal by doctors and lawyers to an ill-tempered judge to stay an execution. We are intrigued as to how these two disparate tales are related, but we DO sense a connection in due course, because the dry, somber doctors are talking about a ""killer"" and in that wet parallel Motel story there're KILLIN'S GALORE.By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.That's Twist No.1  that all this rain-drenched piling in and out of rooms like the Spanish Inquisition with shocked pusses is merely a psychopath's IMAGINATION.For a few moments we are led to believe the Shyamalan trap has been sprung  but there's a trump card  through Grand Misdirection on the film-maker's part, the doctors believe they successfully purge the psychopath's mind of his ""killer"" persona, but it is revealed in the last few seconds of film that the psychopath was too adroit in concealing his *real* ""killer"" persona in the form of the least likely hotel guest.THAT was the true ""twist"" to the movie: discovering that the doctors' cure did not go deep enough; discovering that the psychopath was able to disguise his persona as a benign presence in full view of both the viewers and doctors.The movie could have opted to wrap neatly with the first Twist, or could have taken any number of juvenile turns, blaming spirits from an Indian Burial Ground, or any of the lesser characters (who all sported damaging secrets), but the writers led us on a merrier, more interesting goose chase.Thus, this deponent sayeth: Bravo to the road less traveled. On the other hand, my ""feminine personality"" thought the movie brutalized women too overtly and my ""killer psychopath"" personality is going to make the film-makers pay for giving away my secrets...(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Identity

Emotions are high since a woman has been hit by a car and is seriously injured. The roads are blocked off by flooding. No one can escape. What better time for a psycho killer to start picking them off one by one?That's the basic plot of this TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style suspenser, with all of the expected plot twists and brief gory flashes of violence, and it actually begins surprisingly well. The production values/technical credits are top-notch and the cast is good. John Cusack as a chauffeur escorting obnoxious actress Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta as a cop with insane killer Jake Busey in his custody, Amanda Peet as a reformed hooker with a stash of dough, Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott as a bickering young couple, John C.

104,Maciste_Brother,Film suffers from identity crisis,4,20 April 2005,"IDENTITY has an interesting if somewhat trite idea at its core. Unfortunately, the execution and the script destroy the whole concept. In order for a story like IDENTITY to work, the characters had to be compelling 3-dimensional folks with depth. Without interesting characters, the storyline suffers so much that the whole thing ends up feeling like a waste of time and a cheat. Had the characters been compelling, the sketchy concept would have worked because the movie-going audience would have believed the killer would have actually spent time in creating these people (or muses) and would rather spend time with them, and tormenting them, instead of the killer being alone with himself and tormenting himself. As of now, the characters in IDENTITY are so boring and forgettable, or interchangeable, that it makes me wonder why would the killer even bother coming up with them? Or why would anyone in the audience care about these people, or types, at all? The film ends up being totally pointless and very predictable, and because of this, IDENTITY is surely one of the worst films I've seen in a while. If it wasn't for the excellent cinematography, which was crisp and beautiful on the DVD, I wouldn't have given this film 4 stars, more like 1 star.Don't bother watching it.",Identity
105,BrandtSponseller,"Who Are You? Who who, Who who",8,17 March 2005,"Because of what seem to be unusual circumstances, eleven people, strangers to each other outside of their respective ""groups"" (two families, two professional associations), end up stranded in a desolate Nevada motel on a dark, stormy night. One of the ""strangers"" is a death row murderer being escorted to another prison for execution. When bodies start turning up and the murderer goes missing, he's the obvious suspect. But things are not what they seem. Identity provides a ""double mystery""--a traditional whodunit and an increasingly bizarre ""rubber reality"" mystery that we must figure out along with the characters.This is my second viewing of Identity. I didn't like it quite as much this time, although it still earned a ""B"". The two aspects I had a slight problem with on the second go-round were one, the plot didn't quite envelop me to the same extent (maybe because I remembered the twist?) and two, since first watching it, I've seen a lot more films in the rubber reality genre, and Identity is nowhere near as mind-bending as many other examples. Still, this is a great film, with a lot of assets.Director James Mangold effectively employs a number of interesting techniques here. The main standout in the first reel is the use of Tarantino-like ""multiple viewpoint"" shots, where we see the same span of time from one character's point of view, then another, then another. He also effectively creates two very attractive atmospheres, especially for fantasy fans--a ""Twilight Zone""(1959)-like conundrum and a sustained dark ambiance. The Twilight Zone aspect makes itself most obvious beginning with the scene where the convict, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), tries to flee, but discovers that he's still at the motel, after all. The constant, Blade Runner (1982)-like rain underscores the dark ambiance, which is reminiscent of films such as Fallen (1998) and Se7en (1995).While Identity isn't exactly a bastion of graphic violence, there are a number of strongly visceral scenes and shots that are extremely well done and effective for seeming realistic. The atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by the hotel set, which matches the Bates Motel from Psycho (1960) in dingy gloom. The film also has a wonderfully nihilistic ending.Even though I wasn't as enraptured in suspense this time, one is still drawn into the film by the gradual quickening and spiraling of loss of control experienced by the characters. While slowly killing each one of them off as they're stuck in an isolated setting is a traditional ""10 Little Indians"" horror film motif that writer Michael Cooney employs, the Twilight Zone aspects allow him to trump the sense of horror and despair, as the surviving characters come to realize that they are not in charge of their own lives, they can't call the shots, and their illusions about their realities crumble before their eyes.One of the negatives is that the rubber reality resolution is a bit too telegraphed, too overt. The solution is given too early, and ends up being spelled out note-for-note. It's a bit like giving a lecture on a joke right after one gives the punch line. It might be difficult to blame either Cooney or Mangold with this, however, as American film studios and test audiences are notoriously allergic to ambiguity, which is depressing, because I love ambiguity in films. Still, maybe the Identity is just easier to figure out when you've seen tens of rubber reality flicks. When I watched the film upon its theatrical release, I overheard more than one fellow theater-goer still trying to figure out the gist as the lights came up.One might be tempted to claim that Mangold under-uses his fine cast--who all turn in excellent performances, including one of my favorite character actors, John C. McGinley. But on the other hand, it makes sense that there is this large number and broad range of characters. Under this scenario, you either under-use them or you've got a 3-hour-plus film (not that I'd complain about a 3-hour-plus film).Of course the theme of the film, as well as all of the subtexts, has to do with personal identity, and especially veiled personal identity. None of the characters are who they seem. Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet, and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other. Cooney and Mangold explore the various social facts, actions, ceremonies, rituals and so on that help provide personal identity for us, such as birthdates, names, residency, marriages, benevolent versus criminal or unethical actions, and occupations. They also explore a more dynamic identity of action, as relationships continually shift throughout the film.",Identity
106,baumer,"I wanted so much more, this can't be it.",6,1 May 2003,"Very few times have I been more excited to see a film than I was to see Identity.  With the healthy revival of the horror genre in the last few years, film makers have been doing it right more times than I can remember since the early 80's.  I think The Ring has set the bar so high for so many films that now writers are trying to do the next great thing to scare the hell out of you.  And every film has a shocking twist to it now a days as well.  Think back to films like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and a few others and it seems that everyone is now trying to give us the next great twisted film.  Whatever works I guess.  The only danger of that mentality is that when you market a film like the way Identity was marketed, you better make sure that your twist pays off and doesn't make the audience feel cheated.  I read Roger Ebert's review of The Usual Suspects and one of the reasons why he didn't like the film all too well is because he felt that the twist was so truculent, so brash and so unexpected that he felt cheated.  There was no way that he could figure it out and he felt that the creators of the film didn't play fair with it's audience.  While I do not agree with that assessment of The Usual Suspects, I do understand what he was complaining about because that is how I felt here.  The twist is so unexpected, so convoluted and so unfair that when it did happen, I looked at my wife and said, ""What the hell...are you serious?""  And from that point on ( and there was still about 15 minutes left in the film), I just couldn't enjoy what I was watching.  I just couldn't buy into what they were asking me to accept.  Without giving away the film, a good comparison perhaps is to say that if you were told that your two best friends were in a fist fight and you had to stop them from hurting each other, but then found out that it was all spurious expose, would you really fear for their safety or would you watch with a crooked grin on your face?Identity is a film that is blessed with a plethora of excellent horror film elements.  You have ten strangers that all seem to have some sort of connection.  It is a dark and stormy night and the small area in Nevada that they are in is going through a torrential storm.  It is flooding the roads so that everyone has to take refuge at a dingy looking Batesesque looking motel.  The film starts out beautifully with a terrible car accident that may have been triggered by one of the other patrons when she lost some of her luggage on the road which caused the flat tire and this caused the accident.  Everyone seems to be meeting by suspiciously conspicuous circumstances.  What they all have in common and why they are all here is the million dollar question.   Soon everyone is settled into the rooms but other eerie events just keep popping up all over the place.  And then finally someone dies.  And in a most heinous of ways.  She has her head cut off and placed in a dryer. Pretty gruesome stuff.  But what is the significance of everyone being here and why can't they get out?  It is almost like they have been brought here by some mystical force and it is keeping them here.  Radios don't work, cars won't start, the storm is flooding everything except the motel and to make matters worse, there is a psychotic prisoner chained to the bathroom wall in one of the rooms.  Add to the story that they all share the same birthday, some strange names and the you now have one seriously confusing film.  And that is where the films stops being suspenceful and confusing and it heads into the absurd.There are enough red herrings introduced in the film as well to throw you off of the real deal but some of those red herrings would have made a more compelling story than they one that the writer's want us to believe.  But what does keep the film flowing is the actors.  With a film blessed with a cast that includes Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John Cusack, there is never a dull moment.  Cusack carries the film and every second he is on screen he makes you listen.  He has come such a long way from his days in films like Sixteen Candles and The Sure Thing.  I have never seen him better than he is here.But ultimately what transpires in the last half hour of the film is what put me off.  That is not to say that it will put a typical viewer off the film off, it probably won't.  I have talked to many people that saw the film and loved it.  They liked the twist, they liked the outcome and they liked how it all played out.  I can't really tell you why I didn't care for it, but I just didn't.  And this is coming from a guy that loved the twist in Fight Club, Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  Go figure.  Maybe I didn't feel cheated in those films the way I felt cheated here.6.5 out of 10Maybe the best thing to do is just judge for yourself.",Identity
107,DunnDeeDaGreat,"Great perofmances, good cinematography, predictable ending",7,3 May 2003,Identity was a pretty good movie runied by a predictable ending. The film reminded of Lifeboat but with a scarier atompshere. The film in my opinion really didn't have any jump out of your seat moments. John Cuscack and Ray Lioltta are in top form as always and Amanda Peet looks yummy as always. My only other compliant with the film was that Jake Busey had such a small part. Still it's James Mangold best film since copland and worth a look.,Identity
108,mentalcritic,It mostly works...,8,27 July 2004,"Identity is a hard film to describe without giving the story away. In fact, every little second of screentime is important to the story, so talking about events is a difficult thing to do without giving away too much. I will try to discuss it in general point form, but if you haven't seen it already, consider yourself advised. Even describing the setup without ruining a surprise is a tough ask.The cast assembled at the hotel is exceptionally strong together, and they give the film all of its impact. John Cusack in particular arrests the viewer and gives them someone to get behind. Amanda Peet turns in a rare performance that I don't hate her in. Ray Liotta makes the plot twist of his character work like only a true professional can do. By the time the film reveals why he's constantly yelling and screaming at everyone who dares to disagree with him, he really manages to get under the viewer's skin.The real surprise in this cast, however, is Jake Busey, who does the Obnoxiously Ugly Contingent Of Hollywood proud. During his screentime, his mannerisms and delivery really sell him as a serial killer. If the viewer isn't afraid of the big unknown that the film sets up, they will definitely be afraid of Jake. The guy is big and authoriative enough to sell the character in spite of so little being known about him. But then, we know very little about any character here, even after they try to explain themselves.As various events conspire to bring the principal cast to a simple hotel that appears to be in the middle of nowhere, we slowly get a feeling something is not quite right here. Soon after everyone arrives, one of the guests is killed, and a keychain found not far from their corpse. The keychain corresponds to the number of the room she is situated in, and so the game begins. Most of the people in the hotel share a room with somebody, but the keychain links things together in a way that is subtle and obvious at the same time.Where the film lapses is the ending. Not only does it feel too abrupt, it has little, if any, lead-in or hint, making it feel as though it was thrown in for the sole purpose of closing the film. Sometimes this isn't so bad, but considering the standard set by the rest of the film, it is a big disappointment. Still, the film entertains for ninety minutes, and that's certainly more than a lot of recent films seem to feel we have a right to ask.",Identity

This film had lots of promise and a good cast , lets face it we could watch anything with Ray Liotta in it couldnt  we? But instead of this being an above average slasher/stalker type film it decided to go all deep and paranormal and in the end lost all credability.

That being said, I will tell you that the film is an extremely effective little psychological thriller that I really enjoyed because I figured it out  - in 3 stages - from the clues given, and I got to have the supreme and intense pleasure of indeed seeing it play out the way I had deduced that it must. So for me, the ending was not a surprise (it was the only logical conclusion), but this didn't ruin the film for me or make it predictable in a bad way; in fact it actually ENHANCED the reward of the experience.The movie doesn't have enough psychological nuance to make it a masterpiece (like, for example The Sixth Sense) but I still got the chills at the end even though I had figured it out - this speaks volumes about its effectiveness.",Identity

All that I had heard was that there was a `twist'.  The movie itself was fairly superficial in terms of a storyline, but I soon came to realize that was the only way the story really could have presented itself.  The acting was pretty cookie-cutter, even from my man John Cusack, but some fairly interesting cinematography that was used to tell parts of the story more than made up for it.  The good news is that with a couple of exceptions, I was kept guessing throughout the film, and more than once I was completely dumbfounded.  When the `twist' finally occurred, it took me a second to figure out what was going on, but it ended up being pretty satisfying.  `Identity' was by no means a great film, but it was entertaining, so overall it was a positive experience.--Shelly",Identity

Second, the sound, script and all that other stuff is good as well.Third...the end of the film has a twist that doesn't quite go with the rest of the film.

I am proud to say that I was able to predict the 'identity' of the killer...sort of.Y'see, there is a twist towards the end of the movie that made a lot of folks sitting in the theater with me go ""WHAT?"". Luckily, I apparently have a much higher IQ than those people so I was able to follow what was happening. I didn't like it too much. In the end, the whole thing works itself out, but the twist is one I didn't like.A lot of the story is told in flashbacks. There are quite a few of those and I enjoyed them to a degree. That must be getting quite popular with horror writers nowadays because both RESIDENT EVIL and GHOST SHIP (two other great horror films) have story contained in flashback sequences. The ones in this film are quite important and they are extremely well done.The film was great. It kept on going and going and going. It never stopped. A strait murder fest. Perfect. Brilliant.

The intersection of the two plots can only lead to one conclusion, unless you fail to realize that there's a reason these two stories are within the same film. Despite all the failed surprises and twists, the plot at least delivers the payoff the story has built up; and you'll find satisfaction in the film if you can shrug off the countless flaws with the realization that it never really hinders the progression.

'Identity' must be the ultimate movie in that category, as it's spooky, stylish, dark and scary, but ultimately very unsatisfying. Ten people are being forced to stay in a motel for the night after a storm flooded all the highway exits. Soon, the character mysteriously die one at a time (think 10 little indians), and it's up to main character Ed (John Cusack) to figure out just what is happening.It sounds like an exciting story, and it is. The actors (besides Cusack we see - amongst others - Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet) are fine, the atmosphere just right and the story entertaining as well as dark. But then, about 3/4 into the movie, the writers spoil it by completely explain the plot and what the heck is going on.(SPOILERS BEGIN) It turns out Cusack really is one of 10 identities a serial killer has, and the others in the motel are the other 9. One of those 10 is a killer, while the others may not be as harmful. The real killer's lawyer wants to establish this so he can plead insanity, and the killer won't get the death penalty. The idea of the lawyer is to have Cusack kill of the murderer in his mind, so he won't be a danger anymore. There, got it?It's all a bit silly, come to think of it, but the worst part is that it is all happening after 3/4 of the movie. So the last 20 minutes or so, when tension should rise, you're watching a movie about fictious people, to save the life of a known serial killer. That's not really helping the story, to put it mildly.Enough has been said about the ending, it's just so stupid I won't waste any words on it.

Identity was one thriller that managed to surprise me greatly, as it turned out to be a brilliant psychological slasher with a powerful cast, obviously borrowed heavily from ""And Then There Were None"", well I say the plot, but other than that this movie well and truly stands on its own. It may not be gory which is what doesn't make this movie a straight up slasher, but it is violent and brutal keeping it more towards the horror aspect. Another factor is what I liked is that I well and truly wanted to know why these people were getting murdered and they're separate story lines also kept me interested and this movie is full of surprises and even adds a mind screwing twist that for any first time viewer will never figure out, making it well and truly amazing and original. I mean the twist was just genius and a well and truly talking point.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie, the whodunit element was also done well and even had me shocked and surprised, The use of room keys as corpse markers is a great lead up for suspense. It's always edge-of-your-seat drama as red herrings are picked off, and the collection of people start to learn things about each other that make them all connected in some way, all of which makes the directing by James Mangold slick from beginning to end, with an effective and cleaver set up.Off all the slasher movies I have seen, very few have gathered such a diverse and memorable cast as this. First we get former cop now limo driver John Cusack (Ed) giving a real intense performance as one the male leads, as the movie progresses he becomes more and more interesting and captivating. Ray Liotta (Rhodes) plays it cool as the cop but at the same time quite charming and creepy at the same time, he nailed the part and stealing the show in almost every scene, his chemistry with John Cusack was a real highlight. Amanda Peet (Paris) played the hooker and tart with a heart really well as the unlikely but obvious final girl. Clea Duvall proved competent in role as one half of the young married couple, although I did find her constant whining pretty annoying at times. Rebecca De Mornay gives a stand out performance as the faded actress and early victim, she should have been given more screen time. John C McGingley gave a credible and strong performance as the socially awkward family man George. Jake Busey played the psychotic prisoner and obvious red herring really well and John Hawkes played the motel manager Larry brilliantly and hits all the right notes.All in all ""Identity"" is an effective horror through and through with a brilliant and perfectly played cast, an awesome story line and effective who done it plot which will keep you guessing until the end and a mind boggling twist that will blow your mind completely out of the water.",Identity

It has some gruesome murders, some good scares, some cheap scares, good acting, and a great ending.The MPAA states that Identity is rated R for `strong violence and language.' The violence wasn't that strong, but some of the images were horrific, such as the one in that shed (I won't say any more). I'm glad that there's a horror movie that a) doesn't go for the teenager, PG-13 crowd, or b) goes for the all-out gore. It was also scary for a lot of the time, although it made me jump some times, going for cheap scares. A lot of times, I thought there would be one when there actually wasn't one.Cusack was convincing as a limo driver, he's a good actor to begin with, and here's just another one of his movies. Liotta, who usually doesn't do much for me, was good, although he can't really sway from being a cop. Amanda Peet, who played a hooker named Paris, put in another outstanding acting job, proving her versatility. She can do slapstick comedy (The Whole Nine Yards), drama (Igby Goes Down), and now scary horror films. McGinley was had me believed that he was a worrying husband, although I didn't recognize him. Maybe I have his image from Office Space in my mind.For some unknown reason, the ending of Identity reminded me of the ending of Vanilla Sky. They both explained a lot at the end, although in the latter, there were still questions, while here I understood everything. I thought it made perfect sense, and the last scene is priceless. It will keep you guessing, with different thoughts as you go through it, and, I can assure you, none of them will be right.Music makes or breaks a movie, and here, it makes.

The cast is very good, especially Cusack, Liotta, and Amanda Peet (an interesting actress who really needs a new agent and more confidence, as I predict she could blow us away in the right role but who has been regulated to the worst comedies or recent memory), but they all could do better than this slick thriller that is more dumb than clever. I was almost ready to forgive the film and pass it off as a moderately enjoyable flick, until one final plot twist at the end irked me to the point that I hated it.

I just want to be entertained. I'm not trying to figure out a bunch of plot twists. What I will say is this - it's great to go back to see films of movie stars who are older now simply to see how time has ravaged their face. I would say everyone (even Jake Busey who on his best day is hard to look at) was at their prime in this film as far as looks go. Look any of them up now and most of them are straight busted.

128,Horror-yo,"Very well paced, but loses suspense a bit fast",7,8 October 2018,"This sort of film is quite difficult to accomplish because it needs to be seamless between the events and actions taking place, and the theory behind them. The film makers have to be extremely careful not to give away too much, too early in the film, and they also have to make sure the film doesn't come across as one big explanation of itself (à la Inception). The introduction is poignant and catches the viewer's attention quite immediately. That momentum rides into the whole bulk of the film but then it turns slightly flat. Eventually we realize that ""flat"" area is essential to the very point and understanding of the film, and that's when we get into the crux of the plot. The movie starts to explain itself, and that happens a little fast in the film which makes it, not so much predictable (because it's not) but rather switches off the intensity and genuine sense of mystery that had been maintained so far. It's almost like film and viewer partner up together to see the story progress logically. The ending is interesting and offers yet another twist to the story and avoids a disappointing final impression and it's making a genuine statement rather than just trying to be a dramatic ending with no meaning, as often in this sort of twisty tale.The film probably suffers from a bit of herky jerky laying out of the plot, which interrupts the suspense before sparking it again some more, and would've benefited perhaps from a different setup.The setting and casting are good, the acting is good (from all, but Cusack in particular) and visually the film is rather memorable.

129,asda-man,Hard to identify,7,3 November 2012,"Identity starts off brilliantly. It has various flash-backs and flash-forwards to keep you all entertained and works almost as a puzzle. It's clever and engaging and lets us all get to know the wonderful array of characters who obviously end up stranded at a motel. From then on, Identity tries to pull in a slasher element that would work if it actually tried to be a horror film and not just a thriller with killings. I mean, if you look at James Mangold's previous works, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Walk the Line"" etc. He's not exactly in touch with the horror genre and that's almost what the film pretends to be.Nevertheless it's very entertaining, but could've been executed better. The cast is great and the writing intelligent. Identity thrives off its characters, all of them different and engaging. You have to have a reaction when one of them gets the chop! The trouble being that the chops aren't very well done. Most of the kills are off-camera and don't generate up a lot of tension. Howver, it's the twist which the film thrives off. It had mixed reactions in my house. I thought it was really clever (although I had accidentally read an element of it before I'd actually seen it) and although something similar is regularly done in today's films (especially the horror genre) it was also buried under other elements which gives the film a whole new edge to it. Some might call it silly and pointless, but I call it original and intelligent.Identity isn't much of a horror film, which is a shame because I'm sure if it was approached as a slasher I'm sure I'd be giving it a solid 8. It does generate thrills but not as many as you might imagine. Perhaps if it was done today, it would've had a better look and feel to it. But that's not to say it's a bad film, because its not. It's genuinely interesting, has fantastic character development and is also extremely atmospheric with its use of pathetic fallacy and claustrophobia. It's worth a see, but don't go expecting something as great as some people like to paint.",Identity
130,AvionPrince16,Beyond the Motel......,6,2 October 2021,The whole story is about a killer who commit crime and kill each people in a motel who many people are stuck because of the rain. We asking ourself what happened? Who commit theses crimes and why? The whole story shift in the 3/4 of the movie and have more a psychological point about these acts and two great twist. The story in the motel was quite convenient and pretty predictable really. But i already predicted who was the killer just after 40 minutes of watching the movie. So the second twist didnt surprise me at all. I was just surprised that i was correct. The mise en scene and the editing was pretty good and can give some more interest about the movie. And we realised that we are confronted with a bigger problem more than just a crime. Be careful of the appareances. The movie was quite good and entertaining but some parts are pretty classic and can be clearly predicted like i did. Maybe not everyone will understand but its a good movie i recommend it.,Identity

The problem is, he sees this as an asset to the film, something that makes it good, while I see in this the core problem of this motion picture. Namely, in my opinion, for the first two thirds this movie is only slightly better (due to a good cast of actors) than your average horror / slasher flick...

138,DavidSim240183,A great horror film with some surprising intricacies,9,12 January 2007,"The opening scenes of Identity are the best. It begins with a psychiatrist (Alfred Molina) listening to testimony from a patient of his, Malcolm Rivers (an eye twitching Pruitt Taylor Vince). He apparently killed innocent people four years previously and has been sentenced to death. This setup gives the impression we're going to watch an intense courtroom drama about mental illness. Then intriguingly it becomes a completely different film.The scene then changes to something right out of a hundred horror movies. Strangers that gradually gather at a spooky motel. All set against the backdrop of a dark and stormy night. And the guests are slowly whittled down one by one. These two seemingly unconnected story lines gradually converge over the course of the next 90 minutes. And thanks to James Mangold's confident direction and some superb acting, Identity emerges as a gripping, engaging and surprisingly thought-provoking horror film.I don't want to give too much away about the plot because the greatest joy to be had is watching the mysteries unfold. All of the characters at the motel are entertaining in their own way. Special mention should go to John Cusack and Ray Liotta. One who is a cop. And one who isn't. The film itself will explain what that statement means, and its all handled with a surprising deftness.I love the interconnecting events concerning how each one of the guests end up at the motel. The situations sometimes flow into each other, such as John Cusack's character encountering a family stranded on the highway who all end up going to the same motel.Rebecca DeMornay puts in a scene-stealing appearance as a faded film starlet. And what really shocked me was that I didn't even know it was her until the credits rolled. Amazing how a famous face can go right past you.Not all of the characters are famous, but they do a good enough job of fleshing out their identities, and they become something more than just stock filler material until their time in the spotlight is up. They all come complete with their own pasts and separate agendas.I was glad to see Clea DuVall in the cast, a very underrated actress. But unfortunately, she isn't given much of a chance to shine like she has in some of her other film roles, like The Faculty. In that film, she was able to transcend what could easily have been a very clichéd character. But in Identity, she isn't given much to do beyond crying a lot, and the way she's written out was disappointing. Especially for an actress of her considerable talents.Amanda Peet brings some much needed depth to the role of a prostitute. In some ways she is the most rounded character out of the lot. Especially because she gets to fulfil a life-long dream during the course of the film.And John Cusack and Ray Liotta provide a fascinating counterpoint. Cusack serves as a logical anchor, and Liotta is a tightly wound hothead with a few secrets of his own. Watching the sparks fly from these two is worth the price of admission alone. And look out for Jake Busey as the customary eye-rolling psycho added into the mix.One thing that was refreshing about Identity is the way its sharp and involving in this postmodern era of horror movies without having to resort to Screamesque in-jokes and genre nods. The taut direction and sheer talent of its stars is enough to carry the film forward. The film occasionally dabbles in areas such as destiny and fate that feels like its wandered in from Final Destination. That only serves as a distraction. Identity is at its best when functioning as an engaging horror shocker, before it pulls the rug out from under us.The thing that people pick up on about Identity is the shocking plot twist that surfaces three quarters of the way through. And what a plot twist it is too! A twist that involves the scenes with Alfred Molina converging with the events at the motel. And it does it in a very satisfying way that lends the film a conceptual sophistication like something out of a Charlie Kaufman film. And there are more plot twists to come.I can't say anything more about them otherwise it would rob the climax of its immeasurable power. It could be regarded as a directors cop-out, but not when you deconstruct the rest of the film beforehand. I for one loved Identity, and its ingenious multilayered approach. It left me pondering the notions of identity and reality for days afterwards.Watch Identity, and you'll see what I mean.",Identity
139,pfgpowell-1,"If you want a top-notch thriller and mystery, this is the one",8,6 October 2009,"There's hokum and there's hokum, which is to say there's bad hokum and good hokum. Identity, directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney, is top-class, 24-carat, Grade A+++ hokum, the real McCoy. And that is meant as outright praise. From the intriguing opening shots to the final scene which, in a sense, wraps it all up, Identity scores big time. Other IMDb reviewers have criticised the film for its cod - and thus very wrong - psychology as regards the psychopathology of multiple personality disorder sufferers (or whatever the correct clinical name is). The only response to that is: who cares? If films always tried to get the psychology right, there would be far fewer films. Who cares? is my response to the occasional plot hole, but I shan't even bother listing them here, as the exercise would be pointless. Nor will I outline in tedious detail what happens, as to my tastes is too often the practice here. If you feel you need to know that before watching Identity, then please look elsewhere. I will simply say that Mangold's film is a very clever and very entertaining mix of thriller, suspense, horror and whodunit, with even the occasional dark joke. For this reviewer John Cusack and Ray Liotta are always a joy to watch, but the rest of the cast, not least Amanda Peet, complement their fine performances well. Fundamentally, the success of Identity is rooted in a clever, well-plotted and, in its way, rather original story by Cooney. But that story, made into a film, might well have died on its feet in lesser hands than those of Mangold. And even then it might not have been so hugely entertaining were it not for the cast, each of whom is, to some extent, a stereotype (what stage, novel or film character isn't?), but each of which is brought superbly to life and given a distinct identity by the actor who portrays him or her. I bought the DVD of Identity after watching Mangold's remake of 3.10 To Yuma which I enjoyed a lot. I have also bought, but not yet watched Cop Land, which, however, garnered less critical praise. But Mangold (who works with his producer wife Cathy Konrad) is a director to watch. But at the end of the day Identity's success is rooted in the screenplay by Cooney. If you like being entertained, held in suspense, if you like horror and intelligent whodunits, Identity is the film for you.",Identity
140,LloydBayer,"An unpredictable, shocking, thrilling, edge-of-your-seat twister.",8,26 March 2013,"I am hard pressed to maintain a sterile review without giving away spoilers because IDENTITY is filled with surprises, twists and shocks that even veteran film critics did not see coming. Ten years after watching this film, I watched it again and believe me, I enjoyed this roller-coaster of a movie just like I did the first time. Inspired by Agatha's Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", Michael Cooney's phenomenal story will have you strapped in your seat from the gruesome beginning all through to the gruesome end. The setup is a desolate motel in the Nevada desert where ten strangers will face their darkest and final hours, all before the night is over. Lashed by a violent thunderstorm, the motel comes alive when a man (John C. McGinley) rushes in seeking urgent medical attention for his wife (Leila Kenzie). By his side is their little boy Timothy (Bret Loehr). The family is helped by a limo driver (John Cusack) and a reluctant movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) he was driving before coming to their aid. A cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a chained prisoner (Jake Busey) also stops for the night. The downpour also sweeps in a newly married couple (William Lee Scott and Clea DuVall) and a Las Vegas prostitute (Amanda Peet). With the phone lines down and electricity on the blink, they prepare to wait out the storm. Elsewhere, convicted serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is about to be executed when his psychiatrist Dr. Mallick (Alfred Molina) discovers a journal. Rivers' journal throws new light on his conviction and Mallick calls for an eleventh-hour hearing on preventing the execution. Meanwhile our guests at the motel are being killed in a peculiar pattern, one by one, by an unknown murderer. As they turn on each other to unmask the killer, director James Mangold opens a huge can of perfectly blended suspense and mystery while leaving the viewer with some very unavoidable questions. Is it the prisoner? Is it the weird motel clerk? Is it a character lurking in the shadows? And the most baffling question of all – What is the connection between Malcolm Rivers' hearing and the on-going butchery in a motel set in an entirely different location? Believe it or not, these are questions Mangold and Cooney have cleverly crafted just to pull the rug under your feet. Even if you have been watching and listening carefully, there is only the slimmest possibility you will find the answers before the director starts to untangle the mystery. This revelation is set at the beginning of the third act, with 30 minutes or so remaining, but perfectly timed to have the viewer's thoughts racing back to the beginning. Of course, by this time you will have either figured it out or you will be defenseless for Mangold's final blow. This is also when the narrative shifts from a whodunit to pure psychological horror with an omnipresent trace of the supernatural. Leading an all-star cast, Cusack does a sensational job and along with Peet (they would co-star again in the apocalyptic 2012) maintains the sheer momentum of this plot twister. Liotta, Busey and John Hawes (as the motel clerk) add to the mystery but as you will find, these are small but vital blips in the bigger picture. In all, everyone does their part and at times appear to be a bit comical with characters shouting and screaming in tandem with the rising tension. Even so, this is merely the calm before the storm while the director gives you a little time to take in what is happening. If you liked the way THE SIXTH SENSE or SESSION 9 came crashing down on you, IDENTITY will do the same but the surprises keep coming at you instead of just one major twist reserved for the end. I think I have said enough. Anymore and I might give into the temptation of revealing the film's darkest but well kept secrets.",Identity

The overall idea is pretty ingenious, and a nice twist (heh) on the thriller, and it's executed pretty well. Sure, it's as clichéd as can be, but I think that actually serves the story, instead of ruining it. The very last twist is pretty terrible, though, especially when the director felt he had to show everyone his own cleverness by repeating the key scenes throughout the movie that show that this plot development does have some merit. It's way too heavy-handed and panders to the audience too much. Overall, though, it's solidly acted and is pretty compelling.",Identity

144,christian123,Agatha Christie would be proud,7,22 May 2005,"Identity is a very good thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Ten strangers with secrets are brought together in a savage rainstorm: A limo driver, an '80s TV star, a cop who is transporting a killer, a call girl, a pair of newlyweds and a family in crisis, all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager. Relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. The plot is nothing new but the film is still effective. There are some really surprising twits while others you can probably see coming. The film is also very scary especially since the setting is at some creepy motel in the middle of no where. The acting is pretty good with the best being John Cusack. He is kind of underrated though he has proved in the past that he can play any type of role. Amanda Peet is good though she tends to play the same character in every film. Ray Liotta does a good job as well. The rest of the cast include Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina and John Hawkes. James Mangold directs and does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right until the end. The film is only 90 minutes long so it won't take up to much of your time. Though because of that, the characters aren't as interesting as they would had been if it was longer. The problem I had with Identity was the ending as it was kind of stupid. Everything before the ending though is entertaining and all the twists are done well even if their not original. But the ending nearly kills the film and if it would if everything before wasn't good. Still Identity is defiantly one of the better thrillers of 2003 and it's a must see. In the end, this a pretty good film but the ending nearly ruins the film. Rating 8.3/10, worth checking out.",Identity

Many users have complained about the plot twist in this film. Not about the first plot twist which introduces the last third of the movie but about the final twist. Obviously, these people didn't like the ending because it was not happy!!! The moment they relaxed and believed that things had turned out well they were forced to see that the ""killer personality"" hadn't been defeated and that more murders would happen - also in reality.Oh dear, what an awful ending in a horror thriller!?!?I am utterly unable to understand how anyone could have a problem with this kind of ending. First of all, an evil-eyed kid attacking a woman in a beautiful landscape with a rake is clearly meant ironically, which means that a too-serious approach to this ending reveals a lack of humour in the critic. Irony is, in my opinion, an excellent answer to the recent inflation of ""mental-plot-twist"" movies.Second, what the **** do people expect of a horror film where people are stabbed with baseball bats and where audiences are supposed to be screaming out loud at the revelation of a dead body? People who do not like to see dark or evil things in movies should have left to see Bambi ten minutes after the film began, shouldn't they?So, for me this is a fantastic conceptual thriller, very well acted, moody, scary, suspenseful - and highly intelligent.",Identity

They are in a room reviewing the crime he committed several years ago. Then it goes to a desolate place in the desert, on a raining night. We being to meet the rest of the cast in the film. The story then begins with a crash, involving a car/pedestrian. This is where John Cusacks character comes in. In a remote part of Nevada, on a stormy night 10 people are stuck for the night. As the movie goes along the characters start getting bumped off. It's like a who done it and nobody trusts anyone, especially the convict that is among the group.Little does the viewer know that this is all playing out in Malcolm Rivers head, and these 10 people are all his identities. In order for him to escape the death penalty Malcolm must convince his doctor, judge, etc. that his treatment has worked and the killer is gone, so he can go into a state hospital , instead of being put to death.

148,mnpollio,Initially promising thriller whose tension sputters out at the midway point,4,15 April 2011,"A textbook case of something that probably sounded daring and more entertaining on paper than it does in execution. Identity is initially an update on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. A legion of diverse characters become stranded in a storm at an isolated desert motel, where one by one they are picked off by someone (or something).The story is not new, but it is most definitely reliable. The atmosphere is tense, there is a definite sense of dread surrounding the proceedings. An ace cast has been compiled to inhabit the roles of the prospective victims and the screenplay throws in some twists, like all of the people discovering they were born on the same day or everyone's last name is a state. Tidbits which definitely perk the interest and make one wonder whether there is not a supernatural or metaphysical element going on. Meanwhile, a subplot is concurrently running concerning a schizophrenic murderer (Pruit Taylor Vince) and his concerned physician (Alfred Molina). Is Vince the perpetrator behind the killings? Are we seeing something that has already happened being told in flashback? Unfortunately, the screenplay has one twist that comes right around the midway mark that utterly annihilated any further suspense or rooting interest that one has in the film. The viewer is then left with a healthy expanse of dead space that becomes more tedious and illogical with each passing moment. The writers/director probably thought this novel twist was monumental, but it actually shoots the film in the foot. It is predicated on the fact that we MUST have some sympathy with the institutionalized killer - a character that is marginal at best up to that point in the film. It is completely wrong though. The viewer's sympathy and interest lie with the people back at the motel, and by robbing the main plot of any reason to become emotionally involved, the film renders itself pointless.There are good performances about. John Cusack is a solid and likable leading man. Ray Liotta trots out his familiar tough guy shtick to good advantage. Amanda Peet is a lively leading lady, although why everyone in the film is able to immediately peg her as a prostitute when she is dressed more demurely than Rebecca DeMornay's shrewish actress is beyond me. Speaking of DeMornay, it would have been nice to keep her character around a bit longer. The remainder of the cast is comprised of familiar and perfectly reliable performers like Clea Duvall, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, etc. In fact, the two fuzziest and least involving characters are the ones portrayed by Vince and Molina - and when the film drops on us that this is where our attention should be focused and our involvement lies, it is near impossible to remain engaged any further.The latter third of the film - utterly devoid of tension despite increasing noise and hysteria - seems to go on forever. The film then, of course, attaches on a coda that leaves the door open for a possible sequel. The ""shock"" revelation of the ""person"" behind the murders at the hotel will not be much of a shock to attentive viewers or those at all familiar with thrillers in general. Unfortunately, the truth is that it really makes no difference who the ""killer"" at the hotel is and that is what stops the film in its tracks. Definitely an A for ambitious, but a C- for the end result.",Identity

151,AndyVanScoyoc,Great movie...if the obvious eludes you...,5,23 February 2006,"I had such high hopes for this movie and was so disappointed when I saw it that I have waited until now (two years later) to actually post a review. The only reason I am posting this review now is because I watched it on TV last night and though better than the first time around, it still was a terrible let down.I saw this movie the first week it came out in the theaters in 2003 because it looked phenomenal. It wasn't...The movie starts out well enough...there is a terrible storm and people after people, end up at this desolate motel in the middle of nowhere when the roads wash out and become flooded.This could make for a great storyline you think. Murder? Suspense? I was ready to go! Too bad that excitement couldn't have lasted. Halfway through the movie was where it started to fall apart.It becomes terribly predictable. The people in the rooms start dying. Well of course you think it's Jake Busey (as usual a fine actor when it comes to being a ""bad guy"") because he is Ray Liotta's prisoner.No...wait, he ends up being killed too, only shortly after the murders start. Wait then...it has to be the creepy motel owner. No...it's not him either...all of a sudden everything about this movie has that ""been there...seen it and am bored with it"" feel.Where was the originality that I had thought this movie would be infused with? It went right out the window along with the plot line.Let me explain...The actual focus of this movie is on Malcom Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince)...a mass murderer who is up for execution...until Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) discovers that it's not Malcolm himself who is committing these horrid murders...it's his many and varied, multiple personalities! As the movie progresses, each person that ""dies"" is actually one of Malcolm's personas.Now in itself that may not sound bad...kind of original actually. Someone who is mentally ill ""curing"" themselves by having their personas meet and kill each other off. But the manner in which it is done, leaves so much to be desired that it almost becomes comical. The idea was brilliant, and so much could have been done with it but the execution was awful...and halfway through the movie at that...For all purposes, these people stranded in this motel think they are real people, with real lives. Yet, suddenly, all of the murdered bodies start disappearing and no one sees how. To anyone with any deductive reasoning powers, this is your first clue that this seemingly original plot starts trudging down the road of predictability.Maybe this was supposed to be nail biting suspense, but it wasn't. It made absolutely no sense. How could someone clean up so much blood, dispose of a head (belonging to Rebecca DeMornay,) and cart away the large build of a man like John C. McGinley and no one see? From this point forward it is a desperate attempt to keep the watcher hooked and it reminds me of the second ""Final Destination"" movie...with one misplaced and pathetic event after another and none of it helps the movie except to bring it to its end...which didn't come soon enough.The ""kid persona"" of Malcolm's, being the killer at the end, was just too much. How pathetically predictable. Let's see...this kid is creepy, he doesn't say much, looks kind of evil...One does not require a degree in rocket science to start putting the numbers together.Let me just say that other than a bang up performance by John Cusack, Liotta and a stellar performance by John C. McGinley as a manic man with far too many issues, this movie left nothing much else to be desired...How very disappointing...",Identity
152,Thrashman88,Fast Moving and Entertaining,9,23 May 2004,"I rented this last night and had no idea what was I getting. I knew most of the stars: John Cusak, Rebbeca Demornay (who I hadn't seen in movies for a while) and even Alfred Molina (who had a brief role in the 1st Indiana Jones movie). I actually thought I was going to dislike this movie because I had never heard anything about it. I guess that was my blessing, because IDENTITY was actually all the contrary: a fast moving, action packed and entertaining movie. You have to pay close attention to the beginning of IDENTITY, since an important premise is given and is later brought up to round up the film. On the surface, IDENTITY is about 10 people who meet in a run down motel in the middle of Nevada, on a heavy stormy night. They stay at the motel because of the heavy rain and because the roads are blocked. Among the people is an ex-cop turned limo driver (John Cusak), a has-been movie star (Rebecca Demornay), a recently retired prostitute (Amanda Peet), a Cop (Ray Liotta) driving a murderous convict (Jake Busey) to another Estate, a husband with a wounded wife and his,a young couple and the motel owner. These characters then start being murdered one by one with NO apparent reason or motive. This is where the real suspense begins. It's got enough gory murders to appeal to any bloodthirsty, fango crazy movie lover, but everything is done with the style of a big budget production.. All I can say is that what you are watching is not what it appears to be.

McGinley and Bret Loehr) and the motel owner (John Hawkes) - end up getting stuck in a motel because of the pouring rain.But not long after they're all settled, one of the guests is found dead, with the key for room Number 10. A few minutes after, the key for room 9 is found in the hands of a second dead body, and as the murders continue, the keys keep on being found near the bodies, and the survivors huddle together to survive the macabre countdown, but who is the killer among them? And what does a mass murderer (Pruitt Taylor Vince) have to do with them? 'Identity' is quite the surprise; it starts off as a 'Psycho-meets-And Then There Were None' thriller, and after half of the leads have been killed, it shoots out a plot twist that makes you rethink what you saw until then in one of the cleverest ways I have ever seen. A second plot twist is the killer's identity - don't rule any of the 10 off until they die.The acting is wonderful, especially from Loehr, McGinley, DuVall, Scott, Peet and Cusack, the script is tight, the music and lighting are quite appropriate, the scenery is creepy as Hell and the directing is very good.I consider this a movie to own.Identity: 9/10.",Identity

I am a huge fan of mistery movies and psychological thrillers like this one that keep you awake throughout every second of the movie, without blinking. You are always trying to think one step ahead, guessing, trying to make a logical explanation about who might the killer really be, who is who, why is this here and why is this happening here. All of that work your brain did, just so you come to the end and see that it was all for nothing because there is a gigantic plot twist that changes the whole perspective of the movie. This ladies and gents, this is a piece of art. Oh and yes, I really love John Cusack's acting. He is a true talent.",Identity

But I must say that it was a very big disappointment. The movie is nothing but a lame and predictable ghost story. First you see these strangers all stuck in this hotel during a storm and really horrible and cheesy accidents start happening to them. Slowly they all start dying one by one and obviously you start wondering who the killer is. But near the movie you start to predict that the hotel and all those people never even exist, except in the killers mind that's telling his story who was there once and really killed all these people in a hotel when he was a little boy. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and left me wondering what the point of this movie was. The story had nothing to say, except a unbearable pointless mess that's waiting for you at the end. There was also no good acting to save this pathetic movie. I would give Identity 3/10.",Identity
156,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"An original, complex, and wildly unpredictable horror/thriller",9,18 March 2007,"Identity was one of the first movies I saw that affected me psychologically. By the time it was done, it had taxed my brain and left me feeling very scared. The film is well directed, very well written, and well acted.It's a cold, dark, and rainy night. 10 strangers, including a cautious stepfather (John McGinley), an FBI agent (Ray Liotta), a convicted killer (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a hotel manager (John Hawkes), and a former cop turned limo driver (John Cusack), will have their lives dangerously intertwine at a rundown motel and be horrified as they are 'eliminated' one by one, with no clue who the killer could be. What ensues is a dangerously good episode of psychological horror.The music is very good, but it felt like there were those moments where they used it to foreshadow a scary bit. The cinematography is also top-notch, setting a brilliantly dark mood that really helps the horror aspects of the film. The cast works well as an ensemble, each playing their parts well. McGinley definitely drops his extremely funny reputation to play George York in a great way. A nice change for him. Ray Liotta is in top form as the mysterious FBI agent Rhodes. He and Cusack steal the show. Cusack's character is a great examination of how layered one man can be. We're never clear of what his character's motives are, but we are sure of one thing. He's the good guy. The performance of Amanda Peet was nice, but got a tad annoying as the movie dragged on. John Hawkes played a good part, while Jake Busey was extremely scary and creepy as a serial killer. Alfred Molina and Pruitt Taylor Vince appear in smaller roles. Molina is very convincing as a psychologist, and Vince is simply spectacular as the character Malcolm Rivers, a character who is so layered, deep, and central, that if I were to add more about him, it would spoil the movie. Identity is a classic psychological horror film that I always enjoy watching. The ending is very good, and will make you gasp. Definitely one of the biggest twists in a long time. I highly recommend 'Identity'.9/10 --spy",Identity
157,happyendingrocks,A genuine treat for old-school and new-school horror fans alike,8,15 August 2011,"Unquestionably one of the brightest lights on the spotty landscape of 21st Century horror, Identity fuses the best elements of modern macabre with strong nods to the classic slasher films of the genre's past, and enough tightly-executed twists to drive several films.The plot is basically an updated riff on Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (it's even mentioned in the film), with 10 strangers steered by fate to converge at a desolate motel during a sinister storm. The torrential rain renders all outbound roads flooded and strands the group without cell phone reception or even radio contact. Naturally, these marooned guests start being killed off one by one, and as the dwindling survivors struggle to identify the murderer in their midst, they gradually discover that they may have more in common than they suspect, and something far more malevolent than simple coincidence may be responsible for their common plight.If done right, this basic storyline would be more than enough meat to shape an entertaining thriller, but Identity isn't content to settle for being a straight-forward whodunnit. Here, discovering who the victims are is just as crucial as outing the killer, and even after the grand design of the murders has been revealed, the film rolls out one final swerve that turns what we though we knew upside down and concludes the tale on a grim, ghoulish note.I won't spoil any of the myriad twists for you here, but part of what makes Identity such a well-crafted creation is how well is stands up to repeated viewings once you know how the whole thing turns out. The skillful placement of the jigsaw pieces makes this a fun puzzle to assemble even after you've seen the completed picture, and supplementary visits to this morbid motel reveal the intricacies of the broader mystery.Of course, the excellent cast is key to the experience. Playing directly against type, John Cusack proves to be a fantastic lead for a thriller, and the novel placement of Cusack in a horror film is enough on its own to warrant a look at Identity. Ray Liotta is pretty much great in every movie he turns up in, and Amanda Peet essays a strong heroine who continues the refreshing tradition of resourceful female characters which have become a dependable genre presence since Scream mocked and shattered the hysterical ""chicks in peril"" archetypes of horror's past. The ensemble is rounded out by a slew of solid character actors, whose battling personalities ratchet up the tension within the claustrophobic locale.Though a couple of the murders are clearly telegraphed, the majority of the deaths in Identity arrive in surprising ways, and the unpredictability factor lends the film an aura of meticulously chiseled dread and suspense. Admittedly, it's not hard to figure out who's going to be around for the climax, but since the film holds one more turn up its sleeve at that point, even the fairly standard resolution ends up being a set up for something bigger.There's plenty of gore to please fans of old school splatter, as well a few sturdy scares, so since this is ultimately just a thoughtful update of the standard stalk-and-slash formula, we end up being grateful to the film-makers for not settling for a purely mainstream thriller at the expense of sacrificing the pure horror elements.Despite the renaissance the horror genre has enjoyed in the new century, very few genuine classics have emerged from the pack, and for those of us weaned on the iconic films of the '70s and '80s, the bulk of the contemporary fright flicks have been hollow imitators (and, increasingly, blasphemous ""re-imaginings"") of those legendary offerings. Identity balances the best of both schools, managing to be both familiar and original at once, and this terse, unrelenting exercise in bare bones horror is an enthralling and enjoyable ride. Highly recommended.",Identity
158,theinaniloquent,"""The secret lies within""",8,24 February 2012,"Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rainstorm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one.Everyday we see another cliché horror flick. We get it, it's all been done before, and we want to something new. When I first heard of Identity, I had mixed feelings. I had this feeling in me that this actually looks pretty good, but the other half held what I thought about horror films in general. After ALL those endless good reviews, I sat down to see what the big deal was... Identity was fantastic. The tension was so high and the suspense levels were max. At one point, I had to go pee so bad. In this movie, I didn't even THINK of going to the restroom, because the movie glues you to your seat. Now that's movie-making. The movie progresses like any other has, and this may turn you off. But the thing that possessed me was that feeling you get that SOMETHING is lurking in the background. You don't know what it could possibly be, so your wanting to sit and see. The acting ties in with this too. The actors seemed to be so in their role, it was great. You could tell maybe even them were feeling that something was there too, that great suspenseful feeling movies leave out nowadays. Not once did I even question the acting from all these new and old actors. Now the twists... the twist! If you haven't already seen this movie, I'm going to tell you this again, this is spoiler-filled. I cannot express how good the movie is until I explain the twist, so I suggest you go see the movie otherwise. THE TWIST! Never have I loved a twist so much, because it surprises you and makes you crazy at the same time. You learn that all of this was the thoughts of a guy who has something called personality disorder. This causes him to have multiple personalities at the same time, and he's living inside of his thoughts. Thing is, he's murdered this people and is basically living their lives out inside his head. It may sound a little far-fetched, but this is a MOVIE and people who are complaining should go watch their 'realistic' movies. The way they filmed the big twist was actually really cool. It was making you feel like YOU were in the mind of this guy, and even more twists lie after that one. All in all, I totally recommend this film. It's a thriller masterpiece, filled with so many twists and turns, your most likely going to have the urge to watch it again to catch new things. It's a movie experience, from however you look at it, and I loved it. 8/10.",Identity

The director gradually reveals what what is really happening and the film turns into something I didn't expect.The excellent cast including John Cusack, Amanda Peet John C.

160,rparham,"Good, but another big ""surprise""",8,18 January 2004,"Identity is the latest in a long line of recent thrillers that seems to live for ""the twist.""  Popularized recently mostly by films written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""the twist"" is a feature of a film that develops in one direction to suddenly end up in another.  Much to my surprise, Identity handles it's primary twist well, and I commend it for that.  However, on the way to it's main twist, it tries to hard to build in others that are quickly revealed, much to my chagrin.The film is set primarily at a lonely motel in the middle of the desert.  A group of strangers, from various walks of life, find themselves stranded at this motel in the midst of a torrential rain storm.  One by one, they begin to die off in various rather gruesome ways, leaving the survivors to be suspicious of each other as to who is the killer.  The characters are all different, and as such utilizes the seeming requirement that a film with this kind of situation (small group of characters trapped in a secluded location) feature unique, and sometimes slightly weird, ""types"" to fill out it's roster.  The primary character is Ed, played by John Cusack, a limo driver transporting a fallen movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) to a job, and he quickly finds himself in his element as a former policeman while trying to solve the murders. The rest of the bunch is composed of Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a detective transporting Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a convicted killer; Paris (Amanda Peet) a prostitute on the way to a better life; newlyweds Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); Larry (John Hawkes) the motel manager, and finally George (John C. McGinley) a rather mawkish man who's wife was injured in a traffic accident.  Even though they are ""types"" most of the actors do a good job of filling out their characters.Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively.  The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise, which I will not reveal here.  However, it is not too surprising when this switch happens, as various earlier scenes telegraph it to us.  Director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney have slightly sabotaged one of the film's central conceits by constantly reminding us of what appears at first to be a subplot and eventually turns out to be the movie's primary plot.  I think that this twist would have worked better had there been almost no setup, or at least a lot less than was featured.That being said, Cooney and Mangold aren't through with us after that first twist.  There are others to come, and the final one is quite a surprise that was not nearly as obvious.  From that point of view, Identity is a success, proving that a filmmaker can still surprise the audience in a time when thrillers abound with twist endings becoming more and more unsurprising in their revelations.  You occasionally find yourself wishing that directors and writers would just make a straightforward thriller and leave the twists and turns in the past occasionally instead of always trying to formulate the next big ""surprise.""",Identity
161,Scott_Mercer,A Shameful Betrayal,1,12 March 2007,"I must go against the tide of opinion here. Those people rating this film highly have to be deranged. This film represents exactly the wrong way to write a movie and goes against everything I've ever read about screenplay structure and application. The filmmakers of ""Identity"" have broken a sacred bond with us, the audience. They have betrayed us.*** SPOILERS!!! *** One of the cardinal rules of (successful) screenplay writing is to make the audience care about the characters. In this, all the actors do a bang-up job. Some really good casting here and I can't fault any of the actors, who all deliver excellent performances (even Amanda Peet, appropriately screechy here) except maybe the guy playing Malcolm.But, 3/4 of the way through the film, the rug is yanked out from under us, and the audience is stabbed in the back. Everything we have been watching is not real, not even within the fictional construct of the film's artificial universe. None of the characters exist, the hotel doesn't exist, nobody was really killed, even the rain is false. Nothing that happens has made any sense, or needed to make any sense, because we have been watching the mindscape of an unappealing psychotic serial killer, not real people that the director and actors have tricked us into caring about.When we, as audience members, enter a film screening, we are making an informal agreement between ourselves and the filmmakers, that we will suspend our disbelief, and, in turn, the filmmakers are going to provide us characters we can empathize with (or hate, if they are the villains), and a responsibly constructed story line that follows certain storytelling conventions. Identity changes the rules in the middle of the game! It's like going to watch a football game, only to be told half way through, sorry, this wasn't really a football game, it was really a BALLET about a football game.Yes, I know there were some clues as to what was really happening presented right at the outset. But the fact that everything we were watching at the hotel didn't really exist was certainly hidden from us for far too long, until the only option remaining was that the whole thing was a dream or hallucination of some kind. This was not a clever puzzle, or an enchanting riddle for the audience to solve. This was a cheat, flat out. Straight up.And shame on you, Mr. Cooney, and Mr. Mangold, for cheating your audience. It's one thing to pull a magic trick on your audience through the subtle art of misdirection. It's another to con them out of the price of a movie ticket or DVD. The old Bait and Switch in action. There's a reason why magicians get paid highly to perform, but hucksters and con men are thrown in prison.Honestly, I am shocked that so many people rated this film so highly. If you really did enjoy this film, try the grade-Z cheapie Monster-A-Go-Go from 1965 (it's available on DVD), and tell me how much you enjoyed the ending of that film, another ""mindblowing twist"" that clubs us over the head with the fact that we just wasted our time watching what is a non-movie. If you people enjoy watching a movie that figuratively stabs you in the back, then I can't do anything to help you. But personally, I want my money back.",Identity
162,GirishGowda,An Awesome Thriller,9,28 May 2010,"Whatever I say about this movie regarding the plot will give it away. Still, I will try to explain by trying not to write spoilers. When the twist comes around in the film, you'll eventually figure out the killer if you have seen films like Se7en or Fight Club. This is a notch below those perfections, but still makes an extremely intelligent and engrossing watch. John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and he is extremely talented. He and Amanda Peet were the reasons I decided to check out this movie. Apart from 2012, they have never let me down. This movie is better than most of the films in its genre.Ten strangers with secrets are brought together in a savage rainstorm: A limo driver, Ed (John Cusack), an 80's TV star, Caroline Suzanna (Rebecca DeMornay), a cop, Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a killer, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a call girl, Paris (Amanda Peet), a pair of newlyweds (Clea DuVall & William Lee Scott) & a family in crisis (John.C.McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Bret Loehr), all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager, Larry (John Hawkes) in the Nevada desert. Their relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. Parallel to this story, there is also the hearing of a murderer who has already been sentenced to death.What if every choice we make was already made for us? What if there really were no coincidences in life & our destinies were already predetermined? I will not give anything away and spoil this for you. The film is only 80 minutes and I thought it was too short. The director, James Mangold could have extended the runtime more. I know it is petty reason when the movie is already as brilliant as it is, but that would have satisfied me more. Nobody in this film look like stars acting in a movie. All of them fit into their character perfectly. The standout comes from Ray Liotta and John Cusack.****Spoiler Alert**** Though I figured out the killer in the beginning, the plot made it impossible for that character to be the killer. So, I thought it must be Amanda Peet or Ray Liotta's character. But, that turned out to be a dud and the director made my first guess the killer. Anyway, its an awesome film.

165,ilovedolby,A very chilling thrill ride!,8,27 April 2003,"Having never really been a fan of the horror genre, upon first hearing of `Identity,' it seemed easy to dismiss. However, it wasn't easy to dismiss the cast: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, and Alfred Molina. Although these actors haven't always chosen the best screen stories, they are still respectable and for the most part a good bet when casting for a movie.After seeing `Identity,' the only conclusion that one could come to was that this film, although grizzly, was not really a horror film. In fact, to call it a horror film is disgraceful considering most horror flicks are just cheap, rehashed slasher movies that are geared for the teenyboppers. What separates `Identity' in terms of scary films is the mystery that surrounds it. An interesting story, and ultimately a mind-bender, `Identity' proves itself to be a very chilling thrill ride. `Identity' tells the story of ten people who are stranded at a motel during a powerful thunderstorm that has flooded most of the roads in the region. However, during their night at the motel, people start dying. Everyone is suspect and everyone is also innocent, as the killer is remote to the strangers. The killings seem to be ritualistic in that whoever the killer is, his or her signature card is a key tag for the rooms of the motel. In other words, as the murderer does the job, he or she counts down with every dead body, starting from ten. The events all lead to an ending that is as shocking as the murders themselves. At first, the film feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's `Psycho,' in that the events take place at a highway motel during a storm. That may have been some of the inspiration of horror screenwriter, Michael Cooney, whose credits include `Jack Frost,' (not to be confused with the Michael Keaton family film), and `Tracks Of A Killer.' James Mangold directed `Identity.' His work includes such films as the 2001 almost romantic comedy, `Kate & Leopold,' which starred the over-used, romantic comedy star Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman. Mangold also directed the critically successful film, `Girl, Interrupted,' which starred Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. His direction here is good and he tries to incorporate a bit of chill in the cinematography by occasionally throwing in a still image to throw the audience off. The technique is not all that impressive but kudos should to be granted for his trying.One scene in particular was somewhat spooky. The power goes out at the motel and while Liotta's character is outside, he slowly comes around the side of the motel. While lightening flashes and the rain beads off his face, the impression that it gives the audience is that he's doesn't have a chance of surviving the night and he's already dead. Performances in `Identity' were good. Cusack plays Ed, a retired cop, now limousine driver. He, along with supposed cop, Rhodes, played by Liotta, try to take control of the events taking place by continually searching the motel for answers of who the killer is. Peet, the gorgeous actress of such films as `The Whole Nine Yards,' and `Whipped,' plays Paris, a hooker trying to turn her life around. Molina, the star of last year's `Frida,' plays a psychiatrist bent on finding out what happened during the night at the motel. Other stars of the film include John Hawkes (`The Perfect Storm'), John C. McGinley (`Office Space'), Rebecca De Mornay (`Backdraft'), Clea DuVall (`The Faculty'), Jake Busey (`Contact'), and William Lee Scott (`October Sky'). All in all, `Identity' affirms itself as an absorbing show that plays with our fears and with our minds. ***",Identity

John Cusack, who I don't care for at all for his type-casted roles in romantic comedies/dramas...was pretty good in this.  The cast overall was pretty good, I was suprised to see Rebecca De Mornay back on screen, she was suitable for her short role.  Ray Liotta was bad as always, he's great.  The plot twist in this is pretty refreshing; though its something that's been attempted in other films, this movie does it very well, and leaves you even more astounded by its end.  It's a shame that this didn't get more fanfare...I always wanted to see this but just didn't get the chance, and boy am I glad I did.

It represents good entertainment in what could have been just another cliched horror film. Identity is interesting, atmospheric, and entertaining.
Even if it was cliched, Identity would still be suspenseful. Director James Mangold seems to really know what hes doing here. I dont know much about the rest of his work but I have heard he has done some solid films.
The acting definitely elevates Identity. While not award-winning performances, they are solid. John Cusack does a solid job in his role. Ray Liotta will forever be typecast as a tough guy, but hes so damn good you wont care. Amanda Peet does a nice job with her performance. John Hawkes is frequently scene stealing. Everyone else gives solid support.
Identity has a surprise around every corner. They deal with exactly why the characters are at the hotel and there is a surprise ending. Unfortunately, the surprise ending is a bit of a letdown. Its not that the thing with multiple personalities is not clever, its just that I did not totally get it. I dont want to say it had no logic in it but I just dont know. It may require another viewing. Overall, I was satisfied by Identity. It was a breath of fresh air for this year. I recommend Identity to pretty much everyone.",Identity

Starts off alright, then becomes really great, and then tapers off with a really ridiculous plot twist. Really, this was a perfectly good crime thriller until they introduce the twist, and then it all starts to slowly fall apart. Maybe to some people it seems fine, but I don't like it at all. It feels like the retarded little brother of Memento and The Machinist, trying to be those films, yet coming out just slightly skewed. And under all of that gloss, it's just a slasher film, a Friday the 13th write off. Really doesn't look too good to write about this one on paper, rather than watching it. This movie feels very fake and artificial by the end, an attribute to which the plot twist does NOT help in the least, and it really unravels down to the bare bones of it's mediocrity with the absolutely horrible ending.But this film isn't without moments, for it's rather enjoyable for the bulk of it's duration. Before the plot twist, you're really fired up and enjoying this one. I know I was. The interactions between characters and all of the kills are pretty enjoyable, but, it just keeps coming back to how bad it gets in the last 15 minutes or so.

But, we are intrigued as a few of the early scenes go backward in time - making us realize we there is something to this time line issue.

Some of the comments I have seen regarding this film indicate that most viewers didn't get it.  That's understandable since it wasn't rolled out like a red carpet or spoon fed like most other movies.  This movie was infinitely more imaginative and entertaining than the vapid and dreary poser film ""Memento"" that so many here enjoyed for some reason that still escapes me.  It succeeds where Memento fails, and delivers substance and style where Memento relies on device and contrivance.John Cusack contributes immeasurably to this film, as he does to everything he does, but this is decidedly an ensemble piece. Despite comments elsewhere that indicate a lack of understanding of literary craft, the non-linear delivery is classic noir and takes full advantage of a genre that lesser films have tried to mine without out success.

173,skullhead739,Not half as good as the reviews say,6,24 August 2020,"I want to start off by saying the postives.
the first half of the film is really interesting and goodthe characters and cast is amazingthe realization of the characters true selves is ironicly goodvery interesting and dramatic scenes at least in the first halfthe whole plot idea is uniqueNow for the negatives which ultimately makes this film not half as good as people say.
the 2nd half of the film is really badthe ending is given away half way through and you know that everything your watching is fake leaving little imagination or suspense towards the endthere is no twist and the plot seems to end way too quickly. Then there's 30 mins of the film where your just waiting for it to end because you already have expierenced the plot twist and its now anti climactic.the murders are hard to follow and are not very exciting at allthere's way too many ""convenient"" scenes that is caused by crappy writing. Oh the blonde girl opens the door and can only see the shadow of the murderer so nobody still knows who the killer is, pathetic.too many random things happen that were not foreshadowed at all and is just more lazy writing. Why did the car blow up randomly without any foreshadowing whatsoever?the ending isn't a twist and is really anti climactic and cheesy. All suspense is lost and with the typical last scene just leaves no satisfaction for the viewer at all.Summary:
The first half was really interesting and really promising. All to be let down by a really crappy ending and 2nd half. There's too much lazy writing, typical and cheesy scenes that make this a lowsy 6/10 for me. Not the type of movie that deserves this much praise.",Identity

It had everything to be the next THE SIXTH SENSE, or even THE RING for that matter. Problem is: it was released right before X2 and THE MATRIX RELOADED, not having the attention it deserved.I liked it for many reasons, but the less you know about the story, the better. The film editing is great (the early scenes, for instance), the characters are engaging (which is an important factor!) and the set is moody.

It's probably because few directors are capable of manufacturing them. Then again, maybe there aren't enough good scripts. Whatever the reason, James Mangold does an excellent job with ""Identity"". The cast alone is stellar! You have Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet (great in ""The Whole Nine Yards""), Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2), Clea Du Vall, Rebecca De Mornay (quite a surprise), and a few other familiar faces. All of these stars are cast into a motley bunch of characters that are held up in a local motel due to a rainstorm. The introductory scenes are cleverly tied together in a sequence of demonstrations of how one thing leads to another. The final destination for all of these encounters is the motel, which seems to resemble an island in the middle of nowhere. I can't tell you much more of this film without ruining it. I can say that a convict arrives in the custody of an officer. He escapes and one of the hotel guests ends up dead. Murder continues as another and yet another of the group is killed.The redeeming quality of this film and the main reason to watch it is in its portrayal of everything appearing as what it is, yet being something entirely different. The ending, what adding another shock, was too far-fetched for me. I felt the movie could have actually ended at an earlier point, but it would have changed the entire overall mood. Watch it and judge for yourself! 8/10",Identity

Ray Liotta plays a pushy cop transporting a prisoner.  Amanda Peet plays a hooker on her way to Florida to buy an orange grove in her hometown.  The rest of the cast is lesser knowns who all do decent work keeping the story going.

In fact i was thinking of turning the damn thing off but if you keep on watching , the film begins to pick up the pace and the plot becomes more diverse . This not the best thriller every but it contains its own original twist. The setting is perfect. An motel placed in the middle of nowhere. The director captures the atmosphere well with the constant raining and lightning adding more of an effect. Sure these two elements are always being used but there nothing wrong with that.The actors carry out there roles reasonable well. there no exceptional performance from anyone but you don't expect that from this type of film. Now for the twist, a lot of people struggle to understand it. Personally , it not all to complicated to follow. If you know about split personalities then the conclusion shouldn't be to hard to understand.Some negatives is that the ending is easily predictable. It doesn't keep you guessing but instead wondering if the whole plot ties together. Also there no artistic value to it. When you are told of what is really happening you will begin to wonder if the director could of added more depth to the world rather than basing it in another typical world .But still the film is enjoyable to watch and one which you'll be talking about after it finishes.

181,w00f,Psycho meets The Sixth Sense: I Don't See Dead People,6,27 April 2003,"""Identity"" has some solid performances by several fine actors, not the least of which are John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  The story and the plot have terrific potential.  It could have been a great movie, despite being a somewhat shameless rip-off of a short film made a couple of years ago that manages to tell the exact same story in about 20 minutes (sorry, I don't recall the name of the low-budget, black and white short that appeared as filler between features on the Sundance Channel).Unfortunately, this movie blows it BIG TIME at the end.  I don't want to give it all away, but this is one of those movies that would have been an excellent psychological thriller if the writer and/or director hadn't decided that it needed a big surprise ending.  They achieve this ending by suddenly splicing in a bunch of extra scenes at the very end that turn all of the build-up in the rest of the movie into nothing more than a bunch of red herrings.  The ending chosen opens up a bunch of huge holes in the story that can only be explained away by a variant of the old ""it was all just a dream"" cop-out ending.  Personally, I hate it when a film makes such a transition in a glaring, rough way that almost takes the viewer by the back of the neck, shakes him violently and screams in his face, ""No, look stupid, we fooled you!  Now look at all the things we didn't let you see during the rest of the film!  Thanks for your $8.00, schmuck.""  I suppose the film makers HAD to do this, though, since the movie's twist is otherwise given away halfway through the film, at which point the balance of the movie is utterly predictable to anyone who hasn't been watching it with a burlap sap tied over their head.  Clearly, desperate moves were called for in order to achieve a blockbuster ending. Did I say blockbuster?  Change that to ""lackluster.""This film could have raised a very interesting and original question about the nature of personality (and identity -- get it?), but instead, it lets itself be turned into ""Psycho"" meets ""The Sixth Sense.""  Instead of ""I see dead people,"" it turns into ""I don't see dead people.""Big deal.  It could've been a good one.

First off, the clues that they give as to who the actual killer identity is are broadcast loud and clear.  The story of how everybody gets to the hotel is kinda neat, and the little backgrounds that are given are sufficent, but my main complaint is that there are to many characters.  With too many characters, there is no real way to make any of these characters fully fleshed out and make us really care or hate them.  That combined with a weak cop out ending make this a film that you should see if you have nothing better to do.  Everything else is fine. On a side note, John Cusack tried to get out of the project 3/4 of the way into filming due to different people rewirting the ending.",Identity

Kudos must go to James Mangold for directing the all-star cast so tautly and keeping the movie so atmospheric. Its amazing how persistent rain adds to the hopelessness and depravity of the scene and as noted by ray liotta in the special features, john cusack was very lucky to have been somehow cast wearing a raincoat! I wouldn't dare leave a spoiler here as the what really makes the movie is the fantastic twist, trust me, you won't have any idea and you wouldn't guess it if you had a thousand attempts. What I loved about this movie was that there was such great chemistry between the actors, the tension was really palpable which is missing in so many modern movies.

Then it all fell apart.Once the surprise twist is revealed the audience is left with two emotions. One, we've been had. Everything we saw up until the reveal was meaningless. It was like changing the channel to another movie. The movie just rebooted and we've seen two minutes of relevant footage.The second emotion is ugh. We've seen this twist before. Too many times for it to surprise or thrill. It is effective exactly once, and if you're over the age of five it's too late for you.Worse, the twist doesn't hold up on a second viewing. There are multiple characters doing things in different parts of the motel at the same time. The writers apparently are unaware that human beings can only manage one point of view at time. Try it. You can't focus on two scenes at the same time. You can switch your focus back and forth, but that isn't what we're shown on screen. Fail.Ten stars for the first hour.

Identity purposely confuses and tricks one into thinking they're actually watching 2 separate movies at the same time, but, in reality they're not.It seems that these 2 flicks have been inexplicably spliced together. But the truth is it's just one tangled and intertwined story that, literally, takes reaching the end of the film before the logical side of things get ironed out. (Well, sort of) Identity's story is so convoluted and incoherent, at times, that if we were all schizos ourselves to begin with, then we might be able to appreciate this flick to its fullest.Identity's story revolves around 10 ""so-called"" strangers who, during a dark and violently stormy night, all end up congregating at some rundown, rinky-dink motel set out in No-Mans-Land in the middle of the Arizona Desert.Just like the movie Ten Little Indians the characters all start to get bumped off, one by one. Who's behind these brutal murders, and why this is happening, is a movie plot-twist that, I suppose, is intended to end all movie plot-twists. You judge for yourself and then tell me that Hollywood doesn't overplay mental-disorder, and such, to the point of being downright ridiculous far too often.The cast of Identity is headed by the talents of, none other than, Mr. Leave-It-To-Beaver, John Cusack, and Mr. Damage-Face, Ray Liotta.",Identity

191,brandon_lee420,Probably the best Thriller/Suspense film ever made!,10,24 May 2010,"Identity maybe the best thriller film of all time considering that it has all the elements and a unique substance that holds this film together and, simply, it just is a unique masterpiece by James Mangold. James Mangold is a visionary director who has made great films like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted but even though they maybe great, Identity easily tops that list in a flash. James Mangold uses a lot of twists and sometimes confusing puzzles to make you like this film and out of nowhere the puzzle will be answered with a new brilliant twist. Even though I give films ten stars, it still does not mean that they are perfect but with a film like this, it is a whole different case. Identity and a lot of other ten star films surely do come to be perfect. A few centimeters more and they will become my next best friend. Gosh, how could I have thought that this would be time wasting? How could I think that this will be crap? How could I think something bad about this? Answer = Stupidity. This film defines the ""Don't Judge a Movie By Its Cover"" tagline. Now to the acting and performances by the crew in this film. John Cusack is in his game with this film as he plays a likable ex-cop turned limo driver, who ends up in a motel that is in the middle of nowhere along with more people who, mysteriously, all have a connection to each other. His acting is what defines acting in a good way and when I mean that, I am f*king dead serious. Ray Liotta is also another performer to watch out for because he portrays someone who knows more than he is letting on. I love his scary, yet deadly secret. Liotta acts beautifully and convincingly all the way till we find more about him. Amanda Peet plays a prostitute who is heading for a place to start a new life specializing in growing oranges, who also, strangely, goes to the motel. Amanda is strong in this film and near flawless. Before I go on, you might be wondering that why are they all ending up in a motel. Answer = it is raining and the streets are flooded. Alfred Molina is unrecognizable as he plays Dr.Mallick and I didn't even know that he was performing in this film if it wasn't for the credits. Nevertheless, he still does a great job. The plot is greatly crafted and engaging from the first scene. The storytelling which is seen from all sides is quite clever and adds a little bit more depth to the whole film. The cinematography is outstanding and spooky because, since it's raining, with no where to go, you have no choice but to go to a motel where you are wondering who is going to die first. The rainy setting is the perfect setting for this psychological thriller. The atmosphere also has a clear sense of horror stuck to it, a perfect atmosphere for a film. This review is all positives but no negative. Erm......The film is too scary!! That is my only concern - thank you! I am ranting on too much about this film but that is hard to since I wanna tell you all about it and why you should watch it. One: Great acting. Two: Brilliant cinematography. Three: Great twists. Four: likable characters. Must Watch!!! I highly recommend this to anyone, children and adults alike since I am not a classification freak like some, but the only concern I have is that it has a confusing story that takes a lot of time to figure out but if you want to have a go at it.... please do.Strangers from all different walks of life: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager are caught up in a nasty rainstorm, stuck at a motel in desolate Nevada. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.Minor spoilers hereon: When you find out that they all have the same birthday and are named after a state or country, you are think WTF! but the ending tells you why this is what it is. The waiting to find out what happens is really annoying because with a film like this, storytelling has to be fast and clear at the same time. The story about the ""Indian Cemetery"" is a really scary mini-story that gives you something to think about. It is haunting as well. The ending was great and unexpected so you don't really know what is happening until PANG you are hit in the face with an unbelievable twist. The boy who, reportedly, dies is quite scary to think about. The funny thing is that, if you have watched the film, John Cusack is actually a fat, bald guy. For a reason I found that funny. My words are running out.....Damn!! The original score is great and adds a bit more creepiness to the film which will make you enjoy it way more. The uniqueness of this film is very rare and hard to find nowadays in film. The ""I met a man who wasn't there..."" poem is frightening and greatly written. The voice that says that adds a bit more effect to the hauntingness of it. Should definitely be on you ""Must Watch list!"" 10/10 - A Masterpiece! Bravo!""Over and out."" 24 March 2010.",Identity

When the mysterious killer reveals out to be a child of my age or even younger, that had always gotten me into an excitement. Watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was a proof of mine, saying ""-Look, I'm totally grown up, now. I don't afraid of Freddy any more. Huh huh!"" , to mum.Time's changed. Horror genre is strengthened by mindless mysteries and sentimentalism. This new type of horror can't make viewers laugh or have fun any more. If not getting any fun from a horror, why watching it? The plot is solely good for mystery; yet the director chose to make a horror/teen slasher, which happened to be a fallacious deduction. Directing and editing is totally awful. ""Identity"" is talented director James Mangold's worst movie. From 1995 to 2005, his first decade of industrial movie making experience had caught everybody's attention. The present time is 2009. His latest works ""Walk The Line"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"" scored success both on box-office and on film critics. I wish we won't see any disappointment from him any more.Reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""And There Were None""(1945), Hitchcock's Psycho and Kubrick's idea of mystery at Indian cemetery; there is no such thing as an original idea. The opening scene sparks off a traffic accident profits from each character's view of the accident. No one was guilty. Followed by coincidences 8 adult, 1 child and the runner of the motel got stuck in a deluge. The story telling was as good as 2004's best motion picture winner ""Crash"". Differently, they never tried to break free from their situation. Instead, they make each other fall into a calamity. After two more coincidences, we learned as a third coincidence that everyone shares the same birthday. 10 people, all of them, have born on the 10th of May. Then Amanda Peet tried to save the situation: ""This place used to be an Indian cemetery"".Even before the first half of the movie, it happened to become a comedy by a chain of disasters and coincidences. Thanks to Alan Silvestri, who has composed a good music score. Watching for the reason to learn what's going to happen at the end, has been the key factor that made viewers think this is better than an average movie. Quite frankly, it is not. Film editing is dreadful.1 out of 10 for editing. 8 out of 10 for acting. When you come to the end, you'll realize that it's not the movie you're watching any more. It's so easy that when a director puts all the different puzzles and mysteries altogether mixing them with some sentimentalism, and when at the end his leading actor says: ""Sorry, I am a paranoiac. I was only dreaming. Nothing really happened. Everything was just a dream.""",Identity

For that reason, I won't say too much more about it to avoid spoiling any parts of the movie. It's well acted, well directed, and a good story.

And then a final little twist about which of the personalities was the actual killer. Like anyone cares ...

This movie begins as a well-produced, taut, whodunit murder thriller with top, popular, well-known actors way better than the movie deserved, with the familiar body count countdown, as a fixed group of people in an isolated space, slowly die one by one, while we try to figure out who the killer or killers are.

Then the reveal comes at the end, and it cheats the whole thing saying ""yes, the plot events don't make sense, but it's not supposed to, and this is why.""Remember how let down you were when that emotionally draining dramatic plot ended up being a dream?",Identity

199,secragt,"Decent, but less than the sum of its parts",6,29 April 2003,"Blessed with an intriguing hook, escalating suspense and a game ensemble cast, IDENTITY is ultimately more style than substance. This is not to say it is not diverting and largely entertaining. It's just also a bit of a cop out. Coming on the heels of no less than five recent movies featuring the same modus operandi of the cagey or otherwise unreliable narrator / narrative (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, FIGHT CLUB, THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE and even CUBE 2), IDENTITY is probably the least successful of the group in logically / cleverly integrating the gimmick. Coming so late in this plot device's cycle, one would have hoped for more than mostly nonsensical pseudo-psychological mumbo jumbo. Still, this is not to say that the movie isn't an enjoyable ride. It just doesn't go very far after promising a much greater journey.SPOILERSLike too many X-Files episodes, the movie sets up a clever challenge and hook which the climax and conclusion is never able to satisfyingly explain or resolve. A movie which owes a tremendous debt to PSYCHO, IDENTITY ultimately suffers the same anti-climactic letdown inflicted on us by Hitchcock. PSCYHO's five minute pop psychological soapbox soliloquy on cross dressing by Simon Oakland is matched by IDENTITY's similarly laughable lip service dissertation by the defense psychologist on how the entire movie we've been watching is the schizophrenic delusions of a sybillic patient. This longwinded and patronizing lecture on split personalities is almost as dated as Leslie Nielsen's ""Monsters of the Id"" deus ex machina from FORBIDDEN PLANET.Much like FIGHT CLUB, another movie which relies heavily on the POV of an insane (in this case schizophrenic) protagonist, IDENTITY begins to lose steam just as it strains hardest to impress us with its twists. The problem is not that the story isn't ambitious. The problem is that the split personality twist is from out in left field and we are left bushwhacked, sidetracked and disappointed. It's a twist that we don't want to be true because it ruins the mystery that we hope will have a much better explanation.Obviously the creators give a lot of thought to structuring the reveal and choreograph individuals' locations at the time of each murder such that any number of red herrings and solid suspects are available. At first Busey seems a great suspect. Then the motel manager. Then Ray Liotta. Then ghosts from the ""Indian Burial Ground."" There is much to admire in the first half hour, where we meet the ten characters efficiently and unpredictably. We see in nicely non-linear fashion how each player's actions contribute to the others' arrival at the remote motel where they will all ultimately die.IDENTITY has plenty of jolts and some smartness. While it outsmarts itself at the end and gives in to a gimmicky finale, up to that point it is a divertingly creepy and intriguing road to nowhere.",Identity

There's lots of noise; lots of shouting and screaming. Occasional frantic action, violence and a few dead bodies. Confused looks.Basically it's 'Psycho' meets '10 Little Indians' but without the direction, acting or script of either. Most of the first half hour passes before there's any indication of what it's all about and even then it's not at all clear what's going on. After that, it's confused and confusing; the characters are one-dimensional and lifeless, and I couldn't have cared less about them.

204,mwendel,"Finally something different, if not new! (Possible Spoilers)",8,30 April 2003,"I highly recommend watching this movie.This move is a dark, eerie and stimulating roller coaster ride from start to finish, which continues to surprise until the final scene, two seconds before the credits roll.  What makes this movie different than any of the other movies of recent note, is that all the phenomenally acted characters in this movie only exist as the different personalities of a mass murderer - due to be executed in 24 hours.The portrayals of the different personalities and their extremely complimentary contrasts reinforce the amazing depth of the mass murder's multiple personality disorder.  The visualization of multiple personalities trying to co-exist within a single mind and body, indirectly, gives insight of how challenging it must be to treat such a disorder.  Moreover how a doctor can encounter any level of success when the personalities themselves all have independent wills to live and survive. At the same time this film, in a possibly unintended way, presents an interesting case for not executing a convicted criminal because he's mentally ill and makes an argument as to whether or not that is the right way to handle things in the very last scene of the movie.  If a discussion about the treatment of mentally ill criminals takes place, after watching this film, you might have to consider that as one possible motive behind this eerie movie.In a really long stretch, but a possible on, you can draw small similarities to Fight Club, but in this case there isn't just one alternate personality - there are several.  In addition the alternate personalities are more tangible, in terms of how you could see each of the different personalities existing in the real world.",Identity
205,cmovies-99674,IDENTITY was in exquisite film with so much detail and story. 10/10 recommend,9,11 August 2017,"PROS: This movie was such an amazing find. To start off, the way the characters interacted was unbelievably thought out and intricate. There wasn't a single actor that didn't do or say something without a purpose. The way everything was strung together, from character interaction to plot lines, was completely flawless. You were never bored and you were never directly given any answer. What I really like is when you are forced to think with the characters, not for them. It allows the watcher to become invested in the film. Not only was I invested for some of the film, but I was captivated by the whole film from beginning to end. There wasn't a single scene that dragged or didn't have a purpose. This includes the resolution which, if I might add, was the best ending to any movie I've seen in the past month. The last thing that I'll add was how spectacular the actors were. I loved the cast and the raw emotion that they showed. With such a large cast it's hard to find a good actor for each role, but IDENTITY did that.CONS: This con might not seem like a big deal, but it is very important to me. The trailer was very poorly put together. I pick which movies I watch based on trailers, and I almost didn't pick this one because of its poor editing and plot description. It's not important to everyone, but I review films from on screen to off screen, and the trailer is what sells, therefore I must review that too.www.chorror.com",Identity

There are many well-known actors in this movie and surprises at every turn.  Once the puzzle pieces start falling in place, I guarantee you will say ""Wow!"" because this movie is just a constant roller coaster that never ends. I highly suggest to anyone thinking of seeing this movie to watch it.  The movie is done in a good way where it makes you think, but you don't have to watch it 10 times to understand what happened.  In addition, the DVD has another version of the movie with an alternate ending.  I haven't check that out yet, but either way it is a treat.",Identity
207,boondocksaint20,"Effective and enjoyable thriller that unfortunately left me slightly disapointed, rather than satisfied towards the end",8,12 June 2003,"I will say that Identity, as a thriller, works.  It is one of the few horror films, like The Ring, to have come out recently that is unique, and ultimately terrifying at times.  As practically everyone has commented on, there is a wonderful ensemble cast in this picture, and practically every character is unique and entertaining to watch.  The film's atmosphere is very creepy and well done...definitely one of the film's assets is the constant rain storm and darkness outside.  The film is multilayered, like your favorite Tarantino outing, and is interwoven pretty good throughout most of the film.Now, if you read my one line summary, you saw that I said that it is also slightly disapointing, well, I'm getting to that.  The film does score marks on a bunch of plot twists, some of which were unpredictable, others were predictable in the sense that you knew something was off, but didn't know what.  I will also say that the use of the film's MANY red herrings really threw me off for a change...most movies I have seen that attempt to do this, fail miserably.  So, after hearing all of this, you'd think that this is areally good movie overall...don't get me wrong, it is definitely good, enjoyable, and exciting.  However, my disapointment comes from one of the plot twists towards the end.***MINOR SPOILERS (Don't worry, nothing major is given away)***
Though the film is multilayered, this is also one of its downfalls.  From the get go, we hear a recording of a psychiatrist talking to someone who has murdered 6 people in an apartment.  I won't say what, but what was said on the recording gives WAY too much away...this did not detract from my enjoying the first hour of the film, but I was disapointed in that I knew from the first few frames a little too much information about the killer. And, my BIGGEST complaint is the unraveling of the film's main plot twist a whole 20 minutes or so before the flim's ending...I won't say what it is, but once you see what it is, and ultimately, realize what is going on, you suddenly won't care at all for the safety of the remaining people at the motel, their fight to survive suddenly becomes a means to and end.  I'll admit, it was a good twist, but to me, it totally killed the suspense and mystery for the remainder of the film.  The rest of the film, though well done, however, I felt was disapointing after knowing exactly what 'Identity' means as the film's title, and the reality of the situation way too early on.  If the filmmakers hadn't revealed the premonition of one of the characters so early, it would have been a lot more suspenseful.  Then again, with the way the ending was written, perhaps that was the only way to have filmed it...at any rate, I will say that I liked the very very last twist at the end, it totally had me surprised...though not as shocked as I would have liked to be, considering my interest investment in the film had died 20 minutes earlier, it is still unexpected.***END OF MINOR SPOILERS***All in all, not a bad movie.  I'm not sure if it's one worthy of multiple viewings, but definitely one of the better horror movies of recent years. It has great acting, creepy atmosphere, and a good plot to keep it running...but don't let my disapointments turn you off from seeing it, as I've read on the message boards, people have reacted very differently to this movie.  That's my 2 cents.  8/10 stars.",Identity

The film starts off by introducing the characters, and then showing how they all got to the motel. The York's had a a family crisis, the limo driver was in an accident, the actress on her way to Hollywood for a small TV gig, the newly married couple with martial trouble, and the cop transporting a convict.These ten people have nothing in common, nothing except all there names are of places & they all have the same birthday.

212,muons,A top notch psycho-thriller,9,6 August 2018,"This is a film in which two seemingly unrelated stories run parallel. In one, we see an eleventh hour hearing where a psychiatrist tries to convince a judge to rescind a death penalty prior to the execution of a murderer. In the other, there are 11 people stranded in a highway motel in a stormy night and each one gets killed one after another in a mysterious and gory way. Considering the second story belongs to a very formulaic thriller which has been staged time and again, it would be naive to think that it makes up the core of the plot as the movie meanders along. There are enough number of twists and turns that will make your head spin. However, at the end you come to realize those twists are the essential elements of the plot and are not overly used as some viewers complain. There's also a very fine line between the annoying ""everything was a dream"" trick and psychoanalysis inside the murderer's mind. This causes polarized intelligent reviews that sway between love and hate. If you can see past ""the dream"" ploy you'll appreciate Identity as a well scripted, well directed and well acted movie which deserves the generally high marks it earns from the reviewers' ratings.",Identity
213,shannen-l-c,Phenomenal mind-bending thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat,9,25 February 2018,"This movie came recommended to me on Netflix spotlight since I watch so many thrillers/horrors, so I decided to give it a try and was blown away. You may think you know exactly what's going on and exactly what the movie is about, but you cannot predict the direction in which the story is headed until its revealed. First of all, I should point out that although 'Identity' is headed under the horror section on Netflix UK, it's definitely not a horror and although it's very suspenseful, the blood/gore is minimal and it's much more of a psychological thriller than anything else. So for any horror fans looking for a true horror, this may not be for you. However, if you're a fan of mind-bending psychological thrillers with a splash of the slasher sub-genre, this is perfect for you. 'Identity' is such a well thought out story that benefits from a talented cast, interesting characters and an intriguing story that is much more complex than it seems on first appearances. Unlike many other movies in the same genre, 'Identity' doesn't extend beyond its reach by throwing unnecessary twists and surprises that are illogical and irrelevant to the overall conclusion. Although the story is complex, every single piece of the puzzle fits together perfectly leaving no unanswered questions or lingering confusion. John Cusak is fantastic as the lead (no surprises there), but the entire cast is strong and give great performances. The characters themselves all had their own personalities and we were introduced to elements of their back-story which made them feel more distinctive as people instead of just a bunch of generic murder victims. The interactions between the characters are equally as strong and there's interesting dynamics that emerge between them immediately. Personally, I was a little confused as to how some of them seemed so familiar to each other so quickly, but just like everything else, it's all explained as the story progresses. I loved the way the twists were revealed because it was done at the perfect time and in a way whereby it was subtle and had you thinking for a few moments longer about what you were being told. But the second the dots connect it evokes an immediate response of awe and surprise. I also appreciated that the story still continued to develop further and progress at a steady pace after the reveal. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that is psychologically stimulating, clever and suspenseful and will have anybody that watches on the edge of their seat guessing what's going to happen next and who the big bad is. The best part is that very few people will figure it out by themselves, because it's THAT unexpected, yet when you know it you can't help but wonder how you didn't see it from the beginning.",Identity

It has an interesting enough concept, and midway through it really showed some promise after a certain something was revealed. However, anything in the film is soon tarnished by a laughably predictable Hollywood ending that most might not see coming because they won't think they'd even take it that far. I joked about how the movie would end while watching it, but was surprised I was right when it came. Should have known better. The plot twist itself, prior to the ending, could have made a decent movie and I'm sure the director thought he was making an intelligent film. But the way I see it, the twist makes it all too convenient for the plot holes and inconsistencies to exist without explanation anywhere in the story. Ray Liotta and John Cusack pull off some good performances, but no acting performance could make up for the story. For example, put Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and it still sucks. Wait, he's not an actor. Liotta should stick to crime drama and Cusack should stick with those quirky movies we all love to see him in. I can see why some people may be fooled into believing this is a good movie. A good movie is one that can be watched time and time again. ANY movie can keep you interested until the end, but that doesn't necessarily make it good. All you've got to do is confuse the audience all to hell so that there's no way they can tell what's going on until the end......but in this case, it kept me interested with many intentional distractions only to be let down. The movie lost several points just for the cop out ending alone.I am genuinely fascinated by this film's favorable rating. I'm feeling generous today. 5/10",Identity

Despite it not being tagged as a horror movie, it certainly takes on a lot of the horror-like cinematography once the action kicks in. Despite the acting being really bland, the characters feels believable as they talk and act realistically - except to obviously progress the plot. The pacing was rather good, with not much downtime from impactful events or dialogue. But it lacked the suspense completely... Potentially because it is too mysterious to even speculate what is behind the corner.The primary aspect that might be taken issue with is definitely the conclusion. It certainly undermined the joy of trying to figure out who the antagonist is, as it is rather unpredictable. But this served the movie much better than giving too many hints and ruin the conclusion. Furthermore, it becomes the most fulfilling moment of the movie - as a conclusion should be - but does so in a unique manner. It definitely could have been executed in a more thoughtful manner, with extended knowledge prior to the conclusion as a potential solution to make it a much more touching ending.",Identity

Well, five minutes in, I guessed it.  I'll be the first to admit that _Identity_ does have potential: a taut psychological thriller based on Christie's _Ten Little Indians_.  Sartre even makes a brief appearance, leading one to hope that this film could give us a meaty existential meditation on the meaning of identity as well a few good scares.Don't get your hopes up.  _Identity_ does all the work for you, requiring zero thought and even less of an attention span.  I actually found myself making the story more interesting as I watched.  The ending, which is supposed to be a plot twist (though I can't see how your average 12 year old couldn't see it coming a mile away, given the structure of the film) just falls flat and left me with an empty kind of ""Is that all?"" feeling.  I got the feeling that the writer thought he was being original.  Negative on that, sir: see _Lost Highway_, _Mullholland Drive_, and _Passion of Mind_ for better variations on the final twist.That said, most of the audience did not feel as I did about the film, instead chuckling with amazement as they crooed:""THAT person was the killer?  How wacky and original?""[insert sound of me slapping my forehead- HARD]With all of that in mind, the performances are all really good.  It's nice to see John Cusack getting work.  Ray Liotta does the same role he always does, so you can pretty much take it or leave it.  Alfred Molina once again changes himself completely and leave me wondering what his real accent actually is.The look and misé en scène of this film was fantastic.  Maybe next time we can have a story.So, the only way to really enjoy this film is to be too smart for your average Hollywood fare and too obtuse to see the point that the film is trying to make.

The fact that there are so many characters sort of dilutes the impact of any one of them and I like that. Why do we always have to have a lead star going up for the awards? However, Amanda Peet and Clea Duvall are more than a match for any of the male performers.James Mangold and Michael Cooney as director and writer respectively deserve a lot of credit for creating a tight script and delivering a tight screenplay.

It's also, I think, the fourteenth version of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"".      I like John Cusack a lot.  Now that he's getting maybe fortyish, his face is acquiring more maturity and his overall presentation more humanity and depth.  His scene where he tells the ""slut"" (Amanda Peet) his reason for leaving the police force is particularly compelling.  Miss Peet is also good as the ""screamer"", the unlucky girl caught in the swill of events, and Ray Liotta does his wacko cop routine to great effectiveness.

While listening to the director's comments on the DVD made me appreciate the film more I am going to review based on the feelings I had walking out of the theater.Identity Starts off with greatness and if you didn't watch the last chapter you would get a much better film. I understand what the writer and director were trying to do with the end but it took a high quality horror film and shot it in the foot. The film presents a interesting idea for a story that I will not give away for people who have not seen it. John Cusak has a really strong performance the kind that is brilliant in a way that never gets noticed. The cast is strong, with quite a few bigger named actors who seemed willing to be wet for weeks.The film is in a genre that the director refers to as single location horror. Panic room and phone booth are better recent films in the same vein. Classics include Rear window and Alien. The confined space provides a lot of the tension. Worth a watch.",Identity

I like any movie where I think I got figured out and I'm wrong. Multiple story lines continue and how they tie together make this a fun idea (if not a new bend on old ideas). I paid $1 on a Tuesday at a cheap theater and got my money's worth. Good rental. If your into creeping yourself out it's pretty good for that too. It can kind of get under your skin. 7/10,Identity

The acting in the first 2/3 of this movie. The set was great, the story was pretty good and the big reveal at the end is a great concept if nothing else, and as a big fan of John Cusack I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately that was only true for the first bit of this movie. I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but I must say 2 things. One, the big reveal that starts off the third act is a really good concept. Had it been done differently, I probably would have loved it, but really, it ruined the movie. Secondly, the reveal of the killer was again a great idea, but incredibly poorly executed. All potential, zero execution seven out of ten",Identity
232,jkbonner1,Very disappointing,3,17 May 2014,"The only thing that I can charitably say about this film is, thank god it isn't a comic book made into a movie. Although the acting is passable, the script is wooden. I found myself wondering why fine actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta would star in something like this, but I guess it was a job.Although the film's story line doesn't lack imagination, it is simply not believable. For me to explain why would be to reveal the ending. Like so many movies today, this one pushes the idea that ghosts and paranormal phenomena are real and that we should believe in them.If this film is a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock (as one commenter suggests), then all I can say is the makers pay him poor tribute. Hitchcock always grounded his films in unflinching realism. That is why he was a master. He relied only on human motivation and psychology to underpin the behavior of his characters. Nevertheless, he succeeded in chilling us to the bone without invoking the supernatural, preternatural, or any other beyond-the-natural. And the ending is total rubbish.I give it 3/10. And a 3 solely because John Cusack and Ray Liotta are in it.",Identity
233,G00fhunter,Wow Just Wow...,7,13 September 2021,This movie was pretty awesome and unique. The acting was awesome and the plot is very different from other movies. I really liked the motel setting and the cast was all recognizable actors. Very solid movie you should watch.7 out of 10.,Identity
234,silentcheesedude,"Great sequences, but predictable",7,13 October 2003,"When 10 strangers come together in a series of events in a rainy night at a hotel, they soon find they're being killed one by one, and one of them might be the killer. If they are to survive this ordeal, which doesn't seem likely, they will have to find out a secret that brought them together.Characters are interesting, and have great depth and appeal to them. John Cusack is good in everything he does. He still has that baby face, but as our main character, Ed, does the job at convincing us he is more then what we thought he was. Ray Liotta plays a cop, Rhodes, that seems to be the opposite of Ed. Where as Ed is cool and seems to have control, Rhodes is a loaded shotgun, angry and disorganized. Identity manages to grab you rather well in the beginning. It does a good try at attempting the Twilight Zone effect, and perhaps would have made a great 1 hour episode. But in the VERY beginning, there is a scene which almost ruined the movie for me. I won't tell you what it is, but if you pay close enough attention to it, and a few other elements, you'll figure out most of the movie long before it's over. I did. I caught every little thing the movie threw out, and although the pieces didn't make complete sense, by the time it got to the 'twist', I was underwhelmed. Identity has 2 twists. The last and final twist isn't as surprising as the first (and the first one was easy to figure out, remember? Of course you do, because you were paying attention.) Were it not for the predictability, this would have been a better flick. Perhaps you can enjoy the movie a little better if you don't analyze everything like I did.Still, if you like suspense movies, rent it. It's dark, and has a creepy feel to it, at the very least.6 out of 10",Identity
235,j-penkair,Story Rules,7,23 June 2015,"Sometimes I get so tired of those ""stream of consciousness"" films. In a better mood, I would be good enough to sit and listen calmly, as a professional and well-paid psychiatrist, absorbing all the emotional downpour and self-inflicting scars. Not all the time, though. So I really appreciate someone coming up with a good and well thought out film plot like this one. It is a pure story that carries all the weight. Even all the well-known and high-calibered actors are embarrassingly placed secondary or lower in certain cases. After the film, people would not be talking among themselves about Cusack, Liotta, Peet, Hawkes, or Vince, but the story and how it captures them. They would think and think about how they are completely deceived and tricked, and almost forget about other angles of the film. Serial murders in an isolated motel out there? No atmosphere is more typical and predictable. Then, it is not at all typical and predictable when the main actor, the story itself that is, unfolds. I saw this film a few years back and got the point, but not the delicateness of its presentation. Now, after some years and some film maturity, I notice. A film student would do himself or herself a big favor to watch this film several times to get the story and the way it is told. Some films are supposed to take us somewhere unfamiliar and yet believable. We the human beings are sometimes in need of an emotional makeover or an escapade, at least for an hour or a little longer. Too few of films today play that important role. Filmmakers use the filmmaking a little too much as a therapy for themselves and not always for the viewers. ""Identity"" is not even close to become a horror classic or a cult film, but it does what film lovers do: tell a good story without blinking.",Identity
236,MissCzarChasm,"Not Really Scary, Just Good",9,8 June 2003,"A+Every so often I like to go into films knowing very little about them. It's gratifying not hearing any news stories, or Internet rumors, or early reviews before you see a film because you can genuinely feel surprised by every passing minute of it. In the case of Identity, I only saw a trailer for it once in theatres and I saw various TV spots before its release, but other than that I knew nothing about the core of the story. I went in with no preconceived notions or opinions. For a change I was being a submissive film viewer.After the credits rolled (by the way I rarely stay until the end of the credits) I was so amazed and surprised by the film that I had just experienced. Identity is a highly original, beautifully constructed, and a mildly scary film that will (excuse my language) do a serious mind f*** on your brain. The less you know about Identity's plot, the better. This is the kind of film you need to go into knowing very little about. There are a few twists, plenty of scares, and also a very surprising ending that will have some people disappointed, or praising its creativity. I'm definitely in the latter on this one.Identity is also a masterpiece of atmosphere. Something that I think is the most important aspect of any movie in this genre. Whether it's Halloween, setting the scene for small town horror, or The Ring, drenching us in very dark and Gothic scenery, atmosphere is what makes or breaks a horror film. Thankfully Identity succeeds by creating an atmosphere that is truly frightening and visually impressive. The motel is a perfect setting for the proceedings that take place throughout the night.A nice ensemble cast rounds out Identity's many incredible attributes. John Cusack gives a very good performance as Ed. Cusack has always been good at playing the 'everyday normal guy' and he uses this to great effect here. It's a layered performance that offers some surprises throughout the picture.The other high profile performer is the always-reliable Ray Liotta as Rhodes. Liotta never seems to disappoint whenever he's performing, even in sub-par material. He's just as good as he usually is in this picture and he uses his sometimes-abrasive personality to its utmost potential.Amanda Peet gives her best performance to date as Paris. She has some nice moments where she's allowed sprinkle some comic relief throughout an otherwise dreary picture. However, when she's required to exhibit real fear, she is more than capable. She also shares some good scenes with Cusack during a few key moments in the film.Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott supply some youth and tenacity as Ginny and Lou. Duvall probably has the role typically called the 'scream queen role' in most horror films and she does well with what she's given. There were times that I could genuinely feel her fear. Scott is given less to do as Lou but he does have some good scenes with Duvall that requires a decent amount of emotion.John Hawkes and John C. McGinley are also adequate in supporting roles. Hawkes is given a fair share of the comedic lines and for the most part he plays the part well. McGinley fairs better as the husband who must tend for his injured wife and social inadequate stepson. If I felt sympathy for anyone the most, it was his character.Rebecca Demornay is given very little to do as the failed movie actress but there are some funny jokes made at her expense as one character asks her 'didn't you used to be that actress?' This is some clever commentary on Demornay's obviously fledgling career. The same can be said for Jake Busey as the convict, who is given little to do and seems out of place when paired with the more talented actors in the picture.What's important is the work these actors do when they're all together. This is very much an ensemble and they play off each other's fear. Their reactions to these situations make the picture all the more frightening.On the other end of the story, Alfred Molina brings a bit of substance to his role, despite have limited screen time as the psychiatrist and Pruitt Taylor Vance will shock, amaze, and terrify you as the murderer waiting for his execution. Vance's portrayal is very frightening, and an ultimately brilliant performance. Given the limited screen time he does a lot with the role.Identity is filled with secrets, surprises, and scares that will have moviegoers talking for quite some time. Much like The Ring it has the potential to have some word of mouth appeal. However, don't listen too much to what people have to say about it because it's best to experience this modern masterpiece of fear, knowing very little about it. I guarantee you will be surprised.",Identity
237,tvspace,a ludicrous thriller,4,26 April 2003,"Identity takes two or three of the most ludicrous plots you've never seen, twines them together in a ball of yarn, dips it all in a bucket of atmospheric goop and calls it a psychological thriller.Well, it is, quite literally, a psychological thriller, though its version of psychology is so far removed from real human mental activity that it leaves the unfolding of the drama seeming mechanical, arbitrary and yet predictable (in other words: written).The less said about the plot, the better, both in order to avoid inevitable spoilers, and because the story gets off to a contrived start, then meanders downhill into the realm of the silly.  Generally speaking, though, this is a film that plants itself proudly at the head of the Too-Clever-by-Half crowd. Along with Memento, The Sixth Sense, and other assorted half-baked postmodern thrillers of the past 5 years, it makes the fatal error of thinking that the secret to a good thriller is to outsmart the audience. While it fails to accomplish even that lamentable goal (except in flashes where it works by confusion and obfuscation), it does, like those other films, demonstrate that the tactic does not a great movie make.
The film does manage to sustain a kind of jumpy nervousness that has to count as some kind of accomplishment compared to, say, the boredom that overtakes one midway through The Sixth Sense, but it is in its insistence on sustaining that feeling through every homogenously gloomy, rainsoaked scene of the film that the director reveals how little he understands the genre...how little modern Hollywood understands, in fact, the genre. Hitchcock demonstrated over 40 years ago that the magic ingredient to the great thriller was the seemingly banal patina of modern life from which the director would manage to extract one unexpected horror after another (whether Norman Bates' mother or the Birds of Bodega Bay).  Identity lacks even a single scene that could be said to reside in that everyday world. Every scene is filmed like a climax, with dripping gutters, howling winds, distraught heroes, and the flinty scrapes of knives slipping in between ribs.  It takes the insistent, homogenous aesthetic of a television commercial and plays it out for two hours.  All that's missing is Catherine Zeta-Jones showing up with a working T-mobile cell phone at key moments in the plot and you'd have a heck of a marketing blitz.  I'm not convinced, however, that this is why we go to the movies, when we go to the movies.",Identity

It had two very good leads, Ray Liotta and John Cusack, but these talented actors were given a basic, wooden script. This movie basically sees characters die one by one in gruesome fashion, and each time they have a key with a room number tag attached. It goes in countdown form (first victim has room 10, second has room 9, etc.). Later on, the only ambitious twist of the movie occurs, and basically tears all emotional attachment to characters away - that's if you can ignore the wooden script and be attached to said characters.

242,Lt_Coffey_182,An example of how films should be,8,26 December 2005,"Identity is a very unique film that impressed me very much when I first saw it and every time I've seen it since. The story is fascinating as it is so full of suspense and it really gets your adrenal glands in overdrive. After this immense build up, the film shatters the audience's sense of reality with an incredibly clever and unpredictable twist that must surely be on a par with Memento. This is an excellent example of what is meant by on screen magic and in retrospect; it's very surprising that this film is not even more famous.What helps to unfold the plot so magnificently is the characters. Almost every character involved has a crucial part to play and it seems that every actor was casted perfectly for their roles, most notably John Cusack and Ray Liotta. Cusack's character is probably the most demanding as he is the only character who discovers the twist except for the audience and Cusack's total shock is very convincing as it was a almost a mirror image to my reaction. One of the more enjoyable roles was Jake Busey's role as the convicted killer. Busey has definitely been typecast with more psychotic roles but in Identity, he shows us that's not such a bad thing. Amanda Peet is definitely worth a mention and is most responsible for garnering the audience's emotions. One of the best and most effective ensembles there's been in years.The direction is outstanding. The audience is manipulated to wherever James Mangold wishes and I can speak from experience; it's one hell of a journey. Mangold shows Identity as a Jigsaw puzzle where every character has their journey to the hotel explained throughout the film via flashbacks and the mainly off screen violence ensures that everything is kept a mystery until the last minute. The constant recital of a poem throughout the film provides added mystery and atmosphere, making Identity very intense. The fact that almost the whole film is set in this one hotel gives a very claustrophobic feel which is always effective in a Thriller. Mangold definitely read the 'How to Make a Good Thriller' Manual when making this film! With all the ingredients of a good film firmly in place and a very clever plot, Identity proves a very memorable film that is definitely at the height of the genre and will hopefully have a longer shelf life than all the recent blockbusters.",Identity

Everyone has some little secret that is slowly brought out to the viewer, and everyone also has a reason to kill one or more of the others. Each time a secret was revealed I'd think ""Well, that's it - he's the killer!"" (or ""She's the killer!"") until I'd labeled just about everyone that way. I even considered the ""least likely suspect"" as the killer just so I wouldn't be hoodwinked by the plot, and wouldn't you know it - each ""Least likely suspect"" starts dying off as well. It rains throughout this movie so much that the rain itself becomes a character to consider as the suspect.

As they get to know each other, they start dying. It's mainly up to John Cusack's chauffeur to sort things out and try and save the day.The first part of the film is told in a series of flashbacks, showing how each of the ten arrives at the motel. This part is quite interesting, but by the time everyone arrives and the stage is set, the film slows down to a standard murder mystery, however the characters are engaging enough due to good performances, with John Cusack and Ray Liotta as the main star power, to hold you attention and keep you intrigued. The film gradually gets more bizarre as it becomes seemingly impossible for the characters to escape. When they run off in one direction, they always end up back at the motel. The strangeness is no bad thing at this point, until the films goes completely over the top with the ridiculous ending. I won't say what it is, and you probably won't see it coming, but it left me disappointed and with a feeling that it was a waste of time rooting for any of the characters.

247,vocklabruck,Great thriller!!!,7,22 December 2006,"I watched this movie and I really enjoyed. I found myself surprised how good it was. Since there are a couple twists near the end you feel desperately the need to watch it again to see the situation from the new point of view, and keep enjoying. Warning. If you watch it once again it may be weak the second time because of some ""plot holes"" if you want to call it that way.---MAJOR SPOILERS ---The movie works because it claims to be about 10 people who meet in a motel forced by a storm. Then these people are front a killer in disguise, one of them is the killer and you keep wondering who. Near the end the first twist shows you that these 10 people and the motel never existed because they are all in the mind of a convict who suffers a multiple personality syndrome and each person is a different personality of his. When you find this truth all the situation in the motel shocked you because you know it is not real, but you do not care because actually this happens very near the end. This is handled greatly, some minutes later there is another twist that is great too! I have to say the finale is PERFECT because this convict hates whores because his mom was a whore and she abandoned him, so the whore must be killed too, but I would have really liked to see the fat guy with some peace of mind and with the girl in the orange grove living her second chance. So I would have liked the finale being just the blending when the girl sings the song.I rented this movie in DVD so I could watch it again knowing the truth. Why did I say the second time it may be weak? Because when you know the killer is the little boy you find strange that he was able to do all the murders and here is where you see the ""plot holes"": There is a storm out there, but the boy murders people and keeps his clothes always dry. Also he has the strength to confront adult people and kill them? Well, he did not kill everyone, but almost. Anyway this ""plot holes"" are not real plot holes, because you know this all happens inside the convict mind so everything is possible.What is a real plot hole is at the finale, when the doctor opens the cage door while the fat guy is struggling himself. Careless move from a doctor! And also why the fat guy killed his doctor? OK, in his mind it was the whore, but during all the dream there were murders at the motel and he did not kill anyone at the office! Maybe just because he was tied?What I did not like in this movie is that I found many homage to many other horror movies Psycho, Seven and I Know What You Did Last Summer among others. I laughed when the Amanda Peet characters cries through the window ""I give up! What the hell do you want, you sick bastard?"" I was expecting she spinning and shouting ""What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?"" from I Know What You Did Last Summer satirized by Scary Movie.All in all, as I said I liked this movie a lot. And for the people who thinks it is impossible for the child to kill the others, again, it is all in the fat guy's mind, so everything is possible there, and that is why sometimes you see the motel a mile far and suddenly you are right at the motel. It is impossible to walk a mile in a second. Right? But everything is possible in the mind.",Identity
248,compi24,"Review Of ""Identity""",6,2 January 2012,"""Identity"" is a 2003 James Mangold Directed film about 10 strangers who meet at a seedy Nevada motel and soon realize that they are being killed off one by one. Let me start off by saying that I love a good thriller. If you have an intriguing premise and a good touch of tasteful twists here and there, I'll ultimately find the movie to be, to some degree, good. ""Identity"" definitely possessed the former, but tricked me with the latter. From the moment this movie starts you are almost immediately pulled into it's fascinating plot. And as the movie goes on, twists ensue, leading you to reconsider every view of every character in the film. However, the last twist of this film, in short, angered me. I found the final twist of the film to make sense, but it was the most unsatisfying ending I could have imagined this film to present. The film presented an incredibly new type of plot for me and in my opinion fudged up the ending a bit. However, every minute up to the last 5 were pretty thrilling and intense. All of the actors did a good job in their roles and their lines were fairly well written. The direction by Mangold is really quite beautiful - he really creates some unsettling imagery here. Overall, I can say that ""Identity"" was a enjoyable movie. . .up until the end.",Identity

The film had a great amount of potential but the way the film was handled is what made it fail. The first act was a bit interesting in the way all these people ended up on a motel in a rainy day. The second act was esoteric and that's what I liked about it. I liked how clever all the murders were and trying to figure out who is committing them all. Then the film goes down hill from there.We come to discover that the whole movie is a fantasy of a mental patient who has many split personalities and has committed several crimes and a psychiatrist is trying to prevent him from being send to death row.
All that is fine and interesting but everything just seems to get more and more stupider from there on. I had suspected the kid to be the killer when I noticed a resemblance between Malcolm and Tim and when they showed Tim's name in Malcolm's journal. But I honestly didn't think the director would take us in that direction. Especially since Ray Liotta made an interesting villain.Like I stated earlier the movie had potential but the story itself was not polished properly and the convict getting murdered by having a bat down his throat was a bit too humorous.

It does not fail till you find out it all taking place inside a social pathetic killers head, all the ""people"" are his split persona's forced to meet and fight for dominance. Roy Loita is the prime suspect as the person that is the killer, alas why he is the killer/criminal in the guys head, but it is wow the innocent little kid who faked his death to go unnoticed until he could kill off the rest and escape to kill in the real world. I truly thought this would have been a much better movie then it was. It was a complete and total disappointment, save your self some time and money and skip this at the video store..",Identity

Great actors, especially Cusak and Liotta, great horror-thriller atmosphere: heavy rain, night, scary motel in middle of nowhere, homicides... well, I was very enjoying this. Idea of movie is obviously taken from Agatha Christy's novel 'Ten little Indians' and that was fine with me. Ten mysteriously connected strangers caught up in a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere with scary motel owner. And then one by one, ten strangers are being murdered. Brrrr! Who is the killer? How are those people connected? Then, circa 40 minutes into the movie, there's strange plot twist happening. And spoils everything. Since that moment, I don't care about people in motel, because I know they do not really exist. I know who is a killer (at this moment it's pretty much obvious). I don't care about rest of the movie. It's just not interesting anymore. I even feel cheated. The end is just stupid. We discover who the killer is and we knew that already since we saw the plot 40 min into the movie. I could predict exactly what will happen and it spoiled second half of the movie. Then comes end. Stupid. Why did they let dangerous killer drive without any real security?

As a law student it reminds me of the physical and mental capacity to commit crime and this idea is mastered at a top-notch level, and the reality layer and the imaginary layer work really well together between each other. Of course the exuberant way to project the mental state of the murderer into the evil kid instead of the policeman is superb and totally unexpected (at least to me)!

Also I don't really know what the movie want to say......But I have to admit that I was tricked, as I failed to find out the real killer. I even didn't suspect the little boy. Although I was quite sure that all the guys getting together in the motel are the criminal's identities, I forget the boy, I didn't count it in. I don't know how the doctor treated him, he surprisingly makes the 10 identities together and makes them kill each other until one left.I think Rivers loves acting too much so that he puts himself into his role play too deep, I'm sure he can win an award maybe in Hollywood, but for the best director, impossible as the story is too weak, even weaker than the American scary stories.Fine get go, a quick conclusion: just so so.",Identity

Yes, you'll have the lingering suspicion you've see this all before and you probably have in films like April Fools and about a dozen others. The ""surprise"" ending in this film is to put it bluntly, horrid. First, it's not a much of a surprise, since I figured it out in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Second, its VERY disappointing and seems more like a trick to get the screenwriters out of several plotholes they'd dug themselves into rather than attempt at making a good script. Third, the surprise happens 20 minutes from the end so it pretty much ruins the suspense, then the film drags on. In all fairness, this movie is well-acted and has great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters apparently ran out of ideas (ie: lost their Cliff Notes of 10 Little Indians)at the end. A very disappointing finish to what starts as a quite good movie. Despite the cheap trick ending to wrap things up, by the end of the film one is left with more plotholes than answers and a lingering sense of disappointment. Plot completely derails to the point enjoyment is easily cut in half. Predictable film and an awfully scripted ending make this film not recommended.",Identity

This in not so much your typical slasher movie than a well made psychological thriller which has obviously been inspired by Agathe Christies novel 'Ten little Niggers'(which was changed to 'Ten little Indians' for the big screen adaptation by those of a more politically correct nature).Not only that but there is also a hint that director James Mangold was also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock.The movies hotel is a grim reminder of one of his finest movies which was the infamous 'Psycho'. The movies premise although strange (you'll understand what I mean when you see the movie) is by no means fairly original.Even it does rip of Christie and Hitchcock's work a fair bit.A good edge of your seat script from screen scribe Michael Cooney and smooth direction from Mangold certainly don't hurt the movie.They're aided by  great performances from a good cast that includes John Cusack,Ray Liotta,Amanda Peet(The Whole Nine Yards),Alfred Molina(Maverick) and 'Scrubs' own John C.McGinley in a more geeky roll.
 Sadly however the movies title is a bit of a give away and didn't make the task of working out one of the movies plot twists very hard.The fact as well that all ten people are somehow linked made part of the outcome a bit obvious.That said however the second twist does take you by surprise and would certainly demand a second viewing just so you could get all those clues that you missed the first time around. The end result is an above average thriller that is not with out it's faults.Let's be honest.There's been far worse thriller's than this that have been made in the past.You need only look at the likes of the dull 'Primal Fear' and the predictable,lame dud that was 'Sliver'.Trust me if you want a good nights entertainment I would suggest this.It's not perfect but you won't be totally disappointed.Robs Rating: * * * *",Identity

269,cosmicfish14,"Forgettable Film, Memorable Twist",4,17 November 2015,"Identity was one of those movies I had to re-watch before doing the review just to remember what happened, and I watched the movie a month ago. So, to say the least, this movie was pretty forgettable. Since this a horror film I guess I should talk about the ""horror."" Its not all that interesting, its just a bunch of jump scares and not much else. They have some scenes that actually a lot funnier than they should be, just because of how lazily the horror is executed.Another thing about this movie is that it has another horror film trope . dumb, cliché and hate-able characters. There wasn't a single character that I remember saying ""Oh that was a well written and developed character"" or ""Oh, that was an interesting character, I hope they don't die by the end."" Speaking of clichés, the movie follows the ancient early 2000′s film cliché of having a weird green color palette, because The Matrix did it and everyone liked it then so why not reuse it over and over again.Finally, I want to talk about the twist ending of the film, so if you haven't seen the film you probably won't understand what I'm talking about after this. I feel the twist ending was really forced in, and I think at first it was interesting, but as I was thinking about I realized that this is the type of twist ending M. Night Shyamalan would do. Also, now that I think about it, the title of the movie subtly spoils the twist ending. If the twist wasn't in the movie what would you call it then? ""Everyone Dies At The Hotel""Anyways, Identity was pretty forgettable in a lot of ways, but the twist was pretty memorable, if for the wrong reasons.Final Score: 4.5/10",Identity

272,alishahmohd,The last act ruins what could have been a good film.,4,3 August 2014,"The Identity had a a lot of good things going for it and before I watched it I expected a good suspense/thriller film. First of all John Cusack was in this film and he always puts on good performances in the roles that he is given, he carried the above average horror flick 1408, and made it so much more entertaining and fun to watch with his enthusiastic performance. Identity had John Cusack and also had a large cast of other actors many of which I did not know of. But the basic plot at the premise of the whole film was very appealing. I was expecting something good in the very least. Movie was going in the right direction, not only Cusack but rest of the cast performed well, and the settings and environments seemed appealing and the film was only getting better by the minute, until the last 1/4 portion of the movie where the big twist was revealed.Now don't get me wrong twists are not bad, sometimes they up the status of the film and may make you come back for a second viewing, leave you shocked and leave room for interpretations. Another psychological horror/thriller Sixth Sense had a great twist; another suspense/thriller film like Usual Suspects had a great twist. The Others a horror film also had a great twist. But this film goes with the terrible it was all a dream concept which ruins all the interesting characters this film was trying to make us care about throughout most of the it. This Dream concept can work if executed right but here this concept ruins everything. We come to the realization that it all in the head of a mentally unstable serial killer who has multiple personalities in his brain, each of which is portrayed by the characters in the movie, the serial killer personality is the killing off the other characters (personalities) which represent something good in the killer or a softer side to him.I don't see this as an intelligent concept because it's premise is flawed from the start, personalities co-exist in the brain they don't try to kill each other off as portrayed in the movie, neither they are numbered in a specific order as portrayed in the movie. I thought the film was heading somewhere interesting when we found out all characters had the same birth date and had last names of countries or cities, but apparently all this was to present them as a personality in a psychopath's head. Plus it's laughable who turns out to be the killer/evil personality at the end. We do agree to suspend our disbelief to a point when watching film but this is just unbelievable, I guess they just wanted to SHOCK us by revealing the kid as the killer, they decided to make the whole scenario take place in a psychopath's head to pass off the possibility of the kid as a killer just to SHOCK us. I wrote off the kid as a suspect the second I saw him just like anyone would, because which movie is ridiculous enough to portray a little child as a Serial Killer? I don't see how is this intelligent in anyway, it is nonsensical, ruins the characters and ruins the suspense the movie had. Why should we care Cusack's character left his police job, why should we care about the Detective being a prisoner disguised as a cop, why care about the problems the couple was having , why care about that women's condition after the car accident. Why should we care about a psychopath guy who appears for like 5 minutes in the movie and what happens in his head and why should we care about what is happening in the head of a serial killer in the first place. Why care about anything at all. This twist ruins the whole thing and reveals that caring about anything related to the backstory of the characters is pointless and is not real and represents something in the psychopath's head.Overall, Identity had a good basic premise, good performances and a good setting , and was only getting better but it will all ruined by the film's twist, which ruins everything this film established in its first half.

It's not some movie where rebellious teenagers run around in their underwear having sex and being hunted down. This movie instead relied on very well developed characters, characters that many people could identify with.

278,openeyes,Welcome to the Twist-A-Rama,8,23 February 2004,"When the defense attorneys for serial killer Malcolm Rivers discover that the prosecution suppressed evidence pointing to the man's insanity, a midnight hearing is held with a judge the night before his intended execution to consider the implications.  Meanwhile, a group of strangers stranded by a storm at a desert motel find themselves being killed off one-by-one.  The strangers slowly begin to realize that they aren't their by coincidence.  They all have a common link....Director James Mangold starts the film off promisingly with atmosphere and tension galore.  Still, with the exception of the Malcolm Rivers angle, we are essentially being served up a warmed-over version of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None.""  It is a true credit to that creaky old warhorse that the story hums along so effectively for so long.  Credit should also go to the excellent cast headed by John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  I found myself quickly drawn into the mystery, and I would be singing the praises if it weren't for the above-mentioned Malcolm Rivers angle.SPOILER...Thinking the audience would be bored with a simple Christie rehash, Mangold and company felt the need to give us a twist.  A big twist.  It turns out the characters at the motel are the multiple personalities in Rivers' head. They are being eliminated one by one as a single personality tries to take complete control.  Meanwhile, at the hearing, Rivers' psychiatrist tries to guide the process so that a benign, safe personality ultimately survives.Okay, okay.  It was a interesting twist.  Clever, in fact.  Not as good as the one in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but certainly better than the inane one in ""Fight Club.""  Unfortunately, it was also completely wrong-headed.  I felt cheated.  I had spent over an hour making an emotional investment into the characters at the motel only to discover they weren't real.  After they revealed the twist, I no longer cared about the Cusack and company when we returned to the hotel.  What was the point?  They were just a fiction. 
Of course, the irony of my reaction was not lost on me.   All of the characters I ever cared about in movies were either wholly fictional or fictional depictions of real characters.  So why did it bother me here? Because the film makers had to nerve to show me the man behind the curtain. They robbed me of the hard-won illusion that what is happening on the screen was real.  That it mattered.  They stole away the magic, and I like my magic.Some things are more important than being clever.",Identity

I believe that this perceived ""multiplicity"" was performed on purpose, to keep the audience off balance.The first time you see ""Identity"" you may be confused, even after the credits roll.

The style of this film reminds me of ""Memento"" and ""The Game"" in that it took multiple viewings for me to fully appreciate it.  I also saw shades of ""12 Monkeys"", but I don't want to go into any spoilers...John Cusack is fabulous as the burned-out former cop turned limo driver. Ray Liotta turns in a stunning performace as well, as indeed do all of the major actors.  The editing style is intriguing, never leaving you bored for a moment, and the partially non-linear timeline captures one's attention.To say any more may ruin the movie for those of you yet to see it.

We don't look for depth, or for an answer to the human condition.  We want to be scared and we want to be surprised.  And this movie accomplished both.  A great cast of character actors helps--especially the criminally underrated Amanda Peet, who has been the best reason to see many bad movies in the past.  She is always worth watching, and her tired, retiring hooker here nicely avoids the whole gamut of movie-hooker cliches.  How nice that she can show tenderness and compassion to the other characters without being saddled with the proverbial heart o' gold.  Fun movie.  If the preview hadn't spoiled it for me, I'd like it even more.",Identity

I read a bit of the description and it made me think it was a slasher. I went ahead and watched and it was something else.

288,Dave-330,Where is Donald Kaufman's credit?,2,17 September 2003,"Wow, some movies are difficult to describe, others are a lot easier, and this falls into the second category.  I rented ""Adaptation"" the last time I went to the video store and I did not like that movie much either, because it was overly slow, but there is one part that makes me laugh:  Donald Kaufman creates a script where the kidnapper, the cop and the kidnappee are all actually the same person... SPOILERS BEGIN... this is that movie. Charles Kaufman was making an overly critical statement of what has come to be considered a good film, and this movie actually uses a script mirroring the over-the-top script used in ""Adaptation"".  It is scary that a movie like this gets made in the first place.  The problems I have are from the start. First it is clearly Cusack's voice on the phone with Molina's character explaining the past.  It is clear that Molina supposedly started the ""cure"" on the phone with him, because how does the movie start without it, and if that is the case, why would you ""cure"" someone over the phone without having him properly watched in case something went wrong?  Why does Molina's character not know which identity killed the people as a child, especially if one of those involved is a child?  Did the child never come out and talk to Molina's character?  Then how did that identity get invited to the motel? END SPOILERI will throw the non-spoiler positives in the middle, between the criticisms.  The cinematography and acting were pretty good.  I am usually quite hard on Cusack, but he gave a good performance and wasn't overly ""cute"" in the way that makes me want to shut off his movies.  This is his best performance since The Grifters and I enjoyed it.Amanda Peet looks like a hooker, but that is what she was supposed to be and she too had a good performance.  Of course, she always looks good (even as a hooker) which doesn't hurt.Jake Busey should had been used more instead of playing ""The Frighteners"" role again.  He is scary, but deserved more screen time instead of being just thrown into the story with little backstory.The rest of the ensemble was fine, nothing great, but still over-achieving the script.MORE SPOILERS  Now the Liotta turn was so obvious from when he tried to call an ambulance, it just was clear he wasn't a cop.  The scene where Cusack looks in the mirror was the best scene in the entire picture BUT let you too far into what was happening and then you stop caring about which characters survive because it doesn't matter anyway, because they are not real.  The kid being the killer was VERY obvious when the mother dies, because the kid goes in to see her alone and go figure, she's dead.  Having the kid die together with someone else was too obvious, ""Gee the m.o. of the killer is to kill one at a time, and leave a key card for each, do you think anyone will notice when we conveniently give ourselves an out by 'killing' two characters at once?  No of course not, we will have the bodies disappear, at that point and then let everyone know they are watching the thoughts of a serial killer and make no more references to the pesky keys until the end, plus we can 'shock' everyone by having the kid come back in the end because the audience will be too into the 'orange-growing feel good story of an obese man, believing himself to be a really hot woman' to notice.""  If you listen really closely, you can hear Charles Kaufman screaming at how awful the plot really sounds.  END SPOILERS.I rate this movie the following way: 1 for the Cusack performance, 1 for Amanda Peet and 1 for Jake Busey, but -1 for obviousness of the plot curves and lack of creativity which gives it a 2 out of 10.",Identity
289,meghal,Leaves you dissatisfied and cheated,7,30 April 2003,"When I first read about ""Identity"" on IMDB, and watched the trailer in theatre, I thought it might be a really good movie. The synopsis made me remember the 60's Bollywood movie ""Gumnaam"". ""Gumnaam"" had same plot of 10 people being stranded in Island, and getting killed one after another. It was a real good movie with some excellent music by Shankar JaikishanSo the synopsis of ""Identity"" felt more like a ""remake"" of ""Gumnaam"". I was thrilled by the thought of seeing a good suspense movie after a long time. And true, the first hour of movie is worth watching for the goosepimples and chills it gives time to time. However, when the curtain is lifted from the suspense, you feel very cheated and angry.I think Hollywood is churning a seris of psycho-supernatural thrillers . ""Sixth Sense"" started a trend. Then came ""Unbreakable"", ""The Others"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Minority Report"", ""Beautiful Mind"" - to name a few. ""Identity"" is a movie that tries to fit itself in this category, but fails miserably. I should have given 6.5/10 rating, but no decimals allowed.",Identity
290,bzb2001,A clichéd but fun classic whodunit,6,5 January 2005,"James Mangold's 'Identity' is a film so wrapped up in tricking you it bypasses its story in the process. The picture tells two stories breaking between throughout. The primary tale is one of murderous chance. During a torrential rainstorm several people find themselves caught at a motel unable to go in either direction on the highway because of floods. All of a sudden people begin dying gruesome deaths.The secondary plot has a convicted killer's lawyer meeting with a judge and prosecutors to determine a new fate for his clearly mentally ill client. This story is smaller and less engaging as the one set at the motel. However, with both stories you feel you are on a ride that will end with a twist. So sure are you that when the twists come, they are surprising but not as thrilling since you spent over an hour knowing it was coming.In the end I decided the good outweighed the bad ... slightly. Most of 'Identity' has an old fashioned whodunit aspect that you can't help but love. The ending is iffy and although the story hooks you, there are so many clichéd plot points that your head shaking and eye-rolling stands in the way of enjoying an all together decent film.I have found myself watching the meat of it several times, addicted by the intrigue even though I know what is to happen. There is fine acting by John Cusack, Amanda Peet, John C. McGinley, and others. The direction is also quite skillful and leaves you right on the edge of your seat when need be. There are many who will love this film for its cleverness. Others will find that it is too cunning for its own good. **.5 out of ****",Identity
291,alannasser,a fraud from head to toe,2,8 July 2013,"Identity is a shaggy dog movie. You have seen a few other movies of this kind. The writer and the director convince themselves that their twist is so very clever, conceptually mind-bending and original that the viewer will be bowled over by the big revelation. The most extreme and offensive form this can take -it is not the form taken in this movie- is the discovery that ""it was all a dream."" That is, what you were looking at for 1.5 hours never happened. Cheap and disgraceful. Identity has a tad more integrity than that, but not much more. You eventually learn that, as the New York Times reviewer put it, ""the movie you were seeing is not the movie you were seeing."" You are set up with what appears to be a complexly plotted thriller/whodunit/horror movie. There are a number of sharply defined characters; each has a special story to tell; it turns out that they are all related in some way. They get killed off one by one - most of them anyway. You are drawn in by the way the film is shot and cut. It's very professional, and the thing moves along very nicely - no fat, no wasted footage. You look forward to a satisfying resolution, something along the lines of the original Ten Little Indians, which is referenced by one of the characters. Your expectations will be in vain. None of the relationships and plot developments are relevant to what you have been led to expect. The twist is a tribute to the writer-director's laziness. The movie isn't the one you thought you were watching. It wasn't all a dream, but it might as well have been. Junk on stilts. - If you must watch this movie, do not watch the trailer, which contains a major spoiler.",Identity
292,Nixonbrian42,"A high voltage film with, sadly, a few low points",8,29 January 2013,"I just seen this yesterday and I HONESTLY thought it was dynamite but I also felt they should have given it a few extra touch ups. The performances by most of the cast was sizzling with a particularly unexpected chemistry between John Cusack and Ray Liotta that seemed to ignite the screenplay with gun powder. They should do more films together. I am not really that big of a fan of Cusack but this was an exception. The movie is directed with precision, lensed with some superb cinematography and very cleverly edited. If you haven't seen it yet and you enjoy films that take you for a ride then it's a good bet that this will be rewarding.The only real negative details; this is a spoiler: Pruitt Taylor Vince I felt was strangely miscast. They should have concentrated more on the casting of his character because he simply doesn't fit in with everyone else. He's a decent actor but here he does not belong. You're relatively electrified for the first three quarters going full speed, and then comes Pruitt and the whole film suddenly drops to a lower gear. I'm not referring to the plot twist which involves Pruitt, I thought that was razor sharp, I mean the choice of casting him for that part ruined the final impact. Kind of mirroring my thoughts of Apocalypse Now. It was outstanding, until Brando emerged.I wasn't impressed with Amanda Peet either mainly because I don't think she's that seasoned of an actress.Some plot holes and casting issues exhibited what clearly could have been a small masterpiece. Still, absolutely worth seeing.",Identity

296,ChRiS-803,A throwback to the good old days of thrillers,9,6 August 2003,"I have always been a sucker for a good thriller, a film that keeps you guessing, throws in red herrings, steers you in the wrong direction and gives you an ending you just didn't see coming. Identity' may seem like a standard old slasher thriller and ultimately it is, there's nothing remotely revolutionary, most of it borrows from past ideas and its pretty clichéd but that's the irony of the film. How do you explain the casting of Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry') and Rebecca De Mornay (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle') who both played menacing terrorisers in the 90's and are now on the opposite end of the knife. It's a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and a family have stopped to fix a punctured tyre. As the father (John C. McGinley) is changing the tyre, his wife (Leila Kenzle) is struck by a limo. With the wife gravely ill, the limo driver (John Cusack) attempts to get help and takes the family to a nearby motel. The torrential rainstorm also forces several other disparate people to seek shelter in the motel. Included are a young newlywed couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); a faded actress (Rebecca De Mornay) who was being driven by the limo driver; a prostitute (Amanda Peet) and a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a killer (Jake Busey). Meanwhile the motel is run by a creepy manager (John Hawkes) who isnt all that he seems.  The rain doesn't let up and the 10 strangers are one by one murdered. Who's the killer? Naturally the killer is the first suspect or is it the creepy motel manager? Could it be a ghost since the motel was built on an ancient burial ground? As the murders intensify, the remaining guests begin to find a connection to the murders. Meanwhile the film intercepts with an eleventh hour hearing for a man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is convicted of several murders and is about to be put to death. Is there a connection?James Mangold hasn't really demonstrated his as good of a director as he is for attracting good casts and he usually has more talent than he can utilise with his past films including the star studded Girl Interrupted' and Copland'.  In Identity', again he doesn't use his cast to the greatest effect (De Mornay is doomed pretty early on), but with such an ensemble cast, there isnt the need for any stand out performances because with more characters standing out than others, it puts the film off balance. Everybody is a suspect, nobody is immune, which is very important in figuring out the film because it doesn't go for the easy answer, it makes you think. This all leads to one of those trick endings, which makes you relive the entire film and put it all together. Some may not think it works, but it grabs you and also makes you kick yourself for falling for the detours and tricks the film has in hiding its secret. Its ending is the first conclusion that fooled me since The Sixth Sense' and Fight Club' from 1999. Mangold though has a nice visual style and though clichéd, the brutal rainstorm is a necessity for a good thriller, it has an ominous effect that works well here. The motel setting is creepy yet authentic and again there's nothing terribly insightful here, but a standard setting with some killings. The industry has evolved that most thrillers rely on shock tactics to scare audiences, but Identity' doesn't have any gruesome scenes or outrageous deaths, it's relying on a terrifying and menacing script to creep the audience out and make them think like a good old whodunit. None of the cast are overly great, though Amanda Peet continues to prove herself a great actress while John Cusack and Ray Liotta may be photocopying past performances but they're still good. Identity' is a good old thriller that deceives the audience, plays with their mind by giving them detours that go nowhere and requires them to try and piece together the mystery; before ultimately giving them an ending they probably would have never guessed. Its these type of films that make the thriller genre one of the best and we like to play detective and its good to get a good old scare and Identity' is an effective way to exercise our sleuthing capabilities. My rating: 8 ½ / 10",Identity
297,Trajanc,"A well acted, tight and intelligent thriller.",7,27 April 2003,Cusack is a standout in this extremely well crafted thriller.

298,forehead1,Lets itself down,6,5 February 2004,"(CONTAINS SPOILERS)Identity is another example of a film suffering from the 'Sixth Sense Syndrome', where a movie cannot resist throwing a number of plot twists into the closing chapter - whether they add to the picture or not.The film starts brightly - quickly getting into the story and cleverly showing how all of the characters' actions led to the group coming together. The following hour keeps the tension up, with a number of red-herrings thrown into the mixture to ensure this is not your average run-of-the-mill murder mystery.  The dark and stormy surroundings also work wonders, complimenting the remote location to create a really nervy atmosphere.  Then it gets weird.Don't get me wrong: I liked the death-row convict/psychosis revelation, and felt it - initially - added to an already entertaining and original picture. However, the writers obviously felt this alone was enough to satisfy the audience and did not put the effort into successfully integrating it into the plot of the rest of the movie.  Really, this shock should have been brought in 20-30 minutes earlier (or the run-time extended by this amount), allowing it to develop into the story and not just appear as a tacked-on afterthought.  Regrettably, Identity nose-dives from this point on, with twist after surprise after shock crammed into the remaining minutes, making redundant the great work that had preceded it and leaving you feeling like you've just watched a slightly more bizarre conclusion to 'Along Came A Spider'.  The less said about the final couple of scenes, the better.   
Could've been good, but one or two plot twists too far render Identity into just the 'watchable' category.6/10",Identity

Ok, i was a little confused in the beginning, but as the movie progressed, i got it. It just didnt reach my expectations, but its up there! It starts off with this guy writing down stuff he hears on a tape, and then it cuts to the motel. Where the guests begin to arrive.I really liked how they arrived, i like how it all started with Paris's shoe. I mean if you think about it, something so tiny, started everything! If her shoe hadnt been dropped, the family wouldnt have gotten a flat tire, the driver and actress wouldnt have hit the mom, and that goes for everyone else, they probably wouldnt have been forced to go to the Motel.
This movie made you feel for the characters.

Frankly, as a film it's a mess.  Its very nicely directed, with competent if thankless performances from the likes of Ray Liotta, Alfred Molina, and John Cusack (always great value) but despite some sharp dialogue, the script goes walkabout halfway through the film.Initially the story is cliched but well executed, with ten apparently unconnected characters forced to spend a night in a Motel cut off from the outside world during a thunderstorm.  They are then promptly bumped off one by one.  Red herrings fly thick and fast as they try to guess which of them is the killer.  However, at this point a Norman-Batesesque twist has the effect of making you cease to care for any of the characters.  Other twists follow in a convoluted and rushed final act which pulls the rug out from under the audience at least two times too many.Therefore on balance, this is worth a look for devotees of the genre, but others beware.",Identity

310,driffma,It lost me in the last act,9,28 May 2003,"Identity begins with the stranding of ten people at an out of the way motel on a dark and stormy night.  The phones at the motel are out and the roads are washed out. The guests at this motel are, a family on vacation, a limo driver and his famous actress charge, a prostitute leaving Las Vegas, a couple just married, a federal marshal with a convicted serial killer in tow, and the clerk at the desk.  Did I mention that it is a dark and stormy night.  Well Constant Reader, you probably already realize that this is a sure prescription for disaster.  Soon after the guests are settled in, they start getting killed off, one, by one. 	The first hour of this movie follows the formula adopted by many a slasher/mystery.  We suspect along with the characters that one of the stranded guests is committing the murders.  We have two investigators on this case, the limo driver Ed (John Cusack) and the Federal Marshall Rhodes (Ray Liotta).  Considerable tension mounts among the guests as they all begin to suspect each other.  And while it is all stuff we have seen before it is entirely compelling because it is so well done.  The fodder in most thrillers is typically uninteresting and when the killer does visit them we care not a whit.  In this film though all of the characters are extremely well drawn.  This is essential as this film basically starts out as an exercise in genre filmmaking.  These characters are intelligently written, they don't seem typical, in any way of the mystery/thriller genre.  We get a sense of the lives they have lived before they all come together in an out of the way motel in a driving storm.   While we don't see or hear much about those lives we get a hint of what they have been like before the moment we meet them in the film.	I liked everything about this first hour and twenty minutes or so. No let me make a stronger statement.  I loved the first hour and twenty minutes of this movie.  I especially liked the limo driver Ed.  John Cusack's limo driver is something out of a 1940's hard-boiled crime drama, not Sam Spade, but closer to Philip Marlow.  He is a nice guy, who has seen much, and most of what he has seen has not been good.  He is a limo driver, but he hasn't always been one.  I think you will guess what he did before the chauffer gig long before it gets revealed, and if you don't you will say oh, of course. And what is neat is every one is good in this film, every part is good. There isn't a throw away role in the film. For me that is the damnable misery of it.	In this day and age you cannot make an eerie mystery without a major twist or two.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  I like surprises, I bet you do too, and there is a big surprise in Identity.  I can't tell you what it is of course.  I can tell you that I absolutely hated it.  That the twist is well done is not in dispute.  Is it interesting?  That is something you will have to decide for yourself.  For me it ruined everything I had come to think about the characters.  The climax becomes just a matter of tying up loose ends.  I no longer cared how it ended, who lived or who died, with the big twist all that stuff just ceased to matter.  	I walked out disappointed.  But I can't say the movie is bad at all.  It is well crafted, and engaging.  And it may be engaging to you Constant Reader, even after the twist.  In a genre that is typically filled with mindless trash, Identity makes an effort to be an engaging thriller, it doesn't do it with cheap thrills or lots of special effects.  It depends instead on thoughtful direction, engaging script, and excellent acting and a lot of rain. I give the movie a 9",Identity
311,cnitinb,"An underrated masterpiece, oh so good!",9,12 November 2010,"In 1991, there was silence of the lambs, then in 1995, there was copycat and Seven, 2003 was the year of this phenomenal masterpiece. Its quite unfortunate that this movie is often never compared or mentioned with the others.The movie starts as two side plot , one dealing with a psychiatrist, Dr.Malick(Alfred Molina) saving his patient from death sentence and the other one involves a group of people stuck in a rain storm at a motel , fighting off and fending themselves from...a killer! The two plots are connected , how exactly? Unfortunately that cannot be revealed here without spoiling the plot.The story is completely engrossing and this is one such perfect edge of the seat thriller that will tighten the screws so hard and to such an extent to drive the viewer crazy and hungry for a solution. Unlike many thrillers the ending here is the best part of the story and will leave you completely satisfied and at the same time in a state of shock.Quite honestly, Identity should be place not just among the above mentioned classics , but a level higher with Hitchcock's psycho and vertigo.

But Identity goes way overboard with it. Nothing is real at all.I liked the basic story before everything got all trippy. The story of a killer among a bunch of seemingly normal people. Then the whole, ""You're actually a crazy person in a mental institute and people think you should die, so prove them wrong"", thing kicks in.If the rest of the movie lived up to what I like from the first hour or so, then I would recommend it, but the movie fails, and fails bad.I give a 4/10",Identity

Maybe I'm just not trying too hard, because I do enjoy surprises... This being said, if you're just as ""easy-going"" as I am in that respect, you might find as I did that this little-advertised movie deserves its place on the podium of a genre (or sub-genre - ""thriller with a supernatural, almost metaphysical twist"") whose recent successes included most notably Frailty, The Others, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and more miscellaneously Abre Los Ojos / Vanilla Sky. Like those, it boasts an impeccable direction and cast, a very enjoyable, if borderline formulaic, first part, and a deeply satisfying and most memorable ""cherry on the cake"" in the form of said final twist. To me this movie confirms, after Copland and (yes !) Kate & Leopold, that James Mangold is one of a handful of directors who can turn even a just vaguely interesting script into a great movie.",Identity

316,Jozxyqk,A 'whodunnit' film with an obvious twist (SPOILERS),4,15 December 2004,"I was informed by friends of mine and movie reviewers that although this movie was pretty average, the ending is impossible to guess. I can truthfully say right now that I practically saw the ending coming.SPOILERS FROM HEREFirstly, the thing about the 'cop' being a convict and the other con being his sidekick was extremely obvious. I first noticed how he was about to grab the key tag from the first victim without worrying about tampering with evidence. Then there was the fact that when the second convict turned up he attacked him to the point of unconsciousness so he couldn't talk. (The 'cop-being-the-killer thing may have been more obvious to me after seeing the stage production of 'The Mouse Trap').However, the fact that the scenario was all part of a DID-sufferer's hallucination didn't spring on me until it was revealed that all of them shared the same birthday.But finally, I found it quite obvious that the child was the murderer for a fact when he walked out the room with his mother, discovering she was dead.I also guessed the clichéd ending how the criminal gets away with it after 'fooling' the cops/lawyers that in some way allow him to escape ('Primal Fear' and 'The Usual Suspects' to name two). I guess it wasn't an obvious fool, but I suspect the child purposely did this to reveal himself so he could escape.So there you have it. I must say that this film doesn't deserves the score of 7.3 it currently has. A score between 6 and 7 would be more appropriate. I do believe that this was a creative twist on the 'whodunnit' where everyone's picked off one by one. However, I could've enjoyed it more had it not been so clichéd and silly at times.",Identity

Not once during my viewing did I think of fast-forwarding to the next scene or chapter. I actually replayed some scenes to try and solve the mystery, but I was unsuccessful.To paraphrase another review, ""There are many, many opportunities for you to name the bad guy, but you will probably be wrong."" All of the actors did an excellent job of portraying their characters, even to the point of being annoying or irritating.There are several clues that things aren't normal, bloodstains on one cop's back, the convict escaping the scene only to arrive again, but these clues don't give the answer to who is the bad guy. Ultimately, I'm not sure the conclusion really explained who the bad guy was, but not in the style of some cheap movie setting up a sequel. IDENTITY was final. It was simply an entertaining, attention-keeping movie.",Identity
319,Gordon_Six_Echo,"Hands Down the Best Horror Film in Years, as well as the First Great Film of 2003",10,29 April 2003,"""As I was going up the stairs, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today, I wish I wish he'd go away.""               -Certain to become a classic quote among horror movies.Many great things can be said of James Mangold's ""Identity"", but one thing is for sure; hopefully this will inspire future horror films to try something new for a change, which in this case is a clever story. After endless years of such wretched teen horror fare and formulaic retreads, here comes a movie that manages to be both scary and smart. Such films as The Sixth Sense and, more recently, The Ring, have been likewise, but this movie gives both of them a run for their money, big time. It also has what I can easily say is one of the most shocking endings of recent memory. I've seen the movie twice so far, and the ending has stuck with me thus far.With talent like this involved, you'd figure this movie had to have something going for it. It's not everyday you see actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta in a project like this. You've got to give them credit because they obviously spotted the cleverness of the script. Had this been your run of the mill scare flick, I'm sure they would've passed. The real standout of the cast is John Hawkes, as the shady motel proprietor. Hawkes, who I remember in bit parts in Rush Hour and The Perfect Storm, can easily be compared to Steve Buscemi, but he provides the best lines in the movie, not to mention the funniest.As far as the plot goes, I don't want to reveal anything beyond what the trailer and ads have, which was thankfully not a whole lot. In fact, it's one of the best trailers of recent memory because of that. All that needs to be said is that if you're looking to be really frightened by a movie, but don't want to endure the standard cliches, then ""Identity"" is a must see for you. I certainly hope that it will generate massive box office attention before the summer movie invasion, because it truly deserves to be a hit.**** out of ****",Identity
320,williamknott,A Gimmick Movie (contains spoiler),5,26 April 2003,"""Identity"" is a gimmick movie disguised as a whodunit.  It isn't even a scary movie.  It's an intellectual puzzle at best and really not that engaging.  I knew what was going on almost immediately.  The first time I stopped to think, ""Why are they showing us this scene that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie?,"" I realized there was only one thing that could explain what was happening:  none of it was real, it was all being made up in someone's mind.  I sat there for half the movie waiting for that to be revealed, and then when it was revealed, the movie kept going to a conclusion that was silly.  Despite the strong cast, never once during the movie did I care about what was going to happen.  Watch a movie like the ""Sixth Sense"" instead and feel the tension, feel how you don't want to look at what's going to happen next.  Now that's tension.  Nothing like that happens here.  People get killed and it's about as shocking as watching a character in a video game get killed.  And when the secret of what's really going on is revealed, I think many people will feel cheated.",Identity

Incredibly pleased, that is until Timmy, movie wrecker in 4 and a half feet, waltzed on scene and said, ""whores don't get a second chance."" To quote the comic book guy, ""worst ending ever.""  I was perfectly happy with the killer that was revealed earlier (who I won't reveal because to me that was the real end of the movie).  I was perfectly happy with the movie up until the point where the sole (or so u think) survivor is hanging washing on a line. It should have been cut there.  End scene.  Why the homicidal child? It's so overdone and in this case badly done.  One would think there would be some clue that little Timmy is daemon spawn, but no.  He seems to be a perfectly normal kid.  I'm all for surprise endings, but they need to be realistic. Other then that Identity was great. I loved all of the twists.  I supposed thats what makes me so mad.  The movie didn't need another plot twist.  It was twisty enough. It seems as though some hack writer was sitting there one day and though, ""Hey, lets make Timmy the murderer! No one'll see that coming!"" Of course we won't. It doesn't make sense!

322,lhseaglerunner,Not Your Typical Slasher,8,29 April 2003,"As I turned the key in my car's ignition, the familiar bass of Queen came tumbling out of my speakers. `Are you ready, Are you ready for this/Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?' How is that for coincidence, I mean, what better song to be playing after watching a bloody flick like `Identity'?On a rainy night in a place in Nevada that could be quite well described as the Middle of Nowhere, ten perfect strangers all end up in a desert motel. There is the pleasant York family with the father (John McGinley) and son Timothy (Bret Loehr) trying to hold together after a messy accident puts the mother (Leila Kenzle) on death's door. The cause of the accident also shows up at the motel in the form of a pampered actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and her faithful chauffer Ed (John Cusack) being the ones who actually hit Mrs. York.Then there is the prostitute, Paris (Amanda Peet), who, for some odd reason is detested by the creepy hotel clerk, Larry (John Hawkes). The next set of people is made up of the newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott). The final set of people is the cop (Ray Liotta) with his prisoner escortee (Jake Busey), which makes for a nice combination on a stormy night. Oh, and I must add that in a seemingly unrelated tangent, there is a hearing going on in some California town to decide on a soon-to-be-executed prisoner's aptness to be killed.As one may expect, people start dying, often in gruesome fashions, which leads in to this nifty bit from the song of the column--`Another one bites the dust/ Another one bites the dust.' Then comes a twist that may or may not blow your mind, but I'll leave that little bit of the mind-twist for y'all to figure out.This is one creepy film. I don't do horror/suspense well, so I really have nothing to base this off of, but it had me hooked. The first two acts play out nearly perfectly, with the suspense building and building as another character bites the dust. To this, I credit director James Mangold for keeping it moving and also keeping the audience guessing as to which member is the killer.The third act of the film, though, threw me for a loop. In some ways, it is a very good twist, but in others, the entire pacing of the movie is interrupted and throws the audience off of its guard for a moment or two, which is not exactly a good thing to do.A couple of stand-out performances-John Cusack is excellent as the closest thing to a `hero' the film provides as he basically walks the audience through the clues. I also give kudos to John Hawkes for his motel clerk who offers the precise amount of patheticness and menace to be intriguing. One other good job goes to Amanda Peet who is solidly spectacular as a flawed semi-heroine.But as with most large casts, there are a couple performances that left a bit to be desired-for one, Leila Kenzle (this is not that big of a spoiler, so don't protest!) as her character is supposedly lying dead, well, when a dead person is noticeably breathing, that is not that good of a thing. I also did not particularly care for Jake Busey's convict-character because what we did see was just not really enough and a bit more could have been done with him.`And another one gone, and another one gone/ Another one bites the dust/ Hey, I'm gonna get you too/ Another one bites the dust.' As this review bites the dust, I can conclude that the tension in `Identity' never really bit the dust, as proof, my heart rate was up over normal by nearly 40 BPM right after the film ended, which speaks to the tenseness. I think that `Identity', especially when coupled with an amazing coincidence, is deserving of an 8 out of 10.",Identity
323,sirbriang2,"good first half, awful plot twist ending",4,6 May 2005,"NOTE: the spoiler comes toward the bottom and is clearly noted. Feel free to read the rest of this.IDENTITY is one of those movies that just misses being great. However, just because this movie aims for the heavens doesn't mean that its graceless fall back to earth can be ignored.On paper, this movie seems like a sure thing. John Cusak restrains his typical ranting character and does a good job as a penitent man. John C. McGinley (who is my favorite actor to see die in movies because I hate him so much) does a good job as a wussy husband/step-father. Rebecca DeMornay is good as a washed up actress (two words: type casting). Ray Liotta is pretty good, too, and even Jake Busey does a pretty good job, which is shocking. His death is pretty cool, too, but was unfortunately performed on a dummy.Good actors need a good script, though. The material is good. This movie is based on the plot of Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS (AND THEN THERE WERE NONE), which is a good book and has been made into a good movie. However, someone decided to try a different angle for IDENTITY. Instead of using good source material and hiring and good screenwriter, they hired Michael Cooney. I'm sure you remember him better as the writer/director of JACK FROST and JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN. No? Well, you're missing out on a homicidal snowman killing Shannon Elizabeth in her film debut. With a carrot. In her special place. Doesn't that sound like the right person to write a murder mystery with talented actors?Obviously, it was. The writer clearly thought that adding not one but two plot twists that make the viewer not care about the characters or the linear plot was a good idea. After the plot twist, I felt as connected to these characters as I do to the bad guys in RAMBO III. This should have been a three or four star movie. The plot twist subtracts two stars automatically. Watch this movie if you want to be disappointed. Then watch CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD because you clearly want to punish yourself.SPOILER COMING UP! BEWARE! The movie is pretty good in the first half. There is a puzzling peripheral plot line about an insane convict having his sanity tested, but the rest of the movie is fine. Then the plot twist happens. All the characters in the murder mystery are symptoms of the convict's disassociative identity disorder (AKA multiple personalities)! What a great, edgy idea! Why should we care what happens to figments of someone's imagination? We shouldn't!Whoa, the little kid is the killer? That's intense! No, it's not. It is stupid. It does not even take advantage of the whole unreality of the mind-scape. Instead, the kid turns out to be the mystery killer and we are led to believe that, somehow, he orchestrated all of the other murders, which is not possible. Had they played up the idea that anything can happen, then it might not have been so bad. But they played it straight. Had the kid been the killer in a movie where the characters were not imaginary, then it might have been cool. Puzzling and motiveless? Yes. Awful pot twist? Not necessarily. This script commits a sin of screen writing. It tries to outsmart the audience by introducing a ""guess the killer"" plot and then makes it absolutely impossible for the audience to fulfill their expectations. Wrapping it up in psychologist mumbo-jumbo doesn't excuse this, it just insults the audience's intelligence; we know when we are being messed with. Screw you, Michael Cooney. The cast and director are all pretty good; they should have known better than to be involved with this script.",Identity

331,ecto216,Very intelligent up until the ending,7,26 April 2003,"It's not the easiest thing, to write a review of a psychological thriller without giving away too many important points in the movie. But I'll try to give you an overall idea of what to look for and what's worth your attention in this film.The main thing I appreciated about this film was the unique way of being able to tell a story. This isn't a solid beginning to end film, it's a bit jumbled up, which adds to the movies excitement (Especially the accident scene) and really keeps your head going at full throttle to understand what you're seeing. It's impossible to not have your head going throughout the movie. With that said, the story and way the director decided to shoot it really helps the film out, and separates it from your usual `Who done it?' façade that most movies in this genre exploit.Moving on, great cast! John Cusak and Ray Liotta were perfect for their roles. I don't know how happy I was with Amanda Pete, but overall she worked out. The other characters however, fit into a cliché, which was unfortunate. The little boy, the feuding couple, the eccentric husband, even the prisoner Liotta's character is transporting looks like your average comic book creep, which is really a shame considering the sets used in the film were so nice, and there was no need to have these formulaic characters in them. It took away from how creepy the film could have been, and more importantly, ruined the tone during many a scene.Now what most people are interested in, the plot. The plot is the hardest thing to write about. I'll say this much: This movie has one of the most interesting, original plot twists that I have ever scene. People who have seen `The Usual Suspects' (and who hasn't) will appreciate the way this movie plays itself out. I can't imagine anyone being able to figure out why the events at the motel are happening, and form the correct conclusion on their own. Quite the unique piece of cinematic story telling.The biggest problem this movie has is not knowing when to stop, specifically the last five minutes of the movie. After digesting what was just dictated to you by the characters in the film, you sit back and think, `wow, that was really something. I was never expecting things to turn out that way.' However, once the ending is laid into place and you recline in the theater seat thinking how smart the movie was, you're treated to a double ending. What you think was true, is not and the true `killer' shows their face. In what has to be the worst idea in psychological thriller history, someone decided to make a certain character responsible for the acts committed that night with the motel murders. What a mistake! What an awful mistake! There was no need for it, it was unnecessary and completely out of place.
Overall, the movie is smart, but plagued by one of the worst ending in recent history. Even psychological thrillers that I hated, such as `Angel Heart', had better endings than this! Great cast, great sets, great story, but in order to maintain that feeling, you have to walk out before the last two minutes of the film get revealed. Overall, 7 out of 10.",Identity

A stroke of pure genius who ever thought of this plot. You actually think it is him the whole time, but is it? NO! A 6 year old! I didn't see that coming.

However, despite thoroughly enjoying the movie, I was somewhat disappointed by the ending. It just fed off of a common hollywood cliche that is all too evident the last few years. However, it's not as if the ending was out of left field...it actually made perfect sense. AS long as you pay attention to the opening credits and the judicial review session you'll understand what has happened. If you don't you will be lost.

Cast : John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet - small parts by John McGinley, Jake Busey, Rebecca De Mornay. I like Cusack and Liotta - and Peet is very easy on the eye if nothing else. So far so good.Director : James Mangold - did CopLand which I also liked.Film : Through a series of accidents, bad luck, bad weather - 10 people end up in a Motel stranded. All strangers. Then they start to die. Great premise, nicely staged scenes at the motel where the viewer is left wondering who the hell is killing these guys. There are a few cliché characters but overall, the thing works for me. I enjoyed the paranoia in the rain-swept building as people begin to get bumped off one by one. There are also a few ""clues"" scattered in the early scenes which make you crease your eyebrows a little in a ""what the hell does that mean"" manner. Then it transpires that the apparent strangers are in fact linked- they all have the same birthday and all their last names represent a state in America - Maine/Rhodes/Dakota etc. By this stage I am about 70 minutes into the film and I too am intrigued as to how they will finish this - hoping they won't cop out and throw in a flimsy finish.I was disappointed.Suddenly, we flash to John Cusack in a chair in a room full of lawyers / doctors etc. and alternating between his own body and another fat guy's body by some quick camera cuts. What ??? We did see an earlier scene with this guy - who is trying to get off an electric chair sentence by some clever doctor talk - but the way it was presented was that this guy somehow killed all the people in the motel. At least that's how I picked it up. But in actuality - and this is a cop out if ever I saw one - John Cusack, the fat psycho and all the other people in the Motel are actually all figments of the fat guy's imagination, all different identities but only one of the identities is the real killer. So by getting them all together through the doc's talking - and getting them to kill each other off, he hopes to kill the killer's identity thus leaving the fat guy a harmless gimp. POOR !! POOR !!

You'll actually even see the old frightened girl turning around quickly into the arms of the good guy who apparently was just standing there. But despite mounds of this God aweful writing, we actually see some pretty interesting twists and turns along the latter part of the film - and quite an original ending, which leads us to believe-- ""Identity"" may have never quite taken itself seriously to begin with. This is the only reason that would explain talent the likes of Cusack and Ray Liotta would lend themselves to this near ""train- wreck?"".

Some dummy in the review section wrote the whole plot twist in his title, so I unfortunately saw it coming... They did give a few clues during the movie, but I first thought the prisoner in yellow was the convict they wanted to bring to lawyer meeting. Turns out it was all happening in the convict's mind, which wasn't any of the characters at the hotel. There is one thing which doesn't make any sense to me... How would they know the killer personality would have died or not? How would they know there is no more than one?

Personally, I found it to be an interesting and welcome twist.

How could it go wrong? Fortunately that question was answered with a yell of ""It can't!""Usually I leave a thriller/slasher flick with a feeling of distaste. It feels too cheap, too ripped off. But the big twist that everyone seems to be talking about...well to be honest it pays off in a huge way. What seems to be more and more goofy as the film goes on, and let me say goofy in this sense isn't unbelievable, just far too coincidental, it all comes across perfectly with the ""twist"". Unpredictable? Maybe. If you aren't paying close attention to the film. About halfway I turned to a friend of mine and guessed what the twist was, and he and I chuckled. It was that far off what is expected. I was right, and it still didn't disappoint me.
I hate spoilers so I'll avoid them. Trust me folks, this is a movie you will want to see. Read my other reviews if you like, they give a basis for the type of movie I enjoy. If you liked Fight Club, American Psycho, Donnie Darko, or Memento because of a fresh take on an old idea...run to the theater now and see this movie. The acting is a 10 out of 10, the scripting is done well enough to know the characters without revealing so much you're bogged down, the action lets up only at the times that you'll be jumping or biting your nails.

363,Bigbert,A twist to far,7,8 February 2004,"When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused.  I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts.  It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions.  This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.  But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie.

But still a very surprising movie. Normally I don't respond well to movies who lie to the audience, who show a whole story and suddenly, in the end, without warning just say ""oh well, after all it was nothing like that at all, the guy was just asleep!"". Hitchcock once said you should never lie to an audience, you should never show something that isn't true. It's one thing to tell a lie in a movie, the other is to show it to the audience as if it was the real thing. It's the easiest trick in the book, of course you'll be surprised, anybody will. To understand it better see the difference between ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Seven"". The first shows a story that wasn't there and in the end pulls a rabbit out of the hat(easy!). The other builds up to an explosive and unexpected finale without any cheap shots, it just carries you through. With Identity the movie suddenly pulls a fast one on you and leaves you wondering... But Mangold doesn't gives the twist at the very end, and keeps a tense film until the last frame. It's a worth see, inventive film and with a great cast to back it up.",Identity
367,blaisepascal,A smart thriller that challenges the viewer,8,6 September 2003,"As tempting as it is to give spoilers, I assure that there will be none in this mini-review. This is mostly because I want to do my best to persuade people who haven't seen this movie to ignore the simple minded criticisms I've read all too often. This movie begins in a predictable, yet very well done thriller/murder mystery type vein. Everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. The acting and script and direction all lay out an extremely solid groundwork. The only problem with this is that this genre has been done many times over and would be difficult to make any impact in.And so the movie decides to take a very original and interesting approach as it progresses. As things unfold, it will at times leave the viewer questioning what they understand and how much of what they understand they're even sure of in the first place. Eventually when the viewer finally gets a grasp on things, the realization sets in of just how ambitious and well done this movie is. Believe me, I haven't even given you a HINT of the roller coaster this movie takes you on.Because it hits you with so much though, I suggest the close minded and slow witted do not watch Identity. Most of the criticisms of this film result from such viewers, who are left clawing to hold on to the predictable (and entertaining) foundation the beginning of the movie lays, leaving them with a stinging bitter taste in their mouths as they are sent hurtling into the depths of the abyss that is Identity.The script and directing are phenomenal. They are what make the movie. The acting is all well done, but nothing really stands out because of the nature of the film. With an adequate cast, which Identity surely has, the script and direction take over and tell a story that easily can win over the viewer on their own merits. This brings out Identity's only real flaw though: because of the script's nature, there is only so much this movie can do. I can't say any more than that without planting the seeds of spoilers. Basically, the writer of this movie had to make a sacrifice. It was obviously a great story. But because of how it has to progress in order to be great, it prevents itself from ever taking that next step into the realm of classics.Perhaps with an extra half hour or forty five minutes Identity could have worked enough character development and pathos in to make it last with the viewer forever. But more likely than not, I suspect, it would have only served to drag out the movie. By making it to-the-point and hard hitting, the makers of Identity bite the bullet and settle for birthing one of the best movies of 2003, instead of one of the best movies of all time.And this, I think, is a respectable decision. A decision that more than warrants that you watch this outstanding movie.",Identity

But then I noticed that James Mangold directed it and that Pruitt Taylor Vince played a big part alongside greats like John Cusack and Ray Liotta, so then I decided to go see it. And I was not let down, because this movie takes you through the mind of a schizo and the movie is cut in such a way that you only learn this step by step, only to be revealed at the very end what is going on and who did all the killing. And when that moment comes you actually witness an aha-erlebnis, trust me. This is not just a slasher movie, this is a great psychological tract on schizophrenia and also a complaint against capital punishment. On a side note, John C.

I had other people trying to convince me it was her, but those arguments made absolutely no sense. Watch the DVD with the director's commentary. The big twist at the end wasn't much of a twist. I guess that's why some people invented their own twists and claimed it was Ginny. I think the movie would have been better had it been her, but no one asked me my opinion. It was the kid and it was very clearly spelled out at the end. Otherwise, great performances all around and an ""A"" for effort. The movie may have fallen apart, but it is a solid psychological thriller for the first hour. Unfortunately, the movie took a cue from slasher flicks and pulled the ""bodies suddenly disappearing"" trick, which I found really annoying. It would have been nice if the script had undergone another rewrite and been about 30 minutes longer, preferably with more character development in the beginning. Also, it would have been nice if there had been enough clues for the audience to figure out who was doing the killing. The ending was a cheat.

A lot of the plot points were predictable, but the last five minutes of the movie will literally drop your jaw.  John Cusack and Amanda Peet shine in this movie, though it is not Ray Liotta's best performance.  Clea DuVall(who was in The Faculty and Girl, Interrupted)'s acting was unbelieveable.

384,silk63826,Identity is a film that will divide audiences -- the twists of its plot will either impress or exasperate you.,9,1 April 2005,"IDENTITY, directed by James Mangold, is a thriller set at an isolated motel in rural Nevada during an unrelenting rainstorm. With all roads washed out and all forms of communication dead, a group of people become stranded at the motel along with the shifty manager (John Hawkes). Among the stranded are Ed (John Cusack), a former cop turned limo driver; Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay), a self-absorbed actress; Paris (Amanda Peet), a prostitute attempting to escape her profession; Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a cop transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey); Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall), bickering newlyweds; and George (John McGinley) and Alice (Leila Kenzle), a married couple traveling with their young son. Soon the waterlogged lodgers start dying in mysterious--and brutal--ways, and the increasingly dwindling number of survivors must discover the killer to prevent their own demises.Riveting from the opening sequence, Mangold's suspenseful murder mystery wastes no time in turning on the tension. Realizing that truly scary cinema comes from the unknown and the unexpected, Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney keep the audience--and the film's characters--in the dark and continually create situations that go from bad to worse for the luckless travelers. Cusack anchors the film as the resigned but noble former policeman, while Peet reveals a depth previously unseen in her other movies. Actors such as Liotta, McGinley, Hawkes, and De Mornay round out the fine ensemble cast. As with many thrillers, IDENTITY has a big twist, but because of the filmmakers' excellent slight of hand, it's unlikely viewers will predict the bizarre outcome.",Identity

It was entertaining and interesting, and if I was with friends who hadn't seen it I'd enjoy watching it again. But the twist was phenomenal. Like most murder mysteries, both the killer and the motive are a secret. The killer is an easy one to figure out, but the motive I didn't see coming at all --- and not in a bad ""Basic"" way where you suddenly can't explain half the things the characters did, but in a good ""Sixth Sense"" way where everything still fits and some confusing things begin to make sense.

When the film came out in April, I avoided it because I associated director James Mangold with such films as ""Kate and Leopold"" and ""Girl Interrupted."" So it was a surprise to find a fine psychological thriller in the Hitchcockian tradition. There are a lot of twists, turn and red herrings. In the Starz! feature on the DVD, John Cusak says that the characters are moved around as if on a chessboard, which is true. It's one of the best films of 2003. Cusak and Ray Liotta are fantastic; the former has that dark, intellectual stuff down while the latter is the dark, dangerous explosive type.

390,movieguyangelus,A solid cast makes it work.,7,25 April 2003,"John Cusack leads a strong cast in ""Identity,"" a slasher film that has enough twists and turns to satisfy mystery fans, and enough blood and brutal killings for those who enjoy a good old fashioned stalk and slash fest. A group of strangers are forced to take shelter during a thunderstorm in a rundown motel that would give Norman Bates pause. Soon another guest shows up with a variety of sharp objects and a bad disposition. While portions of the film are a bit predictable, there is at least one or two surprises for those who think that they have seen it all. The murder sequences are generally offscreen, but the aftermath is often shown in surprisingly bloody detail....often playing very much like throwbacks to the early ""Friday the 13th"" films. But this cast is hardly your typical teen stalk and slash crew. Cusack is great as usual, in a role that is a big change of pace for him, with some good supporting work from a cast of recognizable faces, all of whom seem right at home in the tense atmosphere. Overall this is a fun horror film that is miles ahead of its current theatrical competition, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" in thrills, gore, talent, and originality.",Identity

I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it. Having missed it at the movies, I figured it would be the usual B-grade mystery murder flick, a bit of fun at best. Instead this movie had me hooked from the opening sequence; I almost thought they'd put the wrong DVD in the box! The story is like one big twisted, turning tunnel- with barely a glimmer of a light at the end. The cast is great, the setting appropriately scary- with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing. The cast really delivers too; the characters are diverse and given enough attention to keep you engaged but not so much as to slow the action down. John Cusack is in fine form as the easily likable ex-cop trying to hold it all together; Jake Busey plays the psychotic to perfection as usual. I don't usually go in for gore, but there's really barely more than a few hints of blood & guts. Definitely one to watch in the dark with a group of friends to scare the hell out of yourselves.

400,taxrice,Memento with an Identity Crisis,10,1 May 2004,"""Identity"" is a surprise powerhouse.John Cusack and Amanda Peet drew me to the movie. I was not prepared for the experience. James Mangold has created another film that is, at the least, consistent with his previous ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999) and ""Heavy"" (1995).Ten guests arrive at a ""Bates"" type motel and start dying. It sounds like the Agatha Christie classic ""And Then There Were None"" (1945 & 1975) a/k/a ""Ten Little Indians"" (1959, 1965 & 1989). . . but then it suggests that very theme. This is not the umpteenth remake, but rather a nice twist on the theme.Who is the killer? Why are they being killed? What is going on? Sounds like Memento meets Christie. To my thinking -- it works on several levels. This is a film that you have to be ready to participate in . . . otherwise, save it until you have the energy.John Cusack and Ray Liotta give very fine performances as would be expected. I think this is the best I have ever seen Amanda Peet. I hope director Mangold adds her to his acting company. Mangold has drawn another stellar performance from Pruitt Taylor Vince, who did such an excellent job in the Mangold's earlier referenced ""Heavy"" (1995).It doesn't look like a $30 million movie, but it delivers much more. I suspect the budget was for the acting company that includes Cusack, Liotta, Vince and Clea DuVall. The acting troupe works!Good direction. Very good acting. An excellent story. It is time to add James Mangold to my list of favored directors.  - Michael",Identity

I had the assumption that the latter would easily be better value for money despite the price.  I was wrong. 'Identity' started off as a good movie but deteriorated 1/2 - 2/3 of the way through because of a much described twist that left me (and many other viewers I believe) not caring what happened to the characters.

Well it not only lives up to it, it surpasses it.  This movie starts off seeming like it would be a paint-by-numbers 'knock-em-off and guess who the killer is out of who is left' kind of flick.  Then it's like the writer turns around from the driver's seat and says, ""Ok now you really want to see where we're going?""   Then he presses the 4 Wheel Drive button and off you go into the unpaved and bumpy terrain of suspense and thrills.There is no way to guess how this all is going to turn up from the beginning..  nay.. even half way through the film.  It's not till enough of the puzzle is even mentioned that you could even fashion a guess at what is going on.  But trust me, that's a good thing.I'll tell you guys now, the writer of this also was responsible for ""Jack Frost"" (yes the slasher one) and its sequel.  But if ""Identity"" is any evidence of what this guy is capable of then I have no problems offering him the opportunity to thrill my movie prying eyes again.It was really really well done and as I said, very intelligent.  I put it on the intelligence level of smarter films like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Memento"", and ""The Sixth Sense"".As I said to a friend about this, to make ""Identity"" take one part Agatha Christie, add one part slasher film, and sprinkle a touch of ""Primal Fear"" and mix thoroughly.Nice one, Michael.

406,spirona,"great plot, executed well, with a twist",9,13 March 2006,"There are very few intelligent, scary/suspenseful movies made in Hollywood. Identity, however, is one of them. Is it perfect? No: Identity follows the formula of recent thrillers (Sixth Sense, Hide and Seek, etc.) where there is a slow build-up, sprinkled with suspenseful moments, to a revelatory climax. Some of the writing is hokey and clumsy at times and the characters can be cartoon-like and one-dimensional (Liotta and Hawkes). But I either overlooked that or simply embraced it and enjoyed it. So it's not an indie film or a foreign film (you decide if that's good or bad). But it is a somewhat different, and surprisingly well-made Hollywood film. Identity was entertaining, thought-provoking, scary, suspenseful, and funny. What else do you want?",Identity
407,MovieCrap,Identifiable by how amazing it is,9,26 April 2003,"Identity is a film that returns to the style that old thrillers had. Starting off with a basic premise, we're able to go into the movie knowing fullheartedly what to expect. Ten strangers get stuck at a motel on a rainy night. After they begin to know more about eachother... they start to get killed off. One by one. John Cusack (High Fidelity, Serendipity) and Ray Liotta (Field of Dreams, Narc) lead this amazing ensemble cast. Also starring are Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, Changing Lanes), John C. McGinley (Any Given Sunday, The Animal), Clea Duvall (Girl, Interrupted, The Faculty), Rebecca De Mornay (The Con, Feds) and Alfred Molina (Frida, Magnolia).The coolest thing about this flick is the eerie atmosphere that is created at the motel... during the storm... with these characters. The trailer does a perfect job of catching the mood of the movie, and that alone should attract most moviegoers. The motel in the film, often noted as an obvious reference to The Bates Motel, plays a larger character than any single player in the film. It's the phone booth to Phone Booth, or the panic room to Panic Room. Now, back to the atmosphere. Some movies just know how to suck you into the story. You know, how you often find yourself on the edge of your seat just waiting and waiting for the huge, shocking finale to hit? Identity is the first movie that put me in that position.I've always been able to piece together clues in movies to predict the ending. Well, not for every movie I see (like The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects), but most. The pieces in Identity start to slowly come together, just as they do in any other suspense film, until the final clue is given... and bang! Not everybody will appreciate the ending of the film. Some might argue that it was, for some reason, a cheap way to end the movie. I thought the complete opposite. As the credits began to roll I remember telling myself that, without a doubt, it worked for me. Everything worked for me (besides the often bitchy Amanda Peet).Other films where the cast is killed off one at a time end up being cheesy-teen-horror-flicks (Final Destination), or horror-flicks-that-are-trying-to-stay-away-from being-teen-horror-flicks (Darkness Falls). Identity does a great job to totally set itself apart from those two genres by setting itself up with a well-crafted plot, exceptional acting and an ending that can't be missed. People who are fans of the old mysteries and thrillers must be sure not to miss this one.Seven and a half stars / of ten stars. (******* ½ / **********)",Identity

One by one, the ""escape routes"" were being cut off, leaving the director trying to explain the inexplicable, with the one unavoidable outcome, failure to convince! Shame, as up to that point the film had all the earmarks of a descent, highly enjoyable film, with fast-paced, inventive directing as its strongest point. All in all, it left me with the same feeeling of unachieved potential as 'The ninth gate' did! Still, worth watching for its atmosphere, cast and creative directing.",Identity
418,seth_kenney,Not a feel good movie (possible spoilers),10,17 May 2003,"This is one of those movies that definately does not target every audience. It's not a romance and it's not a comedy.  And if you were expecting a happy ending, it's not one of those movies either.  This is a psychological thriller at it's best...much like SEVEN.  If you liked SEVEN and the USUAL SUSPECTS, this is probably your type of film.   If you've seen the previews, you think it's going to be a who-dunnit mystery and it is...sort of.  Then as the process of elimination unfolds and you think you might know who the killer is, a whole new plot gets thrown into the mix.  This is what makes this film so great.  After the new twist is introduced, you really don't know what the hell to expect next.  And that's exactly what does happen...the unexpected.  Overall, this film has one of the most interesting plots I've seen, and I really didn't know what to expect after the 3/4 mark of the movie.  If you want your mind warped and you want to see a great thriller, I recommend this by all means!  If you're looking to soften your girlfriend up, take her to another movie!

The storyline doesn't explain itself at all until late in the film, so if you want a narrative that will carry you along with the plot - tough. It does grip you so that you want to know why 10 (maybe spoiler - ooops 11 people.......) are stranded at a motel, and are being killed off one by one. Don't listen to these people that say it is paper thin/weak as they wouldn't be impressed by anything. Once you know why they are there, you still want to know what will happen.

I love a lot of Cusack's work, but this film is not one of his best. His acting is good, but the whole premise of the film was a) obvious, and b) unworkable in reality. Which personality was 'running' the man with the disorder when Cusack's 'Ed' wasn't? Why didn't this personality appear at the Diner when Ed was in control of the man? How did the final woman's personality write in a diary when all the man with the disorder did is daydream her life? Why didn't any of the personalities say 'hey, wait a minute, who the hell else has been writing in my diary?'? When a multiple personality isn't evident in the person with a disorder it is not anywhere else, but is suppressed and hidden. When a personality is in control it's not like daydreaming, its actions are the actions of the person with the disorder. Etc, etc. Why didn't the writers not include a picture of the man with the disorder at the beginning and then make the film appear to be present day, but in fact be a flashback to when the original murders took place?

Interesting characters and the always charismatic John Cusack doing his thing. But then the killings start, character-development and relationships are set aside, and the film gradually goes gorily downhill to its' quite batty denouement and really ho-hum final 'shock' moment. But then I don't particularly like these sort of who's-doing-it films because I always get the feeling that it doesn't matter who is doing it, it is only a writers' contrivance. And this is more contrived than most, with the ludricous assumption that the State Governor would sit through a therapy session with a murderous lunatic the night before the mans' execution and then take the psychiatrists' word that the clearly demented man was now cured.

It was impressively shot and showed interesting characters, particularly Cusack and Peet, and Liotta was very funny in his over the top portrayal, but ultimately the ending was so confusing as to bring no clarity to what was trying to be described.  The supposed killer could not have done some of the murders depicted.  I won't go further into that since it may be disappointing to potential viewers to find out.  Understanding that the killer couldn't have done the murders the film takes on the image of a fantasy.  I could accept it as a Stephen King type fantasy, but as not much more than that.  One minor note which properly goes in your mistakes area is that the supposedly Florida orange grove that Peet goes to has hills in the background which are higher than anything remotely suggesting a hill in Florida.  This scene was obviously shot in Southern California.  In away the film suggests ""Mulholland Drive"" in the complexity of the murders, but is nowhere as interesting or as thought provoking.  One of the few times I have been missled by a review in the LA Times.",Identity
431,RockmSockM09,A gripping psychological journey with only minor flaws.,9,1 May 2003,"***This review contains MANY spoilers--please be wary!***""Identity"" is an extremely well-crafted journey through the mind of a killer. And, aside from a few real-world plot problems, succeeds in just about everything it sets out to accomplish.In the film, 10 people find themselves trapped by the weather in a roadside motel in Nevada. During the night, they become the targets of a systematic, brutal murderer. They also begin to realize they have more in common than they ever imagined.What leaps out first about this film is the atmosphere it creates: gritty and foreboding, generating a sense of urgency and claustrophobia. In addition, the filmmakers take some bold avenues of exposition in the beginning--such as freeze-frames, contextual flashbacks, etc. Original techniques are employed to make what appears to be a slasher film seem fresh and compelling--deaths are shocking and hard to predict in nature, music is minimally used, character's reactions are used heavily to relay the brutality of the deaths rather than simply seeing the dead bodies, etc.Acting is top-notch. One would be hard pressed to find one weak performance in the lot. As stated later, each character performs well in the setting of the motel, as well as an element of one man's personality.The film beings in the vain of a ""slasher"" film, including several requisite ""bait and switch"" plot elements--not the least of which is making the audience believe the killer at the motel is the escaped convict (Jake Busey). Another is fooling viewers into thinking Ray Liotta's character is actually a police officer. Though these are respectful attempts at deception, one can't help but think they seem a little too easy to spot early on.  But, that's the whole point--they're supposed to be easy to spot, because that's not the real mystery here.About halfway through the movie, the director starts to hint at some kind of ""other worldly"" force at work when Jake Busey finds himself running to a structure a quarter mile away from the motel--only to find himself right across the street from where he just came from. This is where the film really starts to take off--and elements that will eventually explain the denoument start to arrive in bundles: A frozen corpse is discovered that strikingly resembles the killer on trial whom we learned about during the opening credits (Malcom Rivers, Played by Pruitt Taylor Vince);  Each character discovers they share the same birthday; Victim's bodies begin to disappear with no trace whatsoever; John Cusack's character discovers each person seems to have a name based on a state or city.... and this is when it all snaps into place.Once it becomes apparent that this meeting of people is actually a meeting of personalities in the mind of Malcom Rivers, the movie takes on a whole new level of meaning--and plot elements and characters can be analyzed for what they are:representations of what caused this 9 year-old abandoned child to later become a murderer. Each and every plot element of the ""story within the story"" is actually an element of what Malcom Rivers must have experienced when he was abandoned: The story within the story takes place in an empty motel, which is where Malcom was found years ago; Characters eat from the vending machines--not unlike what Malcom may have been forced to do; An Indian burial ground is mentioned and shown--something Malcom most definitely feared during his abandonment. In retrospect, these elements are frequent and quite stunning.But what's more stunning is how each character represents a singular element of Malcom Rivers personality at the time of the abandonment. The director graphically allows us to see the genesis of each ""personality"" in the story within a story:Paris (Amanda Peet) represents Malcom's perception of his mother as a ""whore"" who went from man to man, and ultimately abandoned her child in the hopes to start her life someplace else--without the burden of Malcom. Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) is Malcom's perception of his mother as a non- mother--someone only concerned with herself, her appearance, money, and without the least concern for human life. In other words--she is what Malcom saw most as a child.Ginny's (Clea Duvall) representation is twofold: she is Malcom himself as a child who is scared of the cold, wary of the Indian burial grounds, and cries in fear. But she may also be the side of Malcom's mother who undoubtedly had a relationship not unlike that of Duvall's in the movie: An attempt to first salvage, and then dissolve a marriage with an abusive mate by using a false pregnancy.In turn, Joe (William Lee Scott) most definitely represents one or more of the little boy's mother's suitors--abusive and immature, and obviously flirtatious with other women. In other words, the only father figures Malcom ever had.Larry, the manager (John Hawkes),  represents Malcom as a guilty culprit: hiding things that might embarrass him; creating stories to get him out of trouble; In addition, he's the part of Malcom's personality who bears the guilt of ""killing"" the original, unadulterated personality, before the trauma--someone who ""died"" long ago in that hotel: the body found in the freezer. This frozen body lies dormant, and is the only ""dead"" body that doesn't disappear--Malcom's personality can still be saved and ""resurrected.""George York (John C. McGinley) is Malcom's inner perception of what a father should truly be: caring, forgiving, always following rules and the proper course of action. He looks after his son when his mother cannot; He can fix a flat; He doesn't argue with his wife; He reassures his son throughout the movie.Alice York (Leila Kenzle) rounds out Malcom's perception of the ""perfect family."" She is attentive, sweet, and has an emotional bond with her son. One can also say she may represent the soft side of the child's mother--something he probably rarely saw, and something that was only shared in private between the two (the hand-touching scene). She has the least to say in the movie, because Malcom rarely saw this side of his own mother.Timothy (Bret Loehr) represents Malcom's purely emotional side as a 9 year old. He never speaks throughout the film, and is relegated to symbolic emotional expressions only. He first shows love (touching hands with his mother), then fear, then sadness (crying after the death of his parents is complete), and finally anger--which drives him to kill. Rhodes (Ray Liotta), on the surface, can be interpreted as one of Malcom's mother's many ""male partners"" (hence the flirtation he has with Peete). However, Liotta may also represent the part of Malcom's personality that draws attention away form the real evil (Timothy). In other words, Liotta is an internal ""defense"" created  by Malcom to, oddly enough, protect the discovery of the real culprit among his personalities. In the end, the Liotta character is successful, in as much as he takes the fall for the real ""killer"" inside Malcom's mind.That being said, Robert Maine (Jake Busey) is the overt counterpart to Liotta's character. Both he and Liotta serve to distract us--and Malcom--from the real killer personality. Liotta is does it subversively, and Busey does it obviously.-Last but not least is Ed (John Cusack). He represents two elements: First, he is the hero/strong personality Malcom wishes he could be--he solves the crime; he protects his mother (Peet) and saves her from a life of prostitution--giving her a ""second chance"" (in an idealistic life: a farmer in an orange grove... something a child might dream up).But Cusack also represents Malcom's lifelong, ongoing attempt to wrangle the other personalities into submission--the last remaining shard of reason in Malcom's mind. We see the motel setting through Cusack--he tries to come to grips with every other character, and he's the one who ""discovers"" the link between them in Malcom's subconscious (the map scene). He thinks logically and intelligently--albeit within a fantasy world. Cusack is the character that Malcom identifies with while at the hearing, and he is the one entrusted to root out the ""evil"" personality that killed those people 4 years earlier in the housing project. Tragically, this last remaining shred of reason ultimately fails--leaving Malcom at the end of the movie in complete dementia, and under the control of the only personality remaining--one driven purely by killer emotion.Which brings us to an interesting conclusion: Malcom Rivers was so far gone in his dementia, and so consumed with revenge and anger--he did not want to be ""saved."" Since we all know dreams and fantasies are controlled by ourselves--and every element is placed there by us (even in our subconscious), we can only assume Malcom actively sabotaged his own efforts to ""find the killer."" In other words--he pulled the most interesting bait and switch of the movie on himself: making his last spark of reason (Cusack) believe the killer was someone else (Busey, then Liotta)--thereby letting the real ""killer"" inside (Timothy), go free--and preside over the mind and body forever.This journey through the mind of a person with multiple personality disorder is both creative and enlightening: Many movies on this subject simply offer a character with the same disorder and blame it on an abusive father, a mother with no self respect, and childhood abandon. ""Identity"" actually graphically depicts each element as a character/ event in a fantasy, and even goes as far to show the struggle within the mind to regain itself versus the internal attempts to sabotage it's own well being.
The only thing that keeps this film from being excellent is the flaws it suffers during the ""real world"" elements of the film. A last-minute hearing to stay the execution of a convicted mass murderer is not only unrealistic, but it's justification in the film is unrealistic as well. Apparently, the only thing that saved Malcom Rivers from execution is a journal that was ""just found"" at this late date. Are we to assume that there were no doctors studying this man for the four years he was being held in prison? Was a journal really required to see this man could have plead insanity? Why was this a ""last minute"" decision?The only explanation for such an odd turn of events is to facilitate the fantasy world of the motel story. In that setting, there is a feeling of urgency and time-sensitivity. The people must survive until dawn;  Malcom Rivers has to find the ""inner evil"" and get rid of it quickly before it takes any more lives, etc. The only explanation for having such an unrealistic ""last minute"" discovery of Malcom's insanity is to maintain the feeling of urgency in the real word as well as the fantasy world. In other words--the film would most definitely lack a certain ""punch"" if the real word events were happening over a period of four years.All in all, ""Identity"" is a great psychological study. It's technically not a thriller--as the story really is the journey Malcom Rivers must make to rid himself of evil. Once viewers accept it as a creative attempt to dissect multiple personality disorders, ""Identity"" truly shines.One note of warning: Don't be swayed by reviewers who portray themselves asextremely intelligent for having ""figured out"" the twist of this film within the first few minutes of viewing it. Their attempts to impress are based on luck, advanceinformation, and hindsight. Some people feel they have to prove their self-worth by claiming they can deconstruct a movie within minutes of its opening credits-- especially one that requires more thought than they probably have the capacity for. ""Identity"" is not a film that can or should be deconstructed in the first few minutes: It deserves much better.",Identity

But the result isn't ""Identity.""Its settings and its set-up (to a large degree) may look and feel like ""Psycho"" with a little Agatha Christie mixed in.  But director James Mangold and writer Michael Cooney deserve a lot of credit here. They've taken just enough elements that are familiar and derivative and then smartly turned them inside-out.Ten strangers meet in a deserted motel and then start getting bumped off one by one.  Whodunit?  Whydtheydoit?  And how come everyone seems awfully cagey and unsettled?  (Beyond dead bodies piling up, that is.)Though less than 90 minutes long, ""Identity"" is tightly wound, and the first 15 minutes introduce the characters, the setting and a tangentially related story in a masterful way.One big flaw: Cooney and Mangold reveal the big ""twist"" (and it's a whopper -- at least on par with ""The Sixth Sense"") about 10 minutes too early, robbing what should be the most eek-inducing moments of some of their tension.Even bigger: ""Identity"" throws in one too many twists in its final few minutes, bringing on a switcheroo that tries way too hard and seriously detracts from an otherwise original, memorable and very creepy thriller.",Identity

You can read on in confidence if you have not seen this movie. I would first like to comment on the story itself. You will hear people refer to ""twists"". I happen to be very sick of ""twist"" endings because they are overused and filmmakers these days rely immensely on ""twists"" to yield drama or reaction from audience. They tend to abandon the rest of the plot and the storyline and focus purely on this reaction. Well, this annoying trend leads most of movie audiences losing interest in movies in general because if you are like me, you'll feel that most of these movies are predictable and lose much of their impact. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention that 90% of action, mystery, horror, or thrillers are in some way (mildly or even blatantly), a ripoff of another story. Identity however, is unusually original.

437,digitald-4,A Superb Movie,10,17 September 2010,"In order to establish a point of reference for this movie, here are some movies I consider excellent. Right off the top... Recently: Identity, Thin Red Line, Little Miss Sunshine, When Trumpets Fade, Charlie Wilsons War (revealing), Inside John Malkovich, The village, Inception (a good movie owing to the subject matter but not for the film itself or the acting).. and many more not mentioned here.Older movies: Hell in the Pacific (a must see), Dangerous Liasons, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, And Justice for All, Dog day in the afternoon, Serpico, The killing fields, etc.Anyway, about this movie ""Identity"", I've seen it many times. At times I shut off the video to listen to the soundtrack in the background while I work on other stuff to try and find ""the"" connection between whats happening in the movie and what's happening underneath my conscious reality - as I perceive it. Am I inferring I might have MPD and am unaware of it? No. In that there is no loss of time rules that out. Still, that is not to say there are distinct ""other"" personalities lurking within that have a logic all their own: Because They are there. Freuds very relevant work in the field of psychology (not psychiatry) which was later made accessible in the book ""Im OK you're OK"" by Dr. Thomas Harris - makes this fact amply clear. Still, going a bit beyond Freuds precepts or those made evident thru Transactional Analysis there is this other exceptionally neat idea (reality more like) of roles assigned to us by society or as Jung would put ""the collective consciousness"" by a guy John Bradshaw in his book ""healing the shame that binds you"". But why bring this up? What do the principles or ideas in these books have to do with movie ""identity"" - Everything! There is a key here - a key to a door. A Door that leads to maybe, just maybe, a truer self? The movie identity forces me to ask questions like these and in doing its function is fulfilled.Assuming we are all acting at all times (like so-called normal people do and will continue to do) and living out these roles assigned to us by the mass consciousness, what does that say about us? Does the fact that we are all questionably ""LIVING"" out these assembled roles and identities not lead to a higher question of our validity? Are we real or not... Doggoneit? More to point are we even alive or Yikes! manifestations of Virtual Reality? Could that be called life? Still, whether it is it's intention or not, the co-efficient of 'identity' is one big looming question; Are YOU really YOU? If you are not you.. are you not then in reality a FRankenstein? Yes! Absolutely Yes! So I have a look at 'identity' now and then because (with the innocence of a child) it hands me a mirror and says ""wanna have a look?"".",Identity
438,AbrahamFroman,Laughable,1,19 July 2006,"movies these days have been going downhill fast. Identity was merely one of the first of many movies to signal such times. The movie pretends to take place in reality when in fact it takes place inside the head of a psycho and all the characters are personalities. There is one huge basic problem with this sort of story: personalities are personalities, not people. They do not interact with other personalities and figuratively or literally kill each other such as portrayed in the movie. The true interactivity comes from the outside and not the inside of the brain. The other problem is the truth of this story takes all of the so-called ""thrilling"" aspects out of the film and turns it into something sub-standard.

439,centaur84-650-156428,Near Perfect Psychological Thriller,8,2 February 2010,"Identity has been compared to many films like Fight Club, Saw and even Sixth Sense because of the twist-ending. But that's where the similarities end.Identity is a psychological thriller and by my understanding of the genre, such movies engage the audience by having them intelligently guess who the villain is while distracting them with several twists in the plot. And Identity does that brilliantly.The story is written in your typical 'whodunnit' fashion. A bunch of strangers from different places, leading different lives, get stranded in a motel for the night, no thanks to the convenient timing of torrential downpour. Predictably they get murdered one by one in gruesome manner until the killer is finally found and stopped. Or so you think.Identity is a movie that plays heavily on character development, which to me is something that lacks in modern thrillers. The well-timed flashbacks satisfy the audience's need to know how the strangers ended up in the same place at the same time and the dialog between characters build chemistry. The cast do a great job of keeping the tension by balancing sympathy and suspicion.The movie's twist at the end is fitting. After taunting you for so long the twist is near perfect for those who like their movies with a reasonable explanation of events. All the movie's clichés are immediately forgiven and forgotten.Identity may not be an all-time classic but it doesn't deserve the negative remarks from some reviewers. It is a well-thought out movie that pays attention to detail and makes a sincere effort to end the film as a realistically as possible.Identity is NOT a horror movie as some seem to think although the movie does fool audience into thinking there is some sort of supernatural force at work in the beginning.Saying too much in a review may just give away the numerous twists in the movie so I urge you to just watch it.

SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called ""Max"", but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was). He pulled off drama equally as well as he does comedy. An impressive talent.And an impressive film.",Identity
442,clargarrr,A Brilliant Thriller with an Unforeseen Twist,9,24 June 2016,"I would have rated it a perfect 10/10 if not because of this:The movie ended with an inconclusive state for Ginny.If we say she did not survive, we assume two scenarios: (1) Each key represents the personality that was killed off in Malcolm's psyche. So, all in all 10 personalities have died. (2) Ginny was the sixth one to be killed. This means that she has key #5 with her - remember that we are counting the killings in descending order.HOWEVER..It was shown nowhere in the movie how Ginny was killed by Timmy. So, it can be said that aside from Timmy (who was seen walking away from the car explosion), Ginny (whose body was never found after the explosion) also remained alive.Although we can safely say that the reason why we never saw Ginny's body after the explosion was because it happened at the same time all the bodies started disappearing, it would have been better if they showed the scene where Timmy killed Ginny. Like, for example: As soon as Ginny and Timmy got inside the car, Timmy gets out while Ginny starts the engine. Timmy runs away from the car as far as he can (because he knows it's about to explode), and as Ginny steps out of the car to call Timmy, the car explodes.",Identity

The plot progresses nicely (albeit a little predictably) and includes a series of sufficiently tense scenes to warrant this being called a thriller.... then comes a point where the film tries to be clever, and utterly fails. And then it tries further, and fails further. In some films, things like these can be cast aside to some degree: the film might be good, 'but' this and that. Here, without spoiling anything, the elements that challenge the integrity of the film are such that they kill the quality of the experience entirely.

Later, and this isn't really a spoiler, people get killed but who is the killer? Who will manage to survive? The problem is that this movie behaves a little like the ""Lost"" series, each new revelation seems disjointed from the rest and not making sense.

I found it to be a real good psychological thriller - and though the director pulled the rug out from under you a few times when you looked back at everything - it all makes sense.  You can complain about some things being predictable or convenient, but to see a movie that was scarier for what you heard but did not see instead of just filling the screen with gore was definitely welcome.

The overdone ""sunny fields"" to cheesey ""Children of the Corn""-esque ending ruined this for me.
We knew Liotta's character was no good from seeing his back early in the movie, but I think they overplayed the whodunit shifting a little too much during the course of the movie.Again, the concept was good, just not carried to fruition.

The drama plays out as 1 by 1 death befalls the group of unlikely suspects.  Each killing a bit more sorted in when and how it happened.

The story had potential and could have had a decent ending, but the creators must have decided that to try to reduce the chance of predicting the ending, they would use cheap tricks and intentionally omit vital information.  After hearing (as stated in the promos) that 10 people are stranded together and are being killed one-by-one, the first thing that should come to mind is Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None,"" otherwise called ""Ten Little Indians."" Instead of crediting this masterful work, the movie references a cheaply done (though moderately enjoyable) mini-series from the '80s based on the book. A sign of a poor mystery is when vital information or characters are introduced late in the story for the sole purpose of misleading the viewer and making it theoretically impossible to know who-dunnit.  If you recognize these tricks for what they are, the conclusion of the movie is obvious about 20-25 minutes into the film. A true hack job.",Identity

I don't mind clues being omitted to heighten the surprise (but I hate it when details are added, clues are always too simple and spoil everything).Once the twist was added, the story was obvious, but pleasantly so. I was a bit surprised when our hero then appeared back at the motel to fight his demons.The very ending was a classic hollywood ploy for an ending that still remained pleasing.

I love John Cusack so much so I was so excited when he did this movie. It was a good movie, a little unrealistic, and the scene where Paris (Amanda Peet) is screaming that she gives up was a huge rip off of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""***VERY BIG SPOILER AHEAD***.....
Okay, throughout the whole movie Timmy was very suspicious to me...and he was always there throughout every murder...I was getting a little fed up..But then at the end when he's standing there with Amanda Peet, his facial expression just had me laughing.

459,antiwalkerthest,Good until the third and final act.,5,29 July 2019,"This was a genuinely decent film for the first two acts. There was suspense, there was an omnipresent sense of mystery, the plot twists were nicely thought out and the characters were good enough to make me care about what was gonna happen to them and what would eventually happen to them. Even though it did feel formulaic and kinda cliched because there have been plenty of movies in the past with similar concepts to Identity, it was all easily overlooked thanks to its excellent execution.Unfortunately, that's where it stops being good. By the time we reached the final act, it went downhill really fast. As soon as one grand plot twist presented itself to the viewer, another plot twist that was twice as grand as the previous twist was shown. And then it did it again. And again and again.Usually, I don't have a problem with movies that have quite a few too many plot twists so long as they maintain the sense that whoever is writing it is competent enough to handle its story, but when you bombard the viewer with a ridiculous number of plot twists that the story becomes too convoluted to properly follow, then that's the point of when you should realize that you're doing something totally wrong, but this movie didn't get the memo.Instead, it continued to move right ahead to inject even more plot twists trying to out think itself that it backfired as a result. What we got in the end was an overblown movie that got so gluttonous that it consumed more calories than it could handle, only to vomit away all of its food as punishment for eating way too much.For all of its merits that this movie had, there were an equal number of blemishes that balanced out its merits to create what I'd consider an average movie. It's too bad, really. If the third act didn't stray away from what the movie was trying to do with its first two acts, then maybe it would've been decent because that's what I certainly thought it was going to be.",Identity

In the end, the only saving graces of it were John Cusack and Amanda Peet. The movie started out well, but the last half was predictable (c'mon, the kid is the last one to go into the mother's bedroom? that was the point where the movie started going downhill) and the ""twist"" was not a twist at all if you had been paying any attention to the film. The movie was too short and should've been at least another 20 minutes. The whole cast did a really good job though - I thought it was kinda funny how three of the members were or are on shows on ""Must See TV"" on NBC (the guy from Good Morning, Miami, the Scrubs guy, and the friend from Mad About You) and I didn't really realize it was Rebecca DeMornay until the last few minutes of her performance but thought the irony of her role was pretty funny, too. This movie was more a pyschological thriller than a slasher thriller. It had the occasional ""jumpy parts"" but ultimatly, you were spending more time trying to figure the movie out in your head (for those of you who haven't seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) than you were covering your eyes. If they had really wanted to, they could've easily made this movie PG-13 - the violence wasn't that gory, it was more just the ""after"" picture of it and the only other thing they would've had to change was the language - too much use of the 'f' word. But had they had done that, the movie wouldn't have been the movie that it was and I'm glad that they made it this way. I mean, if you were isolated with nine other strangers in a crummy motel in the middle of a thunderstorm and one by one people were gettting offed, would you really say ""oh, dang it, I should've stayed home""?

I am rarely caught off guard by a plot, since I'm not only a film fanatic but also a screenwriter. It takes a LOT for a film's plot to dupe me, since, odds are (and you writers out there, I'm sure), we've seen it before. ""Identity"" is one of those exceptions. This is why the device of cutting back to the hearing with Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) nd his psychiatrist (Alfred Molina) every so often annoyed me.Aside from it taking away (even if it was towards the end) from my utter surprise (though not completely), I really wanted to stay at that motel, with those people, until the ending. It was so engaging, right from the beginning, and escalated so rapidly and compellingly, I felt that each time we were whisked away to the shrink's or lawyer's offices, I was missing something. Sure, that's the genius of this plot, that I was wrong, but it still bugged me.I hate having anything about a mystery given away. I want to be just as much in the dark, trying to figure out what the hell is happening, as are the characters. I like being surprised, caught off guard and fooled (by movies anyway). It is so hard to do it well and so seldom that a mystery is as artful as this, that any diversion is unwelcome.While some complain that the ending is too upsetting or unsatisfying, I was properly stunned and though I thought I was fairly sure what would happen,I was wrong. THAT is a cool ending. As Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp)...or was it John Shooter (John Turturro)?...says in ""The Secret Window"" (Stephen King), ""The most important part of the story is the ending."" ""Identity"" lives up to that admirably.Enough has been written about the excellent cast, but I would like to add that it was a great pleasure seeing John Cusack and Ray Liotta, two greats, both incredibly cool in different ways, play off one another, jockeying for ""alpha male"" position! You expect that from Liotta; not Cusack. The entire cast, however, was excellent. Amanda Peet, especially, was very sympathetic, so much so that you expect her to turn out to be nothing like she seems, in this labyrinth of fake identities and made-up life stories.I was disappointed and surprised that Rebecca DeMornay (was ""that actress"" an allusion to ""Gilligan's Island""? Was the whole motel? lol) was used so briefly. She was a real villain in ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle""! The geographical ""name-game"" was another nice twist, used by many directors and writers (remember the G.I.'s in ""Forrest Gump"", none of whom were named after their actual places of origins?).This film, despite a few (minor) weaknesses, was excellent, edge-of-your-seat, great story-telling!

These inconsistencies are explained through a plot device that I have always found unappealing, (if you see the movie you know what the mechanism is) the use of this device and especially the fact that it is revealed halfway through the movie greatly devalues viewer's interest in the outcome, which I found to be thoroughly predictable. Conversely, if the finish hadn't been mostly revealed at that time the continuity errors may have made give up before the end, in short it just doesn't work. The psychological aspect and psychologist scenes are shallow and implausible. I actually think this setting would have worked better as a straight slasher. I also found the lack of gore disappointing. Characters die off in a blink of an eye, the audience has little chance to be fearful for them or develop tension, and only two scenes had any element of suspense at all for me. Once the mystery unravels our empathy for the characters is unraveled as well, and by the last 30 minutes of the film you're just waiting for the credits.",Identity

It was the sort of film where you are not really surprised when somebody gets killed - you even expect it. But it is the manner of the killing, and the meaning for the rest of the story that really matters. The editing is excellent - though it gets a little flaccid in the last 15 minutes or so (and so a vote of 9 rather than 10). The acting is excellent. I could definitely enjoy watching this again. Once you've understood what the story is about then there really is only one 'person' who could be the real perpetrator - but the beauty of the film is that it works just like a nightmare (as the viewer you are on the inside taking it all as real).",Identity

There were several clues and twists and turns that were pretty easy to spot, but other twists that were surprising to me.I think in a film like this my guide was Ginny who has some hints of sixth sense esp ability (she senses evil when Rhodes pulls up which totally tips that plot twist) and she makes the key reference (10 Little Indians [lets you know that there is a common connection between the characters and also gives you a key [pardon the pun] hint about the final twist]).  Of course she is not quite psychic enough to save herself.The move's pacing was good and quick while still slowing in a couple of places where the tension was high.

There are a couple of good performances, but the explanation at the ending is so lame, it made me feel embarrassed for the good actors caught in the mess.

However this movie is not at all original, no matter how well done its filmed. It actually reminds me 3 films and i think it has taken their basic ideas and made it into one movie. Those are final destination, ussual suspects and primal fear. Final destination gives the idea of the patern of the deaths with the key numbers, ussual suspects gives the idea of the fake character story that all have something in common and you dont discover this till the end, and primal fear the multiple personality aspect. offcource it borrows things from other films too, like from hitchkok's type of films, with the single location type of shooting and spooky atmosphere and more.....so to sum up, i really enjoyed this movie, cusack and liota are 2 actors i dont really like a lot, but their performances here were prety good.

497,MisterMovieMan,This is the only review you should read.,4,2 May 2003,"Identity?  Who is who or what(?!), not so much who is the killer.  I will not give away any of this film or run pointlessly through every scene like other people who review movies on this site will do so read on...You can say this movie is over-cliched with horror elements like other reviewers have stated, but it is quite intentional and that is the best part of this film.  It's typical slasher setups and scenes are well designed for scares and/or suspense and you will find yourself engrossed in the first half of this film.  The direction and well crafted scenes are good enough here to blend suspense and confusion into good entertainment.To all those who claim this movie is only for ""intelligent"" viewers please don't write another review ever again. Scenes in the first half of this film may be standard to modern horror but because of the acting talent of most of it's stars, it comes off far better than many films of this genre.  But when it comes time to blend all of this films confusion and mystery with a meaningful, satisfying resolution it falls flat.  You may be surprised, but if you don't feel had, you weren't really paying attention. So all of you who claim this to be a highly intelligent psychological thriller, you apparently don't realize the writer of this was also responsible for Jack Frost and its sequel.  It must have been about time for him to create the next thriller/surprise film and try to break into the money-making theatrical market.James Mangold is not without talent and he tries terribly to make this bad script work and it may have, if only he treated it less seriously.  The disorder you will see in Identity is turned cartoon-ish by Hollywood yet again here and if you are a Psychology major like one reviewer here claimed, you shouldn't be thrilled by this film but insulted.  It's only there for the surprise not coherency.  We don't actually know anything about the surprise character either, so when the story turns down a different road it doesn't really work and destroys everything there was good about the movie (unless of course your mind is too locked in ""WOW - I - AM - SUR-PRISED"" mode).  The other plot twist is predictable if you are used to ""who-dun-it horror"" and  ridiculous as well in flashback scenes shown near the film's climax.Cusak turns in an expected good performance here.  Liotta plays another defiant/angry character as he usually does these days but still remains beleiveable and the remaining members of the cast do a good job as well except...Amanda Peet is not a great actress.  Please don't base your review on whether someone is cute or not - it's insulting to those who know and appreciate good filmmaking.  Go watch Blind Date.  She should stick to bad comedies because when she acts out any real emotions in this film it's usually unintentionally funny. Nevertheless she wasn't as terrible as I expected she would be. Pruitt Taylor Vince was clearly miscast but since his character was poorly underwritten as well it didn't matter.  His performance was barely acceptable.Identity is not a total waste.  In fact, it is an improvement over many recent horror outings of the past few months (if I mentioned any of them I'd be too scared someone would respond that they were actually good) though it could be skipped without loss just as well.  See it merely to be entertained, but don't think about it too long to the point of delusion or you'll make it into a masterpiece (like others here have) which it clearly is not. ** out of ****.",Identity

The cast delivered very good performances, especially John Cusack. Now this is not a horror, but it will still have you closing one eye resisting the urge to turn away. The shots were very good with creating some jaw clenching suspense, they were the type of shots you see in horror movies where you know that something bad is seconds from happening.By the first ten or twenty minutes you get this feeling that the entire movie is going to be nonstop suspense that gives you a feeling as if you were the character but instead of you making the decisions you are being forced into them. This movie holds up the entire time and would have been great but...The ending. The movie got your hopes up because it had a really original good idea and had you pretty scared throughout, and it was executed so poorly it made me legitimately upset and kind of angry.

The rainstorm, cheap motel, remote desert locations, and offbeat characters with secrets to hide make for a suspenseful horror-mystery.  The use of the hotel room keys was a clever device. The cast does well.  John Cusack is compelling in his first horror film, and Ray Liotta is well-cast as a seemingly inept policeman.  And the sultry Amanda Peets makes the most of her character. She is not a mindless sex object, helpless damsel-in-distress, or an invulnerable superwoman, but a frightened yet determined woman doing her best to stay alive. In addition, Rebecca DeMornay shows a terrific sence of humor and self-parody as a snooty, washed-up actress who stumbles into the confusion.  But just as the film seems to be nearing an exciting climax, it takes a disastrous wrong turn.  It becomes a dull psychological courtroom drama that undermines everything that has happened.

It was suggested as ""similar to Psycho"" on a random website and I just picked it up.
I watched it with a couple of friends later the same day and I was a little nervous suggesting that we watch it. Mostly because it could be trash for all I knew.I knew and liked some of the cast from other movies I had watched in the past and that gave me hope that it could be good.Then began the movie - as soon as it had started, the tape recordings had me instantly hooked.What I didn't expect was to enjoy the movie as much as we did. The plot was very engaging and suspenseful and kept us glued to our seats. The setting was perfect as lives of 10 strangers intertwined with each others' as they found themselves stranded in a torrential rainstorm at a remote motel.
Trapped, inescapable characters in a slasher movie? Always works great.What followed was wild and not completely predictable and at one point suggested that something supernatural might be at play since there was no other way the events could be explained.I did predict parts of it but the ending still left me surprised.To conclude, I'll say that Identity is a very entertaining movie and will leave you guessing and excited the entire time.",Identity

But God bless Hollywood for needing to shove another unnecessary twist ending into a movie that would have been JUST FINE without it.

The acting-excellent, the directing-amazing, and the writing-superb. This is definitely a movie that you should not wait to see on video, so go see it now :)",Identity
516,ArdentGuy,It's only a dream...so why should we care anymore?,3,7 June 2004,"SPOILERS within....I found the first two thirds of Identity to be exceptionally captivating. Very weird. Very interesting. I was immediately pulled into the story and joined the group of characters in trying to unravel the riddles of the events that are occurring. What a challenge to try to resolve the mystery of the countdown keys! How to explain the disappearing bodies! Or trying to come up with a plausible explanation how Jake Busey escapes but ends up back at the same Motel. Then comes the mystery of ""May 10th"". WOW! What fun to explore different theories. Identity was turning into some kind of Twilight Zone thriller.Then two thirds of the way into this wonderful who-dunit came what has been called here, ""the twist"". Immediately after the ""May 10th"" mystery is set-up, it is revealed that all the events and characters, the movie itself, is taking place in the mind of a criminal. These characters are his multiple personalities playing out within his mind. The movie is someone's dream. The big ""twist"" is to tell we the audience that none of these people exist. ""Guess what folks,"" the movie says. ""None of what you have watched ever took place!""My two biggest issues with Identity:1. The copout of 'it's only a dream' to explain all the mysteries. I found this to be quite a letdown to what could have been an outstanding mystery. However I could have overlooked this flaw had it not been for the following.2. The narrative returns to the dream world of the Motel after it is revealed that this is a completely fictional environment. What a waste of time. For the next seven and a half painful minutes we are asked to care about the outcome of characters that we have been told don't exist. This is a huge mistake for this film. At this point, I lost all interest in Identity. All of the characters pains, frustrations, feelings, desires, motivations....EVERYTHING became moot. Additional murders occur, but who cares: it's only a dream. These are no longer people being killed. We learn that Ray Liotta's character is not whom he appears to be. But again, who cares. He could have just as well been a space alien at this point. It's only a dream! There is no reason to care about the outcome of these imaginary people at the motel. In the end, when the final 'twist' of which character was actually responsible is revealed, Paris is killed. Her death is meaningless because she never really existed to begin with.In short, I lost all sense of association with these non-characters. Identity would have been much better had it wrapped up all the action within Malcolm Rivers' mind before revealing that Malcolm's mind was the location of all the action. There can be no suspense in a man's dream where anything can happen.",Identity
517,ArdentGuy,Excellent thriller ---- until the last reel,3,23 July 2007,"IDENTITY is a well-made, stylistic thriller completely ruined by a foolish plot twist near the end that invalidates everything the audience has seen. The last reel ruins the previous five by invalidating all that has occurred. The intense mystery and suspense from the first 75 minutes is destroyed. Once it is revealed that none of the characters exist, the viewer loses any interest or sense of dread. Suddenly the audience is stranded with no reason to care for the imaginary characters, their actions, or the conclusion of the film. The film IDENTITY loses its own identity in the last 15 minutes and becomes an extremely dissatisfying viewing experience.",Identity

It tries way to hard to be shocking and comes off as stupid; however, I understand the concept of playing to the lowest common denominator and this movie will make those people feel smart.I thought the movie had potential, but once again I was let down.

520,schebelek,Whodunnit is no question,6,19 October 2003,"Alright. We all love curiousity in a movie, right? Maybe we don't like the term, or the concept or maybe the word itself because of conditional reasons but we al feel good while watching a movie if it makes you feel curious. So, here's an entertainment for all of those who watch movies. You will not be bored and you will have some good time. But. With SPOILERS included to exemplify. This movie lacks ""meta-logic"". Inside, it depends on psychological reasons and outside it's unacceptable. Unlike the Matrix which sets up perfect metacognition around the story-making us ask questions on the reality of the reality, Identity spoils the logic in itself. How many of those who watched the movie, really know if the Doctor really exists or not? Although the scarred personality of Eleven-people-in-a-body decides to kill the Doctor at the end of the end, can't that also be a just his imagination? If yes, what? If no, what? I have read the story of ten little niggers-And then there were none and it was a brilliant one which the movie openly and with gratitude  accepts as its starting point or as its source of inspiration. But why did they need to add the psychology of a madman whose madness is questioned. Although the movie plays heavily on the story, with the fiveminuteflashbacks, the real things to be remembered are made forgotten by the movie which ends in both positive and negative reactions from the vidience. Positively, you keep forgetting your own guess which was possibly true for the sake of the new truth brought before your eyes which you accept as true info since that's the latest news in movie. e.g. Most should accept that they forgot about the possibility of the kid when they saw that Ed was brought in front of the Doctor and lawyers and the judge. Negatively, the movie lost track of the truth for the sake of the twists which may mean only one thing: This is a movie which tries to fool the fool to get recognition. SO American and so Americanishly reinforcing for consuming. If you liked the movie, it's no problem. If you hated it for my reasons, that means you are alert and you are not fooled by the rubbish which repeats itself because it makes people feel good that way. I am sorry to go far beyond the watched and the heard. But this is how things work. You make people seek the thrill of stupid reasoning because it makes a stupid movie an entertainment that way. Then you donot even need to realise that people lose their philosophy. This movie is bad. I will not add particular comments on the cast which were actually very very good. Avoid this kind of movies for they are like cigarettes.A puff of smoke for leisure, but there is nothing in it.",Identity

The elements of the plot are so cliched that it reminded me of something that Donald Kaufman (the less-talented fictional brother in ""Adaptation"") might have successfully pitched.  The ""big revelation"" was heavily telegraphed beforehand and only elicited a ho-hum response from the audience, and by the end of the movie I was thoroughly bored (although one woman in the row behind me loudly stated ""I don't get it"" when the film ended, but that's LA audiences for you).",Identity

You are never really sure who the killer is in the movie, and when you find out in the end, it is a real shock. Also, this is the only movie I can think of that includes a red herring. That is, something that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, it has absolutely no relevance to the movie, the only point of its existance is to trick you into believing it does have some importance.

I never saw or expected that the child's character would have been the murderer (spoiler) and the amazing thing about this movie is that it was left for the very end so all you movie buffs out there you have to watch every minute of the show.

My suspicions where as good as confirmed during the opening titles, with more 'subtle' hints along the way. That's not to say that this is a bad film. A fantastic cast helps this film along with John Cusack being as watchable as ever, and Amanda Peet making a particularly good job of things. The atmosphere of the movie is great, with the Motel location being suitably claustrophobic, and the sound and visuals of the 'Desert Storm' adding to the suspense.Not in the same league as Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects or Memento, but enjoyable all the same.",Identity

John Cusack, Ray Liotta and all the rest of the cast deliver excellent performances in a classic one-set, blind-alley, dark and wet location (as seen in several movies from 'Key Largo' and onwards).It's a cool thrill on a hot summers day.

Especially near the end when Cusack's character is figuring out what the connection is with the driving licences.Jake Busey as Robert Maine was good, although a small role. He freaked me out in Contact and he managed to freak me out in this one as well.The movie wasted Clea DuVall's talent though with that small role.Pruitt Taylor Vince, I LOVE that guy.

Not even close to a level of a Mulholland Drive, but it is Lynch-like in some ways.

So I was going into it with NO expectations whatsoever... well, I did watch Ebert and Roeper a while ago and they gave it ""one thumb up"" so that was it.Right... well, the premise of the movie:  10 strangers, one hotel, twists and turns, stabby stabby.  A ton of this movie was SO predictable but yet I thought that aspects of the ending were not as predictable.  Sure, people call the Schitzo take on everything unoriginal and stuff but I thought that that aspect of the movie was not predictable at all... until everything comes together near the end.SO MUCH POTENTIAL and it was all lost with ""little timmy"".  IDENTITY had the potential of an EXCELLENT psychological thriller with the schitzo thing but it was all lost inthe very very end with little timmy and his CHEEZY line ""Whores don't get a second chance"".  THey should have ended it on a happy note with Ray Liotta being the murdering personality like he was instead of stupid timmy.  As soon as Paris finds the key and looks up and sees timmy there I BURST out laughing... my friends did too... then he said his crappy end line and everyone booed the movie.  TERRIBLE!

So I didn't think this was scary, but neither did the friends I went with who are scared of scary movies.  It's definitely intense in the theater, but don't expect to have nightmares or freak out if you're sleeping alone that night. With that said, despite the fact that it wasn't scary, I thought it was a great movie!  I love original story lines, and this was one that I'd never seen before.  The twist is completely unpredictable, but I think it's good to not always know what's going to happen.  I was totally surprised by The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, but I think I liked those movies better because they weren't your typical ""'good' guy's going to win because everybody likes a happy, predictable ending"" kind of movie.  I suppose if you go into this movie thinking you're going to figure everything out from subtle clues, you're probably going to come out disappointed.

546,clough77,The Usual Suspects,4,15 May 2003,"Once again American cinema falls victim to the old Hollywood ideology: If it made money before, why not again?  Four years ago The Sixth Sense started a trend of `intelligent shockers' that movie execs are still bleeding audiences with to this day.  Unfortunately, trying to bottle-up the magic of The Sixth and pass it off as something new usually leaves me with a Sense of repetitiveness and with Identity, wasted time.  A bad case of unbelievable happenchance finds ten strangers marooned in a roadside motel with no working phones and all roads leading out rendered useless by a raging storm.  One by one the unfortunate guests meet with grizzly demise without many clues to who the killer actually is.  The obvious suspect is the convict (Jake Busey), but as Ed (John Cusack) and Rhodes (Ray Liotta), the natural leaders of the group, try and find some answers, the bodies start to pile up and the identity of the killer becomes more mysterious and complex.  With strong performances from Cusack and Liotta and a perfectly eerie setting for a horror show, there was enough about James Mangold's Identity to keep me interested.  But by the end of the second act the writing takes a turn for the worst, or more accurately, a turn towards the familiar.  The way this movie plays out has been done countless times before and in better style.  And there in lies the problem: Why spend ninety minutes and nine bucks on a film that seems pointless and trite?  So if you like The Sixth Sense or The Ring or any other number of similarly formulated films I suggest renting your favorite intelligent-shocker/plot-twist flick and spend a night at home.

The movie has been out for a long time and I finally decided to rent it about 3-4 weeks ago and after watching it I said to myself ""I should've seen this long time ago"". The synopsis of the movie is one night when a thunderous storm occurs, 10 strangers meet each other in a small motel. A limo driver (Cusack), a cop (Liotta), a prostitute (Peet), a newlywed couple, a husband, wife and their son, an actress and prisoner who is with the policeman. And at the same time of the movie another convict who was found guilty on murder charges is in a meeting with district attorneys and a psychiatrist to talk about the execution tomorrow.But what starts to get the viewers all pumped up and chilled is that one by one a person in the motel gets killed. The whole point is for the remaining people to try to find out the killer. John Cusack who is the main character of the movie plays his character perfectly and smartly gives his best performance to date, the same with Amanda Peet. Ray Liotta was an average performer in the movie and could've of done better. He wasn't as nasty as his character was to be assigned. What I simply adored about the film was that it had me moving and my eyes wide open to all the twists, dialogue, actions, etc. that were going on during the movie. It had all different types of personalities you had to think about to try to guess about the murderer. I'll tell you, I guessed on 3 different characters and I was wrong. What the movie should've done to make it much better was by expanding on the idea. Make it a little longer so the person watching the film could keep thinking.

Identity somehow use the movie technique of Momento, several lines go to a final destination to describe a story, but it is more reasonable in reasoning. From the beginning, I suspect that the cop himself is the criminal, but I never thought about the mean actor of the movie, a former cop who is so tough and calm in such a situation could be one of the character ,or we say fiction of that psycho, less to think that boy could be the final cold blooded killer! Yes, he is, the final scene told us everything and every answers to those painstaking riddles.Every character in this movie performs well.

I guess if you like being blugeoned with an absurd plot and terible character development, go ahead, but the sensible few, steer clear.  Also I think this movie has a better rating than Russian Ark.

In ""Identity"", the answer is murder by numbers and the setting befits this most excellently - an extraordinarily mysterious and sinister concoction of horror, thrill, mysticism, and frustration.The film begins with several characters finding their fates intertwined with each other when all of them were trapped in a heavy storm and had to seek protection in a motel. Ironically, they became trapped in a predicament instead. They realised this when one of them was found brutally murdered and mutilated. The characters then decided that before the killing progressed further, they needed to find and arrest the murderer. As they stumbled along their investigation, more of them got killed.Such a situation makes the audience think really hard about who may be the culprit. Normally, the audience starts naming their guesses as more incidents occur. This is exactly what happens with this film too, but as the plot continues to roll on, the audience will grow even more bewildered and surprised because things slowly become unexplainable. Then the twists come, making the intricate plot even more compelling.If you stay focused when watching this film, you will find an extremely brilliant plot. It is not merely about murder in a motel, but the plot goes far beyond that to explore the complexities of human mind and their relation to identity. Remember, the film is not entitled ""Identity"" for nothing.",Identity
554,gillmojo,Worth a watch if you are bored,5,17 August 2014,"If you are looking for a genuine teaser, something to make you think, move right along. I watched this with a friend and we had it figured out within twenty minutes. We spent the rest of the movie basically waiting for the scenarios we had described to play out, which they duly did. It's not terrible, it just doesn't have anything in particular to recommend it. A shame really as John Cusack is usually worth a watch, and I personally enjoy Ray Liotta's performances. Sadly, here, they were at best clichéd and at worst without depth to their characters. We found it hard to care what happened to any of the cast as they were either unlikeable with no redeeming features or absolutely pointless. The makers also decided that sticking the wonderful Alfred Molina behind a desk and barely giving him anything to say or do was a great idea; what a waste of a real talent. The storyline had potential but somebody decided not to go with that and to make a predictable, plodding, barely above a B-movie effort instead.",Identity
555,James-denney,clever,8,23 March 2005,good film contains some gory scenes of violence but has a brilliant plot line.most of the actors are unheard of but they do a good job. great suspense throughout the movie. it keeps you guessin whats happening next and definitely does not bore you and even if your not a film lover or don't like mystery thrillers you still wont fall to sleep. Not a horror film just a thriller and mystery. Cracking film should be watched even if it is only once from my point of view this is a 5 star must see movie. the soundtrack is just orchestral and symphonic but works very well with what is happening on screen. if you are going to buy this as a DVD do not buy the 2 disk collectors edition since it does not contain any good quality extras on the bonus DVD.,Identity

The movie can seem a bit predictable but all in all you will be completely surprised by the truth behind the ten strangers. The movie throws out clues here and there and there are some points which leave you totally confused.You will need to concentrate during this movie and whatever you do if you're watching with a friend who has already seen it don't ask them ""hey what just happened there?"", the movie will confuse you but all is explained by the end of the movie. The dialog is great and John Cusack plays a terrific lead role along side Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John C Mcginley.The tension grows as the characters slowly start to get killed off which brings the survivors closer as they learn unusual things about each other that they strangely have in common. The fact that the entire movie is at night during a huge storm creates an extra dimension of fear and makes you feel completely unsafe and uneasy during the movie (which is always a great factor in a horror/thriller).The movie does a great job at tricking the audience into believing they know what will happen in the end, and just when you think you've got it, it completely flips on you.This movie proves to be one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time which adds a whole other dimension of fear and mystery to the film which is unique and delivers everything you expect, and a whole lot more!",Identity
557,WatchinMovies01,Explanation,9,27 May 2005,"OK, everyone seems to be confused about this movie so let me explain it for everyone. The killer has a multiple personality syndrome, and was being treated in a psychiatric home. They have tapes of him portraying many different personalities, and they believe that one of his many personalities is the killer. The reason everyone has the same birthday is that every person is really him, all of these characters are made up in this guys mind. The way they figure they can cure him of his multiple personalities is to have them all come together inside of his head and hopefully they will all be killed off, with the risk that the killer will be one of the personalities killed. Let me repeat, the point of that motel, is to have all the personalities come together hoping that they will all die except for one, that one takes control of his life. As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left. In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead, except for the girl. But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet. The exercise that they tried to do was complete, all the personalities died inside of his head, unfortunately the only personality that survived was the one that was the killer. I hope that clears it up a little bit.",Identity

The suspense is good, each character is developed well and the final twist is totally unexpected. The acting seems a little cheesy at the start but stick with it, it gets better and the storyline alone is worth watching. It begins with an excellent scene which manages to introduce us briefly to all the characters, and explains how they came to be at the motel.The characters are varied- a troubled young couple, a prostitute, a limo driver and his movie star client to name but a few. At first this seems like a typical horror movie- people are killed off one by one and no one knows who the killer is, but as it develops there are some interesting twists and turns. The fact that there is a storm the whole way through the movie adds to the creepy feeling, and leaves you slightly uneasy as certain guests stray from their rooms. Although it has many deaths, it is not particularly scary or violent. Definitely a must see.",Identity

This movie gets progressively more pointless and retarded until about 10 minutes from the end when it takes on a ludicrous ending obviously (ill)conceived after the fact, then it just becomes low comedy. It felt like they just tacked on an entirely different movie's ending in a desperate effort to make this everyones-being-murdered-at-the-motel rehash #247 less formulaic.I can't fathom how the guy who wrote and directed a classic movie like copland could move on to film this piece of trash. It's like working your whole life to be CEO then applying for a job in the mailroom 6 years later. Maybe this movie is actually just part of a conspiracy by the director to round up everyone who was excited by the ""surprise ending"" and take them to a motel to celebrate its sequel where they'll all be systematically murdered for a snuff film.

It completely dissipates any suspense that has been built over the previous 80 minutes or so.The final scene is laugh out loud hilarious although I suspect the film makers intention was quite the reverse.I am fairly sure they intended to jolt us out of our seats as Brian De Palma did so effectively in Carrie all those years ago (a device copied ad nauseum ever since with varying degrees of success.

The motif of the dark stormy night, and the cheap motel invokes the a 'Film Noir' feel to the movie. Strong performances by all the cast, including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and John C McGinley. This movie is an exploration of the ""reality"" of the inner mind, and it's power to shape reality to it's own preferences. My only criticism is that the movie seems to move backwards and forwards in some parts, thus confusing the viewer that the Point of View may be in flashback. I think the story would have been just as effective to not use the flashback scenes, and just show everything in chronological order. The flashback technique, though well executed in this movie, does nothing to enhance the story, or the viewer's understanding of the film, unless of course the director wanted to that merely to keep the audience off balance.",Identity

Fairly quickly you will deduce not all is as it seems.  As more details are presented, the idea of a supernatural cause becomes more and more realistic; yet, at no point does the movie seem supernatural.Is this a slasher movie?  In the classic sense, yes.  There are murders. There is blood.  There is a knife, a bat, a gun, even an exploding car. But in the end, the hows of the murders are unimportant.The best hint to give to understand this movie is simple: pay close attention to all the details and make no assumptions.  Upon recollection of all the details, it becomes VERY obvious what is going on.Kudos for keeping the suspense going and allowing the audience to make their own minds over what happens.

Essentially, this is a murder mystery in a classic scenario of 'group of people trapped in a location (a motel) with someone killing them off one by one'.I don't want to spoil the film for you, so all I can say is that at first the emphasis of the story, for the viewer, is 'whodunnit', and of course there are opportunities to consider almost all the group... However, something then happens so that you have to reevaluate what you are watching. The emphasis remains on 'whodunnit' - even though your framing of that question will have changed. Then something else happens, so you have to reevaluate again, and so on.I can only assume that the people who did not like this film are the sort of people who will not have liked 6th Sense because ghosts don't exist do they?

The film doesn't get extremely confusing til the very end where you can't figure out what actually happened and if anything did at all.

Malcolm's various personalities and needs were personified in each character. The prostitute mother (Amanda Peet), the part of him who hated her for being a prostitute (Larry), the loving mother he wish he had, the loving father he wish he had, the selfish part of himself (actress), the violent part of his personality (Ray Liotta and Busey), the irrational emotions he feels and his need to be loved (Ginnie) and his attempts to control those feelings (Lou), the hurt little boy who sees far too many traumatic things in his life, and of course, John Cusack who seems to represent Malcolm himself trying to analyze and understand all the craziness in his mind, tries to follow the rules (accepting responsibility for the car accident), help others (giving Amanda Peet a ride, and stitching up the mother).

At first, the picture appears to be a somewhat conventional horror movie where unrelated guests stranded at a remote Nevada motel in a driving rainstorm are being systematically killed in gruesome fashion.Even then, the superb acting carries the film - especially John Cusack as a limo driver trying to do the right thing and Amanda Peet as a world-wise prostitute.  Eventually a parallel and seemingly unrelated story about a convicted killer who is about to be executed unless his lawyer can get him committed to an insane asylum begins to make its connection to the motel felt.Without giving anything away, it will make your head spin and have you reexamining everything you have seen in order to figure out this brilliant puzzle.

585,tarinbansal,HEAR ME OUT on THIS explanation of the ending!,7,15 May 2021,"Okay so it's a decent edge-of-the-seat mystery thriller with an ending that doesn't really give as big a payoff. There's a simple explanation to the ending that the treatment of Dr. Mallick failed and all the sane personalities got killed in Malcolm Rivers' head leaving him with the one evil identity of Timmy that eventually takes over Malcolm and makes him a pure cold-blooded killer.But this is NOT the main twist is what I feel. My explanation of the ending goes one layer above this. I say Malcolm Rivers didn't just make up those personalities due to his Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), he MADE UP the MPD too in order to save himself from the execution and get a chance to run away once he's out of police custody via an insanity plea. Why do I think so? Hear me out!Let's play by the movie's rules for a while. Let's assume his MPD was real. If it was, the Motel story in his mind, despite being fictional to the rest of the world, is very real to Malcolm. Now Malcolm is probably insane in the real world, but he's fully sane in the Motel world. Therefore, everything that he thinks happened at the Motel has to be plausible, something that could really happen in a real world. No sane person would believe that it's plausible for a 9 year old kid to be able to kill people in that motel in those ways. He knifed a few of them, none of whom could tackle a 9 year old? A 9 year old was able to shove half a baseball bat down the throat of a conscious convict? A 9 year old was smart and resourceful enough to plant a bomb in a car, wait for someone to give an idea for him to run away with someone to that car and then fake his own death in the bomb blast in order to kill the rest? Really?!Now why I believe Malcolm made up his insanity? Look at all the scenes where Pruitt Taylor Vince is narrating the motel story and look at this rapidly moving eyes. Kinda like eye movement during REM sleep of dreaming. Vince, being the brilliant actor that he is, gives incredible eye motion scenes. Now compare those scenes with the last scene where he strangles Dr. Mallick. Even though the strangling of Dr. Mallick and the killing of Paris is supposed to be happening simultaneously, Malcolm's eyes while strangling the doctor are stable and focused. He looks sharply at the doctor and he SMIRKS. His plan worked!The movie is about a killer who weaves a story of insanity, builds 10 personalities, convinces a psychiatrist of his insanity and eventually uses that to escape.",Identity

Also, the way the film began was very cool, from the montage of the psychiatrist and all of the newspaper clippings and the cassette playing in the background, to the way it began with one event, cut back to explain each person's involvement, then began again from the first abrupt scene switch.  Very cool movie I will watch again!",Identity

You see, the thing about this movie was that it is so jumpy and nervey, trying to guess all the time...terrifically atmospheric and creepy, I was certain this was going to be the movie of the year for me...until about 30 mins from the end, revealed to us is something (cant tell as it is a spoiler) but just then for myself, turned everything that had me spooked for the first part, was now laughable...really laughable, because it was telling us that what we had just seen did not matter at all in the first part,thus removing any fear or interest.Dreadful, the ending of this ruined what good had been achieved with the first part.",Identity

The movie was a smart flick and did not dumb itself down for the benefit of mindless slasher movie fans.  For many of these people, this fact is the movie's greatest flaw. That is why some can say Identity was excellent only for the first 80 minutes.  It is my belief that it is what comes after that 80 minute mark that makes this movie stand out from the typical Hollywood horror genre.  Although we are presented with another 6th Sense-style kid (which seems to have become part of the 21st Century horror formula), it actually works in this film.",Identity

Anyway, I saw the trailer and the cast looked promising since they'd been involved in other films I enjoyed (ie, High Fidelity, Office Space). I thought it'd be interesting to see these actors in a new setting.The movie started a little slow, but picked up significantly. It has the elements and potential for a really good film, but the script had a few plot holes and could have used a few more drafts before production began.
The acting was quite good, the best performances coming from Pruitt Taylor Vince and Alfred Molina. Overall, I would say this is a good film worth seeing in the theater as long as you don't let anyone spoil it for you. My only criticism is that the script needed to be patched up a little more (a few characters technically can't exist) and that this concept is much better suited for a psych-thiller than a slasher flick. Of course you can expect much of anything else from Michael Cooney, the man who brought us such quality films ""Jack Frost"" and ""Jack Frost 2:Revenge of the mutant killer snow man :)",Identity

There were no spectacular Oscar performances by the actors, but hey, what does the Academy know right? I was impressed with the acting of all characters and each one added to the ever growing character of Larry!  They all did a recognizable job!

I am a psychology major, so I think I picked up on it a little earlier than some people towards the end, but my roommate said he caught on later.

610,metalpunk009,First half=Amazing. Second half=Not so much.,7,8 January 2012,"Identity was a great thriller. It very much reminded me of something that David Fincher would make. It had all these elements that make for an excellent thriller, just combine that with some good characters, great acting, and wah-lah! It was something else. Having said that, I should point out that the key word in that summary was, well, ""was"". Identity ""was"" a great thriller, until we came close to the end. Then all the poop started spilling out. The basic plot of the film goes a little something like this: While driving an actress to her destination, a limo driver accidentally ends up in a car accident. The woman in the car is hurt terribly, while her son and husband are unscathed (physically, anyway). So they hitch a ride with a young couple to the nearest motel in hopes to escape the rain and treat the woman's wounds. That same night, a cop happens to stop by with a convict in tow. After the night rolls on a bit, the convict eventually escapes and starts picking off the people one by one.Let me first start off by saying this: What in all of hell were they thinking with that twist? That was one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, silly twists I've ever seen. The first half of this movie was amazing. It had a great atmosphere, great acting, and great suspense. Once the twist was revealed, it was all downhill from there. I think that if they had spent just a teency bit more time with the script, they could've seriously made some changes that would've benefited this movie greatly. Aside from those aspects of the movie, there are some things that do help it. For one thing, the acting is pretty damn good. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, and John C. McGinley all give great performances. The only people I didn't like were that stupid young couple. All the chick ever did was whine and scream while the boyfriend was just some idiot d-bag. Director James Mangold (director of two films I love: Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma) definitely knew what he was going for tone-wise and pace-wise with the movie. The tone is very effective and serves the movie greatly. One of the reasons I said this reminded me of something Fincher would make was because it had that same sort-of lighting. You know, that greenish tint. The film moved along fine until the end, when they just kept piling on the twists and made you feel exasperated. Overall, despite my gripes with that stupid twist, I still say that Identity is at least worth a rental, if not just catching it on TV, like I did. An OK movie, not a great one like it could've been.",Identity
611,estranjer,"Dragging, common opening...brilliant, surprising finale!",7,15 June 2003,"At the beginning of this movie, I was like: 'OK. We've seen this already. The usual story, group of different characters, with different backgrounds, end up sharing the same motel for unforseen circumstances, they end up being murdered one by one, and the audience have to guess who is the killer'. However, half way through the movie you will realize that there is more to it then just an Agatha Christie's plot. The story gets more complicated when you realize that there is something significant that connects all these victims whom they are completely estranged from each other.

It is a very great movie, well structured, continuous and well hinted. The thing which I find a little too much is its ending. The makers should have refrained themselves from adding a scene showing the triumph of the Child's personality over Paris's. There is nothing bad with it. But this scene, in my view, puts the movie in a weird situation. After successfully conveying the idea of movie it could have easily ended for good. The death of Paris conveys the failure of everything. Accidental failure of justice, failure of personality, failure of sacrifice and failure of an otherwise great movie. In my opinion a preferable end, if any dramatic scenario was at all required, would have been death of all personalities Malcolm has created and subsequent brain death of him. This could have reaffirmed the idea of the movie and would have contrasted everything the movie needed to project.",Identity

The movie is intended for watchers of mature mind as the theme is too heavy to digest if due attendance is not paid to the dialogues and story development.

615,diana_jarv12-55-38636,3 Major Flaws in the Film 'Identity',10,13 June 2011,"Warning - contains *Spoilers' - all over! It wont be a review as such, just three basic criticisms of the movie. Without these flaws the movie would have fared well - in fact very well, beating major blockbusters and probably reaching a very high position among 2003 movies. 1) Some may disagree but - the ending is predicable. The major flaw resides in the scene where this little boy goes to his dying mom's room and then comes back. And THEN everyone immediately discover that his mom is dead. Whoever watched the movie knows to what scene I refer. Now, after that moment I immediately knew that the boy MUST BE a serial killer and whoever is intelligent enough must have picked it up straightaway too, and the situation was not bettered by portraying Cusack as murderer - the plot was out at that moment. If not for that scene, I would never have guessed till the end: they should have deleted that scene. 2)This may sound a bit silly but if all these 10 people were just his 'personalities' then they did not even 'exist' in real life to begin with, but only in this crazy person's head. Now - the 'interest' factor certainly goes down: coz its not like he was killing real people one by one: the body was one, the mind was split. My point: the movie is far from being equated to the fascinating Agatha Christie's masterpiece 10 little Indians - with a similar plot - and it IS a shame. 3) I am not saying that cast could have been much better. Its OK - comparing this movie to the 'Strangers' movie released some time later or even the 'Devil'movie - it is fine. My point rather is NO MATTER how strong, mentally insane, evil, deceiving a boy may be in that it is NOT realistically physically possible that he performed some of the killing in the movie, especially taking a baseball bat and shoving it in a person's throat - killing him. This is just a minor comment, but come on...strong adult people often find it very difficult to kill themselves.",Identity

Plodding but methodical, the story unfolds without a break, or a chance for you to catch you breath. Just when you think you have the answer, a new element is introduced and you're back to square one. Some would say the ending deflates the film, but I disagree. Rule Number One: The least likely person is the killer. And to finish this experience, you get to keep a eerie little children's rhyme to take with you that will give you a chill on even the warmest day:""When I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. I met him there again today, I wish that he would go away.""Enjoy!",Identity
618,ctsakis,"It, ultimately, ANGERED me.",4,14 September 2003,"NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD:""Identity"" has an identity crisis of its own. It strikes me as a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it, too. It's a conventional ""scary"" whodunit and an unconventional ""you'll never guess the surprise ending"" movie. For me, it failed on both counts.The whodunit is full of huge holes which can only be ""corrected"" once the ending is revealed  - so they distract you throughout the film. The first thing I was hard-pressed to accept was John Cusack's limo being stuck in a ditch when it's a rear-wheel drive car and the rear wheels are on level ground and it's the FRONT wheels (barely) in the water. But that's a minor quibble. What bugged me more about this film is that the end feels like a huge cheat, like they couldn't figure out what to do with this routine ""one-by-one"" plot and so they came up with this silly ""multiple personality""  gimmick. THAT'S what it felt like, really. It felt like a gimmick because it WAS a gimmick. And I LAUGHED OUT LOUD when it turned out to be little Timmy! It was like a JOKE!And speaking of plot holes, the HUGEST is the ending. What cop transports a mass murderer with their hands cuffed IN FRONT OF THEM and not behind?! That is SUCH a movie/Hollywood jive-ass scenario. I knew what was going to happen the moment Alfred Molina's character slid open the oh-so-conveniently present sliding divider. What the  hell, is someone serving PIZZA through there or something?! How many police cars have YOU ever seen with one of those?! I've seen them on NYC cabs but they're not big enough to slip ONE hand through, never mind two! What nonsense!

I love those Sixth Sense/The Others type of movies and their reviews made me think Identity would be something I would want to watch. When the killings began my first thought was that this movie blows.  Oh my God what were those two critics thinking...this is playing out like a 13 Ghosts type of flick.  Then the plot twist and I literally yelled out at in the theatre, ""Oh my God I never saw that coming...this is great."" The idea for this movie is totally original and completely justified the highly unorthodox (and somewhat comical) methods of murder that were taking place. Ive heard a few complaints about the ending, and although I agree the same was a little bit forseeable, it was still highly entertaining. Overall, I loved the film.  Although, I wish they would have stretched it out more than 90 minutes.  Nonetheless, loved Identity...very original...will recommend it in the same breath as The Others and The Sixth Sense.",Identity
620,nwitham78,Excellent direction...,6,14 January 2004,"Review of James Mangold's IdentitySeemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Ten individuals with one thing in common find themselves stranded in a desert motel in the pouring rain. Cue the beginning of a string of gruesome murders, and the inevitability that all of the group will eventually become victims.Filmed on a set bearing an immense resemblance to that of Psycho, the story is that of murder-mystery crossed with horror, culminating in an interesting, Fincher-esque twist. The basic premise of the movie is exciting to me, and it is shot with beautiful precision, in deep greys and reds, that combine with exceptional cinematography to give an awesome visual impression. The cast sets some established actors (Cusack and Liotta) with others (Amanda Peet and John Hawkes) with less experience, in an interesting ensemble.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambience created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels. The one let down in my opinion was the scripting. Michael Cooney has been responsible for some serious misjudgements of screen writing in the past. This is not one of them. Thematically, the movie is excellent, with, in my opinion (here differing to many critics) the last third delivering an admirable twist and interesting look at the psychology of criminals. But for me, the actual dialogue was less than impressive. Some of William Lee Scott's lines were delivered in pure accordance to the Tarantino style guide, which provided me with a smile, but most of the rest of the film was let down by interminably formulaic and unbelievable dialogue.Overall, it seems to me that Identity is a triumph of direction, and is an exciting step in Mangold's career. Roger Ebert wrote in his review that the viewer could work out who committed the murders in the before this is revealed. I feel that this rather confused view of the film is one that many viewers will disagree with; and I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). But this is by no stretch of the imagination a modern classic. The dialogue is lacking too much in intensity for it to be classed in the same bracket as Fincher's first two films (Se7en and Fight Club) or indeed with any of Hitchcock's genre defining efforts. But in terms of enjoyable cinema, and well-educated direction, this is definitely worth a watch.",Identity

I've figured out the whole plot after the first or second dead character. Who is the most mysterious character and didn't say a word? The ""little kid"". But this is not possible to kill people this way with a child's physique, so it's a schizophrenic ""hallucination"" stuff or something like that. And at the end ta da.

Just as you start thinking that some of the sh*t thats happening is getting too wierd (like the disappearing bodies and the matching birthdays) it hits you with the fact that nothing is real.  The psychologist doesn't realise Timmie is still in Rivers mind because he only hears the personalities speaking through Rivers speech and, as Timmie's stepdad explains, Timmie doesn't talk.There are too many bad films being made to slate one like this which is just a little short of being the best I have seen in years.

For me, the movie started off simply being unpleasant - fairly exciting though, to give it credit - but not one of the characters had any charm to draw me in.  The unpleasantness continued for a while in typical Hollywood style...and then came the twist.  Most twists in movies are designed to make the story more interesting, or give the audience a new perspective: this one just eradicated any empathy anyone may have had with the characters.  The real let-down was that this wasn't the end of the movie, so we had to suffer a further 30 minutes or so of what had now become laughable drivel.  Come on guys, you can do better than this...",Identity
632,FaithDeparted,Well Worth Watching!,9,27 March 2004,"I thought that this was a spectacular movie, with a good cast. The plot was cleverly put together, and the responses from the characters were quite realistic, making this movie an exciting and thrilling ride (too bad about the give away scene about 3 quarters of the way through.)The film starts with with the ""putting together"" of a group of ten people, all driven to the same hotel, by a wild storm, that has flooded all the surrounding roads. As time goes by the group of people are being murdered, one person at a time. As you could expect in a situation like this, fingers are pointing all over the place, but who is the real murderer?
Ten People, One Hotel, One murderer, No Escape!This film is one to watch!",Identity
633,LouZemuda,An exciting ride!,9,22 January 2009,"I thought this movie was brilliant! It gave so many glimpses at the truth of what was happening, but you just refused to see it. It reminded me of Fight Club that way. The ""twist"" if you want to call it that, was right in your face the whole time, but the movie doesn't rely on it. The value of the film doesn't rest on the twist. You become invested in each character, and the fact that they aren't real isn't relevant, since they don't exist anyway. The film was multi layered and really needed to be viewed from an open mind willing to dig for all the little bits and pieces of treasure left out for the taking. If you're willing to make an investment of time, and pay attention, this movie is a really exciting ride! If you're just looking for something to put on while you're half invested in something else, put your TV on C-Span or MTV.",Identity
634,incognitomomma,Complex,8,3 June 2004,"* Minimal Spoiler*It's hard to even think of discussing this film without revealing the twists, but the movie is good. For the first third or so, it keeps trying to make you guess which genre it is...first serious mystery, then grown-up slasher film, then it gets farcical and you realize something must be up. I saw it with no clue what the main storyline was, but even after you figure it out, it's entertaining to see how it unfolds. I especially like Amanda Peet in this role, but John Cusack does a great job too, as always. He must do nothing but read scripts...he's finding lots of them that are not the same old thing.",Identity
635,kwasim75,A nice thriller !,8,2 February 2005,------------------- A nice thriller ! -------------------Identity is a nice thriller with lots of twists and turns. John Cusack and Amanda Peet acted very well. 10 different persons get together on a motel and all started dieing one after another with a series of incidents. I like the way story builds up. It's an excellent thriller movie. In short Identity is about a story of 10 persons getting killed one by one in a thrilling fashion but actually it's about 10 identities getting killed one by one.It's very inventive and fast movie with a very different and surprising ending. I voted 8/10.Kashif.,Identity
636,alexandros85sof,"Unpredictable,exciting,full of mystery and horror psychological thriller",10,23 February 2005,"For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made -mostly in the beginning. Furthermore,the idea of the whole film was terrific.On the other hand,speaking frankly there was an excessive gore and emphasis on the murders that didn't impress me;a big part of the movie was ""dedicated"" to murders.Another thing that i didn't like was the continuous rain that made me feel tired,seeing again again the storm. Moreover,what i liked most-contrary to many people- was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you don't pay attention for a while you will ""get lost"". I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastly,you should make sure that you will be 100% concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end. I would give 9 -at least- out of 10 to Identity.",Identity

But hell I had to force myself hard not to switch it off.Don't want to waste more time on it either. Just felt that I should warn others and save them some precious time to do something else.Be well.",Identity
638,lucaslince,Amazing!,10,2 June 2016,"So I just saw ""Identity"" and it was pretty fantastic!I found this film in a list called ""Movies with great twists"" and although I was a bit skeptical about it at first, I have to say it ended up being one of the best films I've seen in the last years.I've gotta say I started watching the film having seen an spoiler on one of the reviews here, so if you're reading this you should go watch the movie because it looks like people like to spoil this film a lot.Talking about the film, it is the definition of what the ""Mistery"" genre should be. If you decide to watch it you are gonna be the entire 90 minutes of it at the edge of your seat, because the movie creates an atmosphere of mystery that keeps you expectant to see what is next. It is full of twists and full of surprises, and makes you become a particular Sherlock trying to find who the bad guy is.All in all, ""Identity"" is a dark, well-written movie that anyone out there should enjoy. It has some cool references to some of Hitchock's work, specially ""Psycho"", and it is able to keep you guessing during the entire movie.",Identity
639,BattlesA,A puzzle of personalities that lead to the true one.,8,5 October 2005,"A very well played out movie about a killer with Disociative Identity Disorder. Malcom Rivers remembers his mother as a whore and that he was abandoned at the age of nine and found in a motel. The movie takes that background and sets the scene in the very same atmosphere that Malcom was traumatized in. The movie begins to introduce the differing personalities that were involved in Malcolm's life as a child. The Stepfather who followed the letter of the law almost obsessively compulsive and even recited them. But because his mother was a whore the stepfather only represented the men that he met and tried to be nice to him but never really getting involved. The little boy Timothy who represents the silent killer as his silence denoted that he was only seen and never heard thus representing his abandonment. The actress who was only concerned with herself and basically is a not so nice person, The Driver who is a helper and one who is concerned for people. Other personalities were represented by the Boy and girl named Lou and Jenny who were married young. Lou had a temper and was known for infidelity and jenny who was vindictive and made Lou marry her. Officer Rose and the prisoner who both turned out to be escaped convicts however officer rose turned out to be the ""more evil"" of the two where as the other was a narcissistic know it all. Finally the whore, who stole mens wallets and tried to get out of her life and into a new one. Each character represented fragmentations of personalities that were created inside of Malcolm and Timmy was the personality that killed each one off as retribution to his mother and the atrocities that he encountered at the age of nine. I wish I had more room to write as I can talk about the psychological relations that were represented in each character of the movie all day. Timmy's last words ""whores don't get a second chance"" no doubt referred to his hatred of his mother...and his real life killings represented personalities that he saw in his mother and so deemed necessary to dispose of them. In my opinion the 6 killings left 4 people alive which represented the four different personalities of Malcolm but the strongest personality represented by Timmy killed the rest off leaving Malcolm hopelessly controlled by his rage and judgement of the traumas that afflicted him.",Identity
640,bidnurg-34457,One of the best and confusing thriller,8,26 October 2016,The movie starts with a accident and heavy rain they all move to the hotel and one-by -one they start to die with a major twist that will blow everyone's mind. I have watched this movie almost 10 times still it confuses me at a point . It's a must watch film for those who love thriller films though a silent film it is quiet interesting and confusing . The acting is good by the lead and keeps us packed in . I love to watch thriller films and it will stay at the top of my list . Basically it's a murder mystery with a huge twist and interesting turns so I beg all readers to please watch it . No matter how many times you watch it gets better always .,Identity
641,galibhaswarey,cool psychological thriller,8,6 October 2005,"This movie was a very good psychological thriller.Depiction of Multiple personality disorder is very good. However, i found the movie to be really confusing. perhaps because of the was I was analyzing it. The setting was also interesting, making the movie more exciting. This is a very common plot in movies though. Isolate the characters and take them out. Seems very typical of Hollywood movies. The ending does not at all seem like most movies we see out there.It was a little confusing as to who the killer really was in the movie. Whether the incident in Nevada was real or not. The beginning of the movie is extremely important as to getting important details about Malcolm Rivers. I have not seen very many movies, but This seems like a movie worth watching. I need to watch this movie again to understand better.",Identity
642,phoebem-49868,Twisted Away From Cheese,8,14 September 2017,Thought this film was cheesy and unrealistic...but the twists were brilliant and put it up there with one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen. Particularly the ending when I thought I had it all sussed and was comfortable with my own assessment of the film. Only marks down for some slightly unbelievable screaming during the couple scene.,Identity

644,vendetta-6,Asolutely Wonderful!,8,14 January 2006,"This is the best ""you'll-never-guess-how-it-ends"" movie I've seen in, well,forever. The cast (which was well chosen, by the way) is great in their respective rolls, the cinematography is well done, and did I mention the ending? The screen play was well written, tying things together well and not being too redundant in order to lengthen the final product. This is worth watching twice: once for the pure pleasure of it, and another time to see if you can find ""clues"" as to the ending (where we discovered that we ignored important things and thought trivial things were pivotal). This is a good flick for those who like to passively be thrilled, as well as those thinkers who like to try to figure it all out as they watch... it will enthrall and mesmerize most viewers, we think.",Identity
645,arsalhyder18-1,"A sheep in wolf's clothing; tries so hard to be deep, but it just is too shallow to begin with",5,23 February 2007,"I watched this movie when it came out about three years ago, and I've watched it twice since; the latter being a week earlier. The premise of this movie is quite stupid to begin with, but I won't get into that. I'll say it simply; it does not deserve such a high rating.I won't say it's a horrible movie. It's a movie you'd want to spend your time on wondering ""What the heck is going on???"" and then the thrilling end puts a stop to everything and you exit the room/theater smiling to yourself. It's mindless entertainment. Nothing else.The casting is really...average, the acting is OK, the cinematography is good, and I really liked how the story progressed, but this whole point that all the events don't actually take place is stupid and un-thrilling. It takes away all the fun from the movie.All in all, it's worth a watch, but don't expect much at all. 5/10",Identity
646,djmbusiness,Fairly well acted but poor vehicle.,2,18 July 2006,"Highly disappointing, the only suspense is the order in which characters are affected. The premise stems from a psychological concept still debated by the industry and only stands up within the film itself as a dramatic device. Acting is better than adequate; one surprise is the all-too-brief portrayal by Rebecca DeMornay. (You might never guess it was she had you not found her name in the credits.) Cusak is creditable for holding his character's tension throughout the feature. Few modern films get by using a single set, but this one does, though the set is ""extended."" Consider this feature as a way to kill ninety minutes or so before something more important comes along; if one can suspend one's disbelief, the film can satisfy.",Identity
