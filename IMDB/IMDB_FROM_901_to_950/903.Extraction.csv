0,Leofwine_draca,The best Netflix action film yet,9,25 April 2020,"I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills.",Extraction
1,SnoopyStyle,Rambo it up,6,14 May 2020,"Ovi Mahajan is the son of an imprisoned drug lord in Mumbai. He gets kidnapped and held prisoner in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to rescue the boy.Sam Hargrave is the stunt coordinator for the Russo brothers and they seem to have given him his first chance at directing a full length feature. He does a perfectly adequate job with the highlight being the action sequences as one would expect from an experienced stunt coordinator. That's not to say that this is one stunt after another. There are some good stuff in between. The exterior locations are exotic. There are some good Indian actors in the villain roles. The roof top scene with the kids is fun. I would suggest a different way to go with Ovi. I would go younger and make it a girl to heighten the danger. It should be Man on Fire. One thing that does occur to me. Hemsworth is doing his Rambo in this movie and he could do the remake.",Extraction
2,Prismark10,Extraction,6,21 June 2020,"Extraction is similar to Denzel Washington's Man of Fire. Here Chris Hemsworth reduces the population of Dhaka in Bangladesh instead of Mexico.Chris Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake. An Australian mercenary with a tragic backstory who accepts a mission to rescue Ovi Mahajan. He is the son of a Mumbai drug kingpin who is in jail.The kidnapping was arranged by a Bengali drug kingpin Amir Asif. He has the police and army in Dhaka in his pocket.Saju is an ex forces operator who was hired to protect Ovi by his father. He brought in Rake and his team for the extraction but then does not pay them. Instead double crossing them and Saju plans to bring the boy back to India.Tyler finds himself alone with Ovi and fighting off Saju and Amir's men.Extraction is an high octane action movie from Sam Hargrave, a stuntman and stunt action coordinator turned director. He was the second unit director for Avengers: Endgame.Hargrave places heavy reliance on action sequences which in some ways reminiscent of the John Wick films. It also has the kind of video game violence that director David Ayer is known for in films such as Fury and End of Watch.It is not the most original of stories but it is a fine enough action film. The setting of India and Bangladesh does give it a different spin.",Extraction
3,claudio_carvalho,Deceptive Conclusion,6,3 May 2020,"When Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of the Indian kingpin Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi), is kidnapped, the mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is hired to rescue him.""Extraction"" is a film with great action scenes and absurd plot.

His son Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal ) is kidnapped and ransomed by the top drug lord in Bangladesh (Priyanshu Painyuli ). He doesn't have the money for the ransom so he plays Tyler (Chris Hemsworth ) to extract him. Tyler grabs the package, but all exits from the city are block with the largest man/boy hunt in history.It was an interesting film. Fighting scenes were half decent. The background on Tyler could have been done better. Why do directors think they should play a game with it?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Extraction
5,kosmasp,Getting most of it,7,19 May 2020,"Pun intended I reckon. But this movie is a straight up action movie. Therefor you may not be too hyped about the overall simple story of it all. It does have great action and stunt scenes and that is what matters with a movie like this, right? It is definitely the mark and bar you should set.Yes there can be better movies out there, but if you look for a quick fix, this will give it to you. No question asked - some puns intended. Thor may be pigeonholed to a degree, but we know he can do other stuff too. In this case his character is quite thinly made - and nothing more is needed",Extraction
6,Tweekums,Full on hostage rescue action,9,28 April 2020,"When Ovi Mahajan Jr, the teenage son of a jailed Indian drug lord is snatched from the streets of Mumbai and taken to Dhaka by a Bangladeshi drug lord Tyler Rake is called in to rescue him. Tyler is former Australian SAS but is haunted by the loss of his own son. Once in Dhaka he manages to retrieve the boy from his captors but getting him safely out of the city won't be easy. His erstwhile kidnapper is determined to get him back and he controls a corrupt police colonel who shuts down the city to hunt for them... if that weren't enough Saju, a former member of Indian special forces working for the boy's father, is determined to take to boy to avoid paying for the rescue.It must be stated the plot is both unlikely and rather simple... that doesn't matter though; it is there to provide a reason for the action and that action is great. From start to finish the action barely lets up... much of what happens from the moment of Rake rescues Ovi feels as if it is set in real time with camera work that puts the viewer right in the middle. Instead of the frequent cuts favoured by some directors we gets scenes that look like a single take. The action includes numerous shootings, chases on foot and in vehicles and a near-obligatory exploding helicopter. Chris Hemsworth really impresses as Tyler Rake as does Randeep Hooda as Saju; the rest of the cast are solid enough too. With its near non-stop violence this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want an action movie and enjoyed films like 'John Wick' and 'The Raid' this is sure to appeal to you.",Extraction
7,paul_haakonsen,Guns blazing and an abundance of action...,6,27 October 2021,"I was recommended to watch the 2020 action thriller ""Extraction"" by a friend, so of course I did so. Actually I hadn't even heard about ""Extraction"" before my friend spoke to me about it. But then again, I am not an avid fan of Chris Hemsworth, so I suppose that is why.But as my friend praised the movie highly, I must admit that I was having a certain amount of expectations for this movie from director Sam Hargrave. And I will say that writer Joe Russo actually managed to churn out a rather entertaining action plot.Sure, the storyline was rather simplistic actually, bordering on being near non-existing. But the sheer amount of action sequences and the dynamic way that the movie was shot more than made up for the lack of a deeper and profound storyline. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie was shot, making it feel like I was right there in the action. Some accomplishment from the cinematography people here.""Extraction"" is not a movie that relies heavily on a sound storyline, as it is all the action that does the talking. So having an excessive character gallery and good dialogue wasn't in the drivers seat here. But again, the action made up for those shortcomings.If you enjoy action movies, then you should definitely sit down to watch ""Extraction"", as it was an adrenaline-filled movie from start to end. However, this is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing, as the contents of the story just doesn't have the contents for that.I am rating ""Extraction"" a solid six out of ten stars.",Extraction
8,CinemaSerf,More of a filling than an extraction....,6,26 April 2020,"So it looks like Netflix have drafted in Chris Hemsworth to help them open up some lucrative business opportunities on the sub-continent with this action-packed, but totally derivative thriller set in Bangladesh. The young son of an imprisoned drug lord is kidnapped and Hemsworth and a team of mercenaries are hired to retrieve him and restore him to his family. What ensues are a series of tightly-shot, almost claustrophobic, set-piece action scenes - loads of extended fights, explosions and injuries that would long since have killed anyone but our intrepid rescuer. There is no jeopardy at any stage, with only a casual nod at character development, the script is all but irrelevant and the music, surprisingly non-commercial - but the film is nonetheless an enjoyable enough watch.",Extraction
9,Calicodreamin,Amazing action!,8,25 April 2020,"The action in this movie was amazing, and really kept up the pace of the movie. The storyline was fairly basic and entirely predictable, but that doesn't matter too much, the actions where it's at. The acting was good and the characters well developed, even with the kids. Awesome cinematography and fight scene coordination.",Extraction
10,view_and_review,Give Me More,9,10 December 2020,"What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, ""6 Underground,"" ""Ronin,"" and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let's break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it's all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. ""Extraction"" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.",Extraction
11,ferguson-6,action escapism,6,24 April 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. The description for this movie labels lead character Tyler Rake ""a fearless black market mercenary."" Now I've personally never shopped for a mercenary, but my assumption is that every one of them is 'black market', and none would likely self-identify as anything other than 'fearless.' My Facebook account is inundated with unwanted advertisements, and I've yet to see one for any mercenary, much less one that lacks courage. Now you likely find this to be worthless meanderings, but that's where the first feature length film from director Sam Hargrave took me. Mr. Hargrave is a veteran stunt coordinator and stunt performer (he's been the stunt double for Chris Evans' Captain America), and he's working from a script by Joe Russo (director and producer of the last two Avengers movies and the last two Captain America movies).Chris Hemsworth (THOR) stars as the aforementioned Tyler Rake. It's a role that would have just as easily worked for Jason Statham or, in past years, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Rake is a live action hero, haunted by visions and dreams of better times. His fighting prowess, shooting skills, and willingness to play roulette with his own life, make him the perfect hire for imprisoned drug lords when their son is kidnapped by a rival drug lord. And that's exactly what happens.The film opens with Tyler in a bad spot. He's injured and trying to shoot his way out of a mess where he's badly outnumbered. The film then flashes back a couple of days where we witness the kidnapping of Ovi Jr (Rudrhaksh Jaiswal) by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), the drug lord rival to Ovi Jr's imprisoned father. We also see Tyler, after a few too many drinks, take a running leap off a 30 meter cliff into an Australian lake. Soon he's visited by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Driver's wife in PATERSON). She acts as his handler for the dangerous jobs, and few are more risky than extracting Ovi Jr.What follows are fast-paced car chases through the dusty streets of Dhaka, bone-crunching hand-to-hand combats, and more shootouts than we've seen in a while. Tyler's job is to extract Ovi Jr and deliver him safely home. When things go sideways, the two end up on the run from an entire army, and take cover in a local sewer ... with all the sights and smells you might imagine. Supporting roles are covered by David Harbour as Tyler's old friend, and Randeep Hooda as Ovi Sr's right-hand man.As you might expect, there are double-crosses and plenty of opportunities for Tyler to show off his 'fearless' mercenary skills. Ovi Jr is a bit of a nerd, but does offer up some life philosophy for his troubled protector: ""You drown not by falling in the water, but by staying submerged in it."" The kill count here is extraordinarily high and literally thousands of rounds get fired. What's most surprising, however, is that Tyler's cell phone somehow survives his many falls, gunshots, sewage, and car collisions. It's much more impressive than the old Timex commercials. Gifted cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (X-MEN movies, DRIVE, THREE KINGS, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) does an admirable job capturing the action sequences; it's just that this is too similar to many movies we've seen before, though it serves as a chance for Hemsworth to be something other than Thor. For those in need of an action flick fix after all this social distancing, EXTRACTION should scratch the itch.",Extraction
12,trashgang,brutal action,9,16 May 2020,"This is the kind of action flicks that I like, straight in your face, not one moment of love or things like that, okay, there are bad memories of loved ones but it's not central.So if you like it rough and in your face then this netflix flick is worth seeing. The plot if there is any is simple it's all about the extraction. Just around one hour the action slows down and we do go into characterisation to move further in part 2 of brutal action.But just have a look at the cinematograhy, that is really stunning. At the end, a no-brainer with a lot of blood.

13,deloudelouvain,"Good action scenes, the plot is a bit weak as usual with these kind of movies.",7,14 August 2020,"If you want to watch a movie with an interesting story this isn't the one but if you're just looking for some action then Extraction is worth a watch. The story is pretty basic, nothing you have to think about, just some machos shooting around. That said the action scenes are good, above the mediocre stuff we're sometimes bombarded with, but you can't be too picky as there will be some guys being run over by cars, shot at plenty of times and still moving around like they can't be hurt. If you can manage those kind of scenes you're in for some well shot action scenes. It's mostly about Chris Hemsworth that fits perfectly as the untouchable hero macho warrior. Extraction is just easy popcorn entertainment with a cast that did a pretty good job, with some great action scenes that are well choreographed, and some quality cinematography. They didn't spare any expenses shooting those action scenes, it's all quality. That said don't expect a deep story, it's not there, so if it's that you're looking then for just skip this one. I enjoyed it as will do others that aren't too picky.",Extraction
14,siderite,An above average action movie,8,6 August 2020,"Chris Hemsworth to the rescue! An action packed film taking place in India that looks and feels like a shooter video game. The legions of heavily armed yet easily killed enemies, the switch from shooting to stabbing to sniping to reckless driving that seems to happen to everybody at the same time, the evil mastermind, the henchmen and you, the killer of dozens, saving the life of a kid. It's a nice action film, but completely pointless otherwise.Bottom line: I am glad that after 20 years from Way of the Gun they rediscovered how to do shooting scenes. As an action film it's a success. Don't look for anything above that.",Extraction
15,FeastMode,hard action galore,7,5 May 2020,"The action in this movie is fantastic. at one point my jaw was dropped for like 6 minutes. entertaining and intense. my only downsides are that the best action scene was early in the movie, and even though they do a good job of making you care, it also hurts the movie when they are mowing down ""bad guys"" (1 viewing, 5/4/2020)",Extraction
16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Derivative, unimaginative time waster",4,4 May 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a burnt out mercenary, who's assigned to rescue Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the intelligent son of a notorious gangster, who's currently holed up in jail. After successfully completing this mission, he finds the kidnappers aren't as willing to relinquish their hostage as he'd hoped, plunging him into a deadly battle through the streets of Dhaka, where everything is not as it seems, and he can trust no one.As cinemas around the country (and the world, of course) are closed in the lockdown, streaming services like Netflix are going to be more popular than ever, as people, and certainly film lovers, will crave the sense of escapism that the filmic experience provides even more than they usually do. And, indeed, the main function of a film like Extraction will be to escape to another world, because there will never be any sense of realism in some action film where one man takes on a whole bunch of villains and defeats them without getting a scratch, the ones popularised so greatly throughout the 80s and 90s. Which the feature length directorial debut of Sam Hargrave ultimately emerges as one, big generic regurgitation of.Hargrave saturates everything with the standard present day dark, moody style, with a gloomy, blurred shooting style, setting the overall tone for the film itself. If it hadn't been so heavy and humourless, and a little shorter and less self indulgent, it could have passed as a harmless, run of the mill actioner, something to nod off to late at night, but instead it's one big, overblown event that seems to be stabbing at something deeper. Hemsworth is effective and convincing as an action hero, there's a depressingly authentic recreation of the Indian slums and it livens up at the end, with some pretty decent action, but it all amounts to the same thing.There's an Aladdin's cave of these type of movies in the back catalogue of films from the 80s and 90s, and there's plenty you can seek out, which will be over and done with much quicker and give you much the same experience. Usually starring Steven Seagal or Jean Claude Van Damme. **",Extraction
17,MOscarbradley,Better than I expected.,7,16 August 2020,"""Extraction"" is a big, mostly dumb and very violent action flic that has the common sense not to try to be anything else and is actually a surprisingly good example of its kind, providing, of course, that this is the kind of thing you like. The plot is simple; the action relentless. A Mumbai drug-lord's son is kidnapped and it's up to mercenary Chris Hemsworth to get him back. Neither he nor the film hang around. As I've said, it's both violent and relentless; a non-stop catalogue of killings and mutilations, choreographed to bloody perfection by first-time director Sam Hargrave. Of course, there isn't a frame that's actually believable. This is a live-action video game, based on a graphic novel, brilliantly photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel in and around Dhaka and with enough good guys and bad guys killing each other relentlessly to keep it on the boil for two hours. Brains may be largely in short supply but there's certainly no shortage of brawn.",Extraction

19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Extra action.,6,26 April 2020,"The highlight of 'Extraction (2020)' is a very extended, practically seamless but sometimes dizzying 'one-shot' action scene that careens from a car-chase to a shootout to a fistfight and back into a car-chase again, the camera confidently swerving around and sometimes diving into the chaos it captures. It's during this sequence that the sheer impressiveness of the filmmaking - the complex camerawork, the tight choreography, the painful stunts - begins to outweigh the piece's narrative shortcomings. Unfortunately, those shortcomings really are quite significant and they start to seep back into the fray once the film inevitably cuts away from its magnum opus. Really, the story is about as bare-bones as you can get, with its generic characters and often-seen situations serving only to get it from set-piece to set-piece. To start with, the flick is actually rather dull. Even the first action sequence doesn't feel impactful because you don't care about anyone involved with it. After a certain point, though, the thing becomes a lot more engaging. It starts to seep some actual character from the gaps in its violence and, even if this is still basic stuff, it helps carry you through to the end of the slightly-too-long plot. The movie takes itself pretty seriously but it's still firmly in the realm of 'turn your brain off' fun. It's rather exciting when it gets going and, ultimately, it is enjoyable. It's lucky that the action is as genuinely good as it is, because it's the only thing that will keep you watching. 6/10",Extraction
20,ThomasDrufke,Serviceable,6,4 June 2020,"Another Netflix original movie that believes it's better than it actually is. But perhaps, this is the type of film that is perfect for Netflix. Great action, serviceable story (but no true substance) with a movie star at the center. A movie you watch on a saturday afternoon while trying to relax. Hemsworth hasn't chosen the best projects outside of the MCU and this film is more of the same. I really do wonder if his career will veer more into comedy as the years go by, since that is clearly a major strength of his. Extraction is solid, but it certainly isn't fulfilling my desire for the summer blockbuster (which we've been lacking because of COVID). Oh well.6.8/10",Extraction
21,Cineanalyst,Netflix Continues to Corner Market on Lousy Action Flicks,4,29 April 2020,"Even before the world, cinemas included, closed for business during the current pandemic, the economics of going to theatres to see movies had become increasingly limited--mostly relying on tent-pole franchise installments. Disney owns a huge chunk of this business with childhood fare: remakes of their cartoons, MCU superheroes, etc. Not only have these new dynamics largely squeezed out the mid-budget drama from multiplexes, but also the traditional, usually stand-alone, macho action flicks such as ""Extraction,"" and ""Bright"" (2017), and ""Triple Frontier,"" and ""Red Sea Diving Resort,"" and ""6 Underground"" (all 2019). Now, if it's not already part of a series, chances are you'll only get this lack-of-a-brand type of adrenaline injection from streaming services and at home. Unfortunately, ""Extraction"" is a mostly generic burger of a movie from MCU veterans taking a break before making ""Avengers 83,"" or whatever.Stunt choreographer Sam Hargrave gets a chance to direct, and his background in filming fighting moves, along with the similar skills of the Russo brothers and Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, shows. The next movie I saw after this one was ""Angel Has Fallen"" (2019), and it's painfully clear that the makers here put care into their craft, whereas the hacks behind the other one, despite it getting a wide theatrical release before making its way to Netflix, were merely there to cash checks. So, I do appreciate the action scenes here--especially the virtuoso, lengthy one-shot car chase.Otherwise, though, ""Extraction"" is a lousy entry in the trope of the White Savior. Others have commented how poorly the picture represents Dhaka, which just demonstrates how little filmmakers of white-savoir rubbish care about depicting the racial other. Narratively, only the white male hero's journey is made to matter--how sympathetic he is to the supposed plight of the Oriental, as opposed to their actual state of affairs or characterizations. Blah, I prefer my white-savior myths to have some knowing humor and time-traveling, purple Malthusian giants. If for little else, ""Extraction"" is helpful for realizing how much I miss fat Thor.",Extraction

It should have been a straightforward story, but I had a hard time following who was working for whom and why.

This movie on the other hand has very good action sequences with hand to hand combat and shootouts. Its like Born but much more bloody! The ending was also good.Overall, do not take this film to seriously, nor look something it doesn't have.

24,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Action Packed,6,7 May 2020,"Yep, another Netflix movie, but that is probably because that is all we really have these days, since the cinemas are all closed, and all of the upcoming releases have been put on hold. So, what we have are these films that are appearing on Netflix, such as this one, not that I am stretched for anything to watch.This film confused me a bit because in part I thought that it was some Bollywood production, but it turns out that it is definitely an American film, though since Chris Hemsworth takes the leading role, I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. Yet, pretty much all of the other characters, with the exception of a couple of the protagonist's team, were Indian.The story is pretty straight forward, namely that the son of a drug dealer is kidnapped and taken to Bangladesh, and Hemsworth is hired to bring him back. As such, we pretty much end up having this huge action movie which is little more than Hemsworth verse the entire Dhaka police force. Yeah, it is a bit like though, though there are a couple of other antagonists thrown in, and a couple of twists as well.In a way it pretty much reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down, namely that Hemsworth is attempting to get out of Dhaka the quickest way possible, and cities like Dhaka aren't the easiest to get around, especially when you have the entire police force after you, and being American (or in the case here, Australian), you do stand out quite a lot.Look, it isn't one of the best films out there, but it certainly does work well to keep you up with your weekly dose of action, especially since it is one of those films that is somewhat new. Look, the plot isn't that great, but the production certainly does work quite well, and it certainly does look a lot better than a number of other productions that have landed up here. The other thing is that the acting isn't too bad either. However, as I mentioned, it isn't particularly original.",Extraction

26,John6Daniels,Thor. Where is your POWA?!,9,26 September 2020,Who you going to call? A White Savior.Chris Hemsworth is basically Punisher in this installment.The movie is about a guy trying to save a boy from the slums of India. It's full on war. Why? I have no idea. Don't know much about the main guy other than he is a very skilled combatant. that mean development isn't perfect.The acting is fine. Most of the Indians don't speak English.There is a lot of bullets and bloodshed. This is the first time children get harmed on screen. Which makes it realistic and unPC. Children are used as fearless mercenaries. Thor isn't afraid to harm them either.This movie is not made for children of these days. They'd get puny nightmares.The movie showed a lot of the slums of India. As well shown how corrupt the authorities can be.1 fault I dislike movies that start at the end then goes back to the beginning.

27,Thanos_Alfie,Save the boy...,6,1 May 2020,"""Extraction"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a man who is a member of an elite team trying to save a young boy's life after he was kidnapped by a crime lord. The boy's father who is also an international crime lord but he is in prison hired them to save his son but he does not know everything about them or his opponent and what they are both capable of.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. I liked it because of its plot which was very interesting, it had plenty of action and much of suspense. The interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Tyler Rake was very good and he showed us why it was the right choice for this movie. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rudhraksh Jaiswal's who played as Ovi Mahajan and Golshifteh Farahani's who played as Nik Khan.

28,cruise01,"Action packed, Chris Hemsworth is brutal, and all out thrilling.",8,24 April 2020,"(4 out of 5 stars).Extraction is an action packed thrill ride. Definitely one of those films you set aside any character development or story. Just enjoy the action flick for what it is. Chris Hemsworth leads the role and he can take on a heroic character. Like how Keanu Reeves leads John Wick. Hemsworth takes a beating. He uses guns, objects, or knives in any fight he can get into. Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary, who is assigned to rescue a drug lords son in Dhaka. While the kidnappers who puts a huge bounty on the sons life which has the corrupt police, military, and other henchmen all after the son and Chris Hemsworth. The film is action packed. The director can manage the action sequences. It is brutal. And there is one long take with the action scene that was impressive. The character Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who is the drug lord son. I will say the weakest thing about the movie is Rudhraksh Jaiswal performance.

29,eddie_baggins,Another cookie-cutter Netflix actioner with some above average set-pieces,4,30 April 2020,"Currently one of the most savvy and successful businesses in the world, with a model that knows exactly what its audience wants and delivers entirely too that, Netflix have been churning out sleek and fast-paced action films ad nauseam over the last few years, with their new adrenaline fueled tentpole Extraction fitting the modus operandi perfectly.Backed by Marvel hero's the Russo brothers, with Joe penning the script and directed by long-time Marvel stunt coordinator and performer Sam Hargrave, Extraction is an instantly familiar action experience that sees Chris Hemsworth's downtrodden but Thor-like Australian mercenary Tyler Rake end up in Bangladesh trying to rescue the son of an Indian crime lord who has been kidnapped by a rival operator.Anyone that has ever seen an action thriller with a seemingly cold-hearted and depressive central figure, whose also a one man killing machine, will know exactly where Extraction is taking us, as the mission Rake is on goes sour and he is forced to take down what feels like a city worth of bad guys to protect his new mate Ovi.Similar at times to Man on Fire, Mile 22 and filmed in a way that feels like a direct rip-off of The Raid franchise (in what is becoming the normal now for Hollywood films trying to replicate the energy and frenetic nature of those action classics), Extraction fails to bring anything new to the table as Hargrave ticks off a serious of boxes on his way to an all too familiar conclusion.It's not to say there aren't little action delights along the journey Rake takes, with a clearly CGI'd but none the less impressive unbroken action set piece around the 30 minute mark of the film one of the candidates for the best action showcases of the year but there's far too much of Extraction that is forgettable, unbelievable and tiresome to bring it home with a bang.This forgettable film nature is a trend that Extraction lead and beloved Aussie icon Chris Hemsworth needs to pay close attention to, with his work outside of the Marvel universe and the well-liked but financial failure Rush is cause for concern.Films like Blackhat, In the Heart of the Sea, 12 Strong and Bad Times at the El Royale might not be the worst films going around but their far from the type of products you'd want littering your career for too many more years to come.Final Say -Some nice action moments are to be found in Extraction but outside of that this charmless and unimaginative action thriller is the exact type of Netflix outing that is still too prevalent for a company looking to reach for the low hanging fruit too often.2 garden rakes out of 5",Extraction

31,digitalbeachbum,Writers and director are idiots,1,27 April 2020,"The intensity of the fight scenes and chase is good, but there are too many moments when they break the reality of the moment. There are too many cut scenes, and the switching between third person to first person is confusing. The cinematography is wonderful, there are plenty of wonderful landscape shots. It's the highlight of the movie.The casting is good. The direction was meh, but the script brings the movie down. Several of the characters are not believable. There is too much deus ex machina being used to move the movie forward.The combat and the combat strategy is flawed. I did not find it plausible the way they executed the story. Such as the street fight with the kids at night. No soldier would follow that path of logic. There was too much at risk. A real soldier like him would kill the kids and wouldn't use smoke bombs, which would instantly paint you.The main character keeps seeking attention. The logic was to be quiet and to use stealth. The two man team thing isn't realistic either.The sniper who got shot by the boat, where is the logic in that? A sniper would have held their position. They would not have gone to check out the boat.And there are far too many silencers in this movie.The sniper stuff at the end isn't even possible. The weapon used by the Colonel is not a sniper rifle and there was no way he is going to get four shots, three head shots, and one body shot at that range with the short barrel. He is using an HK SL8-6 assault rifle. With the scope, the accuracy is good for only a 100 (effective)-300 (max) yards. This is a weapon used for close quarters combat only. IT IS NOT A SNIPER RIFLE.Even the sniper rifle the woman is using is a limited range sniper rifle good for up to 800 yards (max). She is using the FN SCAR8 and there is no way she is going to kill anyone at that range.The range to that bridge is 3,000 to 3,500 yards. The drug dealer/kinpin can be seen using the binoculars at 1:40:00. You can see how extremely far away they are from the bridge. Not possible. Unrealistic.",Extraction

35,southdavid,Thor-pe Park,6,13 May 2020,"Heavily promoted by Netflix at the moment, starring an Avenger, written by the ""Endgame"" directors and directed by the Avengers stunt co-ordinator, you might expect ""Extraction"" to be a low key gem. It isn't. Unfortunately it's largely run of the mill, but it does have a few great action sequences that elevate it above similar straight-to-video nonsense.Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord, is kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli) his father's Bangladeshi rival. Knowing that he'll be held to account for this, Saju (Randeep Hooda) a lieutenant in the Indian family and Ovi's guardian engages a crack mercenary team to extract the boy. The team, with Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) on point, successfully rescue Ovi, but soon discover that Asif's massive influence of the Police, Army and his own street gangs make getting out almost impossible.As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a few action scenes in this film that are much better than the overall film deserves. The rescue scene is visceral exciting close combat stuff, but it was the later driving scene where I really started to take notice - particularly of the excellent camera work. The camera tracks the vehicle, circulates to the front when the car needs to reverse and then, in a bravura move, enters the car and sits on the back seat. There are a number of ""John Wick"" type gun fights for the remainder of the film which, whilst never quite hitting the heights of that franchise, are OK.That said, the rest of the film is a pretty predictable and generic thriller and you'll see the twists and plot points coming a mile off. I can understand why it had Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis attached at various points. Chris Hemsworth is OK, better than either of those would have been, even if it does feel like him playing ""sad action man"" is a bit of a waste, given his comedic talent. Randeep Hooda is given more of an arc, and provides a better performance because of it.Perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours, but I'll never watch it again.",Extraction

37,Vartiainen,More films need to be directed by stuntmen,7,10 December 2020,"Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Namely that of an interesting story. While the story of Extraction - a gun for hire (Hemsworth) shooting his way through Bangladesh in order to rescue the kidnapped son of a drug lord - is perfectly serviceable, it's also nothing to write home about. The characters are shallowly written and while they're acted well enough, the main attraction of the film are those action scenes.That being said, those are definitely good enough on their own to justify the price of admission. Hemsworth gives an electrifying performance as a man spread too thin by all the violence he has caused, while Randeep Hooda gives an equally memorable performance as his foil and counterpart.And it's just plain fun to watch. If you have a soft spot for those 80s action films such as Commando or Rambo, then this is definitely worth checking out.",Extraction

I love going to the movies so much and I miss seeing stuff on the big screen, so when I see good stuff like Extraction, it makes me a little depress that I only have a 32 itch screen to watch this on.I herd that Chris Hemsworth was actually tapped to star in an American adaption of the Indonesian film The Raid. I don't know if that movie will ever happen but Extraction is a good alternative. Watching Thor brawl through an army on the streets of Mumbai is too exciting, and they do these single cut action sequences that make me feel like they are crossing 1917 with a John Wick film.Produced by the Russo brothers who directed Hemsworth in Avengers: infinity War and Avengers End game, it feels like the Brothers are into solid action movies as they did one last year called 21 Bridges which also stared an Avenger, the Black Panther, Chadwick Bosman.The plot does not cut deep enough, but this movie is all about the visual energy coming from it. That's why it saddens me that I did not get to experience this in a dark theatre looking up at a huge screen, trying to stuff my face with popcorn and soda without take my eyes off the action.The movie theatres were made for these kinds of flicks and I can't wait to get back in those reclining seats.",Extraction
39,jtindahouse,A violent film with some seriously good action sequences,7,24 April 2020,"In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch.",Extraction

41,alindsay-al,A Good Brutal Action Film,7,27 April 2020,"With new movies few and far between at the moment we have to take them when we get them and there is a new film from Netflix starring Chris Hemsworth called Extraction and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a special agent sent into Bangledesh to rescue a gangsters son from his rival.
Main Character
As mentioned above Chris Hemsworth is the main character in this film and he does a really good job. He is great in the action scenes, he is believable and is probably only second to John Wick in terms of his action skills, it is just really entertaining to see him go through multiple enemies and kill them in pretty gruesome ways. His character takes some time to be developed but he has enough depth to him to make you care and you do understand his motivations towards the end of the film.
Supporting Characters
David Harbour is probably the most recognisable supporting actor and he does a good job with the limited screen time he has, I bought into his character and Hemsworth's having a relationship and it worked. There is also a character called Saju who is hunting Hemsworth and he is like a Terminator in the action scenes taking down everybody in his path and he has a bit of character depth aswell. Unfortunatley though I didn't care about the boy as much as you are clearly meant to and I thought the villain of the film was incredibly basic and really had nothing interesting about him.
Story
The best parts of the story are some of the arcs that the characters have, they develop nicely and you understand their motivations, I also thought the ending of the film was well done and left you guessing as to what could come next. Though as you can probably tell from the premise this film has a very basic plot and one that you have seen plenty of times and it does very little to make you think you have seen anything new.Script
The script has some heartful moments to it and some well done dramatic moments but it doesn't have anything that reall stands out to it. Plus a film like this doesn't really have any humour which may have been better at times to help humanise Hemsworth and other characters.Style
The style of the film is awesome, the action scenes are pretty incredible. They are really well filmed and well choreographed, every hit feels brutal and seeing the inventive ways that people are killed is a joy to see. As mentioned it can be a bit gruesome but I thought it worked for the film an allowed them to be more creative, also it was nice to see Bangledesh used as the backdrop as it provided some unique action sequences.Overall
Overall, this is a good action film, if you want to see Hemsworth take out tonnes of guys then this is a film for you, it doesn't do anything to stand out too much but is an enjoyable film for sure.",Extraction

Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a black market mercenary hired to bring the drug lord's son home in what proves to be one of his toughest assignments to date...It's probably fair to say that if you choose to sit down and watch Extraction that you're unlikely to be blown away by its story; however if you are a fan of action films with plenty of shoot em up sequences then you should find this film to be relatively enjoyable.Arguably the biggest flaw with this film lies with the story itself; 2 drug lords are at war with each other but we're never really given any explanation as to what their beef is with each other? Still as I've said this doesn't really matter in the moment as there is always something happening in this film (shoot outs and fisticuffs come thick and fast in this picture) which, in fairness, is what you'd come to expect with films of this nature.Hemsworth does a solid job (he's a good physical presence, but unlike some of his counterparts that we see in action films he also does well from an 'acting' perspective as well). The villains are a little clichéd, but nobody disgraces themselves here.Although it feels a little generic and underwritten the fast pace and neat actions sequences make it worthwhile.",Extraction
45,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Action Flick - Extraction,6,7 May 2020,"No, this is not a film about going to the dentist. However, the relentless action sequences might give you a migraine. They are well done, but the acting in the film is left to the professionals; that would be the Indian actors. The lead actor, unfortunately, has less range than John Wayne, and I think we all know what that means. The direction and production values make up for this deficiency, and the Indian character actors actually steal the film quite easily.
Think of the action sequences as eye candy and the main course of steak and potatoes is being done by the Indian actors. The street urchins of this Indian city were quite reminiscent of City of God, where orphans run rampant in Rio, Brail.
This aint your flying down to Rio film of the 30s. And Extraction isnt your usual overcoming bad odds battle; it is a bit unrealistic to think one man (even with the help of a highly trained team) can overcome an entire city of police and soldiers. That being said, the film is still very entertaining; thanks to the Indian actors.",Extraction

Chris Hemsworth is obviously the standout, though Randeep Hooda and Priyanshu Painyuli are also noteworthy here. Those three, and a few others, give more than solid performances but I don't feel like they are anything extraordinary - mainly due to other factors.That also matches how I feel about the action. I enjoyed a lot of it in truth, a number of the deaths are pretty nicely done, though the editing/cinematography comes out odd in parts... yet it does still weirdly work.The set designs are something I, flat out, don't rate in 'Extraction'. All of the major scenes in that regard feel fake, like they've been created from scratch to look like a war zone... à la what you get in video games, comes across too rigged.This film's premise isn't the most original, you've seen it all before and it can feel dragged out, though this still makes for a mostly enjoyable experience.",Extraction

57,Easygoer10,High Bodycount; Too High,8,27 April 2020,"This reminds me of ""Rambo 4"". With a body count well over 100, it's truly over the top. What is really bad is the credits are over 13 minutes long. That is worse than the ridiculously high amount of people shot, stabbed, etc. At least it wasn't revenge motivated. More of a ""who cares? type attitude from seeing too much death. Basically, a forgettable film. I should mention David Harbour turned a corner several years ago (which is not atypical). Now, he is aalmost always cast as an antagonist. Take ""The Equalizer"" (2014). I think he weakens an already thin plot. It would be mire interesting if someone actually betrayed him. Audiences are smart. Still, I gave it a 7/10 for the excellent stunt fighting choreography, squib work, special effects, etc. Although there are are outrageously unbelievable sniper shots made (several appear over 1 mile away) and hit dead on. I bet you $1000 the Kid who shoots Tyler at the end will have a prominent role as a ""bad guy"" in the sequel, which is already ""in the works"".",Extraction

60,arungeorge13,Superbly choreographed action compensates for weak storytelling! [+59%],6,25 April 2020,"Extraction offers the familiar action-movie combination of breakneck pacing, a paper-thin storyline, and dazzling set-pieces. As the title suggests, it's about a mercenary by the name of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) carrying out the extraction of a little boy (apparently, the son of a drug lord in India) from the clutches of a Bangladeshi drug lord. Aiding him covertly in his mission is a team led by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, who's best known for About Elly). A subplot brings Saju (Randeep Hooda), the Indian drug lord's enforcer, into the scenario. What ensues is a series of ultra-violent, well-crafted (and tastefully shot by Newton Thomas Sigel) action-movie clichés.Hargrave chooses to cover up the fallacies in the script, some inane casting choices (Priyanshu Painyuli, for example, is a particularly bad one), the lack of locational authenticity (most of the film is shot in India, not Bangladesh except for plateshots), and disjointed Bengali lines mouthed by the gangsters, with neatly choreographed action. One such set-piece (shot like it's a single take) that gets going shortly into the 35-minute mark, is probably the best I've seen in recent memory (which is why it gets a 3 and not a 2.5). The action is punctuated by bullets whizzing past narrow alleyways, hand-to-hand combat that we've seen done better in Asian films, and a sufficient amount of blood-spilling.Heck, in what seemed like a minor nod to The Raid films, Tyler uses a rake (which is also his surname, mentioned later in a scene) to dispose of a thug. The single-shot-set-piece is straight out of the books of ""Call of Duty"", with the camera splendidly juggling between first-person and third-person action. Even for a hardcore action flick, Joe Russo writes in a few scenes that attempt to humanize the characters of Tyler and Saju. They aren't exactly acting showcases, but they get the job done. Plus, the presence of Randeep Hooda subverts the 'white savior' cliché to a certain extent.While the scenes involving the Bangladeshi drug lord (dressed in awkward costumes) were the weakest (in terms of writing and performances), I did like how Hargrave portrayed the plight of underprivileged kids in the Indian subcontinent and how they were being used as gun-wielding henchmen. It's a template action movie alright, but there's enough machismo, explosions, and gore to please fans of the genre. It, however, needed better writing, a (much better) baddie, and more heart, to rise above its surface-level coolth.",Extraction
61,Abdulxoxo,High-octane action flick,8,29 January 2021,"When the son of an Indian druglord is kidnapped and taken to Bangladesh, Australian mercenary Tyler Rake is hired to retrieve him. Yes, the plot is simple, but I don't necessarily see that taking away anything from the movie. With the intensity of 'Rambo', but the stylish precision of 'John Wick', this film is a perfect example of what an action movie should look like in 2020. The action sequences are simply breathtaking; each and every action sequence is wonderfully crafted and some camera angles during the fights are surprisingly awesome. There are incredible hand-to-hand combats, exciting chases and other fantasically choreographed stunts that makes this film the most exciting, and joyously violent, film of 2020. There's even some good dark humour in there too. Chris Hemsworth gives one of the best performance of his career. Not only is he incredibly physical in the role, but I actually believed the emotional side of his character; which with Hemsworth isn't usually the case. The supporting cast is also great; as is the cinematography; sound design and the excellent hair and makeup department. All in all, Extraction is a fun, action-filled film with little story but it doesn't matter.",Extraction

There is no way this thing needs to go over 1h30min but clocks in at 1h56min, or in technical terms, too long. It's sort of the flip side of the old joke in which two people are talking about aa restaurant with bad food. ""And such small portions,"" one of them says. We have lousy movies that somehow think they will be better if they go on 20% longer.Yet another bloody kill-fest of wonton slaughter in which the protagonist seems to be immune to bullets while everyone else around him is a bullet magnet.

postpone due to COVID-19 impact across the globe. At this time, the only saviour is digital platforms like Netflix which aired its one
of the most anticipated film, Extraction, at least during this lock down period. I just completed watching Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda
starrer and felt a real action flick has arrived that will pump up your adrenaline especially on Friday evening.Extraction tells the story of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who is a dreaded mercenary and supposed to rescue the son of warlord in Mumbai
from clutches of his competitor in Bangladesh. The rescue operation goes haywire when he is interrupted by unknown intruders.From the Avengers directors Russo brothers - Anthony and Joe Russo (who also wrote the Graphic novel ""Ciudad"", on which film is based),
Extraction is directed by Sam Hargrave who has done the stunts in some 80 films, including the Marvel super heroes flicks like Avengers : Endgame
and Avengers : Infinity WarThe movie starts with a bang as Tyler Rake goes all the possible way the moment rescue operations initiates. Tyler he faces the goons where he fights with knives and guns which is brilliantly choreographed followed by an eye-popping car chase scene as Tyler drives through the busy streets of Dhaka.
I would like to highlight that this probably one of the best car chase scenes which an outstanding camera work. The street-fight between Randeep Hooda is another spectacular treat to watch out as both actors does well in the hand combat.If you think this is enough, hold on as there is a high-octane climax scene with jaw-dropping stunts. The movie traverses through a wafer-thin plot and yet
manages to keep you on the edge of seat with some of best stunts. Screenplay does falter in few places but I will not complain as Extraction kept me glued to the screen for 1 hour 56 mins.This is a movie for those people who love action films and should be respected as each and every choreography is worth clapping. The movie goes very
well with electrifying background score. Art direction is superb while Cinematography is wonderful, especially during the action scenes.
Writing by Joe Russo is engaging and does not let blink your eye for a minute.Tyler Rake could only be played by one and the only Chris Hemsworth. The actor not only emotes well with his expression but is
fantabulous with his hand combat and action stunts. I loved Randeep Hooda as he brings in spark once he enters the scenes. Rudhraksh Jaiswal
and Golshifteh Farahani were good in their part while Pankaj Tripathi has one just scene in the film.Overall, if you are in need for some kick-ass action film, Extraction is the right dose for you. Electrifying 3.5/5",Extraction

68,Prashast_Singh,Extraction delivers action that provides both entertainment and satisfaction.,10,24 April 2020,"I had been waiting for this day since long. With cinemas locked down due to the global pandemic, I had stopped waiting to watch any new movies. What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.",Extraction

The director took that and his skills and gave us a adrenaline rush of a movie so action-packed that not only makes the point of not giving up but things aren't over until they are. Good story, twists, special forces, weapons galore and the scenery or locations are impressive for their realism.

In the end, this movie is as realistic as any superhero movie (and less than many of them, even).Having said that, the action is superb. While the characters aren't more than avatars and the story as thin as possible (rescuing X, in the hands of X in the City X), the chase sequences and shootouts are insane. Some are ""one take"" long shots. Not in the ridiculously boring 1917 way, with minutes and minutes of nothing BUT IN ONE SHOT.

76,bankofmarquis,"Fun, by-the-numbers, action flick",7,6 May 2020,"I'm pretty sure that no matter what, I was going to enjoy the Chris Hemsworth action flick EXTRACTION whether it was good or not. It is, after all, a NEW movie, albeit one that was made ""Direct to Netflix"", so those can be of lesser quality.I'm happy to report that in the case of EXTRACTION, that is not the case. This is a good (if by the books) popcorn action flick with a charismatic lead keeping you company throughout.In EXTRACTION, Chris Hemsworth stars as an Australian Mercenary (who knew there was such a thing), hired to extract the kidnapped son of a drug lord from the hands of his fiercest rival.This is a pretty ""by-the-numbers"" action film:1). The mercenary has ""baggage"" - will the events (and the subject he is to extract) help him come to terms with his pent-up emotions in order to move past his traumatic ""baggage""?2). Will there be some sort of ""double-cross"" that screws up the extraction causing our hero to go ""on the run"" with his ""Extraction""?3). Will there be a buddy that our hero trusts who will, ultimately, double-cross him?What do you think?The fun of this film was not the plot machinations (they are pretty basic), but the execution of these machinations - and this execution is pretty fun/enjoyable.Start with Chris Hemsworth as our mercenary - with the great action flick name of Tyler Rake. Hemsworth knows exactly what kind of film he is in - and he brings the goods. If he chose to, I think Hemsworth could be an action hero staple like Jason Statham or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson - but I think Hemsworth is not really interested in that. But here, he is steely eyed and calm taking hits and doling out punishment to hoards of ""red shirt"" bad guys in his way. He has the action hero chops. He also has the acting chops to make the overwrought ""emotional"" scenes palatable. He makes weak writing enjoyable.Joining him is Rudhraksh Jaiswal as ""the extraction"" - and his interactions with Hemsworth are fun. Randeep Hodha and Golshifteh Farahani do a nice job in the roles that they play in the action and the always watchable David Harbour eats a ton of scenery in his limited time on the screen. All are fun to watch.But it is the telling of the story by first time Director Sam Hargrave that was a (pleasant) surprise for me. After doubling Chris Evans in the first CAPTAIN AMERICA film, Hargrave became the ""go to"" guy for Marvel action choreography, so (I'm sure) he got to know Hemsworth there. He brings a fast-paced style to this film that works. He doesn't stop to examine much at all (which helps the plot holes in the script) and his action work with his stunt actors is top-notch. If you watch nothing else in this film, check out the chase scene at about the 1/3 mark of the film. Hemsworth and ""the extraction"" are being chased - and it is filmed in the ""shaky cam/cinema veritae/ make it look like one long tracking shot"" style that I often criticize in my reviews - but here it worked and worked well. I'll be keeping my eye on what Hargrave does next (word is it that there will be an Extraction 2).All of this is brought together by Producers Joe and Anthony Russo - the Directors of many Marvel films (including INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME). Not only did they Produce this film, but they wrote the story from where this film came from. It's obvious that they turned the majority of the screenplay writing to others (most notably Ande Parks) and this film is based on a graphic novel...so it plays like an over-the-top comic book action flick (think John Wick-lite) where the dialogue is sparse and cliche-ridden. This part of the film was far less interesting than the action parts.But, the action is fast, fun and furious and Hemsworth is worth watching for the 1 hour 56 minute running time.All-in-all, a good time was had while watching the first ""new"" film in over 6 weeks.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Extraction

But I might have enjoyed it more if they ironed out the inconsistencies. The plot is meh but if Bruce Willis and Arnold were considered for the part, then I can understand the choices made.

There were funny moments in Thor Ragnarock and it seems that this opened and hopefully closed the door on comedy.Now Extraction is for me Chris at his best.In summary a 14 year old boy is kidnapped by one drug barron who is son of another, his son lives with an employee his fathers (I'll come back to this later).Eventually we find out that no one wants Obi not even his own father so why did his father employ Chris Hemsworth to Extract him?The fathers friend who Obi lived with was then sent to kill Obi and Chris Hemseorth, why? Surely if he didn't want his son just simply don't pay the ransome, problem solved.So as you can see the story is silly especially as half way through the guy Obi was living with and who was out to kill them both suddenly decides to help, cone on!BUT.........As I've said above Chris Hemsworth has finally returned to what he does best, ACTION all the way!The 11 minute continuous scene starting with the car chase and escaping the corrupt police is absolutely amazing! How the camera transitions from inside to outside the car and following the action, one word WOW!Atomic Blonde did this but this film blew Atomic Blonde out of the water in my personal opinion and the action continue throughout the film.So forget the story and simply enjoy this film for what it is, an action packed movie with simply amazing camera work which has to be seen to believed.Rating 9 out of 10",Extraction

A few years back Paul Greengrass gave the Bourne series a very realistic style that even quite successful really never was repeated out of B movies that rarely get distributed in theatres (John Wick the exception).
Now Netflix as produced a really good one, that keeps and sometimes even perfect the Greengrass style with a lower budget but in very exotic scenarios with (apparently) one long takes (handheld cameras ) action scenes, almost in first person that rarely seeing (or never) in latest movies.
Forget the story; it is quite simple; as it was Die Hard or the Bourne, but the action and quick characters definition is so good that you even care about them in the middle of the bullets and infinite deads.

82,kjproulx,"All about the action, and it delivers!",8,25 April 2020,"I usually don't give a lot of credit to movies that feel like a million others, because they usually feel pretty derivative. When one stands out among the rest though, I feel that a huge round of applause is in order. Extraction is one of Netflix's latest feature films to hit their service and it's probably my favourite film that they've released since last year's Oscar contenders. No, I'm not saying Extraction is award-worthy, but it's quite a ride. If you're looking for something new to watch, I think you'll be pleased with this one, even though some may find it too violent.This film follows a badass mercenary who's looking for his next big job in order to keep his mind off a troubled past. Being recruited to track down and extract a kidnapped teenager, who's father is in prison, this mission becomes his most difficult one yet. Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is the brain and the brawn of this story and if he doesn't work as a character, the entire film would fall apart. Now, even though there is some care put into the emotional moments, Extraction is all about the action. If you're not a fan of too much violence or too much action, then I suggest looking elsewhere.Directed by stuntman Sam Hargrave, who has done many of the stunts for the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, pulls no punches in dropping you right into the action. From long single takes with fantastic fight choreography to the brutal amount of deaths throughout the movie, Hargrave, even though this was his first major outing as a director, was clearly the man for the job. Written by Joe Russo, I felt even more enticed to watch it, and while there's nothing all that groundbreaking about the script itself, it has enough character development to serve the action overall. I feel that Joe Russo could write a few more films that are heavy on the action because it seemed to work here.If I were to explain everything that happens throughout this movie, you'd think I'm describing something else you've already seen, but I really appreciated the fact that the incredible action scenes made this movie stand out. On top of that, Chris Hemsworth and Rudhraksh Jaiswal, who plays the kidnapped Ovi Mahajan, have some nice moments together. There are a few humorous lines to break the tension and a couple heartfelt interactions that gave the film time to breathe. I personally really enjoyed watching this one.In the end, as I said, Extraction won't be winning any awards and it definitely doesn't hold back in the body count area, so if that's not your thing, it may not be for you. For myself, I like a good action movie with likeable characters and this movie delivered on that for me. Sure, things feel underdeveloped and the film unfolds as you would expect it to, but it's all about the action and it absolutely delivers. Purely on an entertainment scale, I didn't have a lot of issues with Extraction, because I truly don't believe it was trying to be anything new in terms of storytelling. As long as you're okay with violence, I recommend checking this one out on Netflix.",Extraction
83,kuarinofu,Well done third person shooter videogame adaptation (with lots of borrowed stuff),6,24 April 2020,"Extraction is a lot to talk about.One should watch this film with an understanding that this is yet another film directed by a stunt coordinator, much like John Wick. So, there is not much to be expected in terms of story or characters.With this in mind, we encounter our first problem - Chris Hemsworth is very much miscast for the role. He looks ripped and all cool, he can do stunts, but he is too typecast as a good guy superhero to represent a generic washed up mercenary with no will to live. Also, and this is my personal humble opinion, he is not a good dramatic actor.This is where we find our third problem - the story is incredibly generic and unimaginative. You can easily spell out the dialogue before the characters do, just because you've heard it a million times.The film is a remarkably interesting combination of stunt ideas and cool scenes, mixed with inspirations and copypastas from other films, even the ones the director and the writer worked on together.What sucks is that all of these feel watered down, not even one of these borrows really works out in the end. The emotional connection base of a hired assassin and a kid who has no real family (for the assassin to become one for him) could not be done better than in Leon (1994) (or the Professional). The crime mogul intent on training a heir to replace him in time was also done before (but I can't recall now when and where), but in this film this plot goes absolutely nowhere, it just stops (while it could've been something interesting). The ending was also very reminiscent of the ending of Leon btw. The old friend subplot was super obvious, but it still felt like it was borrowed from 16 Blocks (2006). Some of the visuals of the film were inspired by John Wick (2014), Children of Men (2006) (the car chase), the shooting style of the action was reminiscent of 1917 (2019), the ""drowning in the water"" scenes were ripped straight out of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) (interestingly enough, the director of Extraction was a stunt double for Chris Evans, even the music from these scenes was very similar because it was composed by the same composer.I can go on and on, but I think by now you get the point.Anyway, even well shot action scenes still need a script. They don't work without a good story, they just get tiresome and kinda boring, this was very well demonstrated by Michael Bay's 6 Underground (2019).There are lots of reviews of Bangladesh nationals who were offended by the portrayal of the country and the capital, but I'm not one of them (this is why filmmakers tend to use fictional locations).Besides the action scenes, I also loved that this film had that amateur quality to it, like lots of slow scenes that don't really go anywhere, but they just look smart.You also don't see Hellboy brawl with Thor very often, not even talking about Thor kicking and punching kids around.Interesting film in terms of how much they've put into it, still feels like a third person shooter video game with bosses and enemy respawns. Clearly not the worst of the stunt-directed kind.Easy watch if you're bored, but don't forget to disable your brain first.",Extraction

The film may over complicate the storyline but it's a well created action film that the trailer didn't service very well.

85,tm-sheehan,Good performances and lots of action,7,10 August 2020,"My Review- ExtractionAccording to Netflix we joined the over 99 million viewers to watch Extraction since its release in April 2020 which means it holds the record of the most watched Netflix feature movie so far . It's difficult to tell who watched the entire movie as Netflix registers anyone who watched two minutes or more of a movie as a viewer. Unsurprisingly, Netflix is working on follow-ups to both ""Extraction"" and ""Birdbox.""a dystopian thriller starring Sandra Bullock which rated 89 million viewers .
I watched it because I was interested to see Chris Hemsworth in a role other than Thor and I was impressed by his performance as Tyler Rake, a fearless black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the of kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Chris Hemsworth obviously believed in this film as he's one of the Producers along with Joe Russo. Extraction cost $65 million to make, and producer/screenwriter Joe Russo argues that's around double the budget they'd have landed if it had released in theaters, and been funded elsewhere.
The entire ensemble cast are all very convincing in their respective roles but standout performance for me was 15 year old (at time of filming)
Rudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan, the son of Indian crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr. who is the kidnap victim. He is excellent in his role and the quality of his performance reminded me of Dev Pate's debut movie appearance in Slumdog millionaire.
Reviews have been mixed Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times praised the performances of Hemsworth and Hooda, and wrote: ""Featuring one of the most stunning action scenes in recent memory...
Violent thriller action films are not my favourite movie genre and believe me there is a lot of violence and blood shed in Extraction but I found it entertaining and the Action and stunt work is certainly well done and would have been even more spectacular on a proper Cinema Screen.
No wonder the film looks good it's Director Sam Hargrave an American stuntman, actor and director who is best known for his collaborations with the Russo brothers, including being the stunt coordinator for several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe including all the Avengers films .
Script writers include Joe Russo and Anthony Russo and they keep the action moving along at a frenetic pace.
I can't say much more except after seeing Extraction I'm sure Chris Hemsworth will succeed in branching out for roles to replace Thor when he decides to put his hammer away.

Was the director truly the person in charge of every creative and technical choice? Were the producers the ones responsible for most of the film? Or was the cast that carried the whole thing? Extraction might be Sam Hargrave's directorial debut, but he's been a stunt coordinator in Marvel films, working with the Russo brothers in Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame. The complexity of each choreography screams their names all the way through.Now, I don't want to take any credit from Hargrave! He has a clear vision of how the film should be like, and he delivers the best Netflix original action movie ever. While it's true that this last sentence doesn't really mean that much, it's genuinely great and far better than every other original action flick distributed by the streaming network. Two key components make Extraction a success: its unbelievable, jaw-dropping action, and Chris Hemsworth's extraordinary physical (and emotional) performance.I'll start with the actor. Chris Hemsworth is one of the most underrated actors working today. Everyone looks at his portrayal of Thor in the MCU, and think that he can't do anything else. First of all, Thor is one of the characters that changed the most within that universe. Chris has demonstrated both his dramatic and comedic range interpreting this superhero. However, in Extraction, not only his physical display and stunts are out of this world (he actually does quite a lot of them), but he's able to slow down and really delve into an emotionally compelling state. Brilliant performance!Nevertheless, the action steals the show. Joe and Anthony Russo help Sam Hargrave in bringing their Marvel's experience of having to balance dozens of characters at the same time, and the impressive choreography elevates the film so damn much. During the promotion campaign, people kept talking about a stunning oner (one-take sequence), which Chris Hemsworth himself described as ""the most complicated action sequence"" he's ever done... They were not joking nor overselling their movie. It's genuinely a work of art.I was so surprised by those (approximately) twelve minutes that I stopped the film, went back, and watched them again. I believe it's one of the pros that home viewing has against theaters. Just to be clear, it's not actually just one take. It's a collection of long takes ""stitched"" together to make it seem (and feel) like a oner. However, it doesn't diminish this incredibly technical achievement in any way, much on the contrary! The long takes are packed with all kinds of action: car chases, shootouts, knife fighting, hand combat, running, jumping, crawling, you name it.I'm going to put myself at risk and state that it's one of the best oners of an action flick in the last few years, especially if we don't count the two best action sagas of today (Mission: Impossible, John Wick). Throughout the whole runtime, the action is exceptionally filmed. The editing is impeccable, the excitement is always there, and the sense of urgency is never lost. It rarely gets over-the-top, every time our protagonist gets hit, cut, or even shot, it never feels like he should be down and dead. It's that base of realism inside an action movie that can make it become an outstanding success or a massive fail, and Extraction built a very solid one.This film has all the ingredients of popcorn-entertainment, and I'm confident it will get huge praise from, at least, the general public. However, it's evident that the Russo brothers and Hargrave didn't offer the screenplay the same care that they had with the action. Even though it's a pretty simple premise, the attempts at making secondary characters important or emotionally resonant fail its target completely. Even Tyler Rake gets a pretty cliche backstory that everyone has seen hundreds of times. I struggled to care for a single person or a relationship.The reason behind the whole extraction procedure being due to some drug warlords is so formulaic that it's honestly becoming annoyingly unimaginative. There isn't even a logical reason for them to be fighting each other over one's son. The movie also wraps up by leaving tons of questions unanswered regarding its plot, and with a ridiculous try at either being philosophical or actually ruining the entire thing. Finally, I was never a fan of films starting with a flashforward of the protagonist, especially in this genre. It takes away tension and suspense during the actual movie since the viewer knows the flashforward scene hasn't happened yet.In the end, Extraction is going to be remembered by its insane action and a fantastic lead performance by Chris Hemsworth. The latter is one of the most underrated actors working today, and he delivers not only a phenomenal physical performance but also an emotionally powerful display. The action is jaw-dropping at every level. The outstanding choreography plus the seamless editing are able to elevate the action into some of the best I've seen in the last few years, including a technically mind-blowing oner. The excitement levels are super high throughout the entire runtime, credit not only to the Russo brothers but also to the debutant director Sam Hargrave (who definitely leaves his mark action-wise), who all make a great film. However, the focus went all to the action, making the actual story and characters suffer from formulaic storytelling, cliche backstories, and an overall lack of emotional attachment. Still, Extraction is the best Netflix original action movie of its history, so don't miss it!Rating: B+",Extraction

89,SoumikBanerjee25,Delivered what it supposed to!,7,26 April 2020,"Expectations could vary depending on individuals. Some of us will love this just because it's full of action and of course the inclusion of Chris as the lead. And some of us will absolutely loathe it because it has zero plot importance and weak characterizations!To be honest I find myself in the middle. Frankly saying; Most of us already knew what's going to happen with the movie. You can't really expect much in terms of depth from an out to out action piece! And it surely stands out on what it promised.This has some scintillating action set pieces, with breathtaking adrenaline rush. Although the same scenes could look familiar for Regular Action fans but they look pretty good on screen nonetheless. The camera work here is phenomenal in those particular moments. The screenplay might not be that great but certainly it shines the most whenever any action starts. The technical efficiency can be easily noticed. I truly admire the efforts that have been put in by the Debutant Director here. As far the production value goes this ought to be on the top tier as Russo brothers are behind it. Hence the Execution looks matured in thrilling moments. I must mention that 11 Minute long one take scene; that looks magnificent. The Hand to Hand Combats, the Gun Fights all looked great as well. It's apparent that The technicalities are the major highlights over here.The performances are decent enough. Considering it's the Action Genre. But character build ups failed to impress. The writing falls short on many aspects. The Kid Character, he acted pretty well but I wanted to see more from him and his past or daily struggles. Being a Kid of a Druglord must be a Burdening thing on a day to day basis. Pankaj Tripathi as Indian Druglord; Well he was literally in one scene. It's Unfortunate to see such a talented individual getting such a low recognition here. Randeep Hooda as Saju was brilliant. Chris Hemsworth as Tyler performed great. His dedication and hardwork pays off.
The Bangladeshi druglord, well I see him as more of a Cliched overpowered villain like we used to get in 80's rather than a more structured modern day one.In the end It's a fast paced entertainer that hasn't got much depth in it. But it's full of Gruesome, Violent stuffs that Action Junkies might prefer a lot. For an ordinary group of audience this would be a Fun, Popcorn flick. Nothing more.",Extraction
90,mahmus,The most generic and forgettable action movie ever,4,26 April 2020,"This movie wants to be John Wick meets Sicario, but it lacks a unique enough identity to make it work.This is one of the most clichéd, generic and unremarkable action movies I've seen in a while.Everything from its ugly, yellow-tinted cinematography to its horrible script, makes it almost indistinguishable from some direct-to-video action film that no one ever buys.It isn't all negative though.
The action is, for the most part, pretty impressive.
There's one sequence that is one long take and it's by far the best moment in the movie (if you can overlook the painfully obvious hidden cuts).Chris Hemsworth's performance is alright, but his character is not memorable or likeable.
David Harbour shows up towards the middle and he's really good, but he's gone far too quickly.
The kid that plays Hemsworth's rescue target is really not good. He's suposed to be scared for most of the movie, but he just looks confused.It's a bore and it sucks, which is a shame, because there could be a good movie buried in here, somewhere.It also kinda, sorta, maybe sets up a sequel?
Which is wierd.",Extraction
91,maccas-56367,An action hero Aussie style,7,8 May 2020,"If you want non-stop action - then this is probably for you. It was refreshing to hear Hemsworth not only keep his Australian accent, but embrace the fact his character was Australian. It gave the one-liners an Aussie edge which I loved (as a fellow Aussie) and definitely enhanced my overall enjoyment of the film.Hemsworth was well-suited to this role and it perhaps signaled an entire career direction taking place. The action scenes are the highlight. The storyline was really just a backdrop to what were some of the best action cinematography and fight scenes I've seen in a while. There was a grittiness and realism which perhaps set it apart from the likes of John Wick - which it will no doubt be compared to.The setting of the film itself was a somewhat refreshing change from the usual. It simply added to the intensity of what was happening on screen. I was craving some explosions and shootout entertainment - and this certainly satisfied that itch!An ambiguous ending is sure to divide some viewers. But ultimately, Extraction was fairly satisfying and did exactly what it said on the packet.",Extraction
92,0w0,This movie has more plot holes than bullet holes... but it's watchable,6,26 April 2020,"Some 'news sources' and 'reviewers' have said that this movie contains too much blood/gore, but this movie contains no more blood/gore than John Wick, Rambo, Gladiator, or any of the other dozens of action movies out there that feature 1 guy killing many people...Also, those same 'news sources' and 'reviewers' have said this movie is a 'white savior' movie... but did those same hypocritical clickbaiters call Django Unchained, or Man on Fire, or Equalizer, or I am Legend, or Bad Boys, or Blade, or Hancock, or Book of Eli, or I Robot, or any of the other 'black savior' movies, the same thing? NOPE! That's because they are hypocrites! They call this movie a 'white savior' movie, simply because they want you to click on their website, that's all it is!Anyway, this movie has lots of plot holes: There were 2 opportunities where the main character could have killed his pursuer yet he didn't... this is sloppy writing and adds 2 plot holes. Considering how much trouble this pursuer gives the main character later on in the story, this writing choice was a conscious choice by the writers and they simply chose to ignore the massive plot hole that they created (twice).Also, the main character on more than one occasion chooses to not pick up a superior gun, and instead just runs around with his standard handgun... this is another plot hole and sloppy writing. I also counted at least 4 scenes where combatants engaged each other in hand-to-hand combat, despite there being a large abundance of weapons in the immediate vicinity... this is obviously done to create a false sense of drama and suspenseAnother plot hole is that in one scene the main character gets hit by a car that's going about 40kph... this is impossible seeing as the entire street was full of cars and people at that time... and then not even 1minute later, the main character hits another guy with a truck, yet as I stated previously, THE ENTIRE STREET was blocked with cars and people... so it's literally impossible for the truck to have been driven down the street, as it was blocked. That's another 2 plot holes right there.Overall, if you look past the glaring plot holes and sloppy writing, then the movie is watchable... I'd give it a 6/10... it's not NEARLY as good as Equalizer or John Wick or Taken, but if you've already watched all those movies, then I guess this movie would be OK to watch... I don't think the director (Sam Hargrave) did a particularly amazing job or a particularly poor job in his directorial debut either... we will just have to see if his next film will be any better",Extraction

94,MrDHWong,A generic kidnap and rescue story kept involving by its well shot action scenes and consistent performance by its main star,7,7 May 2020,"Extraction is an action thriller film based on the graphic novel ""Ciudad"" by Ande Parks. Starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role and directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, it is a generic kidnap and rescue story kept involving by its well shot action scenes and consistent performance by its main star.In Mumbai, India, Ovi Mahajan Jr (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a notorious Indian drug lord, is kidnapped and held to ransom by a group of gangsters working for Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's most ruthless drug kingpin, and brought to the capital city of Dhaka. As Ovi's father is currently in prison, he is unable to properly pay the ransom and time is running out over whether or not Ovi will be brought home in one piece. To ensure Ovi's safe return, former soldier and black market mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to travel to Dhaka to extract Ovi from his kidnappers and navigate through the dangerous city with Amir's gang and corrupt police officers hot on their tails.While this genre isn't anything new, Extraction still proves that with the right amount of creative action and star power, there is still some entertainment value to be had. The story follows the typical plot line of an important individual being kidnapped and a tough macho protagonist attempting to rescue said individual. Cliched and silly? Yes, but if that's what you enjoy, then this is for you. The strong violence and gore will certainly be off-putting to casual audiences, but for the most part I think it looked stylised in the vein of the graphic novel from which it was based. With that said, some of it did feel excessive at times and served little purpose other than for sensationalistic action scenes involving the two main characters. In terms of the screenplay, some it felt confusing near the beginning as it didn't do that good of a job establishing the differences between the Indian and Bangladeshi characters to the viewer. We are shown that there is something of a rivalry amidst the two countries involving their drug empires but it isn't really communicated that clearly how severe it is over the course of the film. Also, we see how some of the police forces in each country are in cahoots with the drug lords as they have been bribed to work in their favour but they only really show up in one or two scenes and aren't ever mentioned again. This felt like a missed opportunity to offer a commentary on police corruption but instead it was brushed aside for some more action.Stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, making his directorial debut, showcases his talents for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and single take shots that keep the viewer on edge. There were parts where I was reminded of some the action-packed moments depicted in the John Wick films, in that the lead character made good use of the surrounding environment to take out his adversaries, even using simple everyday objects as weapons. He also shows how claustrophobic the densely populated cities of India and Bangladesh can be when trying to maneuver through the large number of people to get to where one is going, especially if you're being pursued by dangerous gang members. I still think he has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as a storyteller, but he has certainly nailed the action and cinematography side of things.Chris Hemsworth plays his usual badass action hero self, shooting, stabbing and punching his way through a seemingly endless number of foes. At this point, it's pretty much confirmed that this is the only type of role he is capable of playing but still, if it ain't broke. I particularly liked his scenes with the young Ovi Jr and how he becomes something of a father figure to him throughout the course of film. There is a nice back and forth dynamic between the two, clearly reflecting on Hemsworth's personal love of India and its people. Unfortunately his interactions with the rest of the cast felt lacking, save for a scene or two with David Harbour, who plays an old army acquaintance of his. These were the only parts of the film that offer some kind of emotional connection with the audience, as the rest is merely bullets flying and things being blown up.As I mentioned earlier, this film offers nothing new from the kidnap and rescue genre but a great deal of its appeal comes from the action rather than the story. Reportedly, there is a sequel in development and although I don't really see this whole thing becoming a franchise, I think it does provide an opportunity for further world building and the ironing out of some this film's issues. If you have nothing better to watch on Netflix, then there's not much else to say but sit back and enjoy this for what it is.I rate it 6.5/10",Extraction

There's a ten minute-plus seemingly one-shot action sequence that is absolutely outstanding. The fights are so brutal and each more creative than the last. John Wick showed that having stunt coordinators direct action movies could be a winning formula. Extraction is another example of this as the Russo Brothers hired their Avengers stunt coordinator for this project. It's lacking the sleekness of John Wick, but goes in a different direction with a raw, gritty approach to action and a real Call of Duty vibe. Chris Hemsworth is great and this is easily one of his best performances outside of Thor.

Since it's directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, I had a feeling the action would be impressive and indeed it was but everything else was lacking in comparison.Extraction follows Tyler Rake, a mercenary who goes on a deadly extraction mission where he has to rescue a huge crime lord's kidnapped son.The biggest enjoyment you can get from Extraction is the action sequences. I have to give a huge amount of credit to everyone who worked on the choreography of the action. All the action scenes are brutal and look very realistic. There is this incredible 10 minute sequence that looks like it's done in one take which is any action lover's dream. The camerawork and stunts during that scene are really well done. I can't imagine the amount of time that would've been invested just on that one scene. I wish I could say the same for the script.If you're going to watch this film for the plot and characters, then you will be disappointed. The Russo Brothers, who made films like Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, wrote the screenplay and it's pretty bad. Apart from the action, there is nothing else to it. We barely learn about Hemsworth's character and the relationship between him and Jaiswal was extremely underdeveloped. This made it so difficult for me to care about them especially the end where it mattered. David Harbour is in the film but he didn't get to do much. He was completely wasted. There wasn't much to the villain either. A movie like John Wick has great action scenes as well but at the same time there is a good amount of character development within it.Extraction is very forgettable. The action is commendable but I've seen better in films like John Wick and The Raid. Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were good but the material they had to work with had a lot left to be desired.",Extraction

Another great action movie produced by Netflix that people should watch this summer and have fun. This movie draws a lot of inspiration from other movies like: The Bodyguard, Mile 22, 3:10 to yuma and etc. All these movies have the same features: the relationship between two very different characters and delivering a ""package"". Extraction has the same features as well, only it is done in a perfect way and without flaws. The relationship between Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the target Ovi is intense and draws the attention, most of their scenes together are good and create the sort of drama this film has. One of the most memorable sequences of the film is the 11 minute action sequence throughout the movie that looks like it's a one - shot. No cuts but just a full one shot sequence that is perfection with a lot of camera movements and scenery. I think I might watch the movie again just for that sequence. Chris Hemsworth is good as always, not only as a professional assassin but also in giving a real acting performance. I highly recommend for those who love action and there is plenty so enjoy.",Extraction

It's a beautifully crafted movie with commendable cinematography, good action sequences and beautifully visualized South Asian countries.

What did not work:
Even if the movie ended with showing the lead actor( not wanting to spoil the movie) visually, it would have worked as well. One thing that is not bad for the eyes but less convincing is the idea of one man army destroying the army effortlessly. It's one of those movies

Makes for very unsatisfying viewing. Kids might like it. But, adults? Give us a moment to breathe. After awhile, who cares anymore?Hargrave also plays Rake's sniper back-up on the rescue mission. The much-hyped scene that lasts over 10 minutes, goes from car chase to close combat and gunfights that wind in and out of flats, to people jumping from roof to roof, falling off a building, getting hit by a car, and ending in a big explosion. The entire scene was all-around crazy. The next-most-satisfying thing is seeing Rake slapping the hell out of a young, obnoxious gang of boys sent after him. Then, there's also the gorgeous Golshifteh Farahani, who blasts a helicopter down. Can we have a spin-off that focuses on her character? The Iranian actress plays Nik, who's Rake's controller, and also the only woman with a substantial role in the film. Extraction is very close to an all-male movie. With Farahani in it, it's like someone eventually realised that the film could use a badass female character, too.In the best moments, you can see Hemsworth and the stunt performers do their brutal hand-to-hand choreography in close quarters, but the camera is often so close to them that it's hard to get a clean look at the action. Impressive only on a technical level, the sequence drifts towards the uncanny valley of video game-dom, particularly in a lengthy car chase section involving a squad of police cars, aiming for gripping immediacy and missing the mark.The acting was good.

It's an all out action film with some absolutely brilliant action scenes, the long takes worked so well and was really good to watch. The reason why I enjoyed it is because it's an almost mindless action plot where there's car chases, guns, fighting, explosions and more guns. Sometimes people just need a release and watch some simple good action and this is it.Linking to what I just said, the plot. So, it doesn't go into any kind of depth into the villain whatsoever, it was just this is who he is, deal with it. Why did he have all this power? He just needed depth. He was also barely in it. Like I said before it didn't bother me at all, but I can see why that would fuss a lot of others. Same concept for a lot of the characters that wasn't the kid or Tyler (Hemsworth).Overall if you like action films then give this a watch. It has all the elements you want and shot superbly.

110,danielcereto,"John Wick, Sicario and Rambo",5,24 April 2020,"John Wick, Sicario and Rambo are three of my favorite action movies of all time. These are great action movies. Extraction is just an average one because three main reasons.First, acting is pretty poor. I do not expect an Oscar winner as a lead actor, but Keanu, Benicio and even Sly, are more credible than Chris. I like Chris but not here. I didn't feel any empathy for him.Second, the script is pretty weak and the ending a joke. Again, I do not expect too much, but there are a bunch of extremely unbelievable situations and decisions by the characters that makes this movie sometimes awkward.Last, the use of CGI here is not bad but some explosions looked cheap and the scene jumping from the waterfall and then doing underwater meditation was embarrasing.
There are many examples of good action movies with a low budget but pretty real, raw and brutal. Check action scenes on Rambo 4 to see what I am talking about.
So, overall an average action film to watch during the lockdown. Forgettable after it.",Extraction
111,PyroSikTh,More Than Just Its 12-Minute Longshot,7,27 April 2020,"I didn't expect much from this movie. The Netflix tag still doesn't quite instill confidence despite their recent successful hits, and the action genre is one rife with hit and miss entries. I've already read quite a bit of feedback on this movie, and I feel like there's one key point they're all missing; this is a mindless action movie. Judging it on the merits of being a deep, thought-provoking character study is unfair. However judging it on the merits of being a balls-to-the-wall action flick, there's actually a lot here to redeem itself and set it apart from other attempts.Okay, there isn't much plot to Extraction. The entire story is summarised in the movie's title. Hemsworth plays a mercenary; Tyler, who's sent to Bangladesh in order to extract a drug-lord's son from the possession of a rival drug-lord. The entire city goes on lockdown and Tyler has to fight his way through henchmen and a corrupt police force in order to get out. There's some nice twists here and there from changing allegiances, and a few points of foreshadowing and plot payoffs, but there's nothing that requires you to really wrap your brain around it, and honestly that's okay. This isn't Inception. Truth be told Extraction has a lot more plot (from the aforementioned allegiance switches and payoffs) than I expected, so I feel like calling it mindless is a little baseless.Another thing about Extraction that plays against the dull and plot-less complaints is the character work. Again this isn't a full-on character study, and the background development we do get is a little cliché, but it's way more than your average run-of-the-mill action flick usually gets to enjoy. Tyler is a broken man after the death of his son and the breakdown of his marriage. He spends his days getting drunk and doing death-defying feats for fun. He has no more love of life. He doesn't get into the job because he cares about the kid or anyone involved. He just wants his money. But being haunted by the death of his son ends up making him more sympathetic to the fate of this kid, and as the movie goes on, the money means less to him. He just wants to get this kid out safe and alive.But Tyler isn't the only one that enjoys a hefty amount of personality. The movie also makes a bit to explore other more fringe characters, the most notable of which is Saju, the kids keeper after his father was incarcerated. With assets frozen, he can't afford to pay the mercenaries what he owes, so he tries to finish the job himself, against them. We get a look into his family life and his motivations behind his actions, and sit with him in the downtimes between action sequences. He becomes as much the lead character as Tyler does, earning respect and sympathy from the audience. You end up really rooting for this guy even as him and Tyler sparr off. We also get a small glimpse into the world of the antagonist drug-lord, showing us how despicable he really is by casually killing kids without a care, and brainwashing those left over to work for him. Extraction is brutal to its kids, but it plays to Tyler's predisposition and creates a much tighter and meaningful narrative than many give it credit for.But Extraction isn't about its plot or its characters, even though I feel those aspects are being unfairly criticised. Extraction is an action movie, directed by an ex-stuntman, starring muscled action stars from across the globe. In fact on that last point I particularly liked the movie's dedication to casting people roughly from the same area their character is meant to be from (or I guess vice versa; rewriting characters to fit the actor's background). Tyler is Australian, David Harbour plays a grizzled American on foreign soil, Nik is played by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, and while most the Bangladeshi characters are actually played by Indian actors, it's at least closer than most Hollywood casting. I particularly hope this opens up more Western opportunities for Randeep Hooda who played Saju, oozing charisma and cool without speaking a word, and effortlessly earning audience sympathies.But anyway, horrific tangent aside, Extraction is about its action sequences, and on that it certainly doesn't fail. This is another movie in the likes of John Wick and Atomic Blonde that prefers its action gritty and efficient. There's style here for sure, but it rarely breaks suspension of disbelief, and we see real consequences for all the hits these characters take. Tyler takes time bandaging his arm and putting it in a sling, Saju has to put his broken nose back into place, and David Harbour offers probably the most realistic reaction to being shot in the chest I've seen in a long time. There's no flying acrobatics, and no artistic flailing of limbs to make the choreography look pretty. It's brutal and efficient fighting, showing how exhausting it can all be. Ammo counts and reloading matters, getting punched in the face is different to being kicked in the gut, being run-over by a car hurts. And this is before mentioning the soon to be most-talked-about 12-minute long shot action scene that spans car chases, knife fights, gun fights, and apartment brawls, following multiple characters and different perspectives with seamless match-cuts to give the illusion of a neverending single shot.But the action isn't a complete winner, and there are reasons I'm apprehensive to label it as 'realistic'. Certain objects come out of nowhere for no reason just for excitement purposes, like high-speed cars heading down a dead-end. While there's no flying around, there are some cable stunts that are a little hard to swallow, like Tyler grabbing a kid by the leg and effortlessly throwing him into a car door. There's also a number of sniper moments that feel like they take too many liberties with how sniping works. Normally this would be pernickety even for me, but for a movie that wallows in it's accurate portrayal of gun fights, from injuries to the differentiation of sounds (pistols make more of a 'pah' sound, for instance), giving sniper superhuman abilities like seeing round corners and 100% accuracy just felt little lazy. In any other action movie I probably wouldn't have minded these slip-ups so much, but when the rest of it is all so tightly choreographed and mapped out, slipping up and breaking believability becomes so much more noticeable.In some regards, Extraction is just an average, run-of-the-mill action flick, and in others it's up there with some of the genre's modern greats. There are stakes, characters have emotional backbones even if they are a little cliché, there aren't any deeper themes, but the narrative is still tight and focussed, the action is more phenomenal than it is irksome, the cinematography is a little bland, the soundtrack can feel like a rip-off of better scores, but these kinds of motifs are iconic because they work so well. I find Extraction a hard one to judge because it feels greater than it has any right to be, while also hitting just shy of the mark. But generally I fall positive, so I give Extraction a respectable 7/10, and honestly I could see myself bumping it up with subsequent rewatches. There's a lot in this movie to like.",Extraction

114,ethanbresnett,Pretty run of the mill as action films go,7,9 May 2020,"There honestly isn't too much to say about Extraction. I am slightly disappointed as I'd heard great things about an action sequence oner and it was Netflix's number one film at time of watching. It didn't really live up to this hype, but was still an enjoyable action film nonetheless.The action was fun although a tad repetitive by the end. I did feel like we were getting the same sequences just in different locations for some parts of the film. Saying that though there was some great camera work during the close quarters combat, particularly a scene in an apartment building following a car chase. The choreography was always tight, maintaining a gritty and dangerous feel. Pretty unforgiving at times in its violence and pace, Extraction does provide solid entertainment.With regards to the plot... it was so so. Nothing stand out, nothing bad. There are some action films driven by plot, far more driven by action, and this was definitely one of the latter. In this sense then the plot was good as it facilitated the action sequences and they all made sense and flowed within the world that was created. Nothing felt too out of place or fantastical, with the action remaining (for the most part) in the realms of plausibility.Overall Extraction is a fun watch but nothing more. Its not revolutionary or ground breaking in the genre, but is a good two hours of entertainment and well worth watching if action films are your thing.",Extraction

117,stevenrotherforth,It's been done before but rarely as good as this,8,27 April 2020,"With a title that should be the name of a crappy Steven Seagal movie that you'd find at the bottom of a DVD bargain bin, this movie was surprisingly rather good.
Of course the plot is a recycled one but hey! Recycling is good right?Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary who is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned crime lord.
It's a simple premise. One that's been reincarnated many times before but rarely as entertaining as this.
The Russo brothers of 'Avengers' fame produce with first time director Sam Hargrave at the helm.
I say first time. Hargrave has directed several short films but this is his first feature film.
A renowned stuntman and stunt coordinator. Hargraves has crafted a fine action movie with 'Extraction'. His expertise shine through with some of the best hand to hand combat scenes this side of 'John Wick'.
There's a beautifully shot car chase in which the camera stays in the car so we the audience feel like a passenger. There really is some marvellous direction of action here.
The film maybe basic but the fascinating camera work is certainly a cut above.
After this I can see Hargrave's being in big demand.
He knows how to get the best out of his actors too.
Hemsworth is in full badass mode and sells every single punch.
Apart from his excellent performances as Thor, he's never been better.
Hemsworth has the talent, charisma and physic to follow in the footsteps of Sly and Arnie.
There's not too many genuine action stars anymore. Chris Hemsworth is totally believable onscreen and it's clear like Keanu Reeves he's doing most of the arse kicking himself and not relying on a trained martial artist or stuntman.Presented in Dolby Vision on Netflix, 'Extraction' is a visual treat.
It boasts a 4K crisp image.
There's absolutely no film grain which allows for a digitally crisp picture.
Detail is very strong with sweat and grime visible in every pore. Close ups reveal every hair strand and blood soaked clothing as fine texture.
The movie has a amber coloured filter making the whole look of the movie feel hot, sweaty and gritty.If the visuals are good then we should have a great sound mix to accompany it right?
Well rest assured that the Dolby Atmos mix that is available for those rocking a dedicated home theatre system is one of the best Netflix has to offer.
There's plenty going on up top with helicopters and bullets wizzing overhead.
In ceiling or height speakers will have to work hard.
Surround sound effects are constant. Ambience or action, there's always something finding its way around the soundstage.
LFE is rich and punchy.
Gunshots have a realistic thud whilst mid range sound is crisp as depleted shells bounce off the floor.
My only gripe with the sound mix is that the centre channel, particularly dialogue could become muddled from time to time causing me to raise my centre speaker by a few dB.
All in all this movie offers a fine surround sound experience.
The action scenes are demo worthy.
The film itself was a joyous surprise and one that those with a Netflix subscription should definitely check out.",Extraction

Directed by the experienced stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Sam Hargrave, ""Extraction"" is an action-packed and eye-pleasing romp of violent action, anchored by excellent stunt work and often impressive camera trickery.""Extraction"" is yet another addition to the Netflix blockbuster collection, perhaps a notch better than most before, but flawed in all the same ways. The story is based on the graphic novel ""Ciudad"" co-written by Russo brothers, who adapted it into this film script as well. It's a highly derivative plot, mirrors tens if not hundreds of other thrillers, possesses a high predictability factor, and, as a sum, is just narrow and shallow. It tends to be unrealistic, which is no biggie for a blockbuster like this one, but in the second half, specifically the finale sequence on the bridge, it got a little too far fetched. The character of Tyler Rake (cheesy, isn't it) is your usual cardboard American hero in his usual swipe-and-pick-your-action-man story arch. Where ""Extraction"" truly shines is in the action department, which, obviously, takes up most of the screen time. The first half offers many amazing and satisfyingly violent action scenes showcasing impressive choreography and a little insane camera/editing work. Around the middle of the movie we have the talky-talky interlude, after which we get back to action, this time a little weary, as it gets a tad repetitive, and the climax is plagued by some perhaps small unrealistic touches, but a little frustrating nevertheless. The performances are fine and dandy, but almost the entirety of the roles weren't much broader than one dimension. Naturally, such an action-heavy an expensive movie is coated up in good overall aesthetical design, great cinematography and an okay if a little too contemporary original score.""Extraction"" offers no revolution, not even any tweaks, but it will entertain You with great action sequences, and if You come expecting it to be for what it is, You should not be met with disappointment.

Except perhaps with slightly less 'badass empowered female' action, which was refreshing. There is a lot of violence, but it still felt watered down. It could have been way darker and edgier, which would have been more realistic too, but the main character was held back by the script.

There are a lot of moments packed of tension and this is exactly how this kind of films should be made. The one take like scene at the beginning, required a lot of planning and care, but the result definitely pays off. Stunts artists made a wonderful job and VFX department realized amazing and very realistic effects.The story is basically non-existent, and the plot is extremely predictable. So, if you are looking for a profound screenplay, search elsewhere. I really wish that this production was a little bit more balanced. Characters are mono dimensional, not deepen at all. They are basically tropes, that I have watched many times. It is possible to create interesting and capturing narratives, while having great action. ""Atomic Blonde"" and ""John Wick 2 and 3"" are just a couple of examples. When I ""review"" a movie, I need to consider all the elements and having just technically solid and impressive scenes, does not suffice to create a captivating production.

127,DeBBss,"Cliche, but Entertaining",6,6 May 2020,"Extraction is one of those really stereotypical action movies where you know what's going to happen, but it's super entertaining. Extraction does exactly what's it's supposed to do, and it does it perfectly. The action is so good that it actually holds the movie up when everything else holds it down. If the plot and characters where more compelling, then Extraction could've been one of the best action movies since John Wick.The plot follows a mentally scarred ex soldier merc who rescues the protagonist. Since this plot has been done too many times to count, it becomes nearly impossible to be just slightly unique. Extraction does one thing different, and that's the setting. It's unheard of that an action movie takes place in Bangladesh or anywhere near Bangladesh, but Extraction took the opportunity. Bangladesh is a hidden gem for settings because the possibilities are endless, and you can have some beautiful cinematography.When it comes to the action it's great until the last act for me because of how repetitive it becomes. By the time you reach the last act, you pretty much become desensitised to the action. If they slowed it down and had more dialogue, it would have been a breath of fresh air, and possibly be more emotional. Other than the repetitiveness, the action was really good. The character development and execution was good, although the cliche was to the max.This was Sam Hargrave's first big time directional debut, and it's a promising outing. Everything was shot well and the choreography was super impressive, and those few fight scenes where the most entertaining scenes in the movie. The editing was done masterfully too, as many action movies do a terrible job with showing all the action, but in Extraction, you witness everything.Overall, Extraction is a movie that is a definite watch if you're bored. Although Extraction does have issues, it doesn't really matter because this movie has one goal and that's to entertain you.",Extraction

Director: Sam Hargrave
Starring: Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, Pankaj Tripathi etc
Overall rating 92/100Extraction is based on a black-market Mercenary called Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who must go on his riskiest extraction yet where he has to save a young boy from two feuding gangs. I thought Extraction was excellent and there is so many good things to talk about so let's get started.First of all, the cinematography/visual creativity and set pieces were fantastic. Having the film set in India was a really interesting choice for an action movie and for me it really worked. The cramped streets were perfect for action sequences and the temples being beautiful to look at which is something that directors of action don't usually do. The film's cinematography and visual creativity was fantastic as well, the rich colours of yellow and orange were fantastic and the camera work was also excellent with the camera following the characters through some of the scenes and in the car chase scenes which created a great effect making you feel like you are in the movie with them.My next positives would be the film's tense tone, gore, and incredible action. The film managed to execute an excellent tense tone throughout, with the film managing to even make you jump on multiple occasions due to it's deliberate lack of sound making you on the edge of your seat for a large portion of the movie. The film's gore and action for me was some of the best parts of the movie. Due to the film's constant nonstop action you were consistently entertained throughout and never bored, the variety of different action scenes and the creativity within them were as good as John Wick without a doubt. And the excessive use of gore was fantastic as well and added to the impact of the action scenes with even me having to look away on a couple of occasions.My Only two nit-picks with the movie for me would be the lack of character background and the slight lack of depth to the plot. The film just went straight into the action in the beginning without any background information on the main character which I always find slightly annoying, we learned more as the movie went on, but it's always nice if you feel partly connected to the character before the action kicks in. And the movie did suffer from a slight lack of depth to it's plot, this is largely because the movie largely went for style over substance which fortunately for the movie is fine and perfectly acceptable, but it was very much one objective throughout leading to an end you were largely expecting so it would have been nice if they added a few more layers to the movie.My next two positives would be the character depth and the director not being afraid to cross near the line with child gang members. The movie went into a surprising amount of character depth with Chris Hemsworth's character that I wasn't expecting. His whole background of losing his son at a young age was truly heart-breaking, but it also made you understand his character more by how much he was willing to sacrifice in order to save the child that he became connected to, so this was well done. The director also was not afraid to cross near the line with use of kids in gangs. It was shocking to me how many of the kids were in the street gangs, but it also portrayed a more realistic portrayal of what gang culture looks like which I found interesting. The fact that the film was so willing to kill off the children was also shocking but made you dislike the antagonists more therefore doing a successful job.My final two positives would be the film's excellent performances and emotional weight. Chris Hemsworth was excellent in Extraction. He pulled of all the action sequences excellently which as an audience was well aware due to the marvel cinematic universe. But he really got his moment to shine here, but he also showed versatility with his acting as well with his characters more sensitive side. The debut performance (at least for me) of Rudhraksh Jaiswal was exceptionally good as well considering he is a much younger actor. The movie also had a surprising amount of emotional weight which I was not expecting as well, When Tyler opened up about losing his son it got to me emotionally which was a welcome surprise, and the fact that he saw his son in the kid really showed after he sacrificed himself to save him which I thought was powerfully executed, also with a clever link back to the beginning with the underwater scene with the kid at the end becoming like Tyler.Overall despite perhaps not having as deep of a plot as it could have had. Extraction is an excellent movie, with excellent creativity with its action and visuals, excellent performances and the blending of action and large amounts of emotion which is rarely used and was executed excellently proving that Chris Hemsworth definitely has an acting life outside marvel.",Extraction
129,msunando,A celebration of high octane action wrapped around a hollow plot,5,26 April 2020,"Extraction - It's high octane action, display of brawn and muscles, a celebration of firearms and a whole lot of blood & gore. That's Extraction for you. The story is a wrap around the central theme - more action. Since this has already made you curious, Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a mercenary working on death defying assignments, is given the responsibility of extracting Ovi Mahajan Jr. (Rudraksh Jaiswal), the son of an international crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi, in a blink and you miss role) from the den of another crime lord Amir Asif (Priyanshu Paiyuli), based in Dhaka. Also in the fray to rescue Ovi is Saju (Randeep Hooda) who works for Ovi Sr., under the threat that the failure will lead to the elimination of Saju's family.It's a formulaic pot boiler really. The only difference is that there's very little spoken stuff, exchanges are mostly in the form of armed combats, car chases and raining bullets. In its cheapest form, the hand to hand combats are with a myriad of knives, or anything else that is found handy. The high point in the film for me was when Hemsworth speaks in Bangla asking for evidence, ""Promaan Dao"" (show me the evidence, for those who didn't know), not once but thrice stunning the original captors and the dumb struck audience - I am almost certain that the looks on our faces would have mirrored those he was addressing on screen. Well, after a couple of hours of mayhem Ovi is indeed rescued but not before almost everyone dies.

And the purists be damned.There is relentless action. I didn't count but I believe Hemsworth would have slayed 200+ soldiers in the 100 minute run time. The action set pieces are designed to blow you away. There is one in particular, a 10 minute long, one - shot sequence that should make watching this worth your while.The story is as long as it's IMDb summary. There is nothing more to it. It is meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and that it does in almost every frame.Hemsworth doesn't have much to do, in the acting department. He has to sling a machine gun or draw a knife and kill/maim every living being, be it a boy or a man, that he comes across.
Randeep Hooda gets a surprisingly long bit and does as good as he can.There would be detractors who would cry about the lack of aesthetics and a deep storyline, about big wasteful budget.

You'll grow sick of bad dudes being punched, so hard that you'll start a campaign for the prevention of violence against bad dudes.
Simplistic and mediocre plot otherwise. Watch Man On Fire if you want that kind of vibe but can't stand Liam Neeson trying to not look old or if you cannot have your films all have a green/ brown camo tint.
Hemsworth plays a mercenary in ... somewhere. The ethnically-challenged son of some guy gets kidnapped. C.H. proceeds to extract him. As they get shot at by goons with terrible aim, C.H. has to face the ethical consideration that, while he's extracting the kid from a bunch of criminals, the guy who he's bringing it back to is *also* a criminal. Because anyone who is not white is a criminal, in one way or another.

The character motivations turn from questionable to directly contradictory. The protagonists clearly become the bad guys, but not in a way that feels like the director wants you to think they are the bad guys.

The story/plot isn't weak its mearly simple & that's all it needs to be, it doesn't need to be complex because its all about the action.
This is simply a 1st class adrenaline pumping roller-coaster ride.
Cinematography is excellent.
Camerawork is excellent.
Stunt work is excellent.
Locations are excellent.
Acting is excellent, not just Hemsworth but everyone involved.
Now back to the whingeing girlyboys, absolutely no one watching this movie is going to make a judgement about the country or its people that are depicted in this movie, just like no one made a judgement about the countries or people shown in Taken or Bourne or Rambo or any other fictional action thriller, its over the top, over dramatised made up for maximum entertainment.
Now its a good thing to be proud of where you're from but it is utter lunacy to protest that crime & corruption doesn't exist in the country you live, it exists & prospers in every village, town & city on this planet.
Have some common sense & review this movie for what it is, it isn't a documentary, it isn't a biography & it sure as hell isn't a tourism video depicting all the pretty sites with all its pretty people, it's an action thriller & a damed good one at that.",Extraction

The cast aren't great and the plot is predictable. The ending tried to be different but it just played out quiet silly. I'm sure it'll spawn a few sequels as there isn't much work needed to make these types of films. I'm sure alot of action fans will enjoy it and it's simplicity but for me, it lacked any standout performances or anything to think about or remember..

For one, Hemsworth's character is named Tyler Rake, and he kills two people with a rake. It's a nice wink by the filmmakers. Another highlight is the extended tracking shot during the movie's strongest and most violent sequence. I'm not sure if it's the best tracking shot ever in an action movie, but it very well may be the longest.If you enjoy action movies, you'll probably enjoy this one.

Great action scenes, great cast (including the amazingly beautiful Golshifteh Farahani), but with no surprises beyond the initial premise.

156,faithless4734,Soooooo no real story at all....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,6,25 April 2020,"So 43 minutes in and so far we have about that many lines of dialogue making for zero actual story. I will say that the fight scene that I paused to type my thoughts so far is probably the best knife fight I can remember ever seeing in a movie so kudos for that. To bad they ended the way they did totally ruined that fight scene. Next oddity, why does this kid keep trusting Hemsworth? So we have in this story a typical troubled hero with something in his past that haunts him and drives him to make the choice that ultimately kills him but also makes him a hero. We have the innocent caught in a world he does not belong in and completely out of his element. We have the woman who loves the hero from afar and has never had the courage to act on her love. We have the trusted henchman that double crosses his boss only to be destroyed in the end. Finally we have the evil tyrants on both sides spreading hate and death for selfish reasons and greed in this case as often is the case two warring drug lords. 60 minutes, I am getting a bit bored of the same old same old. Oh my, the old friend, I just paused again, I am gonna guess that the old friend betrays him and tries to make an excuse about how he has to survive or they came to him and threatened his family or something like that. Watch it to see if I am right. 1:21 unforeseen twist, not completely unpredictable but I did not see it. Final thoughts; Randeep Hooda aka Saju is a fantastic action actor and I really enjoyed watching him in this movie and hope to find some others he is in that I can watch. Hemsworth does an admirable job of playing an operator or special forces or whatever you choose to call his past roll. We knew how the movie would end, however, that does not mean I or we should be happy about this, it was a bullstuff ending and frankly lost a star from me over the ending itself. (Yes I know this was based on someone else's work, a graphic novel, so what it is still bullstuff.)",Extraction

158,totalovrdose,A Highly Rewatchable Entertaining Action Flick,9,25 April 2020,"Extraction is a brainless action film, which not only understands its identity, but under the competent helm of Sam Hargrave, is executed beautifully. Many action films feel the need to insert shaky hand-held camera (I'm looking at you Michael Mann), or worse still, frenetic cuts that are challenging to follow, but it's the use of steady-cam, and the smooth pacing, that really makes the film easy to watch.With plenty of shoot-outs, some fine looking explosions (though one is a little hit and miss), plenty of guys being thrown left and right by the protagonist, and the inclusion of the best knife fight I have seen since Jeong-Beom Lee's The Man From Nowhere, this film has virtually everything 'cept the kitchen sink. I had heard the film's violence was viscerally exaggerated, though I would disagree. It's no Freddy Vs. Jason, but it's no Jason Bourne either, so expect to see your fair share, but you won't ever need a towel to wipe it from your screen.A good action film needs an equally great villain accompanying it. Extraction, in this department, is rather lacking. Priyanshu Painfulli portrays drug-lord Amir, whose innumerable henchmen and child soldiers are enforced by Shataf Figar as the Colonel, who can authoritatively shut down the city of Bangladesh in a heartbeat when crap hits the fan. These characters are similar to The Voice in Man on Fire; rarely ever seen, yet their influence is around every corner. To exacerbate their ruthlessness, more screen-time was needed.The use of metaphor is well inserted on occasion, through dialogue and accompanying visuals, and it is this that perhaps gives the most depth to Chris Hemsworth's Tyler, other than the moments when he simply tells us his backstory to strangers, akin to Cruise and Foxx in Collateral (without the antagonism). He portrays a larrikin mercenary, his genuine Australian accent accentuating his tough guy image (because who doesn't like a good occa?), his boyish charms and poignant backstory making him incredibly likable. Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenager he is assigned to 'extract' from Amir, who has had him kidnapped for not only a large sum, but to show his imprisoned father who's boss, is also equally enjoyable to watch, and though he receives the same lacking amount of characterization, his humanity is an engraved part of the film.Randeep Hooda joins the cast as Saju, a bodyguard whose intentions are initially difficult to fathom, though his limited characterization reveals a family-man buried beneath his grizzled exterior. David Harbour's Gaspar, who is in the film for probably all of eight minutes, portrays a character who believes the end justifies the means, while Golshifteh Farahani as Nik, is easily the only character capable of stealing the light from Hemsworth. A brilliant tactician, who can control any situation, and can wield all manner of conventional firearms - she is the ultimate waifu.At the end of the day, the story is pretty bare-bones; boy gets kidnapped and must be rescued, with predictable double-crosses abound, though that doesn't make it any less entertaining, or recommendable - at the same time though, it is forgettable, requiring little in the way of brain power. For a film that occasionally breaks the 'show don't tell' rule of cinema, the end is very much multi-interpretative, adding depth to an otherwise two-dimensional feature. I personally think Hemsworth should be in more movies like this; gritty fun action films that remind us of decades earlier, when movies were more concerned with entertainment, instead of politics, whilst Hargrave has equally shown us that stuntmen, much like Chad Stahelski and David Lietch, make for some of the best action directors in the business today.",Extraction

161,Slarkshark,Elite Modern Action,9,18 February 2021,"Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) falls straight into the bad ass column with company such as John Wick. 'Extraction' and 'John Wick' are quite different kinds of movies, but they are both upper echelon action. Hemsworth is an absolute beast and electric throughout.As stated with other reviews the plot is simple, which I have absolutely no issue with. Too often nowadays films are muddled with confusing or unrealistic plot twists. Something like this it's best to keep it to the point with the focus on fantastic action sequences.Speaking of action sequences, how about that continuous scene of 11 minutes and change? This is of course accomplished with several takes and gives the illusion of an uninterrupted thrill ride, but impressive nonetheless. That long of an exciting scene reminded me of the one at the beginning of 'The Revenant'It was nice to see Hollywood and Bollywood come to together and make this. It's not often we see movies like this take place in this part of the world.With the limited amount of movies we got in 2020, 'Extraction' is likely my favourite action movie of the year. A non stop adrenaline rush that delivers high quality fight choreography, stunts, and competent gun fighting. This is no doubt due to director, Sam Hargrave's extensive knowledge and experience in those areas. Well worth the watch.",Extraction
162,achyutaghosh,There is Thor vs Hellboy- do you need anything else?,6,26 April 2020,"In Extraction, Chris Hemsworth does not have Mjolnir by his side. He still manages to ratchet up a triple digit bodycount to save a drug lord's son. How ungodly of him.The plot is as simple as it gets- India's biggest drug lord's son gets kidnapped for ransom by Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, and the former enlists Hemsworth's group of mercenaries for the rescue. Of course, the obstacles start piling up, and Thor summons up all the thunder he can to save the innocent.Neflix may have thought a movie set in Bangladesh offers novelty, but their treatment is so formulaic, that you replace Bangladesh with any other 3rd world country setting, the movie would virtually remain the same. The 10 year old child soldiers, machete waving teenagers, corrupt police forces and simply high gangsters could fit in anything set in Mexico, Africa or Burma. There is absolutely no attempt to develop the precious few characters in the movie, including the leads.Seems Chris Hemsworth is saving his laughs for Marvel only. Here he plays Tyler Rake- a mercenary with a heart of gold and lot of bullets- you know the kind of characters Arnold used to play back in the 80s. Regular Netflix stalwarts Pankaj Tripathi, Neha Mahajan and David Harbour play side characters, but the one man that really makes every scene count is a buffed up Randeep Hooda. He stands toe to toe against Hemsworth in the action sequences, and gets a poignant send-off too. Rest of the cast are caricatures of the highest order.Irrespective of the genericity of the plot, Extraction is probably one of Netflix's most well-choreographed action movie. and why not- given that director Sam Hargreaves has been the stunts director in a host of Marvel movies. Mind you, this is no Chad Stahelski, or Gareth Edwards stuff. Hargreaves trades off Chad's style, and Gareth's art for effective brute. It is a cocktail of everything you see in action movies- manic car chases, exploding helicopters, sniper fire, close quarter gunfights, and car crashes, and from a first time film-maker, really impressive at that.Am sure he will only get better- and learn to nuance his characters a bit more, and make his movies a bit less predictable.But the two things that make up my price of my time cost of viewing are the epic Thor vs Hellboy fight (can you do that, Marvel?) and making Hemsworth speak Bengali 😊Indian don vs Bangladeshi don really?

Anyways, the plot is basic, and writer Joe Russo doesn't elaborate with it more than necessary. The son of a rich, imprisoned criminal is kidnapped, and an expert mercenary is hired to rescue him. Chris Hemsworth plays the merc and does so with ease, probably easy with the script he was handed. With video game camera angles and exciting action sequences, ""Extraction"" is entertaining, and violent, but it isn't much more than that.

Absolutely the highlight of this film is the fight scenes and action scenes. The technical application is 10/10. The director of this is a stunt co coordinator for many famous films and he shows his skill here. Every shot, punch, death is immersive and feels powerful and real. They have long scenes that are blended and cut so insanely well. This is up there and imo better than ""hitmans bodyguard"" and ""kingsman"" when it comes to action scenes. I promise you many, many many stunt men were hurt in the making of this.Story: 6.5/10

The plot seems to be a bit lame because one of the protagonists wants to stiff the bill by killing the people he hired in the first place. The movie is quite realistic in the fighting scenes and the abject poverty of the two countries.

184,Paynebyname,Feels like children playing bang bang in a playground,4,28 April 2020,"I like Chris Hemsworth and enjoyed the John Wick series and so sat down to watch this with excited anticipation.The story started off interesting enough before descending into a series of never ending stunts and action that although impressive slowly starts to actually numb you to what you are seeing.There is a small attempt at building some character but it came off as pretty shallow before we bounced right back into another chunk of action where characters are taking an inordinate amount of punishment and limping/staggering onto the next scene.Despite all the crashing and banging on screen it actually started to get boring and caused my mind to wander off into thoughts about whether too much action is a bad thing.Ultimately it was an okay impersonation of John Wick but was lacking in heart and soul. I think the Russo brothers are trading on their work for Marvel and have probably let the success of Endgame go to their heads in making them believe that they can only pick 'winners' from here on out.Overall, the film has some good action but I was disappointed with it and it does feel like children running around a playground shouting 'you're dead' and 'you didn't take your shots'.",Extraction
185,paul_3-960-896774,Sponsored by Tupperware,8,24 April 2020,"The story is not as straight forward as I thought it might be, there are a few genuine twists that makes it fresh. There's also some smart levity in it but it is an action movie.The action looks like it hurt, it's violent AF, intense and vicious. They let it breath, literally, making it feels real and very much like you're in it with them. As a result there is not much suspension of disbelief needed. The fight scenes, close quarters fighting chases and gun battle have a danger feel to them and a high cost throughout the film. I have a favorite fight scene though, all I'll say is kids.The directing is very smart with the tracking, using the idea of camera posing to hide the stuntman but using it in tracking shots, making us watch one way at some interesting thing while you know what's happening off camera, then picking back up to where we were it's amazing. Sam Hargrave delivers big time, he's one to watch.The acting is amazing, top notch, it pluses the story and help carry the emotional weight. The cast is region accurate and the actors are great. Hemsworth did not hog the screen time - take note Robbie - and was surrounded by talented actors.By the way I totally spotted a Thor reference, did you ?Extraction, sponsored by Tupperware - don't think I missed the Tupperware bottle Hemsworth gave the kid - is a really good movie. Hargrave, Hemsworth, and Joe Russo delivered.@garcwrites",Extraction
186,schroederagustavo,It's alright,7,3 May 2020,"Extraction features some good action sequences and a charismatic lead in Chris Hemsworth. It's cool and a little different that the plot takes place in India. There is a backstory to Chris' character so that he isn't just ""generic action man"", and it's OK, although it did feel to me like they just put that in for the sake of him having a backstory.The first act is the strongest in my opinion, we get to know some of the characters and we see a good amount of action while the plot progresses. It's simple and to the point: Chris Hemsworth and his team have to extract this kid from the hands of kidnappers that work for a drug lord. I think the movie does get weaker towards the second act though, as it slows down a bit too much for my taste, and the third act is also a bit too long because a) people are getting shot all over the place and there doesn't seem to be much plot development and b) the movie opens with what happens here on the bridge, so there's no intrigue behind what's going to happen.Anyway, Extraction is a good action movie and although I will probably never feel the urge to ever watch it again, I enjoyed it for the most part.",Extraction
187,theredsky,Extraction Review,4,6 September 2020,"These action movies nowadays are trying to copy John Wick. Extraction is a borderline bad movie with just enough decent stuff to keep it from being bad. The one shot action set piece was admittedly kinda cool and Chris Hemsworth did do a good job with what he was given but everything else is so bland. The cinematography is bland, the action set pieces, minus the one take one, was bland and the characters were bland. The script was terrible and the story was so bloated and boring that I was scratching my head wondering why they made this movie 2 hours long. I would have been more lenient if the movie was at max an hour and a half long but 2 hours is pushing it. I would recommend passing on this unless you really want to watch it.",Extraction
188,Hussain-AL-Naseer,One Star Extra For Authenticity & Some Bad Ass Action,7,25 April 2020,"Thank God we live in an era where authenticity is now being valued and that is one the pleasing thing about Extraction. If its about Indian Drug Mafia's Lord you'll see an actual India with an Indian guy as Drug Lord communicating in Hindi, similarly when film goes to Bangladesh, you'll see real Bangladesh with Bangladeshi guy being Drug Lord there talking In Bengali. The film is the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave a Stuntman and Stunt coordinator known for choregraphing stunts in several Marvel Movies including Captain America: Civil War, Endgame, Thor: Ragnarok etc. which explains the fact that film is very mediocre in its storytelling and plot unfolding. In addition to that the film also never connects you emotionally during its emotional parts. Despite of that the film is a visual gem and gives you some visual experience as cinematography and Long action sequences are the strongest part of the movie which somehow despite of the flaws pulls this movie off to engage its audience. Talking about performances, Chris shines in all the action scenes as he should've and his presence is delightful to watch especially in cat and mouse sequences.However on the other hand Randeep Hooda looked little off colored may be due to the longer tiring action scenes for which he is not use to of, despite of the fact that he has fair amount of screen presence and is one of the leads which I definitely not expected. Tripathi as an Indian Drug Lord having just cameo appearance but he nailed it as he always does.

190,joshbarton15,Sam Hargrave delivers a brutal and impressive debut.,8,24 April 2020,"There's sure to be an outcry over the violence or the flimsy narrative that Extraction possesses however, the film is rated 18 for a reason and some of the best action movies ever made don't exactly have the deepest narratives either so neither of those are going to bother me when settling down for an action movie.Chris Hemsworth plays black market mercenary Tyler Rake, who accepts the deadliest mission of his career when tasked with an extraction of the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. There's your narrative, it's a basic set up and it knows it, and they sure as hell waste no time in getting down to the nitty gritty stuff.Sam Hargrave comes from a background of working on stunts for some pretty high profile films and he certainly utilises that here in his directorial debut. Hargrave goes for the serious approach to his film so there isn't much time to stop for any comedy, which suits the film's fast-paced and brutal action sequences down to a tee. One in particular, a long take action sequence that moves from vehicles to an apartment block before falling down to the streets, is up there as one of the most impressive action sequences I've seen in a film, the swift camera movements and stunt choreography really something to behold.Hemsworth leads the film well with a dominating screen presence, whether it be scoring headshot after headshot on an armed unit or slapping a bunch of adolescent soldiers about. The physicality of the performance is demanding and it's impressively handled by everyone involved.The film does drag a little in places and it feels as if 15-20 minutes could be shaved off but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't engrossed by what was happening throughout. Extraction has the added bonus of the lead character with the surname Rake actually killing someone with a rake. Bravo.",Extraction
191,iamkeysersoze-13228,Great action in an okay film,6,24 April 2020,"Extraction is a solid film in terms of action but not in terms of plot. The story is fairly simple and been done before but it doesn't really bother me in this case. The action makes up for it.The action scenes are really terrifically. Whilst they aren't on the level of The Raid movies, The John Wick trilogy or even Atomic Blonde. The film does deliver some pretty good action sequences. They are filmed really well without the over use of shaky can and quick cuts. The choreography is very good. There is a really great 11 minute sequence which is done in ""one take"" and it works marvelously well.I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's around 102 minutes long (excluding the credits) and there is very little downtime. That's because of great actors and a decent script. Chris Hemsworth is great here. He did a lot of his own stunts which is great to hear. Everyone else from David Harbour to Randeep Hooda are also very good.If you're looking for mindless fun, look no further.

OK, the Kid's father is in prison, got that. But there is this Other Guy, the one with all the gold chains, who apparently spares no expense in human lives to stop Rake (Hemsworth) from rescuing The Kid. The motivation almost seems like it's Gold Chains Guy's personal vendetta or revenge against some (?) opposing forces, and The Kid is merely a pawn in this story. But since that dialog is all in Indian, English-speaking audiences may not know any more.Although it's just a movie, it seems irrational for such an extreme expenditure of human life for 1 Kid -- although The Kid's life is valuable too -- I'm not disputing that. For these reasons. I give the film 7-stars.",Extraction

Though I must have watched a ton of movies I prefer to steer clear of nonsense like the Avengers. If they had given the contract to Robert McCall he would have got the work done with minimal bloodbath. Its really not that bad a movie to be honest. The action sequences are done really well though the movie is a tad too long in my opinion. The best part of the movie was when Hemsworth beats up those kids. That was just so funny. Had to rewind and watch it again. Let's hope they make it like a 'Taken' sort of movie and the kid gets taken again. It was really disappointing that one of the finest actors in the country Pankaj Tripathi has a blink and you will miss him role. Randeep Hooda does hold his own in my opinion. Bangladesh is represented in very poor light in the movie and if the same movie was set in India we would have ' BoycottExtraction' trending on twitter with about 100K tweets.

Furthermore, Chris Hemsworth may be a no-brainer choice to play an action hero, but in here we can see he is a human who gets busted and injured. There is not much of a plot: hero extracts boy but things get messed up so he has to do the utmost to achieve his mission. That is the premise. But this mission also provides a character arc for Hemsworth's character, and in the middle of the story, he makes a choice. The real highlight of the movie is the action, of course. This movie pulls no punches with the action, there is a slight humor to it involving child soldiers too. I am surprised with the acting from the supporting cast. Randeep Hooda plays one of Hemsworths' nemesis in the beginning, and he is totally badass. I also rooted for his character. The style of shooting involves long shots, and immerses you in the story. The choreography is almost like John Wick, but in a more gritty setting. Thus, there are a lot of good things to enjoy from the movie. The weak point is the drama, and sometimes even the action drags down. The first part was great, but the action in the end was less exciting.

There was nothing new offered by Russo brothers who directed magnum opus Avengers: End Game. They have placed one suspense which was quite obvious and it exposed quite early.

Nor is Extraction a spin-off from the highly-successful John Wick franchise, although if it is was, you wouldn't have thought twice. If anything, thinking twice is not why one would watch the Netflix original movie.Resplendent with turn-yer-brain-off action and in-yer-face fisticuffs, Extraction is the perfect prescription for fun escapism this quarantined world needs.Based on the graphic novel Ciudad by comicbook veteran Ande Parks (Capote in Kansas, Green Arrow) and Joe Russo (a screenwriter/director... somewhat of a newcomer in the field. Has a few little-seen, indie flicks on his resume...), Extraction is the straight-forward tale of a hardened-yet-weary merc hired to rescue a kidnapped boy. That boy, refreshingly played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal, whose wide, innocent eyes are more-than-reminiscent of Finn Wolfhard's Stranger Things teen exuberance, is the son of a ruthless Mumbai mobster. An equally-ruthless mobster, this one from Dhaka, Bangladesh, has the son kidnapped in order to finalize their gang war. Enter Chris Hemsworth and team whose muscles, grunts, and squinting eyes would make any paramilitary army quake in fear from their oncoming storm. In a fun little twist, once Hemsworth's team gains the child, they are brutally betrayed by the son's guardian, Saju, a former black ops solider, portrayed by action-star-in-the-making Randeep Hooda.Directed by Sam Hargrave, who worked as a stunt coordinator and second unit director on a number of Marvel movies, he follows in the footsteps of Chad Stahelski (John Wick) and David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). Showing more than hyper-stylized fight scenes, of which there are plenty, Hargrave beautifully choreographs an 11-minute, single-shot scene that even Sam Mendes (1917, Spectre) would find impressive.Hemsworth brings brunt physicality to the role as well as the requisite levels conflict. The twinkling Thunder God's eye has been replaced with a study of seriousness, which was a welcome turn following the depressing aloofness shown in his Endgame character. Most of all, Hemsworth is convincingly believable in a rather unbelievable role in a most ridiculous movie.Extraction has all the tropes of an 80s action movie. Of course, if Ovi was a blond woman there would have been the obligatory romance scene. Instead, there is the all-too short bromance between Hemsworth and David Harbour, whose affable charisma deserved longer screen time.

211,shide_85,FTFY: The Raid (2011) meets Hardcore (2015).,8,1 May 2020,"Many writers have tried to recognise the ground for this movie, those two above in the title are where you can find the base for it.
It would not surprise me if they said the goal was to bring those two together (inventive camerawork with bar setting action), ad on that the long shots which has become more popular due to flimsy material (cut up scenes) many have used during the last 2-3 decades and you're there (exceptons in recent years include Russian Ark 2002 and Woody Harrelson's Lost in London 2017 that was groundbreaking in of itself).Regarding the movie they try to ad a little depth to a partially cliché subject by making the boy close to an oposite to his crimelord father and play out the bond that brings up in Hemsworth's character (who is  merchenary basically).
They do not exactly hit the notes here and that means the plotline that was strengthened by these elements don't end up being so more than a little tad.
Having characters without morale, which is is line with reality afaik for blackops personell (may it be formerly known blackwater oeprators, CIA hitmen or other guns for hire that kill both criminals and innocent alike), is also a good notion.Overall what is the focal point is the thriller momentum mixed with the action, action which is close to that in The Raid 1/2 and very few movies since (less than a handful asian movies). If you like action movies - this is a MUST see, if you like hemsworth he makes a solid but not aced performance when it comes to emotional depth but nails many of the actionsequences. Those where he misses and the martial arts koordination doesn't end up working are not in focus as the camerawork is good and the stuntmen are also mostly good which means it never really comes into focus either but lands in the periphery.The end become a little anticlimactic as it's more towards the cliché direction (one being tying up loose ends).Regarding any other notes the cinematography that has been mentioned stands out for another reason, several notes has been lent from the Bourne series, at one point you're just waiting for the theme track to roll. Which detracts a little but also possibly open for a sequel (?). Which it should get, but I wouldn't put that one in connection with this movie but rather as a fully new plotline for the same characters.",Extraction

I wasn't and hence not disappointed. Most action films are based on the extraction of kidnapped family member or a precious item or heists of different types. Lovers of action films are going to love this film. The 10 year old son of an Indian drug lord ( Pankaj Tripathi) is kidnapped by a drug lord of Bangladesh, and taken there. Pankaj tells the boy's caretaker Randeep Huda to get the boy back or else.... On the other hand, a mercenary Chris Hemsworth is launched for a rescue mission keeping in mind the ransom money. The mission is launched and like all projects things don't go as per plan.
The film is full of car chases, car crashes, shootings, explosions, fistfights, sniping with dozens of policemen/ goons getting injured or falling dead. Our heroes/ villains have barely the time to reload. All credit to the director and his cinematographer for creating continuous, pulsating, edge of the seat action majorly with a hand held contantly fluid camera. The viewer has no option, and he/she is sucked into the action through the vibrant cinematography supplemented with rocking music. A word for the crisp editing which makes the film racy.There are some splendid aerial shots to heighten the impact. Never a dull moment.

He has been second unit on several major productions, and is big in the stunt world, where he has been a stunt double for Chris Evans's Captain America, and has subsequently become a stunt choreographer for Marvel and the MCU. The Russo brothers have written the story, and Joe Russo has lived screenplay. The film is based on the cartoon ""Ciudad"", written by Andy Parks.The film is known for its 11 minute long one-take, witch is made up of 36 different stitched sequences. Some of those sequences took 25 takes in order to line up correctly.It's an action-packed movie, but it's a bit of a shame that the first action scene is almost the best. This action scene is made with rubber weapons, as it was illegal to transport weapons that could shoot with light gunpowder into the country where the film was filmed. You can't see that in the finished film, so cardou for that.There is not much character development in the film. It's 100% show, with no significant history.The ending sequence on the bridge also causes the film problems, in terms of the sniper's ability to shoot and lack of the same.Chris Hemsworth is no doubt cut for action movies, but he is also good at comedy.

237,TheCasualReviewer,Let me go ahead and extract this from my brain...,5,14 May 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a black market mercenary who takes the mission to extract Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) from a powerful crime lord and return him to his father.REVIEW:
Not a huge fan of this one. I didn't rate this one too low, because there's potential at certain moments of the film. For example, there is a very cool continuous shot sequence near the beginning of the film when Tyler is in the process of extracting Ovi. The driving was a little distracting since you could get clearly tell he wasn't driving (I know that's obvious, but it shouldn't look obvious). A couple issues I had with the film is the sporadic writing and with the end of this film. There's also a female character, Nik, (Golshifteh Farahani) who seems to be close with Tyler, but there's no explanation of their past. They did announce working on a sequel, so maybe they'll explain there, but I digress. Wasn't my biggest qualm with the film. For me, that came with the end of the film. I understand dragging emotional sequences out, but when someone should be dead, they should die. Not everyone is Superman out here. There's only one to my knowledge. Maybe there are more supermen. Maybe this was a Superman prequel idk. Either way, the film wasn't horrible, but I'm not itching for that sequel. 5.9/10.",Extraction

Another truth is the whole Avengers series has literally murdered the careers of a number of stars. Scarlett Johansson may be an exception. The role of Chris Evans in Knives Out could be played by anyone, as the story and screenplay both were so tight and there were plenty of powerful actors to sail the boat. Extraction is another sad tale of how you play with the expectation of the common people after a gargantuan success like the Avengers. Chris Hemsworth has been portrayed as a mercenary who has literally killed more than a thousand soldiers in this movie. Was it that necessary to forget every logic while making an action film? If you have ample time in your hand and your Netflix subscription has been lying unused for a month, you may watch this. But never watch this piece of ... with any expectation.

With very little movies being released this summer due to the pandemic; this is a good mindless, fun, shut-your-brain-down kind of flick. The action is believable compared to some over the top Hollywood movies, probably has a lot to do with the overall budget.I'd say my biggest gripe is that the scenes that were finally calm, you could barely hear the conversation between Hemsworth and the kid. I almost wished the subtitles remained the whole time even though I hate seeing words across the bottom (yes, I know it's Netflix and I could have just turned the subs on permanently).One thing is for sure is that we need more Hemsworth led action movies without Marvel being in the title.",Extraction

244,MovieWarfare,"Chris Hemsworth kicks add in a really dumb,forgettable action movie",5,26 April 2020,"What interested me in watching this film was seeing Chris Hemsworth in a movie outside of Marvel and the fact that this film was produced by the Russo brothers who did amazing Marvel movies. However, this movie was a Netflix exclusive movie which is rarely a hit. The basic premise of the movie is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) has got to extract the child of a drug lord in India who was kidnapped by the drug lord of Bangladesh for money. Simple.Starting with the positive and probably the biggest reason why anyone wants to watch this movie, the action. This movie goes for a John Wick style of action with its incredible choreography and fast pace action. The action scenes are extremely violent and brutal which is borderline gratuitous but so entertaining. There is one particular action scene which is filmed to make it seem like an 11 minute one camera shot scene and it is really good even if the cuts are obvious. Praise should also be given to Chris Hemsworth's performance who gives a lot of likability and charisma for his character. Additionally, it is clear that Chris did a lot of the stunt for this movie and the director utilized this properly and effectively. The soundtrack and cinematography are also pretty good especially considering the scenery and high octane action.This is where the praise ends. How was this a screenplay/story from the Russo brothers? It's very barebone and has a lot of forgettable dialogue. There is a plan from one of the drug lord that just feels really dumb and done so we can have a cool fight. Additionally, there are non-action moments in the movie where it just feels like time panning and slowing down the momentum. These moments would be fine if it felt like it was adding something but these moments are a bore with mediocre dialogue and boring characters that it is uninteresting. The movie is also very predictable and this is due to the fact that this movie adopts way too many cliches from older action movies but just giving a fresh coat of paint. These moments made me just wish they would just get to the next action set piece already. On that note of characters, they give some backstory for Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the ex-military man who was hunting him to make him sympathetic but that's it. It would be nice to have been shown and not just told stuff about him because it just feels like a throwable line just to quickly give Tyler some characterization. What about his relationship with the mercenary girl or even David Harbour. Speaking of David Harbour even though he is a great actor, his character is incredibly forgettable. Every supporting character is forgettable to the point that I don't really know anything about them. The kid that Tyler saves likes playing the piano and is a son of a drug lord but apart from that, we know nothing about him. I would love to know more about his character by exploring his relationship a bit more with his father and ex-military dude or even how life is like as a son of a murderous drug lord. Furthermore, the relationship between Tyler and the kid just feels incredibly rushed and unearned. They just suddenly have huge trust in each other without any conflict which just feels unnatural. A lot of critics have bashed its aimless violence but it doesn't really bother me but I do feel that it doesn't feel necessary a lot of the times. However, the last act of this movie gets really tedious by giving hoards of mindless goons for Tyler to kill that just kind of makes you feel numb and bored of it.If all you want from a movie is Chris Hemsworth kicking ass then this movie is really good. The director was definitely a stunt man as this movie has great stunts which shows the experience of a veteran stunts person. However, these action scenes don't really do something drastically new so don't expect anything revolutionary either. The action is all this movie got going for it. If you expect a good story or good characters similar to John Wick then this movie does not have that going for it sadly.",Extraction
245,toddg-473-289818,Expect an action movie and no more,6,25 November 2020,"Yes, this is an almost nonstop action movie about an broke ex soldier hired to rescue the kidnapped son of a jailed drug lord in Bangladesh. The seemingly straightforward rescue goes south when those who hired our protagonist (Chris Hemsworth) refuse to pay the fee they have agreed on, instead trying to bypass Hemsworth and rescue the kid themselves. Add to the mix the rival crime lord in Dhaka, whose people originally kidnapped the boy but have lost him to Hemsworth and now will use all of their resources, including most of the bought and paid for police and military personnel on the payroll, to recover or kill the boy.This movie has great action sequences and cinematography going for it, but it needed a better sound editor, as many of the regional Indian dialects sound like mumbling to the western ear. Also many of the vehicles and scenes looked more like India than Bangladesh. Even Thailand was listed on the ending credits as one filming location, but it is difficult to pick out any scenes that looked like Thailand.",Extraction

Instead it focuses on what it also does best: The juicy action! Hemsworth is hands-on, he sure took quite some beating while making. His character is written well enough to feel believeable and his acting is on par. Same goes for Randeep Hooda, who is quite explosive as the antagonist.Most of the creativity and talent by the crew was spent in the first half and it shows. The camera work and the direction is simply amazing, the car chase scene left me puzzeling what was going on (in a good way).

281,wlee08,Impressive camera work and stunts but flawed story,7,26 April 2020,"This movie might have one of the best 'long takes' (single take or appearing to be a single take) film sequences ever, and it boggles the mind how they were able to film all this action in one take, spanning quite a distance and involving a ton of stunts and pyrotechnics. The technical wizardry aside, most of the intent seemed to be showcasing stunts instead of telling a convincing story. Much of this story has been seen before in other films, and there wasn't much humour in the script. Its actually a bit on the dark side as it ups the violence to unecessary levels - think The Raid Redemption.
Uses the 'white saviour' trope, and other cliches, as the battle-hardened, hard-drinking ex-marine-now-merc has vague flashbacks of a lost child or wife that sustains him and gives him his sense of aimlessness in the world, allowing him to mow down hundreds of cops in India, whether they're on the take or not. That's about all the character development we get - so overall, they could have injected a bit more life into the script.
Not a bad effort overall",Extraction
282,Diablo1616,A Little Bit Disappointing But Still Good Movie,7,24 April 2020,"I had been waiting for this day since long. With cinemas locked down due to the global pandemic, I had stopped waiting to watch any new movies. What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat",Extraction

288,Eric266,"Decent Actioner, But Not Very Original",7,29 August 2020,"First off, this is a good movie to kill two hours. Who doesn't love Chris Hemsworth? He's one of those guys men want to be and women want to be with. He has great screen presence and he just seems like a likeable guy,The movie has a ton of action and the fight scenes are at a John Wick-ish level for production, choreography and execution. The opening sequence where Hemsworth's character rescues the young boy and kills like a dozen men is filmed at close quarters, is very fast paced and is hilariously violent. The camera jumps around the scene so you get different angles.Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake, a depressed, burnt out former special forces soldier turned mercenary. He is hired to ""extract"" the 14-year old son (a very good Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of a imprisoned drug dealer from a rival drug dealer's clutches. The movie is set in India and the scenery is bleak, dirty and does not do India's reputation any favors. Once he rescues the boy, his team is ambushed and Tyler is left alone with the boy trying to navigate his way through the city to an extraction point. The father's right hand man, Saju, (an also very good Randeep Hooda) is likewise a former special forces soldier and he is tracking Tyler and the boy as well, holding his own personal motivations.David Harbor as an old friend with a safe house and Golshifteh Farahani as Tyler's handler Nik Khan are good in small roles. And that is the problem. The movie had some real potential to develop characters we care about, but it sacrifices 3D characters for action and violence. Tyler and Saju are two sides of the same coin, but that isn't explored very well other than a few quick scenes of their families. Nik is a bad ass supporting character, but her role is just yelling Tyler's name into a radio most of the time, until the end climax and epilogue. There is no sense of history between them...or between any of the characters. This movie had some pretty decent talent involved and it just felt wasted to make room for more action. When characters died, I didn't care because I had no emotional investment in these people.As I said the action scenes are superb. The scene of Tyler and Ovi racing through a rundown apartment complex chased by a slew of soldiers, police and gangsters is filmed in several very long takes and the camera is so close to the action you almost feel the punches. The fight that culminates this scene between Tyler and Saju is as good as anything in John Wick. Its a highlight of the film.A good movie that could have been great had it spent some more time on its characters. Still, I enjoyed it and look forward to Hemsworth's next project.",Extraction
289,franklindf,Decent action with some flaws,6,24 April 2020,"It's basically an action movie so the whole plot supports the action, it's a mercenary who gets tangled up in Bangladesh. It's cool that it does the location aspect well. My issues are when you have a seasoned mercenary I feel like he commits a lot of mistakes and gets into some situations that could have been avoided. There were a lot of tactical errors. First he goes in Rambo style, which is cool but if you're planning a mission up against 20 hostile, you need a squad. There is an ambiguous support character who seems battle hardened but his methods don't really add up. When you are senior military, you make sure you can win and you have the upper hand. But we see a lot of panic and escape here, not a cool controlled authority. It's a good movie but I think they should have ran it by a military consultant to make it more authentic.",Extraction

The primary villain needed some more motivating factors, but the film will make you hate him enough to root for anyone who stands against him.

Hemsworth's character (Tyler Rake) was a little different than I'm used to as in he feels more human and so does the villain which makes for some great back and forth between the two. The movie was not overly complicated like a Bourne film nor was it nearly as good but some of the chemistry between characters and the cat and mouse aspects and a couple of twists really engage the audience.

But I must say the main characters are punshing bags who can also take bullets.I feel no connection with the main character, on the bridge I was thinking: and now they will shoot him... And yes there he goes! I did not care at all. The only thing we know is that he had a wife and his child died. And he drinks a lot of course. But I must say the acting is good, also from the other actors, but the main villain looks like a joke. Also the things he does is getting boring. Ok so he kills children, has weird demands and he is ordering around people. Why he wants to have the kid... Only humiliation right?And the action is getting boring quickly. It looks fantastic but after a while you are getting used to the falling of the bodies, the explosions, the 'they block everything but still we get out'.So it feels like a hommage of the 80/90s action movies. The kid at the end will get his revenge like he wanted... So I must give it a 5. I have seen way better, but also worse.

310,bodhi-13262,REDEMPTION BEGINS!,8,25 April 2020,"Being the directorial debut of stuntman/choreographer Sam Hargrave, 'Extraction' delivers on all its premises. For a film I was in moderate anticipation of, I must admit, I was heavily entertained.1. Written by Joe Russo, the plot involves mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who is tasked with recusing Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord from a rival kingpin in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Whenever I watch action/thriller genres of film, I prefer simple plots and this does just that. The story never feels heavy-handed nor do the minor subplots ever disrupt the flow of the film itself. Each of the lead characters are given just enough backstory to where you feel for them by the time the suspenseful climax comes around.2. The film is ultimately Chris Hemworth's to carry and he doesn't disappoint. You completely buy him as an action star and this film is undoubtedly the most physically intense and realistic action I have seen him do. Unlike Sylvester Stallone or Dwayne Johnson who are rather generic action stars, Hemsworth proves himself as also being a very formidable dramatic actor as well just by the sheer emotion he puts into his deeper characters including this one. All credit to Sam Hargrave as I was completely floored by his direction of each fight scene and the manner in which they were staged.3. Unfortunately, as much as I want to praise this film, there are problems that need to be addressed. For some reason, the krytoninte of many action films are the generic villains and this one is no different. Priyanshu Painyuli plays the rival kingpin Amir who is responsible for the kidnapping, but he never has a formidable presence or seems like a legit threat in the overall story to where the film feels like there is no real antagonist. The same goes for Golshifteh Farahani (Nik) as her character is never fully developed either. The real dynamic is ultimately between Hemsworth and Jaiswal.4. Unlike the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, the action never becomes unbelievably unrealistic or buffoonish to where it lost me. In fact, despite there not being anything new action-wise, the realism and the way the cinematographer captures it all is what has you most compelled. Its been a long time since I've felt such intensity and fear for certain characters during a climax especially within an action film. I should warn that there is a certain level of gore that may make some viewers squeamish as this type of action doesn't shy away from the graphic nature in which people are killed.Had this film been released in theaters, I would have gladly paid to seen it on the big screen. I understand these types of releases are usually decisive among critics, but if you love R-Rated action, this is by far one of the more better ones in recent years. Much congratulations to Sam Hargrave because I honestly can't wait for his next directorial feature.",Extraction
311,denigmatic,Father and son movie?,5,24 April 2020,"When i prepare to watch this movie i do not have a big expectation because i thought this will be just another action movie, personally i'm not easily impressed by action movie because so many action movie not having a good plot and for many reason they so predictable. Don't get me wrong i grew up with action movie, my father is a hardcore action movie, Stallone, Van damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie chan is my childhood memories, because of that i put my standard to watch Extraction very low. The only reason i watch this movie just because Chris Hemsworth is my favourite Avenger.Suprisingly this movie have a good cinematography, the director of photography have a good job shoot the scene for hollywood quality thumbs up. The second good things in this film is the choreography of hand to hand combat, it's very good they do it perfectly, i love every hand to hand combat in this movie.Yup that's the good thingThe very first thing i catch bad in this movie is the CGI, okay it's not so bad but it's caught the attention of me, maybe because this movie have a very good cinematography that makes the little bad CGI caught the eye. Second bad thing is the plot is too simple, so many forgotten character and so many oversimplifying story plot. I won't SPOIL the story, i just make a simple note of example like:1.Why the kid care so much to the main character? (it's like just a one day movie set and why he trust the main character more than his father right hand?)2.What's the important subplot of gangster kid Dhaka?3.David Harbour character background is contradicting with his act motives4.The ending is just duh5.Is this father and son movie? (you'll see many father and son scene in many character plot)Yeah i would say they have a lazy writing here, but in the end credit i see that this movie is based on Graphic Novel called Ciudad. so i dont know if this movie stay loyal to the Graphic Novel source or not, if it's not then probably it's lazy writing.The conclusion is Extraction it's a movie that have a good cinematography and one of a kind hand to hand fight scene, but this movie is not a martial art movie like The Raid so probably you'll find more shooting than fist, you'll also find noticeable CGI, cheesy ending, unanswered background story, and many why plot.What concern my mind is why the choose grown up actor for Ovi The Extraction kid character? They have a gangster kid group in the Dhaka who is more younger than Ovi the Extraction Kid !maybe if they change the kid character to more younger actor maybe it'll make me more sympathy to the film, yes like Logan movie.",Extraction

Actions scenes are good, well, not good, fantastic, and comparison with John Wick is in place but somehow extraction offers another angle, technically and with sorroundings.

318,thomasmitilis1995,"YOU DROWN NOT BY FALLING INTO THE RIVER, BUT BY STAYING SUBMERGED IN IT...",6,1 May 2020,"Extraction is an entertaining action thriller with high stakes and gory violence. Chris Hemsworth proves that he has acting skills and delivers a range of emotions even though the flashback about his lost child is brief and a little cliche. The action sequences are phenomenal and the long takes reinforce the tension and the adrenaline. The camera movements in the car chase scene are incredible and the shootout segments are well choreographed. Randeep Hooda is a revelation and the fighting sequences between him and Hemsworth are stunning, especially their hand-to-hand combat. Sam Hargrave manages to include in one single take a shootout inside a building, a car crash and a fighting with knives and hands. There is even a scene where the protagonist beats the hell out of some kids!!! Rudhraksh Jaiswal is an amazing talent and he is involved in the more emotional scenes of the film. Golshifteh Farahani plays a badass character as the friend of the protagonist and the scene where she fires an RPG is fantastic. However, there is no much to be said about the plot. The villain is way over the top for this specific movie and David Harbour's character exists only to add some minutes to the runtime. The subplot with the teen who wants to prove himself to the druglord is unnecessary and out of place. The ending scene is kind of unrealistic and the motives behind the abduction are never really explained.",Extraction

321,ShaeSpencer,Hemsworth can ACT,7,4 May 2020,"Extraction's excellently staged, inventive action is ultimately overtaken by a rousing story, in spite of the hundreds of close-quarters gunblasts and the absurd body count. Powerful performances and tight scripting take tired clichés and make them feel like tried-and-true storytelling techniques. (Most of the time.) This could have been just a fun, disposable genre pasttime, but it's significantly better than that.Chris Hemsworth reveals himself to be a gifted craftsman through an understated, gripping performance. It's refreshingly un-self-conscious, and delivered humbly, without flash or fanfare. It's the mark of a smart director that he was given the space to do that. In those quiet moments, with his fierce, but anguished, weary eyes, he really made me believe his spiritual desolation. On reflection, it reminds me of Denzel Washington, who also elevates more than one action movie with hard-wrung pathos. I hope Hemsworth is allowed to continue on this track and do meatier work than he's been saddled with up to now.His isn't the only impressive performance. David Harbour is delightful in a thankless, but crucial bit part. What a presence that guy has. Rudhraksh Jaiswal shows up big time in that last act. Most kid actors aren't nearly that good. If there's any justice, he has a good career ahead of him, as does the startlingly adept first-time feature director Sam Hargrave. He doesn't quite sidestep all of the pitfalls of a movie like this (lots of side characters we don't have time to care about, some on-the-nose flashback material, etc.), but the way he choreographs motion, viscera, and heart is impressive.",Extraction

A great looking set and environment showcase a proper action vehicle with Hemsworth at the front playing a mercenary who takes a mission that ends up being completely fubar. His job is rescuing the son of a drug lord who has been kidnapped by a rival drug lord.Along the way Hemsworth's character starts to see the boy Ovi as more than just a job. Everything that could possibly go wrong, does. Tyler (Hemsworth) decides that his mission isn't about the money any more and risks it all to save the boy. I really enjoyed Hemsworth and the actor who played Ovi. They had good chemistry together. The only gripe I had was the ridiculous part where the same thug kid who wanted to kill Tyler to impress his drug lord boss, is the one who actually is responsible for shooting Tyler at the very end. It was beyond preposterous.The soundtrack was very good and kept the pace up with all the action going on and with the more emotional scenes. The end it seems was left a bit ambiguous by the director. There are rumors of a series of films featuring the same character Hemsworth played and I would be pleased if this happens.",Extraction

I think if the director would have approached an actor from Bangla Film Industry like Jishu Sengupta it would have been a splendid thing to watch.

I don't understand the hate the films getting, because there are so many other films that are way worse than this and this is not even a bad movie, it's very good. But, I wish they would have dug more deep into Tyler's life when he was a father, I think it would have given the audience a better outlook on who he is as a person. has there been many movies similar to this one, yes. But it doesn't stop it from being a good film.

336,DJKwa,"A straight-shooting, no-nonsense ride that goes for the jugular when it comes to action, just don't expect to find much meat on its bones.",6,25 April 2020,"A mercenary, Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), with a troubled past accepts a contract to extract a mob bosses' son from the clutches of a rival mobster. With the odds stacked against him, Tyler finds his physical and mental resolve put to the test as the stakes become increasingly personal.A throwback to 80's style one-man-killing-machine action flicks that gave Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger their respective careers, Extraction's title also doubles as a pretty accurate synopsis of the film.Fronted by Hemsworth in another solid action leading man role, Extraction is a straight-shooting, no-nonsense ride that goes for the jugular when it comes to action. As Tyler travels through Dhaka, Bangladesh with the kidnapped kid in tow, he finds himself chased by crime lords, corrupt police officers and even child soldiers. The action is relentless and the film transitions from car chases to rooftop scuffles and street standoffs all within minutes of each other, making Extraction feel like it could have worked well as a single-take film had the filmmakers decided to take it up a notch.Naturally, comparisons to John Wick are inevitable, not least for being another feature debut for a stunt coordinator turned director. However, Extraction's endless onslaught of bloodshed ends up having the opposite effect of John Wick. Long before the film's protracted finale, the relentless shooting and killing becomes numbing rather than exhilarating, largely due to the exploitative nature of the story.Unlike the hyper-realism of John Wick, Extraction grounds itself in the gritty geo-political climate of a third world country (Thailand doubling for Bangladesh) and the grimy subtext of police corruption and organised crime is exploited for mind-numbing action carnage. It works on a basic thrill-level but leaves the film mired in questionable politics and a general air of callousness.That's why the Michael Bay school of switch off your brain to enjoy applies whole heartedly here.

If you want a movie with similar plot lines and scenery based on a real person, actual complex characters with layered acting, decent action and lots of intensity and good twists in the plot, I recommend another Netflix original ""Close"" with Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and great supporting by Sophie Nélisse (The Book Thief). It's criminally underrated for one being a female action drama/thriller which people will always be nitpicking about opposite movies like this one starting out at a solid 7.4. What? That's higher rating than Die Hard 2 and almost the same as Skyfall. Not to get started on ""6 Underground"" coming in with 6.1 solid stars with its big names not even making up for the lack of so many quality-based things, putting an emphasis on ""empty action and looks"".

We already know that Hargrave is very competent when it comes to action, escpecially close combat and hand-to-hand fights, and it shows. Chris Hemsworth is physically brilliant, thanks to his director, and gives us a glimpse at how John Wick might have moved 15 years ago. The camerawork is quite impressive, the look of the film is a bit generic, but still beautiful to behold.Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The characters are shallow, the story almost non-existant and the acting... well, how good can it be? Hemsworth and his fellow co-actors actually try to make the most of the weak material given to them, but that material is very low-mileage indeed. Astonishingly generic backstory for a potentially great protagonist, no background for the antagonist, no interesting side characters. Given that, any emotional impact is sorely missed, even if the film repeatedly tries to make you feel something with cheesy flashbacks, meaningless sad music and other cheap tricks.This is a film with a starved skeleton of a plot, uninteresting characters and no reveals or plot twists at all. No surprises, no emotions, no impact. And even with the action being absolutely top-notch, it doesn't spark any real interest, at least not from my side. I even found myself a bit bored after the umpteenth time of Hemsworth doing cool moves, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that even the action falls short of fulfilling its objective: to thrill and make you root for the hero. Still, my verdict would have been a 3/10 if it wasn't for the excellent action.And so a question pops up: should every stunt coordinator and second unit director get to become a director? If he can also tell a story and has a vision, sure! Unfortunately, Sam Hargrave doesn't seem to fit that description and might be better off sticking to his guns.",Extraction

369,ksharath1999,Action!Action!Action!Nothing More Nothing Less,6,12 November 2021,"Extraction is one of the better action movies of 2020. Extraction is a realistic style thrilling ride set in India, the core of the movie is its back to back violent action sequences followed by strong performances from Chris Heimsworth and Randeep Hooda. The movie also succeeds in portraying the suffering and helplessness of people in a drug lord controlled country.The movie is really entertaining at times and at times it feels like the action feds you up. This is one of the unique movies were action is its pro and too much action is its con. The setting and tone chosen for the film delivers a Bengali touch to the movie which might degrade the hollywood feel of the movie.In the end, the only thing to praise in the movie is its well executed action sequences making the flick a strictly average one.Rating:61%",Extraction

371,skunksurffer,Noice,9,24 April 2020,Nice close combat fights and nice gunshots.. the plot is not something special it's normal and ok plot but the actors they are good specially the kid. Ovi was really emotional and really good at his role....for new movie in Netflix is really good. Also the death of both of the saviors (Tyler and senju) was really good ending but a little bit clichè. I mean come on the kid that wanted to kill him cause made him look like fool appears in the right moment when he was weak and almost dead to shoot him in the neck? It was very predictable in my opinion,Extraction
372,premmgor,Well! You won't regret!,8,26 April 2020,"Extraction follows the story of Tyler Rake whose life is about to change as he enlisted to rescue a boy from one of the most impenetrable cities. The Best Part of the film is its Action Choreography; Most of the Sequences are one-shot having Incredible camera movements, The Combat battles are close and clear even in such a tight space. As it shot in my city, Ahmedabad and not in Dhaka so maybe it fails to be as impactful as it should be. Every actor is impressive in their respective roles and the film surely something that worth your Time and Money. Highly Recommended! ❤",Extraction
373,ciobanualin-94020,A very good action movie!,9,1 May 2020,"""Extraction"" is probably one of the best action movies that I've watched until now. There is a huge ammount of realism added in the fight scenes, in the special effects and in the movie atmosphere as well. A special element which makes me think of this movie as a good one is the fact that when the people have been firing on each other, the bullets were almost to hit the target. There are no blind shooters in this movie, who are shooting 100 bullets at around 50 yards of the target. Even if the bullets don't hit the protagonists, they are very close to do so. What impressed so much has been the scene where Tyler is fighting with Sajur in the street and also the curiosity of the surrounding citizens. This demonstrates me that I didn't waste my time with this movie.",Extraction

375,e-1529,Solid action flick,7,30 April 2020,"I enjoyed watching Extraction, it's a pretty decent action movie. The plot is ok, the acting is alright. Some actions scenes are outstanding, like never before seen camera work going on. However sometimes I could 'feel the presence' of the cameraman which you're not really supposed to in a movie. Another thing I didn't particular like is the amount of killings, just one after the other after the other, it's like the bad guys were spawning out of nowhere. It kind of got repetitive after a while, I blame it on the legacy of John Wick... Buy all in all, it was worth watching, just don't get your expectations too high.",Extraction
376,infoalwaysacritic,"Quality cast, production and non-stop action",7,17 May 2020,"When John Wick snuck under the radar before blowing up on streaming services, it changed cinema in the way that Hardcore Harry showed the possibilities of POV. Keanu Reeves' character bobbed and wove through seamless action scenes littered with bodies and close quarter pistol techniques that were both brutal and poetic. Extraction brings the efficiency and intensity of battling for survival to the underworld of India in the hands of Chris Hemsworth's haunted mercenary- Tyler Rake.The character introductions are well handled, with Tyler's depression clearly signalling a painful past. Flashbacks are used to hint at the nature of this past, without fully becoming clear until the final act. Tyler is recruited to a mission that he says no other mercenary would touch, and this again signifies Tyler's broken state accepting a mission that is bound to go wrong. There is more characterization done on Tyler's counterpart, the man hired to protect the victim from the start, with a clearly defined motivation and predicament around the boy - Ovi, who is excellently played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal.
What follows is an intense series of action scenes with few breaks for exposition before wrapping up in the final act.Where the story succeeds most is in the dynamic visuals and the scant dialogue is effective in furthering the plot while racking up a massive body count. Scenes move smoothly from running through the jungle, to a furious car chase, before the camera travels out a window into a building chase sprawling multiple rooms and floors before crashing from a balcony into the streets again. This gives little time for characters to emote beyond grunts of exertion and desperation. This leads to some of the films shortfalls, moral ambiguity and lack of vested interest.
Far too little time is spent getting to know characters that their loss is hardly felt, while others undergo significant screen time that ends in tragic survival. This undermines the primary antagonist when subordinates demonstrate agency over their actions without consequences and often in ways that don't affect the narrative arc. A show down takes place, for example, between a background character that has had only a few short lines, while significant time is spent flushing out the unexplained thirst for violence in a young person who ultimately fails to contribute much to the plot at all. This leads to a moral ambiguity that is emphasized by a conversation between Tyler and an old friend - There are no good guys.Tyler demonstrates many admirable traits in the film, willing to stick with things to the bitter end, driven by something deep within him. He fights for what he thinks is right and does it well. He is however working for a drug lord to rescue his son from another drug lord. No matter where you point, there is no moral high ground, and there is legitimate concerns raised over the permanence of their actions, causing many questions to be left with simplistic or incomplete answers.The end result is a genuinely impressive action film, which benefits from a simple viewing. There are some deeper themes hinted at, not very well flushed out, but for sheer adrenaline and stylistic violence, it is a well done film. Chris Hemsworth and the other leads deliver on pretty well all fronts, and the production is very well done.",Extraction

But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it.

428,robin_sayer,Good fight scenes but ridiculous attempt to put a moral twist on it,5,25 April 2020,"The movie was great until about half way through.
The idea that a mercenary paid to rescue a drug lords son, gets shafted but ends up rescuing the seemingly nice kid any way after flashbacks to his owns sons premature death is trite but OK, we can love with that.
The idea that the drug lords second in command is also making the ultimate sacrifice helping the rescue because otherwise his own family will be killed is also trite but OK.Whats not OK - is that while this moral premise is being played out, of a rescue of an innocent, there seems to be several hundred innocent police offices ruthlessly slaughtered along the way, with a sort of deliberate unemotional distancing.
All the police, almost universally have their faces covered - almost as though the director is trying to turn them into simple targets that you're not supposed to think about.
So while we watch literally hundreds of police - who are presumably just following instructions to track down a mercenary, have their throats cut open, blown up, crushed by cars and riddled with bullets - the movie at the same time is trying to create a situation, where you feel this is OK because the mercenary isnt doing this any longer for money, but is doing it to protect the drug lords son from a bad man.
We know this is a bad man, because we see his henchmen throwing children off a roof - but were you to tally up the death toll in this movie, it would seem the baddies kill about 4 innocent people, and the goodies several hundred.
The movie even sinks lower into its moralising by finishing off with an assassination of the baddie leader at the end as though that keep the boy safe and then stupidly does a shadowy figure behind him as though 'but is he really safe'.For a brief second, the movie looked like it was going to flirt with realism, and then it descended into a pure body count and that thing that happens in a movie where despite being injured hundreds of times, the hero gets up and still kicks ass.But oh well, first 30.minutes were watchable.",Extraction

What I didn't like was there is hardly any connect between the kid and Helmsworth yet the kid chose him over his father's known aid played wonderfully by the very dependable Randeep Hooda. Had the story been a little more layered with certain emotional connect then it w o uld have been a terrific film. Entertaining it is. No doubt but it could have been more. And the way they have shpwn Dhaka police being completely controlled by the Drug Lord is way over the top and the gear they have shown the police is unimaginable in Bangladesh.Any way watch it for Chris Helmsworth.

Only thing i missed was that Chris Hemsworth came here to shoot the film without knowledge of many MCU fans in Bangladesh. Like people really love the avengers series here the ticket line for Infinity war screening was so long that the people from the 7th floor of the shopping mall came to the streets with no interruptions. So imagine if they knew thor was here back in 2018 they'd be crazy.Love the action scenes also the talented cast like randeep hooda and pankaj tripathi.

Because if you are looking for a story, then stay away from the likes of John Wick 1,2,3, Polar, Spectral, Extinction, Etc.Watch the movie for what it is, a power-house of action scenes.Again, if you want to know about the country, watch a documentary and not a fictional movie.Enjoy :)",Extraction

Dhaka looks like any third world country and with Hindi songs blaring out, and the Hindi style spoken bangla, it feels an Indian city and not a Bangladeshi city.
Anyhow, the drug and mafia interplay and the country's top military and police brass in cohorts, tries to give a police state with a nexus much similar to African countries. The story backdrop of kidnapping and rescuing is okay, but there is no build up.
The dhaka ganglord is totally unbelievable. He is not menacing at all.
The child actors are better and natural. Specially the slum dwelling would be one and the kidnapped kid.
Liked the Randeep huda versus Chris fighting, but the final crossing over in the bridge with huge lots of random killing and blasts are just mindless, because of lack of empathy and focus.

The action is great but it is one of those movies which look good and seem very promising but do not deliver. The characters feel almost hollow for the most part.The only character who had some back story was Randeep Hooda (Saju) he is the only one whose actions feel appropriate in the given situation. You don't get why Chris Hemsworth's character is trying so hard to save this kid there was no reason for him to try so hard.

464,swowen-84128,"OK, but missing something",7,30 May 2020,"So the movie starts and we see Tyler Rake (played by Chris Hemsworth) decked out in tactical vest, looking very badly injured, on a bridge. As he slumps behind a vehicle with shots being fired around him, his mind goes back, we see a blurred vision, of what looks like a little child on a beach. The story then cuts from that scene and goes back to explain, how and why Tyler is in this condition.
We see a teenage Indian boy, Ovi Mahajan (played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal) with his friends. He looks like your average teenager, hanging out with his friends. You can see that he is of a wealthy family. He sneaks out of his home to meet his friends at a club,While out one boy he is with gets shot and a hood is placed over Ovi's head.
We then find out that this is a kidnapping. Ovi's father a Mumbai crime lord, serving time in prison, but he main rival Amir Asif (played by Priyanshu Painyuli) has orchestrated it all and will use Ovi as a pawn to get what he wants. Amir runs the underworld of weapons, drugs and trafficking in Bangladesh. So where does Tyler Rake feature? The next scenes show Tyler being commandeered and offered the mission of the ""extraction"" of Ovi. You see Tyler is a black market mercenary. The mission is offered to him by Nik Khan (played by Golshifteh Farahani), who is also a mercenary. She describes the mission to Tyler as, the most deadly ""extraction"" of his career. Does he get to Ovi?
This movie was OK, to be honest i expected a little more. Its A Chris Hemsworth Action Thriller! Don't get me wrong, the movie is full of action and is a thriller, but seemed to be missing something. Car chases, gun fights, knife fights, you got it, the story-line was feasible too. I don't know? Do i now expect amazing films from Chris Hemsworth? Am i expecting too much? I don't think i am! He has come to be known as a very good actor and in Netflix high budget movie, i wasn't as blown away as i think I should have been, especially as its screen-writer was veteran Marvel Comic guru, Joe Russo.

Honestly, this is what it means to make a truly International Film.The things that work for the film -1) The diverse cast and crew - only a dull person would not appreciate such diversity!2) The Action - The fact that Sam Hargrave was on the Director's Chair I expected nothing short of brilliant action sequences. After all he is the Brain behind the action stunts Of many Action/ Superhero Films.3) The background score - It's edgy, it keeps you active and engrossed in the film.4) The story - it's engaging, I like the character development. Of course there are things that could be improved on but I'm in no mood to complain today. So I'm just going to appreciate.I really enjoyed the chemistry of Chris Hemsworth and the young Rudraksh Jaiswal. A job well done there!5) Location - This film proves that you don't need the Swiss Alps and Dubai skyscrapers to make a good film. The premise is focused and it's good to see that the makers didn't compromise on it by trying to make things look pretty.Also, I am so happy for Randeep Hooda, I read in an old interview of his (think it was in 2013) that he went to university in Australia to pursue a career in Acting in Hollywood but things fell apart. And here comes Extraction - with an Actor from Australia and a Hollywood based project! How perfect to see someone being able to accomplish their dreams. ( I hope his mentor Naseeruddin Shah is really proud of him too).I'd give this film a 9/10 because well there is room for improvement and I'm also feeling really good about seeing a thoroughly engaging action film, that isn't a super hero movie.",Extraction

Hahaha, this may be a common problem for actors to fix their roles. It's like I'm used to watching wolf uncle's singing and dancing plays. I think wolf uncle's paw can't be drawn to an actress. Mr. tonestak is even more deeply rooted. Apart from Sherlock Holmes, any movie he sees is full of the feeling that he is pretending that he will come back with a click of his watch. In fact, this feeling has a great impact on the experience of watching movies. What do you think about Harry Potter when you watch the escape from Billy toria the other day? Where's the magic wand? Say the mantra. It's too far away from the topic. Continue to talk about this amazing rescue. First of all, the actors are very good. Other actors don't pay much attention to it, because brother hammer is enough. He is handsome enough. The action scene is also very exciting. The same halo of the protagonist is also very obvious. Although he died in the end, in fact, several rockets sealed the bridge and finished. Why bother? But since it's the fans who are basically fluent in the plot, it's fair to say that they can justify themselves. The editing is reasonable and not controversial.

While the story line is nothing new (hired gun to save an abducted person), there was enough time for character development and sensible rapport between Tyler (Hemsworth) and Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), whom is his target to extract safely from the clutches of bad guys. The acting, dialogue, and action were all impressive. Focusing on the action scenes in particular, they included exciting hand-to-hand combat and firearm sequences. Hemsworth pulled it off well.

Now the pros the action and wow oh wow I want to see chris do films more like this. It was shot wonderfully I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen it was like watching a amped up Jason bourne. Used everything at his disposal and its shot in a similar 1917 style one shot during certain action scenes which really set the bar and the gore left me watching the screen cringing as made me feel there pain.This film would of been a 10 if the story was better but for an easy Friday night action film it's a treat.

Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Is Tyler successful? What all enemies he has to fight to bring back Ovi and do both make it back successfully is what the story covers.
There are some impressive stunt work and fantastically steroidal action sequences by both Chris Hemsworth ,Randeep Hooda(Saju) and even Golshifteh Farahani towards the end. Golshifteh as Nik looks beautiful. Randeep and Chris have some great moments of guns blazing and combat knives stabbing.with each other and against Asif's man.

The movie does get tedious after an hour but quickly finds its feet once Ovi(14 yr old) kills the Gasper(David Harbour ). Yes, 14 yr old has moments as well. And, bond between the Ovi and his saviour Tyler do carry emotion so Tyler going all out for Ovi does make sense.
Though I would have loved to see backstory of Ovi Mahajan Sr(Pankaj Tripathi) and Amir Asif(Priyanshu Painyuli) for me to be fully invested into the series. Such detailing was absent and many a times you could wonder if all the bloodbath is all worth it.

If you're into tactical manoeuvers, you'll appreciate all the small details which make the action amazing, from the interaction between characters to the clever and authentic use of weapons and props.Hemsworth is great in his role, blending his action focus with touches of emotion. His nemesis, played by Randeep Hooda, was very convincing. The Indian kid, Jaiswal, was quite compelling and managed to avoid the trop of the obnoxious child in actions movies.

516,djpa-76657,Terrific action sequences and camera work but meh plot.,5,24 April 2020,"Netflix original Extraction was exactly how I predicted it would be in content- High on action and camera work but weak on paper. I still don't get why action movies are always meant to have weak script despite of audience appealing genre. And also logic defying moments make it even worse like one or two mercenaries fighting against entire Bangladeshi police and Army to protect a child of an Indian Drug Lord. Also wasting talented actors for just one or two scenes or making them act like dumb makes it even cringe worthy show.Plot: Tyler Rake's team were hired to rescue son of an Indian Drug Lord from the clutches of Bangladeshi Pablo Escobar(That's how they mentioned him) who have hired some random local goons and kids to operate over the country(as absurd it sounds, it is a fact). While the action scenes and camera work is quite commendable, this wasn't expected to be that bad on paper. The Russo bros are regarded as Visionary directors after their stint in MCU but they're not visionary writers it seems(Joe Russo the writer has failed this time).Sam Hargrave is the captain of this ship and with a thin paper plot provided tried to make it at least worth a watch especially with cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel especially the single shot scene of 10 minutes length(Though it wasn't exactly single shot but the team deserves applause).Performances wise Chris Hemsworth was leading from the front with one of his career best performance. The God of Thunder has proven himself to be a great actor as well besides being Thor. Rudraskh Jaiswal provided able support to Chris and he was worth mentioning. But the one who surprised me was Randeep Hooda! I've been a fan of his acting but never expected that he'll be such good in action sequences as well. The scenes between Hooda and Hemsworth were sparkling and wished more of them together. David Harbour had only two scenes and that too badly wasted it looked like he was there just as a distraction and unneeded speed breaker. Priyanshu Painyuli was also wasted in a rather unintentional comic role trying to make him look dreaded but ended up being a rather spoof of 'Bangladeshi Pablo Escobar' which didn't make him even remotely menacing especially if he uses local goons or kids to operate(besides the Bangladeshi army of course) the country and end up getting killed plainly. Pankaj Tripathi was there only in one scene that too for only 60 seconds and he exploded with his menacing look but that was sadly forgotten and avoided for no reason, those who know about Pankaj Tripathi and Priyanshu Painyuli(Bhavesh Joshi and Upstarts) would know how great actors they are. Amongst this all male led cast there was Golshifteh Farahani whom the makers tried to make it look important but sadly seemed disinterested.While the movie had its own moments but the overstretched climax and bizarre treatment to one note characters(except Hemsworth, Hooda and Jaiswal) ruined entire plot along with illogical over exaggerated moments. Watch it only for the Hemsworth-Hooda show besides the plot was disastrous.",Extraction

520,Dark-Wolverine,A guilty pleasure movie,7,30 April 2020,"This movie is directed by the Sam Hargrave, the stunt coordinator of the recent Avengers movies and screenplay by The Russo Brothers,the directors of the recent Avengers movies.
Tyler Rake(Hemsworth),a mercenary,is hired to rescue the boy of an Indian Gang leader who got kidnapped by another deadly crime lord. Thats was the entire plot though. The story becomes secondary while making the action primary and,they did achieve what they intended. For starters, Chris Hemsworth was good in this, he did have a really good charisma in this and he was the only one to get a bit of additional character detailing. Ovi Mahajan(Jaiswal), the plot device, had less characterisation but, was likable and had more emotional attachment towards the end. Nik Khan(Farahani) and Saju(Hooda) were also good although they were one dimensional. David Harbour had a small cameo which was actually good. The villain was bland.
Speaking about the other aspects,the movie did have pretty good action sequences. The long fight sequence in the first half of the movie is my favorite. They utilized the 'R' rating properly. The violence was extreme at certain times, unlike in Deadpool which seemed comical,this was more realistic and brutal. The movie was made by a stuntman and he did ensure really good action sequences. There were really good camera movements in this and choreography was good. The music was apt for this. The biggest con of this movie which I felt was that this whole movie felt like a video game. First we had a bit of character interactions,then fights, slowing down to interactions and continuing. This was still a watchable movie, guilty pleasure to be precise.

3. It was really unbelievable to see a colonel possessing that much power to assign a huge group of army personnel, choppers, police force and other things, which in reality takes the entire parliament to ensure, let alone the lock-down of the capital and deployment of military power.
4. The main antagonist struggled the whole time to pronounce the simple words in Bangla/ Bengali.
5. So Bangladeshi people always listen to hindi songs??

Knowing this fact, I was expecting some John Wick level action sequences and Extraction did not disappoint in that regard. The action was fresh, intense and beautifully choreographed. The 11+ minute tracking scene is exciting, even for those who aren't film nerds. Hargrave clearly had a vision for how he wanted this film to look and handled some huge action set pieces with extreme precision. This film definitely borrowed heavily from the John Wick series, and to a lesser extent The Raid. It wasn't quite as good as either, but with the right expectations this is a highly enjoyable, fast paced film. Sure, the plot is fairly thin with a handful of thinly developed side characters, but that's ok since everything else was done pretty dang well. Could this be a franchise for Chris Hemsworth?

Chris Hemsworth has been hired on a mission to Extract a boy, the kidnapped son of an Indian Drug lord, held in captive by a gangster from Bangladesh. Subsequently, as things fly off the handle, and with an armed professional behind his back, the remainder of the movie explores how Chris Hemsworth manages to protect this boy's life while hanging on a suicide mission that manages to get deadlier every single second.

Newton Thomson Nigel's camera work amazes you by capturing the streets of Bangladesh stunningly, and the stunt scenes, especially the continuous shots during the fight sequences are highly enjoyable.

Of course, what could go wrong when Chris Hemsworth is on the scene. Chris simply nailed it, and not to forget the young Indian actor Rudhraksh Jaiswal and the more experienced actor Randeep Hooda who both did not fail to deliver.
The end was really emotional and brought me down in tears.
Overall amazing performance by all and every single moment of the movie was intense and I did not feel board or fall asleep even once.
I would have given it a 10/10 if only all the action scenes were realistic, but of course it's only a movie so you would have to expect at least a few out of the ordinary scenes. LoL",Extraction

555,holyshiteverynamehasbeentaken,(sighs)come on.......,6,29 September 2020,"It seems to me that Netflix has made just another mediocre film.
Now, that's not to state that Extraction is a bad film. It's pretty enjoyable, the actors are quite good, and it has well-executed action. Unfortunately, the film's flaws drag it down, resulting in its forgetfulness and averageness.
Now, the film nails the emotional bits. These characters are likable just from the start of the film, thanks to the writers establishing our connection with them using a few effective scenes, and doubled with great performances from the actors, an array of great protagonists are created.
Unfortunately, the script fails in terms of originality, as the story follows familiar beats as other films, therefore diminishing the element of surprise. The film's side characters are often underdeveloped and underused, for example, Jake Tyler's boss. She gets more crucial to the story as it goes on, but it feels like the writers aren't interested in fleshing her out, as we get glimpses of her past, her relationship with the main protagonist, and more so, but these traits are ignored, leaving a caricature of a character.
Also, the action gets stale quite soon as it doesn't change throughout the whole film.
Finally, this film could be so much better, if it could focus more on either the characters or the action, instead of attempting to do both.",Extraction

I always thought John wick is the most polished action cinema Hollywood ever created but the russos took the challenge and with stunt coordinator turned director Sam hargrave delivered another flawless action film where every broken bones can be heard and feel, the unbroken 12 minute tracking is the highlight of the film reminded me of raid 2 but this scene has its own ruggedness and grit. So coming to the story it is nothing new there is zero sense of character development In this film, the character dynamics between the two main leads are undercooked and the misunderstanding of both the hero and the anti hero Randeep Hooda fantastic performance, are somewhat litle half backed. The predictable plot beats will remind you of Leon the professional and many other films but the dissaopointing script makes up for the terrific acting the cast offers. Randeep Hooda nails his ability to create a believable mercenary from India his acting style is no doubt extraordinary but the way he performed the action scenes feels like he is the action movie star of the world extremely authentic and his character beat is very emotional proud that an Indian actor deserved his talent in the wider Hollywood spectrum. And the lead character Chrish Hemsworth is again brilliant this guy with a hulking physique can emote so brilliantly is a testament to his talents he really is mastering his emotionally charged scenes right from the Endgame. The supporting cast ably did justice to the film and one more thing the wild card of the movie golshifteh farahani stole the show at the climax and the third act she really saved the guys bravo subtle performance from her very intense her role was small but she really made an impression in this film.

On the downside, the film fails to offer anything new, based on a script that has been done multiple times in the past. The villain is never developed and the film's person in distress seems more like an object than a developed character.

566,rajveerdhanak,An Exciting but Forgettable Action Flick.,6,14 June 2020,"""Extraction"" follows a black ops mercenary Tyler Rake (played by Hemsworth) who must rescue an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh.Being an action film, the strength of this film comes from the director being a stunt coordinator himself, which is evident in the film's excellent action. In addition to the fight choreography and action sequences being riveting and gripping, the stunt-work and physical performance by Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda is the highlight of this film - who manage to convince the audiences of them being skilled and trained military men.The films opens on its strength of great action and close combat sequence, hooking me within the first act itself without spending too much time in the exposition. However, the midpoint slows down in pace, in an attempt to build on the relationship between Tyler Rake and the kid he has rescued. The relationship doesn't come across as genuine - but rather a sentimentality that seems falsified, contrived for narrative purpose, which makes this portion all the more boring.The weakest aspect of this film are its subplots. Particularly, the plot-line with David Harbor's character ends up being inconsequential, without revealing anything important about the character or his past with Tyler. Another plot-line - about the kid's father being a drug lord - establishes an arc of their relationship that ends up abandoned and unresolved. Overall, the story of Extraction feels incomplete, with its resolution rushed for the sake of finishing the plot - which makes the screenplay of this film weak and forgettable.""Extraction"" makes for a good casual watch, with exciting action but an unremarkable story that you probably won't remember in the coming weeks.",Extraction

And I had to look away at the rake on the floor scene...but wow, the action sequences...how they filmed them was phenomenal. We wondered how they managed it and had to look it up and see how after watching the movie. In retrospect, and seeing Hemsworth had produced it, to me he is obviously a product of having grown up playing very violent video games. The graphic violence in this movie may be shocking to older viewers, but I can't help but think, considering what kids play online or on those at home game contraptions today, the movie won't register as horrifyingly violent for them as it did me. Still, good flick and more than action packed...more like action on an adrenaline high.",Extraction
571,Sabaher,A must watch for action fans,7,24 April 2020,"First, you have to talk about the action. It's just fantastic. I've seen comparisons to John Wick because both movies were directed by former stunt coordinators and have a distinct style. John Wick is a little bit smoother, polished and stylized. This one is more brutal and visceral. Both are shot excellently and choreographed wonderfully. This one has more brutal intensity with the way it plays out. There's also a lot of variety in the action. There are close corridor shootouts, big open city setting shootouts, car chases, hand-to-hand fights, knife fights, sniping type action, RPG's, one take shot action... Because of the way that it's filmed with the long takes, there's an about 30 minutes long section that basiclly plays in real time. You just feel you are right there in the movie.The other thing the movie does really well is handeling it's story.The basic plot is very straight-forward. A mercenary is trying to get a boy out of the town alive. His objective is very clear from beginning to end. However, it adds complexity, nuance and intrigue with the different characters involved and their relationships with each other.The movie does have sraight-forward and uninteresting villians that are just evil, but it also has characters that are allies to the main the mercenary, but antagonistic to the boy and allies to the boy, but antagonistic to the mercenary. There are a lot of interesting character dynamics that add tension to the action sequences. The plot is straight-forward, but it's executed with intrigue because of the characters and their dynamics.The movie has more emotion than you would expect from a fim like this. There are not any big character arcs, but you learn enough about each of the characters to care about them and their relationships. We also dive a little bit more into the side characters than you'd expect. Even some of the henchmen and assassins are given more depht. There are scenarios of why they are doing what they are doing so you care when you see them in action. Some of them you don't want to die and some of them you do.Chris Hemsworth was great in this movie. We know that he can handle action and be a leading man. This movie ups the stakes of being the here because he's doing real stuntwork. There's no green screen. You see him actually doing fight coreography. When it pauses for the character moments, he gets to really act as this broken man on a mission that's starting to see the humanity in the events. He doesn't rely on his humour or his bag of tricks to make him likeabe. It's al just about the performance and I really think he was the right man for this film.This is not a movie for everyone. This is a hard R action movie. There is violence against children that can be pretty gut-wrenching if that's not your thing. If you're looking for a deep character study or a plot driven movie this isn't that. It's an action movie for people that love that visceral expirience of watching an R-rated action movie. I love that this film got brutal and heart-wrenching. It feels like a gut-punch. Some people won't like it.The thing that holds the movie back the most is the bond that forms between Chris Hemsworth and the boy. It feels sudden. It feels ike from one converstaion to the next there's a big gap that isn't fully earned to hep us understand that transition. It needed a bit more dialogue to build that bridge from one place to the next.This is exactly the kind of movie I want Netflix to make more of. There is talent in front of and behind the camera and they took a risk on a new first time featured director. Since we're in lockdown, I think people a re going to very much enjoy this movie.9/10",Extraction

I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to see just how well crafted this movie is. It has excellent grounded action scenes, great set pieces, fantastic cinematography (I'm a sucker for those epic long takes) and a surprising amount of emotion in large part thanks to amazing performances by Chris Hemsworth and the kid who plays Ovi.True, the story isn't too much to write home about, but it gets the job done setting up the action that is the bulk of the movie. And of course it's an action movie in which one guy manages to take out entire armies so be prepared to suspend your disbelief a bit, but thanks to the excellent execution it never took me out of It. The movie catches its breath a few times and doesn't feel dull in those moments, thanks to the interactions between Hemsworth and the kid. Didn't know this movie was partially produced by the Russo brothers, but it made total sense after seeing it.If you like well executed action movies that don't just rely on CGI explosions and fast editing, give this a watch.

The movie feels like a video game where the viewer is taken through one action-packed scene to the next all while the human element of the characters is left woefully unexplored.The art of action movie making seems to have shifted more to elaborate stunt and special effect extravaganza, while ignoring the more intimate and quite moments needed for the characters to become likeable enough for you to care for them.

614,thabzzl,Formulaic and somewhat predictable but still entertaining,6,24 April 2020,"The plot is quit familiar: Mr. Special-skills-ex-military-tragic-backstory is hired to save powerful person's loved one from rival powerful person who has kidnapped said loved one. Connection to powerful person's loved one becomes personal as both parties survive together. Also, important person's loved one comes to somehow remind Mr. Special-skills of the loved ones he's lost and he decides this mission is worth risking his life.I wasn't bored by any means and there are a few twists thrown in here and there that will probably keep you watching till the end.The ending was perfectly satisfactory in my opinion until the directors/writers or whoever is in charge of such decisions just couldn't bare to have Mr. Special-skills be actually, truly, unambiguously dead. He gets shot and falls in the river so you really do feel the weight of his sacrifice but of course there's no body and we see a familiar silhouette in the background of the final scene so the 'sacrifice' turns out to be no sacrifice at all. Can't traumatize the audience with the death of a Hemsworth and kill off any possibility of a sequel, can we?The assassination of the rival drug lord is both satisfying and frustrating. Satisfying in that we finally see this cruel man get what he deserves and frustrating in that it might, in my opinion, have been more interesting to have him survive and get away with it, making it so the conversations about how Ovi will never truly know peace actually mean something since his father's rival is still alive somewhere waiting in the shadows.It's fine.

There are some cool scenes, a couple of big names, an ""escape the city"" type plot and some adequate acting.The ending is definitely where it flops (spoilers ahead.)Early on it's established that the hostage's father has no money to pay his ransom or for the mercenary rescue team- this is what the whole film is built on.The guy who is looking after the hostage at home dies after attempting to sabotage the rescue and save him himself to avoid paying the fee.Chris Hemsworth's character also dies, meaning that he can't then look after the hostage he's built a connection with.Therefore, we're somehow meant to believe that the crew of cold blooded mercenaries all decided to skip on their fee for rescuing the boy and are now supposedly paying for his school fees?He ends up back at his fancy private school, despite having no money and it also being established that if he remained in the city he would be killed. Yet somehow, 8 months go by with no retribution from the gang who kidnapped him and the leader then being murdered by a mercenary who, for some reason, was still in India.Oh yeah, and then it hints that Chris Hemsworth isn't dead, despite being shot in the throat and falling off a bridge.It's an entertaining enough watch on a weekday evening, but don't expect it to win any awards.",Extraction

The action sequences are honestly incredible, the plot is weak and if the Russo brothers didn't have their names attached, it wouldn't of been such a high budget. Character development is poor as I didn't feel too attached to any of them but that's fine, the film knows it's a gritty action packed film and keeps to that, the character development as I said is poor but is there to help you try and rout for them to survive. Most Netflix films are trash and I turn them off after the first 20 minutes but I really didn't want to turn this one off. You can easily tell that the director was a former stuntman as the action sequences are so good, for me, they are up there with some of the John Wick fights, Chris Hemsworth does well with the role and it's good to see him play a role with a lot more grit and an almost darker side than I've seen in a while especially compared to the MCU.If the action sequences weren't as good then this would get a 5, they make that much of a difference!",Extraction

Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating.

I find it unbelievable and morally unacceptable that the life of an innocent child is in any case more important than the life of the hundreds of policemen and military who died in this movie. They are not gang members.

Now First about the cons of this movie, it defies logic and not sure about the body count though. The major negative is wafer thin story and script. The lead antagonist is completely miscast.
The major USP of this movie is the '11 Minute' fight sequence. It's one of the best action choreography I've seen in recent past. It was wild, raw, realistic and quite intense. Thanks to Netflix release, the censor less leverage is rightfully used. Not to mention about the cinematography especially in the stunt sequence, kudos to the legend Newton Thomas for his live cinematography.
Finally our very own Thor, we see him here as Tyler Rake. Chris's portrayal of Tyler rake was great. And it was indeed fresh to see him as such.

644,nick-1896,Dated and dumb Hemsworth vehicle,3,29 April 2020,"Back to the 90's we go in this highly forgettable action flick that obeys every cliche and adds exactly nothing to the genre. Brooding tough guy? Check. With a layer of scars and calluses from countless unnamed wars? Check. That are hiding a the soft centre of a genuinely good man? Also check. Right, let's have a quick flashback to hint at his tragic backstory and explain why he's so broken and self destructive. Done. And give him one last mission - a rescue, someone vulnerable that reminds him of his tragic loss. The list of action tropes goes on and on - right down to the pretty lady, the hint of new beginnings, of a relationship that can happen once the hero's dealt with his demons. *slaps forehead and sighs* There's just no reason for this thing to exist - other than to prove Hemsworth can do more than Thor. Which he probably can, but this does little for his case. The plot is purille; Rescue drug dealer's kid, oh no, we've been double-crossed (imagine that) but we'll carry on despite the fact he's nothing to us because it's the right thing to do. Even if that means killing hundreds of police with families who are just doing their jobs, a whole lot of innocent bystanders, truck loads of bad guys and a few highly trained professional mercenaries. This makes not a lick of sense considering at one point the mercenaries actually say they couldn't keep the kid safe even if they could pull off the rescue. This is glossed over at the end. The characters are flat and predictable. We know the bad guys are bad because, like Bond villains, they just stand around throwing kids off buildings and doing evil stuff. A lot has been said about the action but really, it's just OK. It's mostly down to shaky camera work making everything seem faster and more frenetic. The location is the film's one interesting point. And also the source of some of the problems with the action. There's a few chase scenes that anyone who's tried to drive in India would know are impossible. Pedestrians etc jump out of the way like in a bad computer game. And in one scene a speeding vehicle comes out of absolutely nowhere to hit poor Chris. Despite the fact we've just see that all the narrow streets are blocked. Inconvenient. But don't worry, we'll just take this truck that's conveniently appeared - from the same narrow alleyways that we've just seen to be jam-packed with people and overturned stalls and carts and whatnot. And drive off at speed. The simplistic plot goes from dumb to dumber as we head towards the inevitable showdown on the bridge we caught a glimpse of at the beginning. It's the typical 'we have to get from A to B' scenario via the hardest way possible ignoring any possible alternatives. ""The police have all the bridges blocked? And for some obscure reason you can't get a chopper to us until we get to the other side?! Umm, what about a boat?"" ""Shhhh. You're spoiling it."" This is anachronistic, dated, dumb action that simply shouldn't be.

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Action scenes are fast paced, realistic, exciting and have that Bourne feeling to them. The setting is not your usual location either being in Asia (India) for this type of film either, which is usually South America. Chris Hemsworth proves he can be more than just Thor (who he plays brilliantly I add).

665,aleksandre,Superb Action!,10,19 June 2020,"The rating of the movie was intimidating me to watch, coz its little low, but im glad I did. As movie begun, it hooked me till the end. It is action, nothing more or less. Dont expect some mastermind twisted plot, it is very simple, but its quiet eye pleasing with all the gun and fist fights. Chris really played well, great merc, even that kid was a quite carry. I give 10 coz i feel its underrated, it at least deserves above 7, cmon, you dont get 2 hours of nonstop action flick every day.",Extraction
666,israelkirven,Freaking awesome,10,25 April 2020,"Non stop John WIck style action with a deep broken and capable chaotic neutral main lead played by Chris Helmsworth. I exclaimed out loud a few times at the brutality and efficiency as ""Tyler Rake"" does his life's work. Loved the tactics and the unseen acknowledgment that the underlying message that war is fifty percent skill twenty five percent luck and twenty five percent heart. Sad fast brutal and realistic. WATCH THIS!",Extraction
667,jackransom-69832,Extraction,7,24 April 2020,"The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job.",Extraction

669,yasmeenshabana,"Good action, sad action hero",6,4 May 2020,"I expected this movie to entertain me with some good action scenes, but I didn't expect the story to be also enjoyable this much. Some violence was too much for my taste so I had to skip it, especially related to violence towards kids. Action is new and the director used the small spaces really well. Car chase was also good. The only thing that I felt enforced into the story, is the death of his son. They had to give a good reason for why he is fighting so hard and risking his life so they came up with the story of the father who lost his kid and now he does that cause he doesn't care if he catches a bullet.

673,marksarko1,The best in 2020 so far,7,16 September 2020,"The movie is technically super cool. Fun didn't stops from beginning to the end.
The action legend John Wick combat style clearly influences the context of the movie, but with a special touch.The combat scenes are breathtaking and eye-catching, as they are very elaborate and in an unprecedented new way that makes the viewers as if they're in the middle of the battle, so the director intended to create some of the realistic mistakes that happens with the hero during the problem in order to give more realism to the scene in addition to the way camera were operated, which was the main element in controlling the combat scene.
Colors, light effects, the sound editing, and visual effects of the shooting environment, all of these elements made the film and the combat scenes in particular a piece of dazzling art.It is not surprising to see this mastery in action scenes when we learn that director Sam Hargrave was the combat coordinator in the Avengers trilogy and the director of the Avengers End Game.The plot and script could have been better, One of the bad parts in the movie is the scene of killing Tyler Rake but he differently back from dead as the Teaser shot at the end of the film showed, it seems that even with the remarkable development that we noticed in Netflix's cinematic production, it still needs some directing.Last time i watched a hero dies and returns in the Slow Motion shot was in cheap Stallone commercial films. The supernatural power of the hero in pure action movies (except for fantasy and science fiction films) is no longer desirable.",Extraction

That gives it a little more 'unpredictability'.The action sequences were great, especially the 11 minute chase sequence which I had to rewatch to appreciate the camera work in particular- amazing!Sure the plot was a little threadbare and there was barely any character development but I still enjoyed the film immensely.To all the people whining about it misrepresenting Dhaka, so what?? London, for example, has been misrepresented so many times, but it's a film, it's not supposed to be real life.",Extraction

677,gocoolraj,More like a GTA mission or a Call of Duty game,7,27 April 2020,The movie has some pretty good action scenes especially the first car chase scene with the running cam was great. Other than that even the last fight scenes were just gun fights which are more like a shooting game and doesn't leave much impact. Chris Hemsworth is good. In the end another action flick which could have been done so much better.My rating is 6.7 to be precise.,Extraction
678,puneetruparel,Another dud by Netflic,6,8 May 2020,"Being a well-known/successful brand is often a double-edged sword - it commands a premium price in the market but it is also subjected to a higher expectation from the public. Same notion is valid even in the field of entertainment. If a movie is released by a well-known studio or an actor, there is a standard that it is expected to meet. Thus, when Chris Hemsworth partnered with Netflix to release Extraction on April 24th, there was a certain expectation from this film & I think it's fair to say that it fell short.Extraction is an action-drama set in Bangladesh in which Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), who plays the role of a courageous mercenary, is hired for a perilous extraction in which he has to rescue the kidnapped son of Ovi Mahajan Sr (Pankaj Tripathi), an international criminal. Things start to take a wrong turn for Rake when there is a glitch in the plan and he is left stranded with Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) after rescuing him from the kidnappers. What follows is a 60-minute non-stop action drama following Rake's journey to rescue Mahajan with the help of Saju (Randeep Hooda).Be it Billy Lee in 'Bad Times at the El Royale' or Captain Mitch Nelson in '12 Strong', Chris Hemsworth is one of the few actors who has been able to continuously deliver notable performances outside of Marvel Studios. His performance in Extraction is one of such notable instances. Hemsworth is also supported well by Jaiswal who, despite being only 3 films old, looks completely in his element while sharing the screen with the mighty Thor. Hooda also delivers a convincing performance as an alibi of Tripathi and risks his life for the safety of Mahajan. For all Stranger Things fans, you also see a nice little cameo by David Harbour as Gaspar.Extraction is the testimony of Hemsworth's effort to keep growing as a filmmaker as this feature marks his debut as a producer in films. Speaking of debut, Extraction is also the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave, who is known for his stunts in Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2, and many other action movies. One could see Hargave's signature all over this movie with dangerously yet immaculately performed stunts - especially in one action sequence that goes on for 11 minutes in which Rake is trying to save Mahajan from the cops and Saju. Hargrave mentioned in his interview that it took him 5 months to create that scene and 10 days to shoot it. Hargrave also clarified that although it looks like a one-long scene from a naked eye, it is actually a compilation of many scenes digitally plastered together.Although the acting, cinematography, production design and stunts are good in this movie, the script doesn't do justice. There are several sub-plots in the movie that are left undiscovered and even the ending demands a little more clarification. Because of its starcast and the current 'stay-at-home' order, this movie will garner more eyeballs than it would have otherwise. But if you are busy pursuing a hobby or have limited disposable time for watching content, you can give this movie a pass.",Extraction
679,Thotbuster,Must watch,10,28 April 2020,Wats up with the negative review. It's an action packed movie from start to end. The name EXTRACTION itself is the plot so I don't understand y people getting offended with all the violence in the movie. Some reviews are so dumb they should start watching musicals. Just enjoy the damn movie and stop complaining.,Extraction
680,realalbertbarrios,Chris Hemsworth becomes a John Wick influenced killer.,7,27 April 2020,"Extraction sounds like a cheaply made film that you would find on Redbox. But since Chris Hemsworth is in the movie, it's a win-win. the film has a cliched plot that we've seen a ton of times. Interestingly, it takes it and does something different with it. The cinematography is average and the hand to hand combat is absolutely the best I've seen. One really outstanding scene from this film is the long 11-minute long take in one of the action sequences. Of course, it's actually simulated but they probably put it there for a reason. Another worthy aspect of Extraction is the acting performance by Chris Hemsworth. He is really great in the film and works. The complaints I have are the plot and feel of the film. It has that filter of a Mexican movie. Now there are some complaints about the violence being over the top. I didn't mind it since I have seen films that are more violent than this one. Overall, Extraction is an enjoyable action film that you can watch during the quarantine. It will just be another of those films that we forget throughout the week.",Extraction

Chris Hemsworth did a great job as did everyone else. However, I thought the film lacked in the plot. I didn't really see the motive in the kidnapping when the drug lord is already immensely wealthy, and I thought Hemsworth's character could have used some better character development. It would have been nice to see Rake's motive for the extraction to change from money to love as the film progressed as well as the relationship between Tyler and Ovi. As a result, Tyler's sacrifice at the end of the movie would have packed a much bigger punch than it did. Overall, solid movie that gave me what I expected - lots of action.",Extraction

2. Story line is completely not believable. Bangladesh is far from a yellow anarchic apocalypse zone with a failed state. Much white saviour stuff that was unnecessary in a mercenary story. Plot was nonsensical - for instance, why would an Indian mafia guy hire a non Bengali to infiltrate Bangladesh.
3. Much of the action was barely believable, and the climax didn't come together well enough to be believable.
4. Why was Bangladesh yellow?
5. Not too many great performances.Summary: Avoid, even if it's just on your Netflix subscription, there are too many good movies out there to waste your time with this.",Extraction

The people just lining up with no protests, Then the lead getting killed by the other kid on the bridge, because his team lead decides to break training?

I was surprised at how much screen time and dialogue was given to even non significant characters, giving the world more flesh and mind. It was so well written and shot that even a few lines gave insight to the mind of the characters.

Randeep Hooda has done good as well but his character could have been deeper. Portraying Dhaka was seriously wrong. The way they speak bangla was totally funny. They could have casted actors literally from Bangladesh to make the movie more believable. CGI was so cheap.

John Wick was interesting, because it explores a whole new world of secret assassins, and is done masterfully, without taking itself too seriously. The character is mysterious and yet interesting, well built.
This thing is garbage. Presents itself as a serious movie, but we get no real idea of who is who, why people do stuff, who wants to kill the kid and who wants to save it.

704,productionslykos,Australian John Wick,7,21 May 2020,"A solid action flick that succeeds at being just that, an action flick, however sprinkled with some heart. I was very bias for what seemed to be another modern day action feature; however director Sam Hargrave provided an Australian John Wick instead! The action was incredible, choreography was jaw droppingly flawless. The connections after being shot, punched and thrown against a hard object felt authentic and added to the somewhat realistic fighting style; camera movements were gorgeous, not too shaky to bring disorientation yet not too smooth to take you out of the extremity. The cinematography was adequate, and at times would tell a story in itself which was surprising. The one shot takes were perfect for the moments presented and although cuts weren't well hidden to an experienced viewer, could easily fool a naked eye. Hemsworth's character, although a stereotypical Australian cliche, was enjoyable to watch. In all, the Australian stereotype was smart as it contributed a mateship sentiment to the story. Hemsworth brought an absorbing performance, being unpretentious yet grandiose in action sequences yet considerate and gentle in tender moments. And I appreciated the inner turmoil his character carried, making this more than a shoot, kill, shoot movie. The dialogue was stale but got it's point across. However, the sporadicity in language variations was questionable as to why characters would switch between two languages. The story was as long as it needed to be, little to nothing felt overstayed or unwelcomed other than the subplot of the Bangladesh boy. The ending is touching yet extremely lazy in terms of tying loose ends. And the 'resurrection' of Hemsworth's character was not needed as it destroyed the meaning of his sacrifice. Overall, an exceptional action picture that I'd suggest watching if you're in need of one.",Extraction

706,scubafiend,Amazing action and fight scenes. Exceptional acting by the boy.,9,26 April 2020,"There are some amazing action scenes in this film - to a certain extent it feels like one long fight scene. There were some continuous shots that were mind blowing - no cutaways or edits, just one long action scene! One of them is 11 minutes long! Unlike lots of action films I found myself literally sitting on the edge of the couch. The acting of the main character - the boy (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who played Ovi- so impressive! It was completely believable that he was experiencing every emotion from the very beginning of the film to the end. As for the complaints by some reviewers about the locale, music, etc. I am not going to base my impression of a country on what I see in an action movie! Besides - all you have to do is look up the filming locations to see where it was filmed which - by the way - DOES include Dhaka! It is like any other film - locations are selected in order to suit the narrative and the ambience of the story. Would it have played as well in a more up-scale neighborhood? Doubtful - they needed to have the mobility in and out of apartments to move the action forward which would not have worked in another neighborhood. And again - FILM. NOT REAL LIFE.Last thoughts before spoilers - This is not for someone who has a problem with violence in film. But if you are a fan of action films with lots of fighting, you should enjoy it!*****SPOILERS*****
My one complaint - the very last scene when Ovi is coming up from the bottom of the pool and you see someone standing there. They are blurry, there is no hint of who it is. Is it the kid who cut off one of his fingers there to get him? Is it one of extraction team? It just leaves you hanging which I find annoying. Actually, that whole scene at the pool seemed out of step - after everything that happened Ovi is just wandering alone at what appears to be a public pool? It almost feels like they couldn't decide how to wrap up the film. That said, these are fairly petty complaints and they do not take away from the film.",Extraction

711,Anudeepsambaraju,Movie Hardly Survived...,5,1 May 2020,"Extraction hardly survived only because of stunning action-packed scenes and Chris Hemsworth. My Rating 2.5/5.Extraction is an action, thriller movie made for tv, By Netflix. Extraction is a story of a fearless assassin who is on a mission to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord.Sam Hargrave First-time directed, known for Stunt coordinator films like avengers endgame, Thor Ragnarok, The winter soldier, and many. Cast- Chris Hemsworth in this instead of his hammer he holds firearms. Randeep Hooda and Rudrakash Jaiswal.Pros - Director Sam Hargrave knows what he whats when coming to action scenes, For a car chase scene he chose to tie himself to the hood of the car to record the scene, all his hard work paid off, All stunts, close combat, shooting, all the action scenes are incredible, well-choreographed. With this film, Chris Hemsworth proved, not only hammer he is also good with guns did a great job.Cons - First if I want to spoil the movie for you I can't because there is nothing to say. For most people, Even though it has a great action sequence with a week plot movie seemed aimless didn't grasp the interest.Poor characterization we don't know the motive of the kidnapper, what's the deal of kid ya there are scenes with a kid but that doesn't add up anything to the story.
And what's with red-yellowish filter, although it spends 65 million dollars the production doesn't look like that.-In Dhaka, Bangladesh every one listens to Bollywood songs? Do cars look like that? the accent is like that? NoooooVerdict - Despite the negative, the good thing that is Extraction doesn't drag at all its only 100 min, if it's for theater it's hard to recommend gladly it's not. if you only want to see Chris Hemsworth in action flying bullets Extraction doesn't disappoint you, if not better to watch John wick, The raid, again.Thanks for Reading",Extraction

There's this one 11-minute long sequence which was filmed in one shot - it was really praiseworthy.Chris deserves praise for portraying his character so convincingly. Action sequences were already his forte; but he absolutely nails the rare emotional bits as well.The second half gets a little boring because of the lack of a proper storyline; there's only so much shooting and killing you can take before it becomes an element of gore.

I appreciate their effort to give the Indian town a Bangladeshi look (they used Bangla poster/signboards everywhere), but Capital Dhaka has not much similarities to the ghetto they showed in the movie.I appreciate the use of local language- but the pronunciations were in some cases- horrible.

There will be loads of Steadicam one take shots and loads of camera floating between cars in a seamless fashion shots so yes so far so spectacular. Where this whole movie falls over is plot, story, character development, chemistry between the cast, dialogue you know, everything else.This film borrows a lot from The Raid and John Wick for its action sequences and they are really satisfying and unpredictable but I do wish the story and dialogue had someone to give it a spot shine. I didn't feel invested in the characters even Chris H, who normally makes everyone he plays likeable, looks like he's finding it hard to project what this guy is about.I haven't finished the film yet as 2 hours of this is way too indulgent and I there are a lot of needless scenes with everyone looking a little bored.It's nice to see a 6 foot white guy save brown people though. He's so pretty and good at his job and the browns are so goddam ugly and corrupt ;-)They should have employed some big name Bollywood stars to make this a proper international production and got someone better to write snappy fun dialogue and who knows it might not have gone straight to Netflix.7 stars for that car chase alone though.",Extraction

It game me the vibe of a JCVD Saturday afternoon movie from the 90's, in HD.I have to give it up to some of the great camera work, but that's mostly due to state-of-the-art stabilizers, so ... well done technology.The whole plot seems like it was written on toilet paper during bathroom breaks from the action scene filming.

Some the camera work is unique and better than I have ever seen in a realistic fight sequence. You will feel like you a right there in the action. Some of the shots are one take, and clearly took incredible coordination to pull off.. Hemsworth has shown himself be a superb, top tier action star, and I foresee him in many more to come. He has the emotional and physical acting chops to make every scene believable, and his character is both complex and relatable.This film is also much more realistic in its gun use, characters actually reload repeatedly, check weapons for bullets, and constantly use cover accurately. Enemies actually take multiple hits and shots to go down, they don't just take one kick to the chest and die like in the majority of other action films.The plot overall could have some improvements, but it does not take away much from the film. The primary villain needed some more motivating factors, but the film will make you hate him enough to root for anyone who stands against him.I've seen the vast majority of negative reviews are solely based on the fact that the negative aspects of life in Dhaka might be slightly over emphasized, but doing research on my own, it is not significantly different than reality. So I would recommend disregarding the majority of negative reviews and give this film a watch if you enjoy action films.

The neighborhoods of Bangladesh resembles with many areas of India and looking at some of the breathtaking action scenes I think this movie should provide a lesson to our bollywood film makers as to how to make a proper action movie in India. I am an Indian and seriously feel that in the name of 'action' thriller most of our film makers just fool us with monotonous action scenes which repeatedly involves humans and cars flying unprecedentedly high in the sky after an explosion or a punch of the actor who isn't even playing the role of any superhero. This movie had a top hollywood and bollywood celebrity (Helmsworth and Randeep Hooda) and both did their jobs perfectly well, this just proves that Indian actors aren't anyway less than the best of the world when given a good director.There were some shortcomings too, it had too much of violence and it didn't have a strong story and a plot to compliment such well shot action sequences and amazing cinematography, the story telling wasn't at it's best yet this movie seems to be the best action movie shot in South Asia.",Extraction

765,philwilson271,"Great action, terrible third act!",5,28 April 2020,"First off, let me say if you love action movies and don't care much about plot, give this a watch. I did find plenty to enjoy, despite the average rating, but I can't score it higher because of the obvious flaws. Also, lengthy review and spoilers ahead...First scene, and we get the now overused flash-forward scene, showing Chris Hemsworth's character all bloodied and getting shot. This can be an effective way of starting a movie, developing a sense of intrigue or suspense. But it doesn't add anything here, and comes off a little cliche.The two lead actors, Chris Hemsworth (Tyler) and Rudhraksh Jaiswal (Ovi) do a great job, but there's not much of a script to work with. There's only one scene of any significant character development, where Tyler is the focus, talking about his past and his son. And there's not enough to make me personally root for him as a protagonist. It doesn't help that he's a mercenary who takes any job (""sometimes I rescue people, sometimes I do other things...""). He's just not a likeable protagonist.So... the final act, lots of confusing moments here. How was Amir's general watching the action on the bridge from miles away, and then a few moments later close enough to take shots at people with a sniper rifle? Why did Ovi nearly make it all the way across the bridge, only to run all the way back to Tyler when he got shot? Why were the team of mercenaries (who had already lost money after not being paid for rescuing Ovi) willing to stage an expensive rescue with several troops and a helicopter? Why did that kid from earlier show up to shoot Tyler? We know the kid was working for Amir, but everyone else involved in the shootout was either army or police, except this one kid. A lot of elements didn't really make sense and seemed quite contrived.Overall, like I said there are some positives.

I may not be able to give a purely objective opinion on the entire movie, as I think I might be in love with Chris Hemsworth. Please understand that despite my bias, I do try to think from the perspective of a film critic. That being said, I found some of this movie's stretch run to be mildly redundant, and overly dramatic. However, as a whole, you can almost tell that this film was directed by a stunt man, as the action seemed vivid to the extent that you could almost feel the sweat of Mr. Hemsworth body, as he took out half the country of Bangladesh's crime syndicate.",Extraction

The problem with making a film like this one so gritty and realistic and violent and dark, is that the plot and script must also represent this. This script and story dont even try.The entire premise makes no sense...they insist on saving one kid for an evil drug lord...but dont mind killing 100 or 200 other people with children of their own who are just following orders and are probably just decent policemen who have no idea what's going on.And they wont even get paid for it.And theyll all probably die.And, somehow, in the opener, one guy double crossed them and knew exactly where all his team was, even the guy in the woods. Such a bad lazy script all around meant only, one mist assume, to practice new stunts and choreography.Beyond that, it is obvious that you will know all the cliches and tropes. But. You wont see some of the car hits coming because they are well shot, but also completely nonsensical since they come one after another, yet no one sees are hears them coming...again and again. Are the streets in india or Bangladesh covered in silent and cloaked electric vehicles? How about a gun and knife battle with cars and people that see it and completely ignore it and just try to get in the way of it. I mean, it is action and looks cool, if not real all the time, but it makes you groan often.The acting is actually good all around, even the kid.Oh, and of course, a beautiful woman gets the last kill without warning or explaining any of it, including what exactly physically makes her equipped to be such a character or how she possibly gets near the villain.Frustrating. So much talent involved and it's just another one of these movies...",Extraction

Have you people seen how other Hollywood movies portray other places in the world, unless they are in Western Europe? Calm down and rate the movie and not the misrepresentation of your beloved country.
So, back to the movie...
Very well done action scenes, with a weak plot and somewhat dry dialogue. The barely believable turning point in the main character's behavior (from merciless mercenary to empathetic ""father"") drags downa bit the whole movie towards the end. On the other hand, we've seen this rather inexplicable motive already in the ""Equalizer"" and ""Safe"", where the main protagonists ""turn soft"" and show their human side.

So, if you like that kind of stuff it's enjoyable.Faults: First of all, whoever has worked as the guide towards Bangladeshi culture and language, that guy needs to get fired. They mixed Bangladeshi Bangla with Kolkata Bangla which is significantly different in use of words and accents. This made the movie quite unrealistic.

And all those 90s hindi songs that no one listens to now. Our bangla songs are much more popular and way, way better. The only bangla song I heard was at the end when credits were rolling. And they took all kolkata indian actors none from Bangladesh. I'm happy that Hollywood took the initiative to shoot in Dhaka, when they could have selected any city in india.

Fight after fight with no breathing space. Because of this in my opinion the ending didn't have a lump in the throat ending that most great action films do. There was not enough space between action scenes to make you care about the characters. Don't get me wrong. It was good in its own way. Acting was great!

Mainly normal & elite police, ordered by a corrupt chief, is dieing in hundreds for one child, less as hunters than as hunted. Rake chooses to see no other way. Strangely, help can get in with bazookas, a helicopter in and out. What about the sentence of Ovid ' today my father killed onother father - I am getting sock about it' ?

It appears that some were sorely disappointed that it was not a rom-com, a period drama or an ""important film"". However, as an action movie, it is far better than average. In terms of intensity, originality, and production value, this is often on par with John Wick. True the plot is not particularly intricate and the character development is minimal, but much is done with little. There is no sense that any of the actors are phoning in the performance because on paper they aren't given much of an opportunity to show other dimensions. The movie covers events over a short period of time and the characters are focused on the issues at hand. There are a few breathers but we aren't sidetracked into forced ""lets talk about us"" scenes in the middle of life or death struggle. With the superhero genre beaten to death, a straight-forward fast-paced entertaining film is an increasingly rare gem and well worth the watch.",Extraction

823,sycik18,Must watch! Ignore the self-proclaimed critics,8,24 April 2020,"Finally it's out! Glad it wasnt a disappointment. Unlike most Netflix movies, this one tops on Production, Casting, Direction and even the story (though many would disagree).THE ACTION:
The action scenes are to look for. Nicely directed. The chase scene is the best,as it immerses the audience as a 3rd person in the event. Real action sequences between characters give it an authentic and grounded feel. Chris Hemsworth has done a great job. So does Randeep Hooda ( soo rooting for this guy! After the great hit he took for his previous release being shelved, this a great comeback! Underrated actor in bollywood). You get the works from choppers, to grenades- top quality action quite forget it was suppose to be an extraction not a warzone in middle of the city. Kudos to Hargrave who can bag this one to his high-profile stunt portfolio (with the likes of avengers etc)THE STORY:
Joe Russo (found out after then movie) does his best in delivering a new edge to an action movie. With audience saturated by so many movies and not to forget now are self proclaimed critics hard to please it's really hard to make a movie with a good story. But I think Joe Russo delivers. People will compare and be like ""oh this part this part that"". I'll just take your phone and shoot a scene at the most. Then let's talk.SIDE NOTE:
You got to give it these Directors, Writers, Production, Make artists a standing ovation as high stakes and efforts are put in. It's easy to sit back relax, watch and comment on a movie takes 3 mins at the max. But takes months of hard work, effort and times accidents just to make a movie.DRAWBACK:
It's sad but realistic avengers ending. 😭CHERRY ON THE TOP:

And what's worse, they try and make it into somekind of emotional journey... Such a disappointment, really actors like chris helmsworth? need to stop chasing the netflix paycheck and be more picky about the types of movies they accept. For sure netflix might pay well just now, but if he makes another one of these turkeys he'll soon find himself stuck in b-movie limbo.

860,thecinewatcher,"AMAZING ACTION, GOOD ACTING, VAGUE AND DULL STORYLINE.",7,24 April 2020,"Positive Points
1. Amazing action and acting
2. Good cinematography
3. Great castNegative Points
1. The storyline of the movie just doesn't cope up, there is no clarity about Randeep Hooda's role in the movie after the killing (Rake's team) in the boat, it is unclear as to who hired Rake's leader for the extraction, coz Randeep is himself killing their (Rake's team) team later on.
2. So many points in the movie are unjustified.
3. The writing of this movie seems immature and bogus.Note: The movie had so much potential otherwise, it's just the writing of the storyline which seems totally off and blurry.",Extraction

863,Mr-Mingz,Some nice Cinematography in a bland copy paste thriller,5,18 May 2020,"The one redeeming quality this movie has was the cinematography. Some of the scenes are very well constructed including the epic 11 minute 'one shot' part following the characters around in the chase. Having said that, I wasn't a fan of the widescreen which felt very claustrophobic or the constant orange filter because I obviously need reminding that Bangladesh is a hot place.
I thought the characterisation was barely noticeable. You don't learn much about them and when they're being sad or determined, the viewer hasn't been put in a position to empathize with them.
Chris Hemsworth was a decent enough actor for a 'merc' but the part needed a lot more fleshing out in the script to make his character have more prestige. In other words, he needed a (better) backstory, a clearer motive and a personality!The narrative felt like it was pasting tropes from other movies it had copied from. You get very typical chases, car stunts, twists and 'military movie conventions' sloppily thrown in if you ask me.I see on the grapevine that a sequel is possible...oh dear...",Extraction
864,OsamaBenFartin,Great action flick start to finish💥,10,3 October 2021,"This movie is worth a watch just for the epic location filming, and the camera work!

886,arindamdas-41892,Great movie. Best action flick of this year.....,9,24 April 2020,"Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.",Extraction

I enjoyed seeing Randeep Hooda and Priyanshu Painyuli in significant roles. Ignore the haters bummed about the misrepresentation of Bangladesh. I agree it's a misrepresentation but their low ratings are a misrepresentation too on the entertainment value of this movie. Thank you Netflix for producing this movie.

It's just an imaginary dhaka shown in the film. A movie bringing together India and Bangladesh in a context, could have been pretty good. There could have been some efforts showing some degree of corruption or systemic error that leads to the actions.But this film is just full of ****. The actions are awesome. If the film realised that the host country has much more to offer then depicted, could have made the film worth watching. Rather, the entire film is shot at , what, 500 metres of set. Everything is repetitive.And there can be no country where the military is run by Mafia. That is absurdity to the highest. Sure there can be some corruption at some level, but that should not attribute all. Remember, winter soldier? Corruption was there. But there was a conflict with the good within Hydra.In this film, there was no corruption. Nothing. Just people swinging AK47. Guns are illegal in the country. How come so many AK 47 there on the street, why would kids be carrying guns? What was the director thinking?Think about it. If you a bunch of mercenaries start shooting missiles and gunning down police without any showing any intention to discuss anything, that depicts terrorism isn't it? Then who is the bad guy here? The police or Chris? What is the logic?Watching the full movie, I did not get any sense of any hatred between the two rival gangs. It's just pointless shooting.",Extraction

Technically the movie is brilliant, especially the continuous action sequence in the 1st 30 minutes. Chris Hemsworth has acted well, the stunts are realistic and Randeep Hooda deserves a mention too.
Watch the movie if you are a sucker for action movies, this one is one of the best action movies with latest techniques lately. Cheers!",Extraction

Screenplay is written by Joe Russo and it is quite okay, Chris Hemsworth is the only person we see on screen. Randeep Hooda and Pankaj Tripathi has nothing to do. But Priyanshu Painyuly has some screen space and he is a shining star...

Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story.

962,swaroopsrijit,Great action movie.... But a weak plot weighs it down...,6,13 June 2020,"Now already my expectations from this movie in terms of action was very high, and this movie hasn't disappointed me in that factor..
Firstly, let me tell you what I DID NOT like about this film
1. The Location...
The location of this movie is primarily based in Bangladesh, and because they wanted to portray the action sequences brutally, they went for a tightly spaced location which was quite rural and not actually like how Bangladesh looks like, and many Bangladeshis had an issue with this... Now they could have changed the plot in another manner to not let this happen, but it is something to be pointed out as a negative factor..
2. Lack of Character depth...
This movie primarily focuses on Tyler, the 14 year old Ovi and Saju of course, but there were so many more characters who could have got a better role, and they lacked character depth, even Chris Hemsworth's past wasn't that satisfactory... If the characters had bit more of a content, it would have helped the plot to be better as well...
Now what I LIKED about the film
1. The Hand to hand combat, chase sequences and Gunfights
I am not gonna type much about this cuz you got to watch the movie for that
2. The performances (The Cast)
Every character in this movie was excellent with great acting. Chris Hemsworth's character is well written and his emotional moments are also good... Randeep Hooda was awesome and finally got recognition for his talent through this film... all other characters were good too...
3. The emotional moments
This film is also gonna surprise you wth some emotional moments as well like between the child and Tyler, and even the emotional bonding between them...
It would be impactful for even those who do not like action films
As a whole I would just say that though the movie is not that good in terms of its storyline, it would not fail to impress in the action... Watch it if you r a die hard action film fan
Skip it if you r looking for an engaging plot with twists and turns and less violence",Extraction

India could have just been fine. I would have given it 10/10. But as a Bangladeshi native, I cannot but express my dissatisfaction about the way film makers gave less attention to the use of Bengali language in the film. Even the setting which was supposed to be Dhaka was not at all in Dhaka. There is no forest around Buriganga river that runs through Dhaka. The mistake was sticking like a sore thumb. The women, the people, the sign boards, the accents of Bangla slang were all wrong. It could have been an excellent work if they could do it properly. They were using Calcutta tongue not Dhakaia language.This is was so disappointing.All the 7 star is for my favorite actor Chris Hemsworth. I could have been proud for this movie as it was staged in Bangladesh. Only if it were a reality - they could have done it Gazipur district with lots of forest to play firepower.

Sajus love and fear for his family, particularly his son
Amirs mentor relationship with that phycho kid
(very briefly) you get to see a bit of rakes friendship with that other aussie guy before things go sour.
That for me is a lot for a movie like this, enough to feel something with each fight scene. Films like this benefit from simple stories so that it gets to focus more on the characters and action. Logan, The last of us, stories like those involving a badass taking care of someone who needs their help dont have convoluted storylines that would just ruin it.

The camera work during the action scenes was pretty fresh, if a little overdone to the point that you were too aware of what the camera was doing. What little acting is required is passable at best. The.... let's called it a ""plot""... is more of a mechanic to get Hemsworth to cross a large chunk of an Indian city on foot while straight killing any cops that might get in his way, but being nice enough to give any young kids a pass. So in this film the bad guys are people that kill one kid on screen, while the good guys are people that slaughter around 30-50 (could be higher) cops who may or may not have been ""dirty"". Take that, and the fact that the film could have been over in 30 minutes had Hemsworth's character not decided that growing a conscience involved taking the kid away from the person who was previously his handler. It kind of made the whole film feel like ""we could have used a native military character as the hero, but instead we wanted Thor to come in and save the day.""If you're looking for nothing more than a film full of action, with very little down-time and even less plot, then this film is great.

Bangladesh is not a great country. There is rampant poverty, large economic disparity, the issue of terrorism, and rise in illegal drugs and gambling.

Also Dhaka is portrayed as lawless with the police and ""Elite""units under one drug lord. There is no such unit called an ""Elite"". The closest would be the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Portraying them as under the payroll of drug lords is insulting as they were the ones who have been carrying out a controversial crackdown against them and illegal gamblers recently. The movie also features children walking around with AK-47 SMGs in public, like as if Bangladesh is a war-torn African country. Bangladesh is one of those emerging economies, on par with Vietnam. Dhaka city may contain slums, but they do not make up the entire city. The movie also shows Hindi songs playing in every house. Bangladesh also has a music industry. Also, the local Bangla spoken is nothing like the one spoken in Bangladesh. It sounds more like a West Bengali accent like those spoken in Kolkata. They not only did not shoot the movie in Bangladesh, filming mostly in Ahmedabad in India with some scenes filmed in Thailand. There were also no Bangladeshi actors used with most of the locals being played by Indians such as Rudraksh Jaiswal. Also one the cast members is an Iranian named Golshifteh Farahani. Iranians are not the same as Bangladeshis. Also Iranians should stop playing Indians, Bangladeshis, and Arabs as a lot of them are willing to play negative stereotypes of Muslims and Arabs. Navid Negahan being one. The inaccuracies are as bad as those of Dan Brown novels such as Digital Fortress, which got Seville wrong, and Homeland, which gets things wrong about Beirut, Islamabad, and Islam. People try to justify these by using the ""it's fiction""excuse. Other than those inaccuracies, the movie also follows a white savior narrative. Our hero Tyler Rake is a typical white action hero. Although not an American, as Rake is made Australian to match his actor Chris Hemsworth, he has traits of a typical white American action hero. Just to save one child, he massacres many Bangladeshis. The movies plot is partly borrowed from the far superior Man on Fire, starring the Denzel Washington. The former atleast wasn't a modern ""Might Whitey"" story and had actual Mexican actors for a movie set in Mexico. People seem to really think this is best movie since John Wick. This movie has nothing in common with John Wick other than the brilliant fight scenes. It is more of a spiritual successor to Beirut (2018), due to its white savior narrative and inaccurate portrayal of a certain city in a developing country.",Extraction

After watching the trailer I was really waiting for something fantastic, something logical though I knew most of the shooting done in India. As they added Bangladesh so it can be expected that there will be something real about Bangladesh but where is that? Even the main character from Bangladesh is not even Bangladeshi. That accent they used, as a Bangladeshi even I can't recognize where they came from. in every house, some Hindi song is playing.

Why? Was there any significance of these locations? If you were interested in adding a foreign language to the movie, say Portuguese. Flights are cheaper to Brazil right ?Point 2: So Bangladesh military works along with the Mafia and they can arrange just 1 helicopter that too was useless against 2 men. And what happens on the other side of the bridge? There's no one to guard the other side of the bridge. Crazy!!Point 3: How does one manage to take a kid from Mumbai to Bangladesh (Dhaka) ? did they go by flight? by car? train? walked?

1019,rahulk-92160,It's captivating in bits and pieces,8,24 April 2020,"To me the movie seemed solid and with flavor. Certainly not the best in the genre but then it sure is one time watch.In these elongated single shot sequence movies or in action movies in general, the story always goes for toss, I still don't understand the point of fast and furious but they are enjoyable. Exceptions would be Bourne series which has a lot more gripping tale to tell although action is the main focus. This movie story assessment falls in between. The plot is not the high point.The high point are the action sequences. There is a floating sense of bourne series, a touch of 'the raid' specially the fights within buildings. some of the gun shooting are slick.Chris Hemsworth in my opinion overshadows others mostly by his strong physical appearance, Other mention would be Randeep Hooda, he had his presence marked, all others did what they are supposed to do, no stellar performances.Now few words about misrepresentation of Dhaka, I feel movie as a form in itself is a misrepresentation, If you want a true representation look for a Documentary. Slumdog millionaire won Oscar though people were pissed off because it misrepresented Mumbai (Bombay). Here is the thing, When you are making a commercial movie, You look for bare minimum and you stroke the preconceived notions of people. They highlight the things which fascinates people, I personally didn't like the overuse of chromatic lighting to make street looks dirtier. But then I feel you are not doing yourself a favor by being offended.All in all it's a one time watch with good action sequences and it's always pleasing to watch Chris Hemsworth who also produced the movie.",Extraction

1026,rplatini,A tribute to the genre,9,27 April 2020,"Whoever was born in the 80s grew up with a very strong incentive for action films, due to the influence of parents, the trend in the industry, the television network, investment in rental companies, everything conspired in favor of the still inexistent term ""shot, punch and bomb "", It was undeniable the happiness to see the films with stars of the genre. Currently, productions are very restricted when looking for some quality or some component that attracts all the attention and transforms the film, in fact, good; there are examples, of course, but with the number produced, the result should be better. This conspired for a feeling of emptiness in the hearts of fans of this iconic genre and when we come across a good production, the heart beats with happiness, that's the truth! Who hasn't been thrilled with John Wick? Action films can be very chic, just that the cinema made use all the good in your favor.The Rescue is an adaptation of HQ Ciudad, written by Ande Parks and the Russo brothers and is a project with long dates. Before it was released, the intention to take it to the cinema already existed, but many things have changed since then. The story narrates a mission by a black market mercenary whose objective is to rescue the daughter of a South American drug dealer, this in HQ; when starting the project, in 2012, the protagonist would be the star The Rock and the direction and cast was completely different, but everything changed, who took the lead was Chris Hemsworth, another thing was also the setting, exchanging south america for india and Thailand. The new chairman was Sam Hargrave, who has a long career as a stuntman in Hollywood and has acted as a stuntman and stunt coordinator in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these names generated great expectations and the result could not have been anything else, one great action movie.When cinema is made with passion and by those who understand it, it is another level, not that others do not know, but being specific here, I refer to what the film proposes, action. the script is simple and common, the protagonist who is almost an army, traumatized and usually drinking, leaving for a mission that may be the last; there are many films with this premise and it is normal to some extent, what will differentiate is how it will be presented and developed, how the aspects will be addressed, the relationship between the rescuer and the rescued is an example of this, and how the setting will be built. I can say that the choice of a director (even if he is new to the chair) experienced in what is really action in the lens, was the biggest hit of this film, without a doubt. The realism presented is impressive from the first minutes, it does not take long for the director to put the camera in his hand and go out with everything, his experience helps to put himself in the right point of the take, in the exact rotation. By opting for less stuntmen on the scene, the audience's approach was also greater, the protagonist is present in many scenes that usually the face would be hidden, the style of filming also deserves to be highlighted. Hargrave uses several techniques to embody his film, the camera in hand already mentioned is used at various times to bring this realism, for sure the director lay down, knelt down and got up running to follow everything he wanted to capture, the dense scenery of an Indian city with those tight streets, full of people, cars, boxes, animals and everything that can be placed there, contributed a lot to the frantic and agonizing rhythm. There is an excellent sequence plan, another sequence that looks like a video game cutscene; the camera takes the action from the front, turns to the side, climbs, turns, swings, a door opens, shows the action of the character (engaging a gear), turns the look again, turns forward and continues, it is sensational.The action scenes with hand-to-hand combat are of a high level too, everything is organic and no matter how much you look for a defect it is difficult to find, again, the camera works well in the movements and everything happens, fight with a knife, shots with different weapons , neutralization sequences that make everything more plastic, shot in the foot, in the body, in the head, rotate the gun for better positioning of the body, change the type of weapon, return to the knife, go to the hand ... phew !!! It's really frantic. I couldn't imagine this film in America, the locations contribute a lot to the geography and the profile, the feeling of crowding at all times causes a claustrophobic effect and the yellowish filter causes a mixture that warms everything, that place looks like a hell of hot. At various times I found myself making comparisons with John Wick, for the plasticity, ignorance and at the same time, the subtlety in worrying about the details to make everything perfect in the eyes of the viewer.
The cast is very lean and obviously pulled by its biggest star, Hemsworth is an actor who has shown himself to be quite versatile, including in comedies. Here he is very well and has his role outside the MCU, I am not surprised if he stops being Thor, for some, and becoming the ""rescue guy"", the commitment to production brought an excellent result. David Harbor is another name known to the general public, but his character is very shy in production and has no prominence. On the other hand, Randeep Hooda, who plays the kidnapper's coast guard, deserves more attention. Hooda is very well known in the Hindu scene and brought a commitment equal to that of the protagonist, most of the best scenes involve his character and, as I said, the result is very good. The rest of the cast follows a well-defined acting pattern that does not compromise on anything, there is no one to say ""this actor is too bad"", despite having a very caricature tone in some. I understand that it was due to the Indian style, many actors work in Hindu cinema and have their own characteristics, the lack of custom in watching Bollywood films creates a certain visual barrier, I recommend even paying attention to this industry, which like any other, it has its mistakes and successes.The Rescue is a film that arrives to fill a gap and finally marks a hit by Netflix in blockbuster-like productions, pushing the mind, for example, Squadron 6. It is a great choice for today and is very worthwhile increase, especially if you are part of the generation that had a lot of fun with the eighteenth-century troglodytes. It draws attention for the already praised work of the director who, like Chad Stahelski, goes on the radar. At the end of the film, I only had a smile because the air was gone.",Extraction

Chris Hemsworth carried the entire movie on his shoulders and being the executive producer of the movie he had very little scope to go wrong and to that point, he hardly disappoints you throughout the movie. Between both his falls (his first scene and the last scene), he has given a power packed performance.
The kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie. But the movie does leave you wishing Randeep Huda's character was a bit better defined. Half of the time you will not be able to decide whether to root for him or not. Moreover, it was a sheer waste to give Pankaj Tripathi such less screen time. It would have been much better to cast him as the Bangladeshi drug lord. He would have made the extraction far more difficult than it seemed at the end.The kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie.

A handful lead actors can easily wreak havoc on an army trained professionals and literally send them to oblivion. But we are not talking about Avengers or Thor here.It becomes a problem when a production like this creates an allusion that the story setting and production design of the movie is 'the' true presentation of a real country, and it's capital, people and armed forces. Especially, if that country is the main setting of major Hollywood production for the first time ever.The production team might have taken some 'plateshots' of some filthy, dingy, overcrowded outskirts of the capital city of the story, which is fine, but that seemed to be the only thing to say about the city. The real nicer locations (not some artificial set) and millions of well educated middle class residents of the same city are totally missing. This is wrong, in my opinion.The law enforcement agencies as a whole have been portrayed as utterly corrupt and incompetent. Almost every single members of the force seemed to be chasing Chris Hemsworth and his band of hired guns like spellbound insects heading to light traps to meet their brutal ends. Explosions, gun fires, car crashes all happening nonstop in overcrowded and narrow suburban streets with complete disregard to many many innocent lives to save only the life of a kidnapped son of a drug lord. And this is somehow a redemption for the protagonist that audience should empathise with or even deem heroic!It is very unfortunate to see how a respectable movie personality like Chris Hemsworth may have tarnished the image of a country (he most likely has never visited) and its people in the name of fiction and entertainment.",Extraction

1088,tanvirahmedfahim,"What went wrong in ''Extraction""? (Continuation)",2,13 June 2020,"6. The Terrorist Country 'Bangladesh'?!
So how much do you know about this small country? Is it the first time hearing or you heard about it but very little... If that's the case, I believe this review already had given you some ideas and here comes some more important ones. Stick around for little bit more.I. The Truth about Gang Business and it's history in Bangladesh contrary to what has been potrayed in the movie --
What's the current status? Let me assure you one thing, Bangladesh is not a country where kids or men go around the roads and carry firearms in the open. Terrorists and criminal gangs do exist here but they are either left spineless due to the effort of law enforcers or is operating stealthily in the underground, Not over the ground!
Bangladesh did saw an emergence of Criminal Gangs throughout the country after it's Independence(in 1971). There main activities were as usual... Drug business, Extortion, Kidnapping, Murder, Robbery, Rape, fighting rival gangs etc. They normally operated there activities without being caught. It was possible because of some local corrupt politicians and law enforcers. Sometimes honest policeman were left helpless with no choice but to comply with them for the sake of their family. There are several cases in the past where family members of policemen were killed for going against some of the infamous gangs. And the gangs were backed by political support and other corrupt policemen and adminstration.
The First Generation(1975-1985) of these gangs used local machetes, Spears and similar weapons. At this stage, the gangs were just starting to grow. They worked alongside corrupt policemen. The government were not able to pay much attention due to the political crisis Bangladesh were in back then after killing of Bangabandhu(Father of Bengali Freedom, Father of the nation) in a military coup in 1975. There were more coups one after another after that! Second generation(1985-1995) started using homemade pipeguns, bombs alongside their first gen weapons. At this point, They started to get involved in politics to backup their dirty businesses. The Third generation(1995-2005) got upgraded with modern firearms. (Mainly Russian and Chinese Aks, Pistols, Shotguns and grenades which were being smuggled in through India along with some Indian handguns.)
After the fall of Dictator President Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, Bangladesh entered democracy in 1990. The main political parties of the new democracy started to use these Gangs in their favor against the oppositions. The gangs also kept switching their loyalties throughout this period to stay in business. Some of them reached at their peak during this period. So much so that few Mafia's made their way into the parliament as elected members!(you can easily guess what they did in their election area) But then things started to get out of hands and their host political parties started to withdraw support from them when their nasty business was getting in the way.
From 2004, planning started for eradicating these uncontrollable crime syndicates by the ruling government of that time. Because these Gangs were making mess within the party and top brass wasn't happy about it. The main politicians were concerned for the public security issues but lower politicians who were in liaison with the gangs and some corrupt policemen were not making it possible for them to lower the crime rate. Extra Action had to be taken. The Army was summoned to help. And they formed a special force for internal crime control of the country with governments authorization. This new force was given complete autonomy to eradicate Terror and crime from the country by any means it finds necessary. It was Initially formed with patriotic members from Bangladesh Army. The force which still operates to this day, is known asII. RAB - Rapid Action Battalion (The Elite Force with black dress in the film)
Also nicknamed as 'The Cobras'. They became terror for the terrorists and criminals right from the formation. Within the first two years of their operation, they apprehended or killed{in Crossfires(some of which are accused of being extrajudicial killings; for which they are criticized internationally)} many many infamous names some of which are Bangla Bhai, Picchi Hannan, Murgi Murad. The thrilling stories of how they tracked, fought and apprehended some of them from their forts still amazes me! Alas, we don't have an industry like Hollywood to showcase their success in suppressing criminal gang activity in Bangladesh.
There was a time(before 2005), when gangleaders were the king of the streets. They would carry weapons with them in the open. But that's not today! Todays Bangladesh is different. Thanks to this guys.
And in the movie, it was shown that the RAB chief is taking orders from a druglord and his troops are fighting for his sake!!! I wonder what kind of rotten weed was taken before writing the script!III. Bangladesh Army
The Army was also fighting alongside the gangs! Lower your drug dose, Please!! The story is all messed up!!
It could have been like... the Gang which is operating from the underground chases the main character (who is trying to extract the kid) while they themselves are also trying to evade police detection. In the meantime, Armed forces are also on their tails as they are unauthorized persons in a foreign country with Illegal firearms in hand... Making the mission 'Extraction' even more difficult. This could have been an ideal story but no! They have to show that our forces are bad!! Such crazy Westerners!!!
Here are some successes of Bangladesh Army in international arena. (Remove the spaces before and after dots)

Bangladesh Army is an Army with a glorious history of Victory, An Army which never loosed! Because they always resided with honesty. There's no way a bunch of drunk mercenaries can overthrow them.7. Messed up timeline!
Many problems with this movie wouldn't have been there if the time line was correct. They seriously lacked in their study about Bangladesh. They probably Googled Bangladesh. Gathered information from past and present and put them together to portray a horrible mess.It seemed to me that they tried to present an underdeveloped and dark Bangladesh of the past. Such showing, kid gang members wandering on the streets with guns! Presenting Army with the older outfits(Army uses a newly issued Camo outfit which more brown than green).But they also showcased Smartphones and other present-day technologies which were not available before 2005. And the fact that RAB was present shows the timeline is post 2005. And with smartphones, it's after 2012. They clearly messed up time while researching.8. Anti-Muslim?
The previously described points led me to ask, was it just a mistake? or was the messing of timelines had been done deliberately to put Bangladesh in a bad light? as it is a Muslim country! I guess, that's the reason. They just came to know it's a Muslim country and that's it. They were like, ""Let's screw it.""If you like my review... Feel free to check my profile.",Extraction

If you are spending so much money, get it right.",5,29 April 2020,"This is my first ever review and I felt like this needed to happen- not only because as a Bangladeshi native I feel that Bangladesh was misrepresented, but because huge movie production companies have taken it for granted that they misrepresent any country and get away with it. Be it any Latin American country, a country in the African continent and especially Middle Eastern countries.
It seems like they are finally starting to get India right, though Hollywood must think that all other countries around it must be the same. If Netflix went through such lengths to acknowledge a small country like Bangladesh and base the entire movie on it (which is a huge deal for countries which are not always known to the world), then why not get it right? The movie must have spent millions of dollars to produce such a massive action movie only to show a very expensive knock-off version of India. Chris Hemsworth has done an amazing job with his acting, and his action sequences were outstanding. But he could only cover so much of the incompetence of both the story and the setting.
Believe me, the natives who are complaining here are not because we feel that our country does not have any problems. It is because we do have a whole list of them, but none that were shown in this movie. For imagination I give this movie a higher score than I intended to.",Extraction

Great action, Chris, as Tyler Rake, absolutely nails it as the highly skilled mercenary, amazing camera work (don't know how they achieved some of the shots), and talented actors from that part of the world.
Some complain there's a lack of plot and no given reason for the kidnapping...wrong! Voice over explains the warring drug/organized crime cartels. Kidnapping served two purposes... revenge(one can assume) and embarrassment to the father in prison.
Plot... Tyler Rake and his partners are hired to get the boy back, man in charge of boy's protection fails and is tasked in returning boy or losing his own family, man decides to double cross Team Chris and everything goes crazy.
There are touching moments scattered throughout the movie. We see flashbacks that Chris has, Chris and the kidnapped boy make a connection, Chris sacrifices himself to save the boy and the ending is uplifting if you believe that blurry figure that the boy sees is Chris.

1139,sheshank-joshi,I don't care how it represents or paints bangladesh,8,24 April 2020,"I know bangladesh is not so different from India in terms of culture and a lot of other things. The two were the same country before this and were divided only on the basis of religion. That's okay, its a different country with a wonderful PM and they are marching ahead. Good for them. But that doesn't mean they should give bad reviews for this movie.
This is a movie that deals with gangsters and mobsters. Those criminals are the same whether they are in India or America or Bangladesh or anywhere else. They do crime, they pull in children in the early age and make them experienced criminals. It happens everywhere in the world, including India. Actually that's the point of the whole movie : I wasn't pissed because Bangladesh was shown like that, but that's reality everywhere.
I simply don't care how it represents Dhaka because I have never been to Dhaka and simply don't care if it is true or not. Regarding Bengali, it doesn't really matter to a person who doesn't speak Bengali, or for that matter any Indian language (especially with those hindi songs in background - it was weird for me too because I wanted to hear bangladeshi songs too, would've been much more realistic), but who watches action movies for realism.
Action movies with realism looks like boxing movies without the SFX to back them up.
The One BIG plot hole of the movie, how come a crime lord gets access to a militiary commander and a whole bunch of army platoons. Its ridiculous. If we keep that aside, rest of the movie is really good. It makes us think how hard it for children, either mob bosses or not to get into it - like how the Urv gets into making his first kill and similar with the other guy who kills Chris.",Extraction

Hooligans in Dhaka don't use AK-47s. Heads of the mafia don't let wasted kids in their dining rooms.Most importantly, a big foreign guy like Hemmy doesn't just go around talking suspiciously on the phone in broad daylight in the middle of a busy street in Dhaka without attracting huge crowd. Maybe possible in India, but not in Bangladesh.And then 60-something year old leader of a law & enforcement starts sniping and accurately killing people by headshots from quite a distance?

You saw the previews and knew what you were getting, so the logic of people complaining that this wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" is lost on me. For those who don't know, this was a film adaptation of a ""graphic novel"" (comic book, for those over 30) and that genre is not well-known for its engaging storytelling.Let me say up front -- the cinematography, fight choreography and seamless special effects (camera behind the car, pulling up alongside, outside the car, panning back and forth, then suddenly *inside* the car, exiting the other side in a long, unbroken chase scene... take a bow FX guys!) combine with a story that's unexpectedly complex for its simplistic origins.All the actors turned in amazing performances, even though all but the two leads didn't have a great deal to work with. Randeep Hooda was particularly memorable as his character wasn't the cookie-cutter character as his motivations are revealed.In short, if you have a couple hours to spare and need a bit of high-octane escapism that doesn't require you to turn your brain off, you may enjoy this.

It does not pass as a good story teller at all. The whole movie has barely any story. The screenplay is not written properly, nor it's execution is good or well done. Direction in respect to story telling is not up to the mark as it lacks the layers of a cinema that would unfold as it progresses.Coming to the point of characters, casting is very good, Indian actors like Randeep Hooda, Manoj Bajpai are really good actors, but they are being completely wasted as there's no space of character development or character progression. The whole film surrounds around Hemsworth, and I'll not say his performance is bad, but also not great.Action films of 90s have a similar pace and style.The only thing good about this movie is its execution of action sequences and its cinematography. The scenes are shot from great angle, and it's no surprise as the Ruso brothers are very fond of them. The movie has used a rusty color grading to portray Dhaka similiar to that used in breaking bad to portray Mexico.
For a industry like Hollywood it's very easy to decorate a movie with all this ornaments to make it look professional and eye catching, but at the end of the day it doesn't increases it's cinematic values.In summarisation I'll say this is not a good movie, the outcome of it is disappointing im respect for expectations.

Extraction is a 2020 Netflix original movie directed by the Sam Hargrave, a stuntman who has done many successful movies, with his feature directorial debut. It stars Chris Hemsworth as ''Tyler Rake'', Rudhraksh Jaiswal as ''Ovi Mahajan Jr'', Golshifteh Farahani as ''Nik Khan'' and Randeep Hooda as ''Saju Rav''. Extraction takes place in Bangladesh, India in present period, over a couple of days. This is an action-thriller movie.
Ovi is the son of Ovi Mahajan Sr. the biggest drug lord in India and for that reason he lives a very sheltered life, has to come home right after school, gets driven around everywhere by people who work for his father and doesn't have a lot of contact with people. He sneaks out to meet his friends in the beginning of the movie and gets kidnapped by men working for Amir Asif, biggest drug lord in Bangladesh. We then meet Tyler Rake, a black-market mercenary and former Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldier, who has a traumatic past and obviously does these jobs hoping to catch a bullet one day. He gets recruited by a fellow mercenary Nik Khan to rescue and extract Ovi Mahajan. Tyler gets briefed on the plan and gets kidnapped by Amir's men. When they take of his mask, he sees many guys with guns pointing at him and he also sees Ovi there. As they escort Tyler away to get the money a sniper kills one of the men and Tyler takes the other one down. After that we get an amazing and brutal fighting scene which ends with Tyler getting Ovi back. They don't get to the extraction point because an assassin took all the people down. We then get an amazing 11-minute one shot looking chase/fight scene. He is told that he must leave the kid because there isn't going to be any payment from Ovi Sr., but he isn't going to do that. Now this is pretty much all I can say before I enter spoiler territory.
Extraction is an awesome movie that has amazing stunts, chases, fights and cinematography. Now the story may not be that amazing, but the other stuff makes the movie so much better. The CGI in the movie could be a lot better but I let it slide because it is a feature debut film from Sam Hargrave. If you like the John Wick franchise, this movie is right up your ally. This movie gets an 8/10 from me.",Extraction

Typically, I can suspend logic when watching a movie. I am on the side of the movie makers, and WANT to believe what they are asking me to believe. I am a friend to movies. I'm rooting for them.
Optimism aside, this Netflix original is one of the poorest written stories offered by the streaming site to-date. It's endlessly loaded firearms, and the hero's penchant for the double-tap coup de grâce fighting style becomes lazy after a while. I have heard review that liken it to a John Wick-style, ultra-violent, revenge fantasy. The difference between the movies' approach to killing, however, could not be more different. John Wick lives in a dream-like word of paid assassins, where Extraction exists in a gritty, morally bankrupt reality. The story has very little, humor or heart. At last count, Chris Hemsworth's character kills 183 people. John Wick's body count is notoriously high as well, however, Wick's killing has context. He is getting his revenge. Extraction holds no such justification. In order to save one boy, there are hundreds of deaths. Where John Wick kills bad guys. Extraction, in stark contrast, kills police officers and military troops. Almost 200 kills for the life of one drug trafficker's son. I just don't buy it!",Extraction

Chris Hemsworth does a good job portraying the vulnerable but brutal action hero. The only thing that at times broke the immersion a tiny bit for me is when the movie didn't know if it wanted to be realistic or not. The (by the way stunning) female lead looked far too glamourous in combat and Chris was too superhuman at times when you consider the (relatively) realistic setting. So maybe the sequel needs to be more realistic or more over the top. But overall I found it very entertaining, especially for a Netflix-original.",Extraction

1236,sreyam_das,Excellent stunt but weak story and excessive violence.,7,4 May 2020,"The Action in the movie is overwhelming , with so many gunfights, hand combat, and close quarter shootouts. Both the character of Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were great in their fights.The accuracy is what is I believe at 60%. The location is picked as Dhaka, especially around the Buriganga river. We have the involvement of Dhaka Police, the military, and another government force known as ""Elite"", which closely resembles the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) of Bangladeshi Armed Forces. Most of their clothes were accurate to a good degree, but when I look at the faces of the actors, including the Commander of the ""Elite"" force, they feel alien to me. Their faces did not feel familiar with the minute characteristics of Bangladeshi people, including facial structure, body structure among others, which made it feel unnatural. I'd say if possible, they should've taken some Bangladeshi actors or background crew to make it look more realistic.The way the characters were talking was also borderline grey as some dialogues felt natural to the way some of the goons speak, especially the kids. But at the same time, the style of talking of the older characters felt more close to something from West Bengal Bengali rather than the Bengali from Dhaka, which we colloquially call, ""Dhakaiya Bangla"".In conclusion, movie felt good with the action, but there were so many plot holes, as to how Ovi was kidnapped and transported, how Tyler's crew entered the country with such weapons and the logistics. All it felt was something out of a script about getting a ""package"" out, without any character development.They have done a great job setting up the environment to be as real as possible.

1238,tilak-22911,#MAR ACTIVITY #MAKAUT #MOVIE REVIEW #ONETIMEWATCH,8,9 May 2020,"Avengers' director duo Anthony and Joe Russo, who co-produce this film with Hemsworth and action choreographer-turned-filmmaker Sam Hargrave, have gone for more than just locations while delivering an Indian whiff. If ""Extraction"" is billed as a high-octane actioner, a lot of the stunts would remind you of old-school Bollywood. For a change, this is not so much about contemporary Hollywood CGI razzle as it is about vintage Mumbai action masala, you realise as Hemsworth bashes up packs of armed goons or engages apna Randeep Hooda in some good old knife-and-bare hands sparring.Perhaps Hemsworth, Russo and Hargrave visualised it that way. An action film that will primarily play out on mobile phones cannot hope to impress with intricate SFX wizardry. Rather loud-impact stunts, kept flowing non-stop, are good enough for what actually is -- an OTT film.""Extraction"" won't disappoint action buffs, in that sense. The film is unabashedly uni-dimensional in situations, plot and characters despite a backdrop that could have been tapped to create a smart socio-political thriller. Instead, the effort never deviates from its intention of being a loud stunt fest and little else.Joe Russo's screenplay draws from a graphic novel that he once co-authored, titled ""Ciudad"". While the drama in the book is based in the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este, the film transfers the story to the Bangladesh Capital city of Dhaka (incidentally, the film was originally titled ""Dhaka"", too).Driven by the clear intention of cashing in on violence, Russo hasn't bothered to check much on the subcontinent's socio-cultural nuances (so typically Hollywood, isn't it). The thing is Ahmedabad simply does not look like Dhaka, never mind the deliberately done Bengali hoardings and occasional Bengali lines - in Bangaal dialect -- thrown in.Clearly, stunt director-turned-film director Hargrave gave more attention to a highlight 12-minute action sequence filmed on Hemsworth than storytelling details. The irony is the particular sequence brings back instant recall of Daniel Craig's by-now classic parkour chase in ""Casino Royale"". Even though that one came 14 years ago, it would still seem the hands-down winner in this stream of action sequences even today.
The plot is basic. Ovi (Rudraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of a jailed drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi in a blink-and-miss role) is kidnapped by the gangster Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Hemsworth as the mercenary Tyler Rake is hired for a whopping sum to bring the boy back.""Extraction"" is sketchy in its intent and execution. The drama operates on a nebulous kidnapping that is never explained. It's almost as if Joe Russo, before writing this screenplay, saw too many of those old Hindi action dramas of the eighties and nineties where you normally threw logic behind while setting up the hero as a portrait of machismo.Indeed, Tyler the hero goes to places where even Thor the superhero wouldn't imagine -- in the domain of the hardcore commercial Bollywood. He acquires infallible swag as he bashes up a dozen baddies singlehandedly, and spectacularly goes about with his mission. Oh, and he is lonely, too -- as brooding men of action normally are. Just for the heck of it, they might have given Hemsworth a love story too, and some naach-gaana!Pankaj Tripathi is wasted, Randeep Hooda gets a few scenes of note as an action star, and those who dig world cinema will be disappointed with the raw deal Golshifteh Farahani gets. Hemsworth fans won't be disappointed, though. It is a package tailormade for the hunky superstar -- it is his co-production, after all.Since it is time of lockdown viewers gonna enjoy this cause it contains action and a bit of drama.",Extraction

Chris Hemsworth plays a likable character, a tough ex-army and a mercenary on the outside and a depressive, suicidal alcoholic waiting to get off of his misery. The kid on the other hand is decent and sympathetic, they gelled together. Another interesting character to look out for is Saju played by Randeep, he is calm and poise in the beginning and would go to extremes to save his family. You feel for him and at times it's difficult to take sides between charactersThe impressive part of the movie is the location and imagery with dusty brown pallet backed with intense action sequences and the cultural diversity. Beautiful colors, ruthless drug mafia, Hindi rap songs and Dhaka families watching Bollywood movies amidst chaos.I think people shouldn't get so bent out of shape regarding the portrayal of the country and people in it. It's just a movie the same negativity arose when Slumdog Millionaire released, people were so upset regarding the portrayal of country and slums but it's just a movie and there's a lot to take from it to enjoy and get entertained.It's fun to watch and relax on a Friday evening, nothing much.",Extraction

The action film takes place over a two-day period, so how much plot can be developed? So yeah, the movie is action packed, and the plot does revolve around the action as much as 48 hours typically allow.Some of the action scenes are pretty amazing and original. New actors not typically seen on US screens also adds originality for the American viewers. And Chris Hemsworth has strong performance during the action scenes and while taking a pause now and then. Do miss his comic side, though.I think if you expect seeing an action flick, you will not be disappointed.

If you love story, slow paced, some inspirational backstory or even some cool ending then yeah this movie is not for you. I said this kinda resembles archer show because of the whole paid mercenary group trying to rescue and kill whoever gets in their way.

But in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.""Starts off with the usual action trope: at the end, and then cuts to a few days earlier. I didn't have much hope for the rest of the film. However, it surprised me. The film had jaw dropping action scenes, heartwarming moments, some funny scenes and when the films climax came about you were really in the moment with the main characters.The action scenes are masterfully done with some jaw dropping stunts and great fight scenes. The chase scenes are likewise amazingly done with the camera flitting from the main characters to the chasers, passersby, and others driving the chase forward in a unique way which was amazing to watch.Would have marked it a full 10/10 were it not for a few predictable moments which you saw coming a mile off and saddened me for the fact they'd still use movie plot devices like that knowing that we, the audience, have seen it time and time again and spoils the movie when you predict it yourself. Saying that, it balanced well with other scenes where it totally surprised you and left your mouth hanging open with awe.Overall, an amazing film which doesn't fail to keep you rooted to the edge of your seat.

There isn't a ton of story but those few moments had some real depth and were exceptionally well acted.

And how kids get pulled into a life of violence like berhad and that little kid, who keeps coming back after you spare him. That kid was funny. And that sewer scene, OMG, I hope that was a fake sewer made just for that scene.Also some things that I think were confusing:
In the beginning on the boat, Saji didn't have to kill the entire team and G. They were both on the same side. Lack of communication right there lol.
And portrayal of Dhaka maybe a bit exaggerated. Never been there but I don't think it's like that, it is the capital city of Bangladesh.P.S: Why you gotta do saju like that in the end xDTLDR:

The actionscenes are very good but only because they have been copied from movies such as John Wick and 1917.
The whole idea with the camera not stopping and doing scenes without cuts is very creative and would be good if it was new but it isn't.
The movie 1917 was build on this.
Another copi-scene is when Roja reloads his gun while holding down an enemy to kill him. This fighting scene was clearly taken from John Wick.
There are some other examples in the movie but these was the most obvious i found.
Other than that, the movies fighting scenes are great, but i don't think they fought of all these fighting moves by themselves.
Still fun to see John Wick scenes done by someone else.

For the love of action, genre watch it!!!. This movie has taken so much in account from John Wick which in my opinion which is the god of all the action movies. All those beautifully choreographed action sequences and long takes are just a treat for an eye. What this movie lacks is a story as it has the same clichéd story. But even after having this flaw, it is still a joy to watch with fantastic direction by Sam Hargrave. Even the acting by the cast is quite good with everyone playing their roles with proper conviction.

The movie is not interested in massive explosions and set pieces like Mission Impossible or the Fast and Furious franchises. One action scene in particular was amazing.

UNIVERSITY ROLL 13003419025If you are an action movie lover then this movie is for you. Extraction is a 2020 action thriller movie directed by Sam Hargrave starring Chris hemsworth, Rudraksh jaiswal and Randeep hooda. It involves a black ops mercenary who must rescue an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh. You can stream it if you have a Netflix Subscription. The movie has one of the best action scenes of recent memory and a very interesting plot twist quite early in the movie. PUBG lovers can relate to this movie as it has loads of street gunfight scenes. Chris Hemsworth definitely steals the show with stunning action scenes and dialogue deliveries.

In one-liner ""it's good for action lover and worth watching but can be spared"". It remains a one-man show from beginning to end.

Most of the scenes are filmed into crowded streets of Dhaka and comes out natural throughout the movie.Action:The action sequence is good and shot beautifully, don't know the technology but it feels you are in a game. Chase scenes are eye-catching, especially the tussle between Chris and Randip Hooda is a treat to watch. Both Chris and Randip did justice to their roles and executed actions perfectly and it seems real. However, some scenes from the army look incompetent, how come a country which is kept under complete lockdown not able to hunt a single person. Personally, I can't believe.Performance:Main screen time is taken by Chris and Randip, both did justice and acted in the character. Rudraksh portrayed the son's role elegantly. The Indian drug lord played by Pankaj Tripati but he hardly got 2 minutes on screen and Priyanshu Painyuli, Bangladesh's drug lord make a significant impact but he also doesn't have anything to do.",Extraction

Though it's a fiction, but it should have been cleared in the movie why all the government forces are openly helping a drug lord. This is not happen in Bangladesh. Here Army never deployed to road for any general issue. Also the way Asif dressed up , Bangladeshi people doesn't dress up like him..he looked like some kind of Prince from 18 century. About the visual effect, it was good. We know some area of Dhaka is dirty but the way you people represent it, It's no way near like this.

1433,iseven_009,A good example of cultural appropriation,2,24 April 2020,"The movie had no substance, only had fight scenes. The alleged kidnapping had no relation with what happens next; Chris Hemsworth's character could have been a deranged psychopath who kills law-enforcement officers for fun, and the movie would have remained the same. An apparently righteous hero cannot justify killing law enforcement officers who were probably just following orders. And those orders were justified too - especially after Chris Hemsworth's character killed dozens of uniforms.The trailer said it was a fight between two drug lords. We never see any of the alleged drug lords to be involved in any drug business. None of the drug lords command a big army of their own.The drug lord of Bangladesh was not believable in his role, not sure if he was a bad actor, or he simply could not pull off a foreign language.Next, there is the issue of the Dhaka city. Except for some aerial footage, none of the scenes were from Dhaka. They portrayed a city in some dirt poor country, war-ridden African country - and Dhaka did not fit the bill.Also, the movie does not show anything quintessential Dhaka - if they claimed to be taking place in Colombo, Kathmandu, or any other city - they would have to change only a few props. Moreover, no actors spoke in any Bangladeshi accent. In fact, it was obvious they were all from the Indian state of Bengal. This is why directors should not use a cultural reference without understanding it. The saddest part was, they could have hired one or two actors and screenwriters from Bangladesh, and do this better.However, no amount of cultural course correction could have made the movie better. This was the very definition of a cliche movie - which was probably fine as long as the movie did not claim to be something bigger than that. In the end, I did not even remember the name of Chris Hemsworth's character, nor the name of David Harbour's character, and I never cared for any of them.Netflix should make better investments in the future!PS: if finding Bangladeshi actors were that difficult, then they should have flipped the story. The Indian drug lord could have kidnapped Bangladeshi drug lord's son.",Extraction

During the first few Hours he spends with the boy, his mine is suddenly changed and he is willing to sacrifice his life for the boy, without getting the money.The plot itself is as basic as it gets. Go get a kidnapped boy and extract him. The main character does so by initiating a co-op with the man who just tried to kill him. The plan is as basic and stupid as it gets, ending up with two guys killing the whole police force of Dhaka.The final scene really destroys all hope for this movie. The main character survivies multiple gun shots (one of them penetrating his throat) and falls off a bridge in the middele of Dhaka, where the whole city is out to kill him. He magically recovers, somehow escapes the city, only to go to India and Watch the Indian boy take a swim.

1483,Saminislam,Rambo in 2020! Netflix Edition.,7,25 April 2020,"Mild SPOILER ALERT!This is your average hollywood action movie. A guy is hired to rescue a hostage and deliver him to safety but faces hardels after hardels which leads to a big blow off and explosions in the end. So, if you have watched action movies before then this ticks all the boxes. The ""hero"" is a mean killing machine, good in fist fights and knife fights, has the ass kicking persona built in. But unlike your typical movie he doesn't have a cool one line that you can quote, never comes face to face with his antagonist and doesn't rides on into the sunset with a harley davidson.As i said if ticks all the action movie signature moves. It has good action sequences, good cinematography and a simple plot. The focal point of the story is set to be in Dhaka, Bangladesh but due to filming restriction shooting was done Ahmedabad, India. But even with that restriction the locations resembles Keraniganj, Kaliganj, Basila which are three towns across the Dhaka City across the Buriganga River. I think the direction deliberately meant this as in the big blow off scene in the end is set on a bridge on top of a river (hint at Buriganga and Babubazar Bridge). So A for effort. The acting was good too.What is a disappointment (if you are a Bangladeshi) in the movie is the portrayal of the local armed forces. Yes, there are plenty of corrupt Police, RAB (branded Elite in the movie/the guys in black) who work under several political leaders and but involving the Army in the end (i think the direction meant to show the paramilitary force Anser who are always under the Police but got the color schemes wrong and turned them into the Army) is too ridiculous. Two men shooting their way past all of these forces is a bit too much even for action movies as we are not in the 80s anymore.Another down downfall on the movie is the Bangla accent. The language of Bangladesh is correct but the accent is far off. In the beginning it seems everybody speaks Bangla like All British Born Bangladeshis but in the end the accent takes a sharp turn and turns into West Bengal accent. If you are someone from any other country you wouldn't mind, but to us it's a bit cringe.So, taking everything into consideration
a) was this movie enjoyable? - YES

c) could it have been better? - YesOverall grade: B",Extraction

But let's just assume that it is a fictional Dhaka. Let's talk about the actual film.
The script is so poor, the movie was going to no where. Character development is so bad. We don't see anything that would help us to connect to the main character throughout the movie. The direction is soo bad (Except for the action scenes)
Director used the camera as mere capturing device. Even in an emotional scene, there was no camera work that would be visual storytelling.
Chris Hemsworth acting was so bad in this movie. He just had one or two expressions, and he carried them all along. No effort.
But kudos for the character played by Randeep Hooda. His character was better written than others and he acted so well. Way better than Chris.

1490,mange-168-696178,1 child's life is worth more than 200 adults,3,10 August 2021,"Movies like this really grind my gears.The plot makes zero sense.One bad guy is in prison and have had all his assets frozen = have no money.Another bad guy (who's not in prison and have money, power and the full force of the military and law enforcement in his pocket) kidnaps the first bad guy's (who has no money) son because.... what? To get money from the poor bad guy who's in prison? How did they expect that to work?The poor bad guy threatens his associate (from prison, while being broke) who's not in prison to save his son. Who's still working for the poor bad guy? Why are they working for the poor bad guy? It's not like he can pay anyone.So the associate decides to call in an extraction team to save the son but stiffs them on their payment, taking half the extraction team out instead.Then he comes after the protagonist (Hemsworth) to take the son from him. It's never really clear if the associate is trying to save or kill the kid since he keeps shooting at the car where both Hemsworth and the kid is in. But then all of the sudden, he agrees to help Hemsworth to get the kid out of the city? A very inconsistent flip there.But the thing that really annoys me with movies like this is that they basically kill 200+ service men/women (military and law enforcement) to save ONE kid. Yes, the police chief was in the second bad guys pocket, but that doesn't mean that all his service personnel (the 200+ people that actually died) was. They were probably just following orders, trying to catch an American mad man who's running around killing people all over for no apparent reason.The story deserves a minus score. I gave it 3 because the production value was high and the acting (it wasn't that much acting though) was fair and fine. The story was simply too dumb for me to give it higher than a 3.I'm just so tired of movies where the protagonist runs around and kills innocent people while they expect you to root for them. It's like the old cop movies where they run around in crowded cities, shooting their guns around or having car chases in 200mph through busy business streets, risking hundreds of innocent peoples lives.",Extraction

1521,winsor-30098,"Action becomes boringly routine, no plot, unfair to Bangladesh",1,30 April 2020,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured a Chris Hemsworth action pic would provide a couple hours of diverting of pulp entertainment.
Where did it go wrong for me?
The action scenes were well choreographed with lots of fiery explosions, chases & hand to hand combat etc, but about half way through the film it got to the point where it became cartoonish & mechanical. The swarms of bad guys were inept & couldn't shoot straight to the point where it was hard to believe our hero was in any real danger, whatever the odds. It all became very predicable & mind numbing.
The plot is weak, even for pulp. The story revolves around a kidnapping, the reason for which is never really established. Hemsworths character is a walking ""mercenary with a painful past"" cliché. The quiet, intimate scenes meant to show his humanity are painfully, awkwardly done, as unbelievable as the overdone action sequences and feel like pro forma filler. Too many unbelievable coincidences. Very senseless & disjointed.
Having said all that, I might have given this film a ""5"" as an action pic if it wasn't for its arbitrary and misleading setting in Bangladesh. As I watched the film I kept thinking that the portrayal of the of city Dhaka is very harsh. Criminals controlling the army & police, a dirty, filthy city, gangs roaming the streets, including kids with AKs - basically Somalia at its worst. And wondered why would Bangladesh allow a film to be shot in Dhaka when it portrays it in such a negative light?
Well, the answer I soon learned is that this film was written, produced and shot in India by Indians and there are no Bengalis at all in the cast. Now there's no reason the plot couldn't have been set in a city in India, other than of course the Indian producers didn't want one of their own cities to be shown as dirty, dangerous, violent, lawless and corrupt. So they moved the whole thing next door to Bangladesh. Never mind that there's no objective evidence that Dhaka is anything like it's portrayed in the film, or for that matter, any worse than cities in India. Just dump the whole dirty, lawless mess on the people across the border.
I have to wonder if the fact that India now has a Hindu nationalist led government and Bangladesh is 90% Muslim played a factor in all this too.
Thumbs down on Netflix and Chris Hemsworth for their association with this tainted picture.

The plot looked to me as though it was 1960 or something like that. They couldn't have made Dhaka look dirtier. Needless to mention how ridiculous Bangla accent was. I couldn't even differentiate whether the actors were speaking Bangla or Hindi because their accent was pretty much same.",Extraction
1529,akskshay,Another action movie lost its plot..!!,7,2 May 2020,"Sometimes the smallest detail can trip up your experience of a movie. Forty minutes into Extraction, Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) and Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) are dodging gunmen in a Dhaka building. They break into an apartment, and the famous intro to Didi Tera Dewar Deewana plays. They alight a floor, 10 seconds pass. Then, from another apartment, we hear snatches of Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna. What are the chances that two instantly recognisable songs from two of the most famous Hindi films of the '90s are playing at the same time in present-day Dhaka? If this were set in the US, an equivalent scene would be Tyler rushing past one apartment as Rick says ""Here's looking at you, kid"" and another as Kane says ""Rosebud"". Not impossible, but unlikely.
Tyler does get Ovi out, but his escape from Dhaka is ruined by Saju's double-cross and the local police closing all exits at the behest of Amir. The film's big setpiece is a very long one-take sequence in which Tyler kills his way from the streets into a building and out again, a terrified Ovi boy tagging behind. Zero-cut extended action is no longer a novelty for moviegoers, but it's still an impressive trick if handled with some wit and variation. Tyler's bloody progress, though impressively choreographed, becomes somewhat monotonous - he moves and executes his kills like a soldier, all precision and no personality.
Its action may not spark much joy but when Extraction settles down for a quiet moment, that's when you're in real trouble. Not content with giving Tyler a formulaic tough guy backstory - his life falls apart after his six-year-old dies of cancer - the film also makes rich, unhappy Ovi, unloved by his own dad, the perfect candidate for a father figure. ""He thinks of me...more like a thing than a person,"" he says, unburdening to a complete stranger who just killed several dozen people and hit the one person he knows with a truck. Later, Ovi tells Tyler, ""You drown not by falling into the river but by staying submerged in it"", because that's how Hollywood thinks 14-year-olds in India talk.
Extraction is written by Joe Russo, and is produced and based on a story by him and his brother, Anthony, co-directors of four Marvel films. The source material, a graphic novel, is set in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay - the film simply swaps one third world country for another, as American movies tend to do. It's disappointing that the Russos, coming off the success of the last two Avengers films, would choose to put their weight behind yet another attempt to turn white protagonists going on a killing spree in foreign lands into some form of soul-searching. Tyler is treated like a gentle soul in torment, despite his frequent reminders that he is a killer for hire.
The film doesn't have any interest in Dhaka - it could be any dirty, corrupt city where Bangla (and some Hindi) is spoken. The one local character of note - Amir - is translated for Western audiences as the Pablo Escobar of his city. Extraction is by no means a realistic film, but it is set in the real world, which means the Russos can't fall back on comic mythos or easy utopias like Wakanda to explain its blinkered politics. Its white characters, also gathered in a poor country with the express purpose of killing its citizens, probably think of themselves as heroes too.",Extraction

1581,cags-22839,"Joe Russo, stick with Marvel.",3,26 April 2020,"Joe Russo should stick to Marvel films with his brother, because Extraction is one mess of a script. It also doesn't help that his stunt coordinator for his Marvel films directed this movie. Extraction yells mediocrity from beginning to end.Chris Hemsworth is called to rescue the son of a Hindu drug lord in Dhaka. The plot is simple enough, but OOPS, it lacks foresight, character development, and anything resembling logic. It's obvious Russo wrote this script while his mind was on Avengers, because the story is so surface level and dull that nothing feels salvageable. This is because the film moves so quickly to get to Dhaka and the action scenes that there's no time to develop character.Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary who's ONLY character trait is that he misses his dead son. THAT'S IT! Beyond that, he's just a soulless automaton. The man who kidnaps the boy has no character outside of ""I'm the villain, therefore I kidnap kids and kill them"" and THAT'S IT. The boy, named Ovi, has no trait other than ""My father treats me like a thing"" and THAT'S IT. All the main characters have little to no character so I couldn't care about them. The secondary characters have more going for them!The filmmaking and editing are by-the-books bland. Other than the typical shaky cam and odd angled action shots, there's a random LONG take shot that comes outta nowhere and just took me out of the movie. It's so out of place from the rest of the movie-plus it totally doesn't help the action scenes one bit-that I felt the director ONLY did it because he wanted to show off and be like ""HEY, I CAN SHOOT A LONG SHOT ACTION TAKE TOO!"" I hate using this word-because it's often overused and misused-but it came off as utterly pretentious and unnecessary.Extraction is ONLY getting praise for the action scenes, which I find to be very disconcerting. Like I said, the action scenes aren't anything special. I've heard some people call it the John Wick of mercenary films?? ehhhhh, no. John Wick at least has character and is campy enough to have fun watching. This film is just a mediocre, poorly thought out, sad waste of time and Chris Hemsworth. If you want to watch a really good mercenary type film on Netflix-in the same vein of Extraction-watch Triple Frontier.",Extraction

You shouldn't be looking for a deep, fascinating story that makes you think about the wider world, take this movie for what it is.
The well choreographed sequences remind me of the John Wick style of brutally over the top and yet grounded and human, especially the 11 minute one shot and the final scene on the bridge. This movie tries different things, in terms of the suicidal element of our protagonist, and the streamlined plot which contains an interesting half way point with David Harbours character.
I would say this movie suffers from undeveloped characters, including Harbours, Farahinis and the boy with the scar. I didn't understand if Farahini was a love interest or just a close relationship, either way it wasn't expanded upon. The boy with the scar isn't interesting enough to be the person who kills Tyler, and as a viewer it did nothing for me, as Tyler seemed very content with dying, he had accomplished the mission and I'm assuming he comes back to life in the final shot.

There are so many plot holes you'll be able to notice right from the beginning of the movie. Major scenes fail to explain the proper reason behind them. Introduction of unnecessary characters in between hinting the producer's need of making a two hour movie.
The action sequences are outstanding, it actually felt that you are a part of the scenes. ( credits director)
The action director has gained all stars and the scriptwriters have lost it all.
Pankaj tripaathi role is too short for his calibre. The abilities of randeep hooda shown in the movie questions the whole existence of Chris Hemsworth in the movie.

-Wrong Insignia in law enforcement uniform
-Wrong portrayal of Dhaka city streets
-Wrong portrayal of Bangladeshi characters ( We are not having a famine)
-Desperate attempts to make Dhaka look like Kabul / Mogadishu
-Completely ignoring Urban & actual Dhaka
-People listening to Hindi songs during noon & sitting duck
( Understandable since the filming took place in Ahmedabad and not actual Dhaka)
-Open food and fish market in the middle of the street; blocking everything
-Desperate attempts to make the streets look like post world war BerlinThings I'm not okay with:-No, kids are not carrying AK47 here for any reasons.
-In the history of Bangladesh we have never had such a drug lord or companion
-Not showing anything from actual Dhaka was the biggest mistake, urban Dhaka is nice, structured & progressive, not anything like what was shown in the movie.
-Employing no adviser from Bangladesh's actual law enforcement agencies or military
-Potentially impacting a bad effect on Bangladesh's tourism industry as many in the west will actually believe this fictional Dhaka.

Extraction is centered on rescuing Ovi, the son of an Indian Druglord who has been kidnapped by a Bangladeshi Drug lord Amir Asif.
This movie predominantly shows the rivalry between the 2 drug lords.
Pankaj Tripathi has about a 30-second role in the film, where he is seen in a jail instructing Saju, his accomplice to rescue his son Ovi from Dhaka or risk his own son's life.
Now Saju has accepted this precarious task unwillingly to save his family but he knows it won't be easy to get Ovi back from Dhaka, it would be like one Man v/s a Country.
He knows someone who can help accomplish this task on his behalf, Tyler, a black market mercenary. Tyler easily accepts this task and sets out to accomplish this mission backed by his team member, Niz.
The film starts with the climax scene where Tyler is shot, making us wonder whether the movie would live up to the hype and expectation.
The moment Tyler reaches Dhaka, Bang Bang, the action starts, the hand to hand combats, Knife fights, guns, bazookas, bombs, helicopters, sniper. Tyler has all the firepower one man would ever need to fight a country.
There are some emotional moments in the movie. amid Ovi's rescue mission when he tries to look back at his life, he realizes his father treated him like a possession more than his son and in this process ends up knowing Tyler's story where he learns about his 6yr old son who is no more. There is a certain bond that develops between Ovi and Tyler.
The USP of this film is action, action and nothing but action and is so well directed that it is difficult to comprehend this is Sam Hargrave's directorial debut. Sam Hargrave is a stunt coordinator at Marvel Universe and it comes as no surprise that he strapped himself around the car with a camera and said action. The scenes between Tyler and Saju are a treat to watch. A scene where Tyler and Saju fall from the balcony straight on to the road and the way the camera follows them will keep the audience gasping for breath.All in all, this movie is a treat for action junkies, it will surprise you with stunts u would have never seen before, the fights look very real and is very fast paced.
Extraction is based on a book called Cuidad.
The film's working title was initially Dhaka but was changed to Out of the Fire and finally, the makers settled for Extraction.

1668,abhihitian,A PURE ACTION SEQUENCE,9,6 May 2020,"Extraction has a very short story which can be expressed in a line: a young boy is kidnapped; a mercenary is sent out to rescue him.
That boy is Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a jailed Indian drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi). The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word ""Proman Dao"").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.",Extraction

The fight scenes are choreographed beautifully with excellent cinematography. The chemistry between Tyler Rake and the druglord's son, Ovi Mahajan, is great. The two work so well together for this film. While this may have a stereotypical plot, that doesn't reduce my enjoyment of it.

The cops are just trying to follow orders. Sure they are working for a corrupt police chief who is in turn working for an awful drug kingpin but they are just doing their job. So our ""hero"" is gunning down cop after cop in a John Wickesque fashion. It definitely takes something away from the enjoyment of the film.",Extraction

1688,kejegoc,Too many plot holes,1,20 September 2021,"The movie started really well, and I like Chris as an actor. I thought it was an interesting setting with a decent plot (for this kind of movies).However, the movie fell apart when Chris' actions started to make no sense at all. His moral compass is so out of whack that the whole movie becomes unbelievable, like he acts only to justify action scenes.I don't think I'm nitpicking: to enjoy a movie I need believable characters that act rationally, or at least according to their own logic. So let's see:1) Chris ""takes pity"" of a kid with an AK that is trying to kill him. He doesn't see him as a threat at all, as the kid is fumbling with the weapon pointed at him. I guess he didn't watch Lord of War and he doesn't know that a bullet from a 14 years old is as effective as the bullet from a 40 years old.2) Then, he's attacked by a gang of drug dealers/criminals, which are teenagers. Because they are teenagers (I assume) again Chris refuses to hurt them even after they are repeatedly trying to kill him. Well Chris, if these criminals that you spared then kill some innocent person as part of their criminal activities, that's on you.3) You might be thinking that Chris is a peaceful mercenary that has a code against killing, like Batman. However, there's a long scene in which he massacres scores of...cops. That's right. Cops. Not corrupted cops, I mean regular cops part of a SWAT team that are trying to apprehend what they know is a dangerous armed criminal. Don't these cops have families? Don't their lives matter? Why is Chris sparing criminals but killing cops just trying to do their job? Oh, to try to hide this double standard the director thought of covering the cops' faces. Cheap.4) Then, he decides to become best buddies with another character, for the sole reason that this other character was trying to rescue the same kid. The problem? This character is a mercenary who just killed Chris's team. So apparently Chris doesn't mind that this guy has just murdered his companions. They don't have any character development (probably on purpose) but still, you'd expect Chris to want revenge for his companions, not to start working together with this guy.5) And the biggest of all: Chris decides to throw his life away for this kid, whom he just met. That's ridiculous. Because Chris has lost a child (because, of course he has), then he becomes so emotionally attached to a random kid (who doesn't look like him) after speaking with him for a few hours? That is absurd. Are children interchangeable now?Wow, Chris, do you know that adoption is a thing?In summary, it ruins the movie when the protagonist does irrational things only to do what the plot needs to make action scenes.",Extraction

Now, why this movie??Because, it's Russo Brothers met Chris Hemsworth met Randeep Hooda met A little bit of Pankaj Tripathi met some of our very own talented Indians met Mumbai met frequent use of Bengali Slangs met unbelievable action met Netflix..It's like a whole dream package for a Indian Nerdy movie buff, on paper..Yes, on paper because some times, the theories on paper fail to reflect entirely in practicals..This film is no doubt, 'The' film with the most intense action sequences ever made in recent history and mark my words, Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth delivers the best ever performance till date mixing it with raw action and dark emotion but some how it feels like the 'Story' could have been 'a bit more', a little bit more..I accept that it's an out and out no brainer action movie but I really feel that the character development could have been better..And Also a quick observation, why Indian Hindi music were buzzing all around the houses of Bangladesh? It calls for a question on authenticity, right?? I myself, an Indian, don't think that Bangladeshis listen to Hindi Music that much..!Nevertheless, it doesn't take away the fact that the Indian Angry man Randeep Hooda fought exceptionally well to take his role at per with Hemsworth..
In parts, it felt like this film is targeted to the Indian audiences, it's like the producers knew what could trigger us to like and watch this film..hat's off Russo Bros and debutant director Sam Hargreaves for this fantantic marketing strategy..
Nothing more to say but I guess this film with it's 'ifs' and 'buts' delivers a popcorn and relaxing treat in these tough times and Kudos to the creators for that..And Special mention must be the precious Bengali spoken by Chris Hemsworth i.e. ''Proman Dao'' ( Show me the proof)..That was shockingly hilarious..!!",Extraction

But at the end of the day, unlike me, most people don't really know much about Dhaka. It's quite unfortunate that with the massive presence that Netflix has coupled with the relatively low fame of Dhaka city will cause people to assume this is what Dhaka is.I'm truly sorry for the production team, cast and all others who put their hearts and souls into this movie for the backlash you're about to face. I simply don't understand why they had to use a name of a city which has no relevance with what was shown. Couldn't you have just gone with a fictional name?It's movies like this that'll cause people to ask me how I'm still alive or so civilized with the assumption that I live in some war zone.

The camera work is a little disorienting at times, it does make you feel very close to the action but the constant tilting and movement gets annoying quickly. Also the story is sort of OK, the motivations of the bengali drug dealer aren't very fleshed out, and Chris Hemsmworths characters follows played out tropes of a soldier thats lost it all and finds his salvation in rescuing the kid.

1732,oritroahmed,Action Packed but Completely missed the Environment of Dhaka,5,24 April 2020,"The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed.

I also liked the part of Randeep Hooda.But, attention to details were way off the track. The whole set looks nothing like Dhaka except for few drone shots. I wouldn't mind if the plot wasn't revolved around Dhaka. The whole story was about rescuing a boy from a gangster based in Dhaka. So the movie should've felt like it's happening in Dhaka. The Bengali accent was inaccurate, the accent used in this movie is from West Bengal, India not from Bangladesh. Child terrorism was never a thing in Bangladesh but the movie clearly emphasized on it. The roads, police, vehicles, locations, buildings, and even the commonly used Bengali fonts on banners and posters are from West Bengal. So this is not nearly an accurate depiction of Dhaka. A slight mismatch would be considerable but this is completely messed up!However, only the people from Bangladesh will feel this way. Everyone else will love this movie.

Also, so many elements and details regarding Dhaka was this much incorrect that psychologically people who know Dhaka couldn't like it.

The weird Bangla accent is anything but Bangladeshi or 'Dhakaiya' Bangla. An ensemble of strange looking cast, who neither look like or talk like people of Dhaka, is another weak work.Writers/producers of this movie should acclimatize themselves with the location where their movies are based. Come and stay physically or get on to the Internet to find movies/dramas of the original location. And by the way, Dhaka has never seen anything even remotely close to the magnitude of violence that has been depicted.

I thought, even for a fiction flick of this nature, there was depth, intelligence and outstanding performances from Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda. The action sequences were incredible, for lack of a better word and the story line is quite believable considering the real world.For me, watching a great movie means that I have to be drawn to it from beginning to end. I went into the film with a lot of expectation considering the likes of 13 Hours and Lone Survivor.

1808,andreiserban01,"Great Action scenes, poor story",4,26 April 2020,"I'll start my review by saying that I love Chris Hemsworth since I am a huge Marvel fan. Also English is not my first language so I'd like to apologize about any of the possible mistakez, whoops, there's one! Joking.The fast-paced action scenes, the trembling camera work, alongside the exciting score, all excelled by giving me anxiety, extreme sensations and a huge portion of adrenalin.
Hence bravo to the director by delivering us maybe the best Action performance I've seen in a while! But the other problems just drag the movie down, unfortunately, and here they are:1. The story is just so poorly and full of cliché that since the beggining I had this sensation of deja-vu. An ex-soldier, Tyler, who is now a mercenary, full of psychological burden, accepts any mission he receives, even though his life might be in danger. This one is an extraction of a Bengali kidnapped boy, Ovi, whose father is an imprisoned drug lord. Think you've seen this one already, don't you? And not to forget Tyler Rake, who literally kills a bad guy with a rake(and who in the name of God keeps a rake in his 7th floor apartment, oh, oh, I think I know this one!). Not to mention the other 150 bad guys he just smashes, and not one of them is smart enough to think of a smart plan to take him down. Nooo, sir! They were like: ""I think I really wanna get shot today, yeah.. Maybe even die, we'll see"".2. I'm pretty sure that there are also beautiful parts in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, except from the penurious, miserable areas we are constantly shown. Where are my Bengali people, we stand by you guys!
But of course, we already got used to this poorly vision American producers have about Asian/African/ or even some European states. See also the bright side of life, dear Americans, as the Pythons would say!3. The Poor Character Development, a MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ME.
Was I supposed to care about Saju(the South-Asian-Pablo-Escobar's right hand), who died to protect Ovi, and in the same time his family? Because I didnt't. At all! I simply didn't care when he died.
That Indian girl whose ancestors I'm 100% sure are the Amazons from mythological Greece. Also, didn't see her use in the story, just because she's so badass that she blows up a helicopter with an RPG, or because she is such an effective sniper, but not before Saju and our hero, Tyler, gets shot, I'm supposed to give her a big round of applause? Nope, I don't buy it, sorry!
And our dear boy, Tyler. Gosh I love Chris Hemsworth. I keep waiting for the movie in which he will be able to show the world his acting skills. Surely this is not the one, but actually he did pretty well. But I didn't care about his missing wife, didn't care about his dead child, and obviously didn't care about the moment - which is supposed to give us some acknowledge about who they are as persons, it fails - he and Ovi have in Tyler's friend's house, Gaspar(i guess??), who, as a matter of fact, is ready to betray his dear friend(who saved his life in the past) for a bunch of dollars. And, you guessed, our professional mercenary, who not long ago in the movie, said that he only want his money, now is ready to save Ovi for nothing!(seen this one already, stop the cliches!!!!) they fight and at the last Ovi shoots him. Later on, that little boy has no remorse for shoting and killing a man.
For me, the death of Tyler only made me sigh by the love I care for Chris, and the melodramatic score(personal sensibility), but that's it. Not even the little kind of totem of underwater meditation Joe Russo gave us, that our hero is doing when we first met him, and wants to do it before he dies. Not only the last scene where Ovi is doing the same thing in a pool, and after he returns to the surface, we see in the backround a foggy appearence of Tyler, which gives us a little hope. Rub your eyes kid, you're deluding yourself.To finish this, overall this is a good action piece, really, even though it is sometimes a little improbable, but what isn't in this World. Sam Hargrave handled the alert rythm very healthy. Joe Russo, though, maybe it is better for him, and especially for us, to keep directing superheroes and leave the writing behind, for now.",Extraction

The unusual bangla pronunciation is the most unfortunate thing here besides wrong bangla fonts & spellings everywhere in the shooting set, wrong uniforms & in fact one guy wore a uniform with 3 different force name in it.

The living standards and that creepy accent is from the west bengal. At least they could hire some real Bangladeshi actors so there would be 'some' who would say proper Bengali.
Other than that, the portrayal of forces protecting the drug lord is hilarious. I know a lot of people is saying, it's just a movie. But still, you should at least do some research before making a damn movie. Why on earth the military of Bangladesh would work for a drug dealer. If they could explain it better, like the the guy was some high profile politician and the military and RAB was tricked into working for him, well they failed at that too. So all in all, I would say, it's a disaster.",Extraction

1827,muntasir-31283,Honest review of Extraction: Russo Brothers do everything right except the Bangla,5,25 April 2020,"Extraction.Some Indian actors completely butchered the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they are from West Bengal
As Covid-19 lockdown continues in Bangladesh, every film lovers' eyes were on Netflix this Friday as they dropped their latest original film Extraction starring Hollywood superstar Chris Hemsworth. The whole country was eagerly waiting for the action-packed film since the Thor famed actor shared images from the shoot on the set of the film on his official Facebook page in November, 2018.The backdropAmerican action thriller Extraction, previously titled Dhaka, was greenlit back in 2017 by Netflix and is the directorial debut of famous Hollywood stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. His titles include Hunger Games and several action films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The screenplay was written by Joe Russo, based on the comic book Cuidad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman.The film is a co-production between Avengers: Infinity War (2018) directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's (commonly known as Russo brothers) independent production company AGBO and Netflix. The lead cast Hemsworth is also one of the producers in the project.The film was mainly shot in India's Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018 and some shots were taken in Thailand and Dhaka, Bangladesh.The film's production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018.The plotTyler Rake, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a fearless black-market mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi, played by Rudraksh Jaiswal, the kidnapped son of an imprisoned Indian crime lord. The kidnapping was done by a Dhaka based international drug lord which pushes Tyler into a deadly and almost impossible mission to Dhaka to save Ovi from the drug lord and his massive force of goons and bribed law enforcement members.The rightsExtraction takes its audience from Dhaka to Mumbai to Australia and back, giving us a picture of the interconnected drug traffic ring in South Asia. The two-hour-long film is dark and raw from start to end and every action film lover's dream.Not even a single action sequence of the film was ever exactly shot in Bangladesh except some plate shots for establishment, including the iconic action sequence at Sultana Kamal bridge near Demra.Chris Hemsworth never set foot in Dhaka yet the audience felt he was blazing his guns around Old Dhaka. All of the shots were taken in Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Hats off to the production design team behind the project who had done an excellent job of recreating Old Dhaka in Ahmedabad with such attention to details from the vehicles, to posters in streets, to every single sign board of each shop in each sequence.Russo brothers and Hargrave visited Dhaka couple of times but as Dhaka is not a very production friendly city, they just shot some establishment shots.As the director and producers of the project are the masterminds behind the Avengers franchise, not a single action sequence will let the audience down.
The long yet fast paced follow shots during the action sequences are a treat to experience.Hemsworth gave his absolute best playing the role of a hired black-market mercenary.The wrongsExcept for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.ConclusionThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.

Sure, we have seen this before.The amount of violence is very high, and the kill ratios are reminiscent more of a first person shooter than a real combat situation (the opponents always wait to fire, and patiently take head shots), but that is not in itself different from any other Western action flick. Those who remember Arnie mow down dozens in Commando without changing his clip will hardly find cause to complain.Bangladeshi viewers who find this movie's depiction of Bangla armed forces as corruptible have a cause to feel aggrieved. But seriously, after decades of Western cops shown as bent in cinema, it is fine if the reality of other countries makes its way into fiction? And principal photography was done in Western India, a vastly different visual space. It is not meant to be a realistic depiction of Dhaka. The traffic snarls and nearly impossible road situations are spot-on for Dhaka, as well as the people who stand and gawp at the action (speaking as a South Asian)..Chris Hemsworth keeps the emoting light and is effective in the role he essays here. Not much more was asked of him. He is believable as a man with a deathwish who wants to go out doing one last right thing. Strong international debut for Indian action star Randeep Hooda. I think he can expect more in the future. Not sure what the people asking for a plot really think they deserve, but the amount that there was - was sufficient for me.",Extraction

The camera developing shots where amazing and Newton Thomas Sigwa and his team killed it
3. The lighting is amazing,it was cinematic and soft,my favorite scene was the scene where Tyler rake and Ovi mahajan were having the conversation In the room,that lighting is the best in have seen in recent times,I just want to kiss the lighting team.4.

The editing and color grading was so nice,I felt the emotion in every frame.6.

Bangladesh film industry has much better actors for the villain's role, at least 1000 times better than the chick shown in the film who could've easily easily helped the director to portray a 'Dhakaiya drug king'Roads, Dusts, Slums are from Kolkata and Kolkata suits best for all those, directors could have easily used Kolkata as it naturally goes with the movie.Most importantly, Dhaka's elite forces (Police, RAB, Army follows the command of a Drug king 😀😂😂😂)
What a Joke...!! Could've easily used thousand random gang members of the drug dealer in place of those uniformed clowns who actually resembles national defence of a country.What was the point of highlighting and developing plot surrounding Dhaka and Bangladesh where almost nothing matched exactly.Tyler and co. went all in for just money, rescued, came to know that they were played & won't get paid, his dead son comes in mind and rescues for the humanity 👏
When his own son died, his humanity didn't rise, he escaped so that he doesn't need to watch his son dying in-front of him. So, getting the air of Dhaka he became a good 'mercenary'?

However Netflix always seems to fall short on the most important part of any film, the plot. Not that the concept isn't interesting but on execution, as with all Netflix films, there is more that could've been done.The films main failure for me was the CGI, it really took me out of the film at points, the main example when the truck flips and is engulfed in flame. The phyiscs simulation is off and the fire effects are lacking quality, also at other points in the film with smoke being used to signal where things are taking place, there is a blatant lack of blending with environment so it just sticks out against a very yellow colour palette.Not to say this film isn't enjoyable, there are some amusing moments where the film takes a step back from the seriousness it tries to convey and allows a chuckle here and there.I will conclude by saying there were also some cool camera transitions but something more couldve been done in the edit trying to hide some cuts as they were fairly blatant even on a first watch.",Extraction

1970,tonystark-22944,Wow what a worst way they represented Bangladesh,3,2 October 2021,Amir Asif what a trash charecter. As a Bangladeshi i will definitely say it was the biggest wrong decision of Russo brothers in their entire life. Reason Bangladeshi drug lord can't say Bengali accent properly (mainly Bangladeshi accent). Isn't that funny? And other Bangladeshi characters saying Kolkata accent. I mean why? No problem with any characters face they all look like Bangladeshi the problem is accent. Before release i was very happy because watching Bangladesh in a Hollywood film was a proud moment but after watching the film i was very disappointed and as a Bangladeshi i couldn't connect myself with this film and for me its a very average movie. 3 out of 10. Lets see what happened in the sequel. Hope it will be better than this one.,Extraction

All the Americans of NY speak English in Indian accent. There was a civil war and famine throughout 2010 to 2019 and the movie plot is in 2020. All the buses and trucks are indian made. There, child of a the top mafia lord of Mexico is abducted, but the mafia lord is in jail, and hasn't enough money to pay to a mercenary to rescue his child?! In-spite of that, his man contact with one of the best mercenary with his team and they agree to do the ""Extraction"" of the boy, without knowing if they would be paid or not! Then the mercenary fights with gang members, police, swats and army and kills everyone of them, except child gang members on his way. Now, you got a Russo Brother and Chris Hemsworth Film.
Really?! I mean, seriously?! This is how much bankrupt Hollywood is now a days? This could be a typical 2nd or 3rd class movie of DHALLYWOOD!
The film name was DHAKA, at a time. Guess, it might be a publicity stunt for Netflix.
Only good thing about the movie is its combat fight scenes(Yeah, pass mark, but not A+ grade. You have to have a powerful opponent to get A+ in combat fight scenes. One man show in combats is old school). And if the city name was different, like imaginary one, this movie would easily get a 5*, although it has no story. You can't just show some potatoes and call it Apple. Either you call a potato a potato, or you show apple, if you wanna tell about apples.
Such a waste of time!",Extraction

1975,krishnaagrawal-85967,"Solid action, weak plot - one time watch",6,12 May 2020,"Extraction is a strictly one time watch Action-packed film with a lot of entertainment quotient like Hand to Hand combat scenes, Gun fight sequences, Chasing sequences to give you a much required good time in this Lockdown Season. However, the plot of the film is very basic and remains one - dimentional throughout its duration but the film still manages to hold your attention quite well.
The story of the film revolves around the son of India's biggest drug dealer who has been abducted by the gang of the drug lord of Bangladesh as they are not on good terms. A mercenary named Tyler(@Chris Hemsworth) has been hired to safely bring him back home. Beside the basic plot, there is hardly anything which gives the depth or twist to the story. Also @JoeRusso's writing has some flaws as the film gives less space for character development. Film has some loose ends and a very outdated portrayal of Bangladesh by showing weak Military, inexpert Special Forces and child terrorism to justify action sequences.
The screenplay is full of hardcore & mindblowing action sequences and you can see lots of violence happening throughout the movie. The combat scenes are brilliantly choreographed and the climax sequence is a major takeaway.
@ChrisHemsworth is in his top form and delivers with such an ease. @RandeepHooda as Saju is equally good and it's a delight to watch him in a never seen before avatar performing such high octane action sequences and all other starcasts have also delivered decent performances.
Background music works well. The cinematography is amazing. The camera work, one-take-shots are seriously fantastic.

The way Chirs Hemsworth portrayed his emotions, and a huge round of applause to Rudhraksh Jaiswal and Randeep Hooda the way they blended so naturally into every scene just made it a great masterpiece.

The way Chirs Hemsworth portrayed his emotions, and a huge round of applause to Rudhraksh Jaiswal and Randeep Hooda the way they blended so naturally into every scene just made it a great masterpiece.
This movie set a new benchmark of you can captivate the audience completely, congratulations Sam Hargrave, instead of naming a school after you in the movie, you should actually open one to teach the upcoming generation about this master class direction.

I'm not specifying the scene because of spoiling.Another perspective is that the film is shot in India but makes it to pretend as Dhaka. The environment is not such in Dhaka, you are using hindi songs in houses which aren't a good example, Bangladesh has it's own music industry.
The accents are very different from Bangladeshi people, the mobs police are different here. Printing posters & make it look like Dhaka didn't work actually.The director portrayed a false image of Dhaka.",Extraction
2072,banarwalajay,orange color grading was menace.,6,24 April 2020,"The kid of an Indian drug dealer is kidnapped by another drug dealer from Bangladesh but the Indian drug dealer couldn't pay the ransom because his assets are frozen.
Really? That's how drug dealers work? Using legitimate assets and banks? What about the warehouse full of cash lying around as always shown in the movies?
And why would a drug dealer kidnap the BROKEN opponent's kid? Where is the ground for the kidnapping? Or just for fun? How the kid is transported from Mumbai to Dhaka? Using a chartered plane or ship or by road or how?Pankaj Tripathi played an Indian Drug Dealer. Using him for less than 5 mins seems an insult for the actor's caliber as he's an astonishing actor and known for playing a cool headed bad guy in Indian film & television industry. He could have been of much use as either opponent or a strong character in the movie.
(the_rajasthani_Wanderer)
Which role did Randeep Hooda play? Is he a partner with the kid's father or security or something else. In case he played a security officer's character then the writer must have been drunk while writing his character. The only introduction to the character's abilities are from a photograph dressed as army personnel, no other description.But, Randeep gets full attention in his weak role also, even if he attacks Rake after rescuing the kid from goons.
If his character ""Saju"" is so brave, intelligent, can travel to Dhaka and fight a bunch of mercenaries then why didn't he thought of rescuing the kid instead of hiring Rake as mercenary when he knew there is no money to pay him. His involvement with the rescue would have been known to the opponent anyway.What about the opponent Bangladeshi drug dealer? What's his contribution to the film other than wearing nice suits, sitting around, speaking nonsense and sipping drinks? And he illegally ties up with a Colonel from Bangladesh Army? Man, it gets worst and worst towards the end.Golshifteh Farahani's character, Nik Khan, handles the team but no tactical experience or decision making in critical situations. The only memorable is her expressionless face.Chris Hemsworth justified his character elegantly and played it very well but details about the character are so vague that I failed to grasp character's motives till the end. The stunts are nicely coordinated and stimulates goosebumps while watching. But, his friend who owes Rake his life, betrays and tries to kill him. Pity on the character for having such a friend.I've seen many Hollywood movies but the lowest grade director from Hollywood may have a better shot of getting nice reviews than Extraction's director.Seems, the film is a waste of talented actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, Randeep Hooda and many others.It could have been a great movie by Chris Hemsworth as a producer.
But, the screenplay writers and the director killed the film with lack of knowledge about South Asian cultures, Geography and people's behaviour.

Not that I had high expectations from this movie but I wanted to see how the city I grew up in is portrayed in a commercial Hollywood movie.Honestly, the movie got multiple things wrong. Here are some of the few things I found annoying and at times, offensive.Horrible Casting: The supposedly Bangladeshi characters of the movie suspiciously talk in a Kolkata accent, 2-3 other characters including the guy that plays the mafia boss speaks with a north Indian accent. Not only the accent was annoying to listen to, the words and phrases they used are never used by real Bangladeshis in such contexts. This makes me wonder; why Netflix with it's multi-million dollar budget could not afford 5-6 actual Bangladeshi actors to play those Bangladeshi characters.Unrealistic paramilitary force: They showed a group of paramilitary force in black uniforms as Bangladesh's main law enforcement agency in this movie. This agency I guess is meant to be a fictionalized version of RAB( a local paramilitary force). The unlimited arsenal and firepower they are showed to have, it would make even the US military envious. This included police chase cars, helicopter, bazookas and other sophisticated military weapons, which I, living in all those years in Bangladesh have never seen.Mafia controls everything: The antagonist in the in the movie, Asif Amir, who is a mafia boss/Narcos style drug kingpin seem to control everything in Dhaka. The army, police, and 'Elite' - everything seems to be in his pockets. While Bangladesh is a highly corrupted country, it is factually incorrect to show that a druglord runs the city.The filmmakers used the Mexico style Druglord-kidnap-Corrupt cop formula on this movie. They totally missed the point that the politics in Latin America and the Indian Subcontinent are very different. Using the same formula would only make for a horrible movie such as this. Very disappointing job from Netflix. Hope next time they do better research before making a based on a culture they don't know much about.",Extraction

Using all these three Defence Forces working for the Drug Lord was an insanely bad idea. They could have used one instead of all three. It felt like Dhaka is a dark city where killing people is a normal thing on the street during daylight. Just like Mexico.2. In the movie, the director used kids to shoot gun fires. Using kids and representing them as the source of crime demeaned our reputation. I never expected that Dhaka will be presented so badly in our first collaboration with a Hollywood movie using kids. Are we so down to earth that we have to use kids for that? Okay, the director wanted to make it more realistic but I felt that he wanted to bring the ISIS vibe where we saw pictures of kids with guns.3.

When first seen, his character is nursing a hangover while lying outside with a couple buddies. To clear his head, he makes a death-defying leap off a cliff and then calmly meditates for a few minutes at the bottom of a lake. That pretty much tells you all you need to know about Australian mercenary Tyler Rake - yes, that's his name - other than that he's clearly struggling with private grief and numbs his physical and emotional pain with copious amounts of OxyContin.

Before I begin my review, on behalf of the more literate Bangladeshi's, I apologize for the bad reviews, please ignore the natives, they haven't even watched the movie, they're willfully putting in bad reviews just because they feel the Bangladeshi army was shown in poor light and that the environment doesn't look anything like Dhaka. But the fact is that, the army is indeed incompetent and highly corrupt. The plot doesn't take place within the city but on the outskirts, this literally proves the fact that they haven't watched the movie. The people putting in bad reviews should be ashamed of themselves, it's so easy to put in bad reviews. If you'll go through the reviews you'll easily know that most of them are just hate reviews without any legit reason. I made an account just to come in support for the people who have made this project a reality.The movie is a Gem, one of the best action films of the decade. I cannot believe this was out for Netflix, it truly deserves a big if not a huge screen. The first half of the movie is non-stop, literally breathless action. The hand to hand combat scenes were on par with the RAID films! I never thought I'd say this, atleast not so soon. They've pushed the limits as much as they could. The car chases in the outskirts of the city were shot extremely seamlessly and choreographed with unbelievable precision. The vfx and sound design is astoundingly neat and crisp, again wasn't really expecting it to be so damn good. The muzzle flares and gun shot effects were on point and as realistic as they could get. The editing is so clean you'll never know the transitions between the takes.
Sam Hargrave, the director, is truly a master of his craft. He knew exactly what he was doing. There's a long extended action scene or a (Oner) which I don't want to spoil for anyone, it's probably the best one-take action sequences I've witnessed in a long time. You think John Wick and Atomic Blonde had cool slick action, wait till you watch this movie. There's some meaty stuff in here for Action nerds and the kind of gun-fu I haven't seen before. You will never be able to anticipate the moves. The stunt choreography was so meticulously and precisely designed, I cannot fathom the level of expertise it would have taken for them to have practised the whole sequence, to remember every move and have executed them in such a precise manner, is so f**king impressive. This is some premium stuff right here. Chris has done all the stunts and combat scenes by himself which is highly commendable. There's a lot of hard work that's gone behind this project and it is clearly visible. Indian actor Randeep Hooda has also done a commendable job especially during the action sequences and that one ridiculously stunning knife fight.
Loved Hemsworth's emotional performance as well, he's a big mean beast with a soft heart and it shows. With this movie Chris Hemsworth can well and truly join the big leagues of pure action movie stars. Not that he wasn't one before, but the stuff he's done in this film is particularly spectacular. I cannot wait for a sequel or even another project from Hargrave. He had my curiosity, but now he's definitely got my attention. There should be more support in favour of projects such as these. I think this is by far the best Action original from Netflix. Do yourself a favour by not missing it. What else are you doing in the lockdown anyway? Totally worth a re-watch.",Extraction

2148,rayhanwittech,Not a good plot,2,24 April 2020,"Just watched the Netflix special ""Extraction"" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka",Extraction

2188,atiqueullah,Very Good Action With No Plot,1,25 April 2020,"We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.
Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.
It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.
The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.
Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.
The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.
Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.
The Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.",Extraction

In an action scene, every household showed listening Hindi Songs which is not even real in Kolkata.

Bangladesh Police uses better APC like Kobra Otokar12. You can't enter into Bangladesh swerage line in that way and height is far little than that you have shown in the movie.13. In near Buriganga river there so much beautiful historical places available. Dhaka is a continuous city for more than 400 years.14. Bangladesh people don't wear that kind of Panjabi and costumes. Most of the people here wear western dresses, and different Panjabis.15. Police, and obviously no army person will take order from a drug dealer in Bangladesh.16. No drug dealer can live in that way in bangladesh. Either he will be jailed for sure or will be died from gun fight with the police.17. Bengali speaking actors should be more professional with Bengali pronunciations and acting as well.18.

2. There is a lack of men in this country, so young children become soldiers of the drug lord with AK-47s in their hands, as happens in Myanmar, Somalia and other countries.
3. There is no air defense or air force in this country, a few Firingi forces flee in civilian helicopters after washing the country's army, police, RAB, but no one intercepts it.

I agree with everything, but where does Netflix get the courage to make the law enforcement forces and the proud army of this country smaller?

2218,tirtharajiit,A Jam packed Action Thriller with some flaws,7,25 April 2020,"Good Things About the film:1. Direction is just flawless. The American Stuntman turned Director Sam Hargrave just nailed it. He knows how to do action scenes without disrespecting Newton. He made the Pace fast where needed and slowed up where it called for one simple conversation between characters. Just incredible.
2. Performances of most of the characters. Chris Hemsworth AKA Thor didn't let us down and delivered An impeccable performance. His sense of every emotion is just amazing. He makes you feel every time he goes through some emotion. And when he pronounces ""Proman dao"" so flawless you'll just feel that One is dubbed but no. He Said it. But he said ""teka"" instead of ""taka"" but it seemed that he learned bengali from a Bangladeshi instead. Overall a ""Worth it"" performance.
3. Shataf Figar as Bangladeshi Army Colonel was just on point. He didn't mispronounced a single bangla word wrong. And his presence and personality was just extraordinary. He did look like a real colonel.
4. An extraordinary performance came from Suraj Rikame as Farhad. Though his role was very short but very very important. He was the finding of this film. His ""on point"" expressions and greatly pronounced bangla makes his performance a great one. He has a Bright future.Bad things about the film:1. I didn't like particularly just disliked the performance of One character is of Rudraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan in this film. His expressions were Same at every scene. He just disgraced Chris's performance. May be he was baffled a little bit in front of ""Thor"". But in comparison Suraj Rikame just stole the show as an teenage antagonist. Only one dialogue that strikes was ""You drown not by falling into the river, but staying submerged in it."" but it was only the dialogue, Not the way he delivered it.
2. Particularly didn't like the pronunciation of bangla words by Priyanshu Painyuli as Amir Asif. He was just a typical north Indian speaking bengali after few classes. I mean seriously? In that level you can't do that he should have been replaced by an bengali actor from Bengal or Bangladesh either. Very disappointed with that as a bengali.
3. Story line was predictable after the first half.
4. Pankaj Tripathi was used only in one scene. They couldn't capitalize on his master class.
5. The Director seriously needed More homework about the music taste of Bangladeshi people obviously. Because, you can hear only Bollywood songs (Most of them are SRK songs from 90's and 2000's and From Gully Boy too) playing in households while a chasing scene. I mean seriously? You could have added a ""Khairon lo tor lomba mathar kesh, Chirol daanter hasi diya pagol korli desh"" instead. They did add a bangla rap in a car scene though (Not ""Ripon Miyar Bangladesh"" though).(Quick facts: All the Dhaka scenes were shoot in India only. Australia scenes were shoot in Thailand. AND THERE IS NO MANOJ TIWARY IN THE CAST. GOOGLE SHOWS IT WRONG WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR ""EXTRACTION CAST"".)Should You Watch It Or Not?
Absolutely. You should watch it. It is a great portrayal of South Asian Under world and also a Gunman's emotion weaknesses about his Son and the consequences of that you would Not expect. Oops!

2240,debjauty,It made me upset,3,25 April 2020,"The cinema grafy is great but it made me upset bcz(collected):
Just watched the Netflix special ""Extraction"" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka. I was offended by how they represented my city, and I want an apology from Netflix.",Extraction

It was all about developing a profitable product for a broader consumer market. Casting two established Bollywood actors (at lower wage), paying for hindi music bits, faking Kolkata locations and ambience as Dhaka and casting Thor himself was to bag in the greater usual netflix crowd from India. Putting the name Dhaka and just showing freelance drone-shots of the city and shamelessly fooling around with inappropriate accent, language, culture and ambience along with lack of any Bangladeshi actor still brings in Bangladeshi viewers. Engaging a reputed line producer from Bangladesh and well portraying the country was not a big deal but I guess Netflix cautiously ignored it.Hence, Netflix will certainly recover the investment with full profit. But for the creative hats looking into the mirror, it's hard not to regret for such pricy and smelly trash.",Extraction

2249,sahriarmuni,.....Action packed but completely missed the Environment of Dhaka......,1,26 April 2020,"The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry AK-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.Reviewed by oritroahmed",Extraction

The movie has some well-choreographed action sequences, good background score, and brilliant camera work. Though I think they could've avoided playing Bollywood songs in every other corner of the apartment building action sequence, that too in Bangladesh. It felt like a bad attempt to attract Indian audiences.The movie seemed to lack character development and plot development. It just focused on the action sequences which were brilliant and made you feel like you're watching a good shooting game. The film gets somewhat repetitive towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without turning out to be numb and somewhat exhausted by it. Also, the film opens with a shot from close to the end of the film and It doesn't work however because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices for an otherwise good action film. I would recommend giving this one a watch especially if you like action movies and games.",Extraction

2266,finnwidast,Overall a great movie leaving you satisfied and hungry for more.,9,25 April 2020,"Although the story may be insufficient for some viewers I believe the straight to the point amazing action more than makes up for it. This is not to say action is the only thing it provides, the story isn't non existent, it's just hidden. They don't go off on dialoge giving backstory, they convey it through the actions of characters and emotion. The context of the storyline is admittedly abit lacking but i think and hope they will cover this in a later release. A second movie is already in production. The story is a tool to create a satisfactory experience paired with the action. With this insight i believe the existing story is more than sufficient while also makeing one long for more.This movie is not ment to be a representation of the modern world, it's a fictional world that exists to convey the film. So judging the quality of the movie upon what music they listen to in one building in Bangladesh is irrelevant. Misrepresenting details about Bangladesh is not important when you have the entire Bengali police force helping the biggest druglord in their country kill an Australian man trying to save a teenager. Talk about realistic. Just beacuse a movie isn't classed as sci-fi dosn't mean you should expect a documentary. The ""based on real life"" trope is played out, we need more creative film expression like this.90% of the people condemning this movie are either Bengali who were expecting seeing their uncle herding animals or people who didn't follow the story. If i wanted entertaining drama I'd have read a book instead or watched reality TV. Personally there's enough drama in my real life already, so much so that i might want to watch a satisfying action movie as an outlet and distraction from todays world events. Oh wait i already did that when i watched this movie.If the sequal gives that contextual sadisfaction this would be a strong 10, For now it's a great set up for that, sitting at a 9.5.",Extraction

2328,leeanne-11042,Misrepresentation,2,26 April 2020,"Just watched the Netflix special ""Extraction"" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why?Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka.

The plot is set up well and gets you emotionally invested in the characters. The indian actors are great in their roles, especially Rudhraksh Jaiswal who plays the abducted child and after the first action sequence I thought ""Wow, this is gonna be fun"".
However what ensues is an ongoing shootout in which our main protagonist mows down countless members of the local police. The justification of that being that their commander is corrupt and in the pockets of a drug lord.
And that just throws me completely out of this story. Since when has it become a heroic act to slaughter public servants? I just can't get behind that and it makes the redemption story of Tyler Rake pointless in my opinion.",Extraction

THE BANGLADESHI ARMY - Who gave them the right to belittle Bangladesh army dress. Lot of you might say that it is not the exact dress, dude they have used the 🇧🇩 flag on the shoulders.
I AM A CIVILIAN still I would be against this because the army is not a force to be neglected this way.THERE ARE MANY MORE LIKE A WHOLE MOVIE WITH KOLKATA BANGLA LANGUAGE AND WITH NO BANGLADESHI ACTORS .

1. Bangladesh (BD) is country of 16 crore +...So, you understand how much it will be in terms of movie viewers number. The movie portrayed BD like Syria, Afghanistan or a war wrecked State which is disgrace for us. Because BD is not such.The stuntman (Director) should have some background studies which hadn't. Because he is a stuntman!
2. He couldn't portrayed our law agencies properly and made whatever just he liked.
3. He could not portrayed Dhaka. Because he tried to do it from Ahmedabad, India.
4. There is distinct difference between the Bengali language of BD & India as it's between US & UK English language in terms of pronunciation. Someone apart from Bengalis may not understand it. The stuntman tried to establish Indian Bengali language as BD Bengali language with lot of spelling mistakes of Bengali language which made the background as unrealistic one.
5. It's obvious that the Stuntman took idea from Someothers not from BD to portray BD as he didn't come here. This made the blunder and has defamed my country.
6. You will need a microscope to find out a man having 4 wives in BD. It may be possible in Middle East. But it's reflected in the movies.This is how he tried to defame BD muslim culture.Thereby I am grading this movie 1/10.",Extraction

NONE of the actors/actresses are Bangladeshi, and the Bengali spoken in the movie is not even the accurate dialect used in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh isn't a terrorist country. Its a peaceful country and its known over the world as peaceful country. Bangladesh armed police battalion is qualified enough to handover the kidnapped boy let alone RAB,ARMY, SSF, SWAT (Its a moral behavior practice in Bangladesh). Mostly There is nothing called elite force, There is no logo like red circle covered by green color, Only RAP wears black dress, Its impossible correlate the 'badge, logo, dress, police in the shoulder, and police car'.
2. Here is yellowish environment.
3. Here is no language that was spoken in the movie.
4. Here no people bears AK47 let alone a boy. It was just lame.
5. Here army police RAB helps to find out kidnapped boys until they die. Not fights against the logic and morality.
6. I don't know How non-citizen don can come here and even fight with the best troops like army. LOL.
7. Acton was awesome but it was for nothing. Without logic. Logic-less action look like very poor.

2408,bravosix_goingdark,Doom Slayer has entered the facility.,7,28 April 2020,"This review is for the people who can't decide whether to watch the movie or not. So let me get a few points out of the way...1. If you like John Wick or have played Doom before and really like the game, you will love this movie.If you are that kinda person who likes non stop executions, gore, violence and do not really care about the logic and practical scenarios... oh boy you are in for another treat. It's just like any other fast and furious movie out there, does not make sense but does a really great job in giving you the non stop crisp untouchable hero action. Just as I said, if you love Doom, you'll love this.
Because Chris Hemsworth has done it again ladies and gentleman. A banger yet again. I wouldn't say a masterclass, but good.2. If you're that kinda guy who doesn't like being left hanging for dead in the end, JUST WALK AWAYNow, if you're that kinda person who wants to understand the complete plot, who doesn't really like thinking about the movie for weeks, analyzing every aspect of the movie to understand the ending? Like I said. JUST WALK AWAY.But hey, every movie is unique in it's own perspective. You gotta appreciate the efforts put in.3. If you're that person who likes to appreciate the bonding between the people, like to just flow through emotions, viewing the scenario through one's shoes, THIS IS JUST WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.If you're the person who really binds with the characters on the screen, really like empathizing, go ahead. Extraction does a good job in portraying the different walks of life.Now coming to my review:Why 7/10? Here it goes ..1. As you guessed it, Chris carried the whole movie. The others characters were really bland. It felt artificial and I felt the scripted dialogues even before my brain could decipher it.2. Most of the plot is predictable. And again, it's the same amateur mistakes again.The trailer revealed the entire movie's plot. Very poor decisions made by the team. There is nothing special to the plot, it's just raw. And RAW as in Gordon Ramsey's verses.3. The sound effects was very average. The sounds of the guns firing, the police sirens, the nades, the smokes, the frags, everything seemed out of place. Visuals were fine, the soundtracks were fine, yeah, Just about does it guess.So all in all, it's just a one timer, nothing too special to watch it over and over again unless you're a die hard fan. I would say this movie is alright.",Extraction

How many of you ever left your Dhanmondi Banani and went to Puran Dhaka and shadar ghaat? The movie clearly says it's based on the gangs of puran Dhaka and I see them much nicely portraying that. Guess what? Puran Dhaka's slums are worst than the scenes of movie and gangs are scarier than what was shown. They showed our rivers brown where it's black lmao. Go have a look tomorrow. Atleast they showed cop cars and strong police defence which doesn't exist in Dhaka haha.Coming down to the sepia (yellow) effect, try going out to USA or NZ and then back to Dhaka and the yellow effect will make some sense to you. Dhaka is covered in haze throughout summer where the sun rays get blended to haze. We don't notice it as we live in Dhaka. The movie has exaggerated it, I agree. But that's what Hollywood does with Kenya, South Africa and any warm country.Coming to the movie, y'all mad as it was not loaded with multiple complex segments to drive your head crazy. It was simply, and much straight to the point like a Bollywood movie. I liked this little movie. The action was amazing, visuals were realistic and it was way emotional near the end.All up, a nice movie. Lets not ask them to portray our city as something it isn't lmao.

Bollywood songs were playing in the households which is not a thing in Bangladesh.
They said Dhaka is surrounded by rivers, which is not totally true. Also there are jungle in the outskirts of the city they said, in reality there are none. Also a kind reminder that this movie highlights the control of a drug lord over the country as he can even manage the armed forces which is a joke. Because drug dealing and drug business is a lot less in bangladesh even less than usa, or other developed countries. Drug is not an issue here. An all powerful drug lord is far from reality.

This new Netflix original action movie is based on a graphic novel co authored by the Russo brothers.
The movie Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth)as a black market mercenary , who is enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal)of an imprisoned international crime lord.
The movie has impressive camera work and action sequence.
It's surely a gun fight action movie with some great hand to hand combat scenes.
Although to bring in some criticism , the movie lacked some logic and purpose of reality , with a poor story line.
But if one is looking for entertainment , you shouldn't miss watching it.
The movie somewhere lies in between good and bad.
The movies definitely has some of the best pure action choreogtaphy and cinematography .
Extraction seems fortunately timed for its streaming rollout which could atleast momentarily satisfy people deprived of the big screen.

Dhaka is very different from what is shown in this movie..more modern..like Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And Bangladesh is one of the most peaceful countries in Asia, like Canadians in North America.And all the actors are Indians, their Bangla and even English accent are not how Bangladeshis speak.The most sadest thing for me is that how many Bangladeshi people had to die just for 1 Indian.. in many way it shows how much ego Indians can build up and look down upon its friendly defencless neighbours.

2473,arittradas,Needed more research before releasing the movie.,8,15 September 2020,"Thanks to the developer for making the Extraction movie in the South Asia Region. The movie is based on saving a hostage from Bangladesh. A boy called Ove, who was kidnaped by the most significant drug Diller Amir Asif in Bangladesh and India. The main character was Chris Harmsworth. The base of operation was held in Australia. The movie has extreme violence and lots of action which I liked most. The sound and combat seem realistic. I notice that the filer looks like gloomy according to Bangladeshi culture. They should have added a better filter for a better look; in the movie mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Harmsworth) as known as an Agent who visits Puran-Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Landmarks, Environment, culture, people everything was realistic. A stranger came with a van and they said to him, 'welcome to Dhaka'. Those people kidnap him and he knew that he has lots of money. But they didn't know that he was a secret agent. He got an escape from the mafia. That action of the agent was so aggressive and enjoyable. But I that time I saw that children with Asselt Rifle and they acting like a terrorist. That was so annoying to see this too me. In the middle of escape with Ove, that was massive action. From the operation base, they were asking Tyler Rake for the drive location. The Police were chasing their car and keep shooting their vehicle. The car crashes were fantastic. Then he entire a building elite team was searching that place. The stealth kill was so perfect in that place. The 12 minutes of this action was so interested in me. The entire sequence consists of a car chase, then a pursuit up some stairs, a fight in a building, a jump from one rooftop to another rooftop, a tumble off an awning, a flight in the street, a fight in the road, and one final of car chase which amounts to about 36 different segments attached together, creating an I, pressure 12 minutes seemingly continuously scene. One thing I notice that Police with badge written Army soldiers again wearing RAB's dress. This is really weird to me. The forces showed that they were bots (Unskilled). But the developer should have research more before making this movie.
The accent was not a regional language. Those accents seem like from the west bangle. As a Bangladeshi fan, the Bengali wasn't mush infested. Children speak about toxic behavior. A maximum vehicle like trucks, old model cars are from India. The lighting was low than editing. But overall, the movie has massive actions and also like the camera angle. Hope, If Netflix announces Extraction 2 in Bangladesh, then again welcome to our country. Overall, Impressive action scenes, a talented cast, fabulous direction from Sam Hargrave, and a brilliant screenplay from Joe Russo all these add up to the awesomeness of Extraction. Even though the plot was a bit confusing and the ending was predictable, Extraction is indeed good enough to put a smile on your face.",Extraction

This movie is a Netflix original action thriller and it stars the actors; Chris Hemsworth and Rudhraksh Jaiswal. Although Chris Hemsworth in this movie is a very good actor, he is playing his character like Thor.Here is a brief overview of the plot without spoiling too much. A black-market mercenary (who has nothing to lose) is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. But in the murky underworld of weapons, dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.This movie was very enjoyable to watch although personally, I think that at some points, the silence lasted for too long.

Chris Hemsworth and the stunt team kept me on the edge of my seat. My criticism would be Chris Hemsworth character's motivation. The loss of his son to cancer seems a little weak for a professional mercenary to become basically suicidal. But I must repeat that the combat scenes and the pacing was excellent. I've read some critiques that were critical of the portrayal of the India and Bangladesh locales, that the depictions of the scenery and the people were not accurate. Be that as it may, I was more enamored by the highly skilled heroes (anyone who has fired a weapon on the move will appreciate) then the scenery.

2551,capedaze,White man kills lots of brown people but it's all good because he's sad.,2,1 May 2020,"Let's do a little thought experiment. Let's say someone made a movie where a Nigerian mercenary came to New York because a gang there had kidnapped a Mexican kingpin's son. And let's say after dispatching the bad guys in a variety of creative ways, that Nigerian mercenary and his team get betrayed and he's stuck on the run in Manhattan and it turns out that there's high-up cops and pentagon officials in the gang-leader's pocket, and they mobilise the NYPD and the marines to stop him.Now of course the NYPD and the marine grunts are just following orders, having been told they need to apprehend a bad guy, but our Nigerian mercenary just goes right ahead and slaughters them all without a second thought. Do you think that would play well with American audiences? Seeing New York's finest, their wive's and kid's world about to implode with grief, mowed down by some African foreigner rescuing a Mexican druglord's kid? Do you think these American audiences would be cheering for the Nigerian because in one scene he reveals why he's sad and the Mexican druglord's kid tells him he's very brave?Please.Sure you can say get over it it's just a movie, but haven't we got past the point where it's ok for a protagonist to just slaughter people undeserving of slaughter while we still have the film-maker ask us to sympathise with the so-called hero?

We have watched similar to it many times! But what makes Extraction very unique and fun, it is it's amazing cinematography and outstanding acting that made it emotional enough to feel connected to the characters. And let me tell you about the crazy thriller 15 minutes of single shot fight/shooting scene! That was just a pure art!

2558,dalvinjames,Hemsworth creating his own lane in the action genre,6,21 May 2020,"During self-quarantine I'm sure many of you like myself have been abusing the time watching content on the many streaming services available to us. I've been lucky enough to dedicate this time to catching up on some of the latest releases on Netflix.If you're looking for a good action film to enjoy on late night then you'll be satisfied with Chris Hemsworth's latest project - Extraction. The film is based around the character Tyler Rake, an ex pay for hire mercenary, who takes up one last job; to rescue an Indian mob leader's kidnapped son from a rival mobster and the largest drug dealer in Bangladesh. Expect spectacular fighting sequences, explosions and exhilarating car chases as director Sam Hargrave takes us on the whirlwind mission in his debut film.Given Hargrave's stunt background (famously known as Captain America's stunt double), there was a lot of potential for the action sequences to bring this film to life. We see glimpses of Hargraves talents shine, in particular, during a fight scene that takes place once Rake attempts to recover mob leader's son Ovi. The close combat flights are captured well, we feel the intensity of the fight through the shoes of Rake. The director wants us to feel every punch and kick which engages us as the audience. Hargraves stunt background definitely adds an edge to this film, he is able to satisfy us the audience through the intense fighting and excessive violence, similar to that used in the Asian action films such as the Raid.With the majority of the film being shot in Dhaka Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated cities in the world; Rakes task seems even more unrealistic as he is one man in foreign country against an entire mob. Hargraves does well at using this location to create chaos. In particular, during the car chase we feel overwhelmed and on the edge of our seats as there's people everywhere and often a lot of near misses. However, what stood out to me during this scene and the fight scene was the camera. Hargraves repeatedly uses a one shot, similar to that used in 1917. This shot is effective as Hargraves is able to make us feel like we're following Rake through the chaos.Although, this film doesn't stand out from its competition in the action genre. It feels like Hemsworth is attempting to solidify himself as a solo lead by creating a lane for himself. perhaps for when he decides to hang his boots as the role of Thor within the marvel cinematic.",Extraction

There was only very FEW MINOR things that bothered me but wasn't a big deal.Anyone who's complaining about location of the movie that it is not accurate...WHO CARES!...Its a film that takes place in a fictional setting. Its like other movies that take place in New York but is filmed in Chicago or other major cities. It doesnt always have to be on point with location.

First is the language, if you want to make a film a a countries background you can't show all the native people talking in some other accent. Here in this film all the supposed Dhaka residents always talking in an accent that is of West Bengal, India, not anywhere near Dhaka. Then the roads, houses and songs! yes you heard right, songs. Roads are dhaka are not like shown in the film, dart roads, so when you watch the film you will feel this is not dhaka at all. The houses are not like dhaka. In the film you can hear hindi film songs from 90's in almost every house. Sadly the film is not set in 90's background but today. And in Dhaka you will not hear 90's hindi song in souses or cafes. So altogether this film does not give a single bit of felling that it's in Dhaka, then why using the name anyway? I understand that being a fantasy film this does not require to be accurate but you can't get all wrong. I feel like the director never did much study on Dhaka before making this movie, otherwise why a Director debut with a film which can be called, ""The Action of Errors""But having said that, If you love solid breathtaking nonstop action and Chris Hemsworth then this movie is enjoyable none the less.

2. "" Sultana Kamal Bridge"" is way ahead from Dhaka city.

The movie lacks its context completely. Dhaka is a peaceful city.
Overcrowded ? - yes.
Heavy Traffic ?- yes
Air Pollution ? - yes
Noisey? - yes
But it is vibrant in its own way- much safer than many cities of the world. We can find child begger in the street - but definitely not terrorist.I suggest anyone related to this movie should type "" Dhaka"" in Google or Wikipedia. They have more information - especially authentic one.I sincerely apologise for my comments above if it hurts anyone. Any city shown in any movie should reflect its own character - imagination shall be there for sure- but definitely not out of context .",Extraction

Brought back a lot of good memories of growing up with the non stop action of Stallone and Arnold movies. Yeah the plot or script may not be the best.

Whole through the movie they have used yellow lence effect during Dhaka shoot to give a polluted vibe. It looks like dhaka people are devastated and this city has no law and order at all. Child terrorism was projected like a poison burn.
Our armed forces are not impotent as long as they are alive in this soil. They will not leave an inch like Pakistan did even ....what to talk about police ,Rab!! Producer have not visited Dhaka city ever I guess,what to talk about Cantonment.
Whole through the movie it seems to me that - ""is it my country?do they think us in that way???""

But frankly, this is not a documentary, the viewers knew what they were gonna see... The trailer didn't lie either. It's a fully action packed movie and there wasn't anything meant to be different either.
Don't know what people in Bangladesh think, do they believe it's always USA in movies like Avengers? No they shoot in Canadian cities where the actual setting is far better than US cities - just to give impression that superheroes stack up in the most developed corners of the world.
Similarly, this movie is not about covering the so called some of the Good Roads 😂😬 of Dhaka. It's just an action movie with a context of being shot in Bangladesh. Obviously they had to bring in fake police, combat squads etc guessing the Real Police of Dhaka won't have given directors the chance of bringing in that much action😆😆. Again this is what we see in every other Hollywood movie too - you think they are always so combat savvy and competent in real life in the West? No. The real NYPD, FBI, etc is surely good but movies just exxagerate everything everytime. This is no different.I give it 10 because they talked about action and extraction which were both there in the movie. The way done Avengers were shot was again brilliant. No complains.Peace ✌🏻✌🏻",Extraction

The story is not really worth mentioning. Its kind of a mix-up of Taken and John Wick. And well it just works totally fine. The focus on well crafted action cinematography is superb. Especially fun is the 12 minute one-take, which moves from a car chase, to a house raid, to really intense close-quarter fights, much in a John Wick style.

But here it is.1. The language spoken was not native. Not even close to Bengali. People really laughed. Bangladesh is the only nation in the world who fought for the language to establish. So it really matters for Bangladeshis.2.There is no such drug lord. Movie shows that the drug lord has huge power to order POLICE and ARMY. But here is the fault. No where we have seen a small cadre, soldier for drug lord himself. Drug lord should have a trained staff to fight with Chris.3. Under aged people have been used by Drug Lords. Oh! The story had a chance to utilize those under aged in beautiful way.4. Such Drug Lord does not exist. It should be well known to the educated people in the world that South-East Asian (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan) cannot be drug lord because of their environment, history. This sub-continent had been dominated by Afghan, Iranian, Tatar, European.5. The dress is not appropriate. Police, Army, Background color, Transport.6. Words are written incorrectly. 'Army/Police Force' was spelled/written in the arm badge as 'Army/Police Fose'.7. One Indian songs was used well. But others are not appropriate. Because it is drug/action/thriller movie, it does not mean that only hip-hop songs will be used. Sometimes, a slow music creates a rhythm. It is just like the scene where Chris jump from the hill/mountain after relaxation. It was beautiful and enjoyable.8. Where is Bangladeshi Actor? Come On! You have no idea how good they are. Because you do not know any actors does not mean there are no actors. You are going to make a movie in Bangladesh, find the right person.9. Netflix!!!!! Poor choice. If I had to spend such amount, I would have used properly. You have released this movie by doing same manner the Bangladeshi producer does.

For example, the Bengali spoken is most that from West Bengal. Bangladeshi spoken Bengali is quite different. There's also a sequence in a jungle near the outskirts of Dhaka, but Dhaka is an urban area and is surrounded by other urban areas.As for the story, there are some plot holes. There's no clear motive that establishes why the kid was kidnapped. It's also ambiguous as to why the kid decided to start Chris Helmsworth's character blindly.

There is no sense. Like I had just wasted my 2 pretty valuable hours of life by watching this movie. Yes, a life of a kid is important but the life of other people is also important I guess. But the director or the writer does not aware of this fact I guess. In the movie, tons of life has been blown like crackers. They must have been dreaming while making this movie cause who kills a couple of thousands of people to just save the life of a kid. You can think that I kinda rude but think about it properly. if the kid is captured by a terrorist group and there is no state's authority to do anything then somehow it is understandable. But no what we see the movie that a bunch of druglords pets capture that kid. ok so extract him from there. But no our mighty hero has gone too far. He just started a war with the state. Like he kills police and RAB and army personals just like a piece of cake.
I have never seen this kind of stuff before like a war against the state by a hitman who works by a darknet hitman agency.And this is not Bangladesh. There is no such drug lord in Bangladesh at all. And Yes many of our policemen are corrupted, sometimes they don't do their duty properly and sometimes they exercise the power beyond their jurisdiction. But when it comes to the safety of the people of Bangladesh, they act solid. They don't have all the types of equipment that they need. but when a situation arises, they are the most efficient force in this world. Believe it or not, they are.

Hopefully, the sequel will be more fun, this lacks the wit within the action that John Wick has, which makes the huge kill count in those films bearable. By the end of this, the complete inability of the police and soldiers to hit anything was reaching A-Team levels of ridiculousness.

But that's all the movie had. There were hardly any meaningful conversations in the movie, except from one which Tyler had with the kid.The story line was completely terrible. There were so many issues with the plot which made it unrealistic. I don't think every house in Bangladesh plays Bollywood songs all the time. It was infact nauseating to watch smelly sewers, conjusted locations, depressed people inside small rooms, all the time. The movie should have been translated in one language, instead of making it multilingual.It was totally a waste of time. The ending was all the more terrible.

It delievers exactly what the creators of the movie were thinking of delievering. People are complaining about lack of story, lack of character development etc etc. But that's the risk the creators take on purpose.
Do you really think the people wouldn't have thought of these things, I think we should judge the movies based on what they want us to see not based on what we actually want from them.This movie keeps you on toe for more than 50% of the time. The fight sequence choregraphy lies in on level of some of hollywood Blockbusters. People rating this movie 1 - 2 are really nuts. As a movie lover i feel bad when people do this to some movies, because it has impact on larger audience reading those reviews.A lot of hardwork has been put into the movies and we should atleast give the credit for what the creater and the team behind these project deserve rather than follishly nitpicking.What i absolutely love about the movie.
CameraworkFight SequencesDirectors dedication to stick to the Raid style action flick.What could have been improved.
Few less fillers and more depth should have been given to the sequences about past of characters of Chris and Randeep Hudda.I am not conflicting about what i have said above about asking for other take on the movie. But the time which was already allocated for sequences where Randeep Hooda calls his family and the interaction between Chris and Kid at night.

Unsurprisingly, the action sequences are nerve wrecking and at it's finest as that's what Sam Hargrave is known for best. It is his Directorial Debut and it shows. Acting wise, the only one noteworthy according to me is Randeep Hooda. The Film is based on a Graphic Novel 'Cuidad' by Andre Parks which is originally set in Paraguay. Wondering who thought it was a good idea to send a literal 6""3' inches Avenger in the streets of Bangladesh where his only job is to blend in to survive. Like the film falls apart at how shallow the writing is. It goes all over the place. New characters pop up for as long as a minute and then they vanish. I think Extraction is blindly trying a 'Bad Man turned Good Man but with a kid to save' troupe Terminator 2(1991) and Logan(2017) and failing at it.

2831,sajidulalam,Lack of research; Poor story & Misrepresentation of a country.,4,27 April 2020,"As the whole movie is based on stunt and action scene one cannot complain about those that is for sure but when the cons take over the cons then the rating goes down.Pros:
Impressive action scene.(3 stars for that)Acting abilities of all characters were good enough.(1 stars for that)Cons:
Lack of research, Poor Story plot & Misrepresentation(- 2 stars for each so -6 stars in total)* A movie portraying recent time should be portraying the recent scenario of the city portrayed. There comes the whole disappointment. Not as a Bangladeshi but as movie freak I am saying this. If you are showing a part of city it is okay to portray as however one wants but if the whole city is portrayed it should be taken into consideration how it should be portrayed. In this movie whole Dhaka is shown as slam/dirty area with narrow lanes which is definitely funny and ridiculous. Yes it is over populated but the whole city is not based on old buildings and narrow lanes or smelly sewer. Only the part of old town has old buildings with narrow lanes.* Dhaka is not a post war country and children do not run with guns in open streets, they dont even carry guns in a hidden manner and they are not part of gangs for sure.* Even if it is considered the whole armed forces are corrupt in a country but what about the background story for that one? I don't know, they might have plan to produce another movie for the past story.
In movie there is no local showed to help the character Tyler or Saju which is actually a serious negative side according to me. For Saju how he entered inside Dhaka without help form someone how he crossed border with arms and without security people knowing that is a mystery.* We all know the difference of English accent between UK and USA, what if a movie story is based on USA and the actors portraying USA locals are using UK accent, how horrible does that sound?
Same has happened in this movie (Except these two character: Dhaka Elite force Commander and Farhad), even the character portraying Dhaka Drag Lord, Amir Asif cannot speak proper Bangla, how funny is that?) The other actors portraying Dhaka goons are using West Bengal accent (Part of india, Bangla is their mother tongue too) which is too much different than the actual accent of Bangladeshi one.*Then comes background songs used in the scene.
All the songs played on background are Hindi (Might have been copyright issues but there are too many West Bengal produced Bangla Music?)

There were so many awesome way to represent Dhaka with that storyline. Like, Children with ak47 is not the Dhaka's looks. Their could be enough aged people or teenage with knife or at most some hand gun could be fit but not the Heavy weapons. And then the lockdown things could be more dramatic. Like a corrupted army or police guy trying misleading the authority to help a drug lord. But this movie shows that the drug lord is a king of that nation.

2837,rarony,Honest review of Extraction: Russo Brothers do everything right except the Bangla,1,24 April 2020,"The Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of Dhaka.Except for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.",Extraction

The only negative as far as I can tell, is that bangladeshi people are not happy how they depict Dhaka and the bangladeshi language in the movie and as a european this didn't bother me at all.

You are saying the story is not about the city, something else. Then why you had to mention the city? It could be elsewhere in any state of India. And what is this Sepia effect all the time? Everything in the movie about Dhaka was like a garbage portrayal and misrepresented You don't care about Dhaka because you don't stay here. Well, some us do. And we know the difference. If you don't care about plot, why don't you just watch WWE and stuffs?To me, it was nothing but a typical bollywood film.

It was a bad idea for him to embrace the challenges of filming on a foreign location and language. Really bad example of depending on whole bunch of cat and crew who not at all could interpret what they were meant to. I felt, Sam unnecessarily made a Bollywood bully which he is not worth for. Unfortunately this movie tried to give birth of an English speaking James Bond, who is not in fact a British Secrete Agent.",Extraction

This movie is looking like that the hollywood representing only Indian lifestyle where a major part based on this movie in Bangladesh.

2913,sushant-79596,Extraction,7,5 May 2020,"A PURE ACTION SEQUENCE
Extraction has a very short story which can be expressed in a line: a young boy is kidnapped; a mercenary is sent out to rescue him.
That boy is Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a jailed Indian drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi). The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word ""Proman Dao"").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.",Extraction
2914,tgeodesic,Poor plot but really good action,4,12 May 2020,"Having Indian actors to represent Bangladeshi people in the movie is like having Nigerians or people from some African countries to represent African-American. Come on! First of all, the movie was not shot in Dhaka, Bangladesh. And then, a Bangladeshi army general obeying the command of a drug lord is something that never happened and will never happen. It's alright to show Chris killing a bunch of soldiers in the movie, but an army general in Bangladesh never obeys a drug lord since the army and the government is stable (not like what is portrayed in some Hollywood movies with plots in African countries). It was funny listening to the Indian actors talking in Bangla with Indian/Kolkatan accent. And old hindi songs playing in the alleys is what you'll see in India, not in Bangladesh. Dhaka is the center of the country with a large military base and the prime minister and all government officials residing there. So, Chris carrying out his mission in the center and the heart of the country is unimaginable. Also, crossing the bridge to hand over the kidnapped child seemed to be the main task at the end. It's hilarious that the army could only attack from one end of the bridge, and the other end is open in the center of the city. Stupid plot, but great action.",Extraction

So when there is a fight in the road in Dhaka city, there should be a big gathering. And Bengali's don't listen to hindi songs in the day, they have works to do. And finally children aren't given Rifles, Shotguns or Pistols in Bangladesh. They mostly got knives with them. In this case you guys should have the casting to some adults who is 17-18+.

While there were elements of the story that were slightly derivative, overall I connected a lot with the characters throughout and found the movie not only immersive with the fight sequences but also the storytelling. It's weird because I hated John Wick but loved this movie. It just treated violence differently where it wasn't meant to be feel good, but instead felt more disturbing (as it should). I thought certain dramatic moments could have benefited from less cutting and more of the same immersive feel of the action sequences.

I've been counting on it as the most dramatic action film.I've watched the movie with hell lot of expectations but after watching, I felt that there are multiple grey areas in the story, many of which are incomprehensible.Dialogs are in 3 different languages, English, Hindi & Bangla, hard to watch without subtitles for global audience. What happened to English and dubbed versions? Audience could have lived with these options very well.The cast list is good enough to make it an excellent block buster but seems the story failed to bind the cast with it.The film story seems much baseless and created by some novice writer.The kid of an Indian drug dealer is kidnapped by another drug dealer from Bangladesh but the Indian drug dealer couldn't pay the ransom because his assets are frozen.
Really? That's how drug dealers work? Using legitimate assets and banks? What about the warehouse full of cash lying around as always shown in the movies?
And why would a drug dealer kidnap the BROKEN opponent's kid? Where is the ground for the kidnapping? Or just for fun? How the kid is transported from Mumbai to Dhaka? Using a chartered plane or ship or by road or how?Pankaj Tripathi played an Indian Drug Dealer. Using him for less than 5 mins seems an insult for the actor's caliber as he's an astonishing actor and known for playing a cool headed bad guy in Indian film & television industry. He could have been of much use as either opponent or a strong character in the movie.Which role did Randeep Hooda play? Is he a partner with the kid's father or security or something else. In case he played a security officer's character then the writer must have been drunk while writing his character. The only introduction to the character's abilities are from a photograph dressed as army personnel, no other description.But, Randeep gets full attention in his weak role also, even if he attacks Rake after rescuing the kid from goons.
If his character ""Saju"" is so brave, intelligent, can travel to Dhaka and fight a bunch of mercenaries then why didn't he thought of rescuing the kid instead of hiring Rake as mercenary when he knew there is no money to pay him. His involvement with the rescue would have been known to the opponent anyway.What about the opponent Bangladeshi drug dealer? What's his contribution to the film other than wearing nice suits, sitting around, speaking nonsense and sipping drinks? And he illegally ties up with a Colonel from Bangladesh Army? Man, it gets worst and worst towards the end.Golshifteh Farahani's character, Nik Khan, handles the team but no tactical experience or decision making in critical situations. The only memorable is her expressionless face.Chris Hemsworth justified his character elegantly and played it very well but details about the character are so vague that I failed to grasp character's motives till the end. The stunts are nicely coordinated and stimulates goosebumps while watching. But, his friend who owes Rake his life, betrays and tries to kill him. Pity on the character for having such a friend.I've seen many Hollywood movies but the lowest grade director from Hollywood may have a better shot of getting nice reviews than Extraction's director.Seems, the film is a waste of talented actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, Randeep Hooda and many others.It could have been a great movie by Chris Hemsworth as a producer.
But, the screenplay writers and the director killed the film with lack of knowledge about South Asian cultures, Geography and people's behaviour.",Extraction

3000,masudfusions,Is this movie represent real Bangladesh??,1,24 April 2020,"As Covid-19 lockdown continues in Bangladesh, every film lovers' eyes were on Netflix this Friday as they dropped their latest original film Extraction starring Hollywood superstar Chris Hemsworth. The whole country was eagerly waiting for the action-packed film since the Thor famed actor shared images from the shoot on the set of the film on his official Facebook page in November, 2018.The backdropAmerican action thriller Extraction, previously titled Dhaka, was greenlit back in 2017 by Netflix and is the directorial debut of famous Hollywood stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. His titles include Hunger Games and several action films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The screenplay was written by Joe Russo, based on the comic book Cuidad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman.The film is a co-production between Avengers: Infinity War (2018) directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's (commonly known as Russo brothers) independent production company AGBO and Netflix. The lead cast Hemsworth is also one of the producers in the project.The film was mainly shot in India's Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018 and some shots were taken in Thailand and Dhaka, Bangladesh.The film's production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018.The plotTyler Rake, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a fearless black-market mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi, played by Rudraksh Jaiswal, the kidnapped son of an imprisoned Indian crime lord. The kidnapping was done by a Dhaka based international drug lord which pushes Tyler into a deadly and almost impossible mission to Dhaka to save Ovi from the drug lord and his massive force of goons and bribed law enforcement members.The rightsExtraction takes its audience from Dhaka to Mumbai to Australia and back, giving us a picture of the interconnected drug traffic ring in South Asia. The two-hour-long film is dark and raw from start to end and every action film lover's dream.Not even a single action sequence of the film was ever exactly shot in Bangladesh except some plate shots for establishment, including the iconic action sequence at Sultana Kamal bridge near Demra.Chris Hemsworth never set foot in Dhaka yet the audience felt he was blazing his guns around Old Dhaka. All of the shots were taken in Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Hats off to the production design team behind the project who had done an excellent job of recreating Old Dhaka in Ahmedabad with such attention to details from the vehicles, to posters in streets, to every single sign board of each shop in each sequence.Russo brothers and Hargrave visited Dhaka couple of times but as Dhaka is not a very production friendly city, they just shot some establishment shots.As the director and producers of the project are the masterminds behind the Avengers franchise, not a single action sequence will let the audience down.
The long yet fast paced follow shots during the action sequences are a treat to experience.Hemsworth gave his absolute best playing the role of a hired black-market mercenary.The wrongsExcept for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.ConclusionThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.",Extraction

3040,saiffbari,Weird plot charecter,1,25 April 2020,At least a Dhakaiya street boy killed Chris Hemsworth (and drowned him into Buriganga) which Thanos couldn't. 🤣💪,Extraction
3041,Paran360,The movie is excellent but incorrectly presented Dhaka.,5,26 April 2020,"Action Packed but Completely missed the Environment of DhakaThe premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different.This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here.And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged.They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff.It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.",Extraction
3042,mohammadmaruf-73958,Really amazing,10,24 April 2020,"Hi.I am originally from bd.Inspite of being living in bd i love this movie,the concept was awesome.But it is a matter of sorrow that Bangladesh is not a terrorist country as the show in this movie.Make sure next time about this.and everything was fine for me",Extraction

3045,fardinkhandakarfk,Misrepresented of Bangladesh,1,24 April 2020,Illogical occurance have displayed numbers of times . The military force of Bangladesh is not involved with any mafia group . Dhaka is not that bad what they showed in the movie .I would say a very good action movie but as tamil movies they didn't bother to think about logic,Extraction
3046,mobile-15434,Story based on c-class action game,3,26 April 2020,"Deserves couple of stars for action in place that rarely is in movies, but movie was biggest nonsense I have watched in a long time. Plot didn't make any sense and was like from a crappy shooter game made by EA.",Extraction

3050,matwallinger,Directing done well,8,28 April 2020,"Despite this being Sam Hargraves directorial debut, it goes without saying it was done extremely well, along side Joe Russo's ingenious writing abilities. I was extremely impressed with the action sequences, more so with the extensive ""Single take"" sequences. I found myself thinking about how they came up with the ideas including the impressive camera work and how it is done. What I enjoy most is scenes/shots that can be interpreted differently, in this case, the end scene.",Extraction
3051,mdfahimkabir,Worst representation of Bangladesh,1,27 April 2020,I have only one question. Have they ever researched about Bangladesh?,Extraction
3052,aaryanpednekar,WHAT A MOVIE! WITH A BIG MISTAKE!,9,24 April 2020,"Everything from Action Sequences, Story, Characters, Close Combat Scenes, Chase Sequences Everything was Outstanding!
