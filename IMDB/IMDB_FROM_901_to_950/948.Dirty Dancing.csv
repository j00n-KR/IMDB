0,MartinHafer,It's one of those 80s films you just have to see.,8,9 May 2021,"I found it interesting that the setting of ""Dirty Dancing"" is at a resort in the Catskills. This is because the film and the actual resorts were quite different. Originally, resorts in the Catskill Mountains region sprung up because Jewish families (mostly from New York City) wanted to vacation but in the early to mid-20th century, anti-Semitism meant Jews were not especially welcome in many traditional vacation spots...so they essentially built their own. And, from the early 20th century to the late 60s, these so-called 'Borscht Belt' resorts were popular and packed. But, in recent years, the decline in anti-Semitism, the discontinuation of railroad lines to the area and the new highway system sparked a decline in folks wanting to vacation there...and soon Jewish (and some non-Jewish) families began vacationing other places....and the resorts faded*. I mention all this because when you watch the film, you can't tell anything is Jewish about the resort--the residents, the food or, well, pretty much anything. And, you learn nothing about the history of the places...which is pretty interesting, especially when you read about it and learn about the dozens of famous Jewish comedians who plied their trade and often got their starts at these resorts.The film begins when the Houseman family arrive at one of these resorts for vacation. The oddly named 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a very kind-hearted young lady, as when she learns that one of the dancers at the resort is pregnant, she tries to do what she can to help. Much of this is training with Johnny (Patrick Swayze) to fill in for his pregnant dance partner who is pregnant. Ultimately, however, this ends up putting her in hot water with her father (Jerry Orbach), as he thinks that Baby is having an affair with Johnny ...and that Johnny ALSO is the guy who got this other girl pregnant. Well, Dad is right that Johnny and Baby are in love...but he's not the pig who got the girl pregnant and then walked away. This is the major tension through most of the film. And, because of that, Baby has to sneak around to see Johnny...that is, of course, until the end of the film.While the story and romance are pretty good, the reason to see this film (and hear it) is because of all the great old tunes from the 60s as well as the iconic tunes from the 80s that became ubiquitous on the radio following the release of this film. So many Top 10 songs from this film....ones that if you lived through the era you'll never forget. My only complaint is minor...some of the hairstyles and fashions occasionally look MUCH more like the 80s than the 60s! Still, an excellent and unique movie...one you really should see.*By the 1980s, nearly all of the old Catskills resorts had closed. Because of that, Virginia and North Carolina fill in for New York State in this film.",Dirty Dancing
1,TheLittleSongbird,Truly excellent with jaw-dropping dance routines.,8,14 March 2009,"Dirty Dancing is an excellent movie. No, it isn't perfect, but it is solid entertainment for those into dancing. There are two flaws with the film. The script is not the best script in the world, to be honest, there are some clichés. Also, as much as Cynthia Rhodes puts a lot of energy into the dance routines, her acting isn't as good unfortunately.However, putting those minor discrepancies aside, the highlights are the jaw-dropping if rather erotic dance routines and the ever-popular soundtrack. The famous lift in the best dance of the film is very hard to do properly, and as far as I'm aware, it was very well-done. The soundtrack isn't like Charlie's Angels or anything similar to that, where the songs get too much. If anything, they capture the feel-good nature of the film perfectly.Now for the performances. I have already mentioned Cynthia Rhodes, but I thought that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey gave the roles of their careers in Dirty Dancing. Their partnership was like Torvill and Dean on ice, unquestionably brilliant. Jerry Orbach gives a wonderful performance also as the earnest Jake Housemann.In conclusion, with a couple of minor flaws, Dirty Dancing is a treat, for those into dancing.8/10.

2,Leofwine_draca,Not my cup of tea,5,18 September 2021,"A rare film aimed almost entirely at a female audience for a change. Some good dancing scenes and a charismatic performance from Patrick Swayze are about all this had to offer me as a male viewer. I can see why it's classic and well-regarded, it's pretty obvious that Swayze has a lot of allure, but it's not my cup of tea.",Dirty Dancing
3,SnoopyStyle,iconic memorable charming melodrama,7,8 February 2014,"It's 1963 in more innocent times. Baby (Jennifer Grey) is a daddy's girl who only wants to be in the Peace Corps. She and her family is spending the summer in Kellerman's Mountain House in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. It's a vanilla existence until she starts to see the world behind the curtains. The waiters are all recruited from the ivy leagues in order to flirt with the daughters especially the dogs. The owner's son is a jerk that is pushed on Baby. Then she discovers the help's party. When Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) needs an abortion, Baby agrees to take her place in a dance show with charismatic dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Then Penny gets horribly ill, and her doctor father (Jerry Orbach) comes to the rescue discovering that Baby lied to get the money for the abortion. He forbids her to associate with those people, and Baby is forced to disobey his father for the first time in her life.This is an absolute charmer. It is very old school melodrama. Like the time period, this movie is a much more innocent fare. Of course, there are the iconic scenes, the memorable dance move, the fun, and the great song. On top of everything, there is the beautiful Jennifer Grey and the charming Patrick Swayze. The biggest complaint seems to be the clinches and the sentimentality. However that's most of its charm. It's an uncomplicated times gone by.",Dirty Dancing
4,Prismark10,Do the mashed potato,7,23 December 2014,"Dirty Dancing was a sleeper hit that launched a phenomenal hit album. It is now regarded as a romantic musical classic. Some of the songs from the film have become unforgettable hits and the dance moves are now much mimicked.The film is set in the Catskill mountain holiday resort in the summer of 1963. Dr Houseman and his family are taking their annual three weeks holiday there. The youngest daughter Baby has taken a shine to the dance teacher, Johnny Castle who introduces her to a more wild style of dancing that the entertainment staff get up to.When Castle's female dance partner falls pregnant by one of the waiter's, Baby gets some money for her to have an abortion which gets botched and she has to go to her father to help her out. Her father is angry and forbids her to have anything do with Castle and the rest of the entertainment team. However she continues to see and learn to dance with Castle and they fall in love.The film is cheesy with some predictable plotting and a few bad lines including the now infamous, 'nobody puts Baby in a corner.' It has some hissable characters such as the immoral waiter and wannabee doctor who is dating Baby's sister and who knocked up Johnny's dance partner and then washed his hands off her. There is also the slimy nephew of the holiday camp owner with his constant veiled threats against the camp staff.Given all that it is still an enjoyable film now ripe with nostalgia and some cracking songs. Jennifer Grey is vulnerable enough and she has a good chemistry with Patrick Swayze. But this is really Swayze's film, he dances, he broods, he sings and he steals the film.Dirty Dancing shows a world that is changing something Dr Houseman wants to resist with his regular holiday at the Catskills with his daughters. Even the camp owner has realised that times are changing as young people want to go to Europe rather than spend a few weeks at the camp. The dance teachers are bored of the sedate dance lessons when they know that they are capable of more hip and happening dance styles and of course Vietnam war is round the corner. Its almost a final visit to a fading lifestyle and an emergence of a new youth culture that Dirty Dancing celebrates.",Dirty Dancing
5,kosmasp,Forbidden Dance,8,29 June 2021,"Is the movie predictable? Does it ooze with Cliches? Might it annoy you with its romantic/soft tones? Well the latter question is one only you can answer ... the other ones are quite easy to answer. No matter if you like the movie or not ... but it is beloved for many reasons. One that is not mentioned enough is the soundtrack! Just great songs all the way through.The other obvious reasons are the main actors/characters. You have Patrick Swayze - the hot rebel ... hard on the inside, soft as cotton on the inside. So frail that some men may have quite a few issues with him. But this is not aimed at any macho loving public - this is aimed at women! And their fantasy - most of them that is, because as with men you can't say they are all the same.The fact that this man, who seems so full of confidence has no idea ... makes him more than attractive to women ... and some men of course. Let's not forget about them as well. So while you can dissect this really easy ... you can also just enjoy the romp - and maybe carry a watermelon ... although you probably are more likely to get excited about the nobody puts baby in the corner line ... if you don't get goosebumps towards the end ... well it is an indication that you probably won't like the movie as much.A clash of rich and poor ... of sex through dance ... those motions ... those hip movements ... there was a time where this was not only dirty dancing, but also illegal dancing ... good thing we do not live in a time like that, right? That aside, the movie really is quite the experience ... in a really good sense.",Dirty Dancing
6,gavin6942,"Very Memorable Film, Timeless",7,28 July 2010,"In the 1960s, during a family summer getaway, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) meets dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) and falls hard for him... with his bad reputation and her father (Jerry Orbach) being a reputable doctor, what will become of this relationship? ""Dirty Dancing"" is one of the quintessential films of the 1980s. If you grew up in the 80s, you probably saw this film a dozen times. I know I did. I recall seeing it again and again in the summer of 1992, and have returned to it many times since.Patrick Swayze should not be underestimated, and this is one of the cornerstones of his career (along with ""Ghost"" and ""Road House""). And Jennifer Grey is 1980s through and through -- aside from this and ""Feris Bueller"", what can you say for her? But the film has charm, is very quotable, and despite delving into some questionable territory (both ethical and political questions are hinted at) it is at its heart a family values film: daughter growing up and a father who loves and supports her maturity and independence.",Dirty Dancing
7,lee_eisenberg,"Dance, she said.",10,17 March 2006,"By now, it seems that no one debates that ""Dirty Dancing"" is probably the best dance-related movie ever. The plot of course has pampered Jewish teenager Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) feeling unfulfilled with the Catskill resort where her family stays in summer, 1963, and falling in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). The movie is good in many respects: aside from the ultra-cool soundtrack, it shows the disgusting-ness inherent in the resort, and the unpleasant - if not dorky - people who stay there.All in all, this is a movie not to be missed. You'll love both Baby and Johnny, and Baby's sister is sure to make your skin crawl. A great movie.",Dirty Dancing
8,jboothmillard,Dirty Dancing,8,25 June 2007,"There are many movies that define the 1980s, and chick flicks that everyone recommends, this is one of the best examples, and from the year I was born, directed by Emile Ardolino (Three Men and a Little Lady, Sister Act). Basically set in the 1960s, seventeen-year-old Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Grey) is vacationing with her family at Kellerman's resort in the Catskill Mountains, her doctor father Jake (Jerry Orbach) is the personal physician for resort proprietor Max Kellerman (Jack Weston). Baby befriends Max's grandson Neil (Lonny Price), and develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle (Golden Globe nominated Patrick Swayze), she is fascinated by his ""dirty dancing"". Baby discovers Johnny's dance partner Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant, womanising waiter Robbie Gould (Max Cantor) is the father, he is also dating and cheating on Baby's older sister Lisa (Jane Brucker). Baby borrows money from her father, she does not tell him it is for an illegal abortion for Penny, she accepts the money, but she and Johnny are due to perform a weekly dance at the nearby resort Sheldrake, she will miss the performance if she goes ahead with the abortion, and they will forfeit their season salary, Billy suggests Johnny to teach Baby to dance and take her place. Johnny begins to teach Baby, the two have many awkward practise sessions together, but she gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction develops between them, their performance at the Sheldrake Hotel is mostly successful, although Baby was too nervous to do the final lift. Johnny and Baby return to find Penny in agony, it turns out the doctor who performed the abortion was a back alley hack, Jake treats her, despite her anger with Baby using money to pay for the procedure, he forbids her to associate with Johnny or his friends. But Baby returns to Johnny to apologise for her father's behaviour, they dance together, and afterwards have sex, Jake tells his family they will be leaving early, but Lisa protests, wanting to sing at the end-of-season talent show, Jake gives in, and despite her father's warning, Baby continues to see Johnny. With his feelings for Baby, Johnny refuses payment to have sex with Vivian Pressman (Miranda Garrison), Vivian instead pays Robbie for sex, they are caught by Lisa, the following morning Vivian sees Baby leaving Johnny's cabin. Later, Max and Neil (Lonny Price) reveal to the Housemans that the wallet of Moe Pressman (Garry Goodrow) was stolen, Vivian accuses Johnny of the theft, in jealousy over his rejection, Johnny cannot give a verifiable alibi, but Baby saves him, confessing that she was him all night, so is not responsible. Johnny is cleared of the theft, it is revealed two elderly guests, Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher, are the culprits, but Max fires Johnny anyway for having a fraternising affair with Baby, Johnny and Baby embrace and bid farewell to each other, saying they have no regrets, despite the objections of her father. The end-of-season talent show is in progress, Jake takes back a recommendation letter for medical school for Robbie when he reveals he got Penny pregnant and insults and Baby, and Johnny walks in as staff and guests, including Lisa, are together on stage singing the closing song. Johnny leads Baby onstage to interrupt the show, he has returned to do the last dance of the season, he makes a brief speech about how ""Frances"" has made him a better man. Baby and Johnny perform a more provocative version of their Mambo duet, other ""dirty dancers"" join, Baby runs to Johnny and executes the lift they'd practised, all guests join the celebration, Jake apologises to Johnny and reconciles with Baby, the couple embrace and everyone dances joyously. Also starring Kelly Bishop as Marjorie Houseman, Charles 'Honi' Coles as Tito Suarez, 'Cousin Brucie' Morrow as Magician and Wayne Knight as Stan. Then unknown Swayze became a huge star following his great charismatic performance, Grey is equally great as the feisty middle-class teenager, they are a very convincing on screen couple. The story is nice and simple, the love story formed over dancing is sweet, the soundtrack is fantastic, with recognisable 60s songs, and original songs, including ""Hungry Eyes"" by Eric Carmen and ""She's Like the Wind"" by Patrick Swayze, and the very erotic and raunchy dance sequences are superbly choreographed, it is a most enjoyable romantic drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, it was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Nobody puts Baby in the corner.""), and it was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for the Oscar and Golden Globe winning ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"". Very good!",Dirty Dancing
9,ccthemovieman-1,"If You've Grown Up, Skip This Movie",1,13 August 2007,"This reminded me of many of the 1970s sleazy films with tons of unlikeable characters with low morals and being portrayed by the sick scriptwriters as ""good people."" This movie was a favorite of of many, especially teenage girls who saw a real poor role model in Jennifer Grey's ""Frances 'Baby' Houseman."" Grey was extremely irritating to watch to listen to, a big pain in the butt. I laugh at some of these reviews that cite her ""depth"" and ""dimension."" Give me a break: she's a slimeball. Only a likewise immature bimbo would enjoy this movie.As bad as Grey's character is in here, Patrick Swayze's ""Johnny Castle"" isn't a whole lot better. He's a guy trying to seduce a teenager via his dancing prowess. That's all we need to see in that age of child sex molesters on the web and who knows where else. At least she was 17 so I guess the filmmakers felt that was old enough.From the sex-obsessed leads, to abortions, to the father changing his mind and giving approval to this male scum, this script offers nothing redeemable. ""Baby"" has no clue about anything and is one of the dumbest characters ever seen on film. I am not surprised to read about so many reviewers who thought this was ""cool"" when they were young and stupid, but now that they are a lot more mature, look at this film again almost in shock at how bad it looks to them now. Good for them; at least they've grown up.",Dirty Dancing
10,Tweekums,An enjoyable romance which has become something of a classic,8,6 May 2016,"It is 1963 and the Houseman family are spending their summer at a resort on the Catskill Mountains; it is the sort of place well to do families go to holiday and boys get waiting jobs before heading off to Ivy League universities. It is quite clear that many of the families hope their daughters might meet a nice prospective husband there they certainly aren't expected to get involved with the other staff; the professional dance instructors who are seen as being from the wrong side of the tracks. Frances ""Baby"" Houseman finds herself attracted to one of these 'bad boys', Johnny Castle, after she strays into the staff area and sees them 'dirty dancing'. Initially he sees her as just another rich girl who thinks she knows it all, but then she helps when his dance partner Penny needs money for an abortion. This means he needs a new dance partner for an event at another hotel and Baby volunteers; so begins her dancing lessons. After the event they return and learn that Penny's abortion was horribly botched; Baby takes control of the situation and gets her father, who is a doctor. This has an obvious effect on their relationship; he feels he can no longer trust her and he certainly doesn't want her seeing Johnny again.I first saw this film many years ago but had forgotten most of it so thought it might be worth watching again. The overall story is reasonably predictable but there are some surprises; the illegal abortion subplot is certainly darker than one might expect in a romantic story. This does add to the plot though; bringing Baby and Johnny closer together as well as driving a wedge between Baby and her father. In a film like this the music is obviously important and even though the music isn't of the period it is effective; this is especially true of the finale where Baby and Johnny dance to 'The Time of Your Life' which provides the film's most memorable moment. The leads do an impressive job; Jennifer Grey may not be conventionally sexy but she has plenty of attitude which makes her character and her relationship believable. Patrick Swayze also impresses as Johnny. These two have a good chemistry and their relationship develops nicely through the film as does Baby's dancing ability. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching even if you aren't a fan of romances.",Dirty Dancing
11,moonspinner55,"Swoony-eyed boy-girl stuff, aided by the musical uplift...",6,19 March 2008,"Although set in 1963, the popular, music-driven ""Dirty Dancing"" is betrayed by its false sense of nostalgia; rarely have I seen a movie which looked so unlike what it was allegedly about. However, anachronisms aside, the casting of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey pays off: these two definitely have the charisma the story requires, and their union is nearly credible. Plot has a gawky young woman vacationing in the Catskills with her parents, learning to loosen up with help from a slightly-older man who works as a professional dancer. Two silly subplots, one about an unwanted pregnancy and the other involving a stolen wallet, just about render the melodramatics inherent in the scenario utterly superfluous. Who cares about some guy's wallet? It just chews up time until the inevitable finale--an enthusiastic, celebratory climax--and that's where the picture cannot go wrong. **1/2 from ****",Dirty Dancing
12,edwagreen,Nothing Dirty About this Dancing ****,9,22 February 2007,"A fabulous film capturing life in the Catskills for Jewish people years ago.Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were perfectly cast as the lovers who meet by chance in the summer of 1963. Jennifer's doctor father, played to the hilt by Jerry Orbach, takes the family on a summer vacation and Grey is immediately attracted to dancer Swayze along with his group of dancers.Besides the terrific dancing and music, the acting is terrific. Yes, there is plenty of stereotyping but it's well worth it.Max, the owner of the hotel, played to perfection by Jack Weston, conveys the spirit that existed at these hotels in the 1950s and beyond.There are certainly exceptions to the usual stereotyping. The prospective doctor, who is a summer waiter, gets a girl into trouble and it is immediately assumed that the swinger Swayze is the father. Wait to you see who has committed all those robberies at the hotel. You'll laugh out loud.This is a rare gem of a film since it so beautifully captured the period of time as we discovered and evaluated our youth.You will want to dance up a storm when you see this one. Hard to believe that 20 years has gone by since the film was made. Jennifer Grey, daughter of Oscar winner Joel Grey, had such talent and potential What became of her?",Dirty Dancing
13,sunwarrior13,All The Elements Of A Guilty Pleasure,7,13 October 2011,"What movie has all the elements of a guilty pleasure? I think that Dirty Dancing has all of it.The movie stars Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles as Johnny and Baby respectively.The cast also includes Cynthia Rhodes and Jerry Orbach. The story is a coming of age drama that documents a teenage girl's rebellion against her father by starting a relationship with a dance instructor during the family's summer vacation.The film was set in thee summer of 1963.A 17-year-old New Yorker Frances ""Baby"" Houseman is vacationing with her affluent family at Kellerman's,a resort in the Catskill Mountains. She is planning to attend Mount Holyoke College to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. Her father, Jake, is the personal physician of Max Kellerman, the owner of the resort.Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle, part of the working class entertainment staff. When she, while carrying a watermelon, is invited to one of their secret after-hour parties, she observes the ""dirty dancing"" for the first time. She is intrigued by the sexy dancing, and receives a brief, impromptu lesson from Johnny. Later, she discovers that his dance partner Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) is distraught over being pregnant by Robbie Gould,the womanizing waiter who is dating and cheating on Baby's sister Lisa. In her efforts to help, Baby also becomes Penny's substitute dancer for a performance at the Sheldrake, a nearby resort where Johnny and Penny perform annually. The upcoming show requires Johnny to train Baby to become a better dancer and learn the required routine.As Baby becomes Johnny's pupil in dancing, tempers flare and a romance begins to develop in the process. Their performance at the Sheldrake goes reasonably well, though she is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic lift. When they return to Kellerman's, they learn that Penny's backstreet abortion was botched, leaving her in agonizing pain. Baby brings her father to help, but he assumes that the pregnancy was caused by Johnny, and he therefore forbids Baby to have anything to do with Johnny or his friends. Jake is furious at Baby for lying to him and betraying his trust. Baby, however, defies him and sneaks out to visit Johnny in his room that same night, where they consummate their blossoming romance.Johnny's and Baby's relationship is eventually revealed after Johnny is accused of stealing a wallet from one of the resort guests and is unable to provide a verifiable alibi. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny could not have been responsible as she was with him in his cabin that night. He is eventually cleared of the theft charge, but is still fired for having an affair with a guest. However, Baby's selfless act inspires Johnny to realize that ""there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them."" Even after being fired, Johnny returns to the resort to perform the final dance of the season with Baby. The film ends with an iconic dance finale.Just like what I said in the first paragraph,I think that the 1987 movie,Dirty Dancing has ALL THE ELEMENTS OF GUILTY PLEASURE.It has drama,comedy,romance between two people of different backgrounds - rich and poor,cheese,predictability,teen-age lust,trying to find oneself and of course,dancing.The DANCE FINALE between Johnny and Baby remains ICONIC up to present.There is a lot more I can tell you that.That is why this movie has become a favorite of many people all throughout the years despite of its predictability and many plot holes.Of course,what makes is memorable is the Oscar Best Original Song winner,""(I've Had) The Time Of My Life"" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.Added to that,the title of the movie,""Dirty Dancing"" was not about dirty dancing at all BUT to catch the audience attention into watching the movie.Although a lot of people do enjoy this movie not due to the intelligence of the story BUT due to the pleasure,numerous formula found in other movies and entertainment it provides to the viewer.Honestly,I believe that this is a classic movie in the 1980's but not a timeless one due to just like what I said,""Dirty Dancing contains all the elements of guilty pleasure"". A 7/10 rating is fair for this movie.",Dirty Dancing

It's an OK dance movie about a middle-class girl who meets a boy, falls for the boy, learns to dance with the boy and ends up in love with the boy whilst the boy (""Johnny"") reciprocates, dumping his long term girlfriend on the way. There are a couple of insubstantial sub-plots bubbling along to sustain things between the statically choreographed dance routines, before, mercifully, it is rescued by Bill Medley, Jennifer Warnes and a cracking tenor sax at the end.

18,anaconda-40658,Overrated Square Dance Crap.,2,15 June 2015,"Dirty Dancing (1987): Dir: Emile Ardolino / Cast: Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach, Cynthia Rhodes, Max Cantor: Overrated sleaze fest shading permissive sex dancing with secondary social themes. Its title references the forbidden. On a family vacation a young woman meets a male dance trainer and she replaces his pregnant partner. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey travel a predictable Romeo and Juliet formula. She will fall for him thus opening up arguments with her disapproving father. And he will, of course, prove himself worthy of this woman after hours of dance training. It is no surprise when she finally does the lift move that she faltered earlier. Supporting roles are a host of embarrassing stereotypes including Jerry Orbach as her strict father in a role rehearsed and performed a thousand times over and it is getting old. Cynthia Rhodes plays the pregnant dancer whom Grey will replace thus stealing the spotlight from. Max Cantor plays the ever familiar womanizing ass whom everyone will see through long after viewers do. Directed by Emile Ardolino with steamy dance numbers sidelining potential theme with a potential orgy. The soundtrack album is catchy with many memorable songs but the film itself is a cliché filled bore that is just an excuse to throw together a mindless erotic tease. In the end this film should be danced upon by a herd of elephants. Score: 2 / 10",Dirty Dancing
19,Wuchakk,"Entertaining hit with lush Appalachian locations, but the writing doesn't respect the intelligence of the viewer",6,12 March 2014,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Emile Ardolino, ""Dirty Dancing"" stars Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Jennifer Grey costars as ""Baby,"" the 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.This was the hit romantic drama of 1987, but it actually didn't make as much at the domestic box office compared to the other two dance flicks of the 80s: ""Flashdance"" (1983) made $95 million and ""Footloose"" (1984) $80 million while ""Dirty Dancing"" brought it $64 million. The two main cast members are a highlight. Swayze was in his prime and Jennifer Grey cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looked it, albeit trim and fit.The lush Appalachian locations are outstanding and the story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60's ""Beach"" movies if the male-female relationships were as ""squeaky clean"" as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): ""As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option."" The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the ""other side of the tracks.""Moreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end, a dude who's fornicating with his under-aged daughter and is clearly much older than her as well, although it could be argued that he's naïve and doesn't necessarily know they're having sex already. Flaws like these smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.If you can look past these problems, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called ""Dirty Dancing,"" huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie: these scenes are so amped-up and choreographed they shout to the viewer via megaphone: ""This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL."" Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man and the beautiful Appalachian locations are a highlight, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. Maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a no brainer! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a film. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. Well, Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.",Dirty Dancing
21,mm-39,Well my wife liked it,5,2 July 2001,"My wife love this  film, she thinks this relationship movie is great.  I found it ok the first time, but second time its  more soap operish.  They do this big dance at the end of the summer for a bunch of campers, after both lead character live becomes messes big deal.  The movie seem hopeless, and pointless.  I might be wrong, but this movie will not age well.",Dirty Dancing
22,Mr-Fusion,"Didn't have the time of my life, but it's pretty good",6,31 August 2014,"Even if you're not into chick flicks, DIRTY DANCING is worth the price of admission just for the two leads alone. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze (rest his soul) make for ideal casting. Their intensity smolders, and that kind of chemistry doesn't grow on trees. Oh, and Cynthia Rhodes' dancing scene - that was five kinds of steamy. Geez, that woman. And I was onboard with the '80s songs in an early '60s movie (it oddly works) until the kid put on the record and an '80s song actually starts playing. Nevermind that it was the extremely schmaltzy ""The Time of My Life"", that was just cheese overboard. Although in all fairness, this movie does not shy away from the cheese: ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner""; really, she's just sitting there at the table, it's not like someone backs her into the margins literally. It's a really hammy metaphor. But this movie was surprisingly involving; and at the very least, the dancing scenes are worth it.6.5/10",Dirty Dancing
23,JamesHitchcock,"""Burn the negative, and collect the insurance.""",7,18 June 2010,"The traditional Hollywood musical, generally based upon a Broadway show, went into something of a decline in the late seventies and eighties, but this period also saw the rise of a new type of musical based upon dance and pop music; ""Saturday Night Fever"" and its sequel ""Staying Alive"", ""Grease"", ""Fame"" and ""Flashdance"" are all examples. Most of these films (""Grease"" being an exception) differ from the traditional musical in that the characters do not normally sing except in situations where people would sing in real life.""Dirty Dancing"" is another film of this type. It is set during the summer of 1963, a date which here carries a certain significance. The late fifties and early sixties, the period immediately preceding the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam war, are often seen as America's age of lost innocence, a view reflected in other nostalgic movies from the seventies and eighties such as ""American Graffiti"", ""Grease"" and ""Diner"".The film tells the story of the Housemans, an affluent Jewish family from New York, spending their summer vacation at a resort in the Catskill Mountains. In particular it tells the story of their 17-year-old daughter Baby and Johnny, a dance instructor working at the resort. (Baby's real name is Frances, although we don't find this out until well into the film). Much of the running time is taken up by dance scenes, and the film is sometimes dismissed as a ""feelgood movie"". Although much of the music is of a cheerful nature and the film has an optimistic ending, I feel that there is more to it than that. The word ""feelgood"" suggests something shallow, whereas ""Dirty Dancing"" treats some rather deeper themes than is normal in pop-and-dance musicals.One of these themes is that of social class. Here in Britain, we tend to analyse class differences in excruciating detail (not only in the cinema, but in the theatre, on television and in literature too), but in America Hollywood often glosses over the subject. Here, however, it is brought more to the fore. The Housemans are middle-class, Johnny and the rest of the entertainment staff are working-class. Even within the resort there are class differences; some of the staff are middle-class students working in the vacation to fund their university courses, and they are permitted to fraternise with the guests much more than the entertainers. Baby's family disapprove of her relationship with Johnny, but have no objection to her older sister Lisa dating Robbie, a waiter in the holidays but a medical student in term-time.A second theme is that of the relationship between the generations, specifically father-daughter relationships. (Baby's mother plays a less important role in the film). Baby's father Jake, a successful doctor, is a political liberal who supports all the right progressive causes. Baby is planning to study the economics of underdeveloped countries at university and then enter the Peace Corps, and there is a strong implication that this future is one that has been mapped out for her by her family, not chosen by herself. Even her name is taken from that of Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Despite his political liberalism, however, Jake is much more conservative when it comes to family matters and is a rather authoritarian father. The title of the film reflects the older generation's disapproval of the new styles of dancing popular among the young at this period.A third theme, and a controversial one, is that of abortion. There is a subplot involving Johnny's dance partner Penny, who gets pregnant and has an abortion at a time when it was still illegal. Jake's disapproval of his daughter's lover is based not solely on social class but on the mistaken belief that Johnny was responsible for Penny's pregnancy. It turns out, in fact, that the real culprit was Robbie, a serial womaniser and first class cad; when Jake realises this he does at least have the grace to apologise to Johnny.""Dirty Dancing"" was made on a low budget, and initially the studio (the recently formed Vestron Pictures) did not hold out much hope for it; according to one story the producer's reaction on first seeing the finished film was ""Burn the negative, and collect the insurance."" It had no major stars; Patrick Swayze did not count as such in 1987. Critical reaction was lukewarm, and in some cases much worse than lukewarm; Roger Ebert complained of its ""idiot plot"". Yet was a massive success at the box office, proving that critics can't be right all the time, and remains popular to this day.Part of the reason for its success was doubtless its nostalgic charm; nostalgia for the sixties has been an important part of American and European culture ever since 1970, or at least since 1973 when ""American Graffiti"" appeared. The film is, however, about more than just vintage pop music. It was the film that made a star of Swayze, although, strangely, its female lead Jennifer Grey never really had a comparable success in her later films. Perhaps she was a better dancer than she was an actress; although she is good at conveying emotion through gesture and facial expression, her lines are not always delivered clearly.""Dirty Dancing"" is also a sensitive coming of age drama about a young girl finding herself and discovering a strength of character she never knew she had. Certainly, part of its appeal is due to its straightforward morality of ""be true to yourself"" and ""do the right thing"". The final scene, where Johnny lifts Baby above his head at the climax of their dance, is one of the great finales of movie history. I am always surprised that it did not give rise to a sequel. (Unless you count the boring ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"", essentially a remake in a more exotic setting). 7/10",Dirty Dancing
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Yeah, it's a little unoriginal, but it's a pretty cool flick",7,19 November 2003,"I know, I know, every teenager loves this film. It's like their fantasy life to meet someone wonderful on their vacation. But I did like this movie. It has a great story line. And Jennifer Grey & Patrick Swazey are a great duo in this film. They just worked their chemistry on screen.
************POSSIBLE SPOILERS************Baby is a teenage girl who goes on a vacation with her family. And it's nothing but cheesy family activities. And everyone acts like they know Baby well. When the entertainment staff comes in, she notices one man. Johnny, a greaser who is a dance teacher. When his partner gets pregnant, she has to get an abortion. Otherwise, they'll loose their jobs. But they also have a show, and if they don't do that, they'll loose their jobs. And the only appointment for the abortion is the night of the show. So, Baby volunteers to be Johnny's partner. And they fall for each other in the process of Baby learning how to dance.It's a cute story line. I was a little surprised at the rating, but you can't win 'em all.7/10",Dirty Dancing
25,DKosty123,Proto Type For 1980's Musical,7,7 March 2008,"Jerry Orbach, Patrick Swayzee, & a few others do pretty well with this movie. The soundtrack is terrific especially digging out old gems like Big Girls Don't Cry by Frankie Valli & Wipe Out by the Safaris. The story itself is a typical 80's musical harmless plot. Can baby keep her virginity while learning to dance from the hot dirty dance teacher? The best part of this film is the fact it gives the viewer an early 60's feel for the suburbs outside of New York City. It is quite notable that it does this as this feel is what gets this film to a 7 in my analysis. Not a real serious film but a film which reflects the early 60's well. It has plenty going for it & is the best of a terrible decade of Musicals known as the 1980's. This looks like a masterpiece when you compare it to 1980's Popeye. At least in this movie, I am what I am.",Dirty Dancing
26,OllieSuave-007,Another iconic movie of the 80s.,7,6 July 2014,"Dirty Dancing is one of the most iconic movies of the 1980s, a story where Frances Houseman (Jennifer Grey) falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) while spending the summer at a holiday camp with her family.This is one of those movies I saw once when I was a kid. While I don't remember much of it, I do recall finding the chemistry between Frances and Johnny very endearing - one of the most cinematic couples in movie history. The dance scenes between the couple are well-choreographed and awe-inspiring, helped by a catchy soundtrack and breathtaking songs, including ""Hungry Eyes"" and ""Time of your Life."" Actor Jerry Orbach was one of the better supporting actors in the movie, doing a great job in playing the calm and stern, yet kind father to Frances. The script to the film isn't bad; found it quite entertaining. It is just a little sappy at times and the pacing is kind of slow in certain parts. Overall, it's a nice piece of romantic drama with memorable songs.Grade B-",Dirty Dancing
27,thesar-2,Each Dance is The Time of My Life,10,6 February 2011,"Despite my high rating (5/5 Stars) for Dirty Dancing, I admit: it's a guilty pleasure.Sure it's not perfect. Sure, some lines could be considered ""clichéd"" and the movie's not that unpredictable. But, it's my life. Literally.No, no one calls me baby, or puts me in a corner – I do that very well on my own. But, I grew up on this flick after my sister, who was the world to me growing up, introduced it to me. Since then, I've probably seen this roughly 34 times. And each timeit gets me.The songs – oh, God, the fantastic soundtrack, the love – proved very well by the wonderful acting of Jennifer Grey as Baby, and the comedy – I still laugh at the jokes, comedic scenes and the silliness portrayed by the boss's son, Neil (Lonny Price) and Baby's sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker.)In my traveled opinion, this movie is an absolute timeless classic. No copy, including the (still unseen by me prequel) can touch it or move me like this movie does. And even the by-a-mile foreseen finale lifts me each time. Yeah, even with what some (not me) would consider the corny line to get Baby onto the stage and away from the judgmental father, Jake (Jerry Orbach.)Setting the movie back in the 1960s was clever. For one, it was a good way to make this movie timeless to avoid the typical 80s haircuts, outfits and attitudes. Also, it got to introduce black-jacketed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a (fairly decent) character. A new ""Fonzi"" (Henry Winkler in Happy Days) or ""Danny Zuko"" (John Travolta in Grease), if you will.Daddy's little girl (Baby) gets a little too curious at a summer retreat when she gets bored and meets the dance crew of the resort. All but immediately, ""Miss Fixit"" gets involved in trying to help Johnny's (the dreamboat of her affection) dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), with getting an abortion. With a little hesitation, Penny accepts the help (cash from big daddy's wallet) but this sets off a chain of events.Number one: inexperienced dancer Baby must replace Penny in a gig at a local hotel – enter in dance-instructor Johnny and let the sparks fly. Number two: the abortion from the backdoor doc nearly kills Penny and Daddy must intervene when he originally didn't know where his money went. And number three: Though Baby did nothing officially wrong, Daddy's trust in his #1 child (shhh, don't tell the idiot sister) has been waned.Will Baby set things right with Daddy? Will Baby grow up to be with Johnny? You'll just have to tune inas if you haven't seen this movie before. If you ever wanted to, you have, at least a dozen times. Or if you're the football lovin', macho male who despises ""chick-flicks"" you really should put down your guard and see this one of a kind film.One of a kind is right. Aside from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the more recent Dancing with the Stars, you can only really enjoy Jennifer Grey here. Her acting was spot on. Her subtle glances have me rolling, but deeper, they're very true to her character. It's what a lot of us go through.And too bad for two of the leads who are no longer with us. The extremely kind-hearted Patrick Swayze was very good for his roll, not to mention danced awesome (with a little help from the equally impressive Cynthia Rhodes.) Also, Jerry Orbach was perfect for what he needed to be as Baby's daddy.While the rest of the cast was great for comic relief or additional (and superb) dancing, the cinematography was wonderful, the editing great and as already mentioned: it had one of my favorite soundtracks. One song in particular – She's Like the Wind was sung (and (co-)written!) professionally and beautifully by none other than Mr. Swayze, himself. The music was so abundant and fantastic, they needed to add a ""More Dirty Dancing"" soundtrack. Though, not as great as the original, it's a certainly necessary addition to any fan's collection.This movie should also be featured on the AMC's Movies That Shook the World collection/TV series. For, it had its share of controversy – Ooohhhthey really are DIRTY dancingPER SHAME! and check out Baby's age in comparison to Johnny's. Also, it spawned a completely unnecessary prequel – again, I haven't seen, so I will try to keep my judgment out of it. However that turns out, this is a heartwarming and complete story. No need to go expand or see what happened beforehand. And finally, it should be labeled as influential for the spinoffs (as most movies don't get that far): the short-lived TV series and the stage version. If I remember correctly, they once toured here, in Phoenix, for the AZ State Fair in the 1980s.Dirty Dancing is a must see. Period. It won't change the Earth, it won't cure cancer and it's certainly a ""leave your brain at the door""/guilty-pleasure film. But for film lovers, true movie connoisseurs, you have to watch all types of films and this 1980s classic absolutely should be on your list.",Dirty Dancing
28,gridoon,Corny and phony.,4,11 December 1999,"There are a few positive things I can say about ""Dirty Dancing"": some of the dance sequences are indeed impressive, a few even have an undeniable erotic tension. The actors are generally convincing, the production values good and the film moves along at an agreeably fast pace - you're never bored. Still, this film is mostly AWFUL. There isn't ONE character that doesn't behave like a complete stereotype, there isn't ONE plot development that you can't predict about ten minutes before it appears onscreen. According to this film's naive, extremely corny vision, people can change and learn all the basic human values (and how to dance like professionals) within a few days. At the end, after the obligatory apologies, explanations and confessions, everybody is happy and everything is solved. Stuck with a predictable, by-the-numbers script, the director makes a watchable, even entertaining at times film, and Swayze with Grey have a genuine chemistry together, and the music is great, but this film is so sappy that only the most undemanding viewers can possibly like it. Really corny.",Dirty Dancing
29,Robert_duder,An absolute classic with this magic aura around it making it unmissable,10,1 July 2007,"Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies of all time...I'm not afraid to admit it, watch it, LOVE IT...and I'm straight!! Dirty Dancing is one of the fastest growing classics of all time now twenty years after it's original release. It seems like almost everyone has seen it, quoted it, talked about it, know of it...it's quite simply magical. The film isn't really BRILLIANT, it's not breath taking in the traditional sense of the word, it's not feat of acting or story so what exactly makes it so incredible?? Magic. Chemistry. The sexiest movie of all time without even a hint of nudity, extreme language, or gratuitous sex. It's just like being dropped into your own summer of love so to speak. It's a coming of age story, a moralistic lesson in standing up, speaking your mind, and helping others against all costs and all the while learning about yourself and becoming an adult. It's simple to see that writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein passionately wrote on her own experiences and has a very passionate and romantic mind set when she writes. The characters are almost very shallow and yet you become completely entangled in their lives and you won't ever forget Baby and Johnny Castle.Jennifer Grey headlines the cast as seventeen year old Frances 'Baby' Houseman. Grey is beautiful and sexy but in this very withdrawn, quiet way. It's not overwhelming beauty or screen presence but something very subtle about her. (Grey was actually 27 when she portrayed this role.) This will be (somewhat unfortunately) Grey's greatest role that she will forever be immortalized for. And then Mr. Patrick Swayze. I am a huge Swayze fan and will forever be waiting for his come back to the big screen. He is multi-talented and a great presence and has had some great roles but I'm not sure any compare to the macho, steaming hot, rhythm dancer Johnny Castle. Swayze is just the exact definition of macho but a dancer which seems like an oxy-moron but it's not because he made dancing macho!! He looks incredible doing it, the man is a master on his feet and in the same breath can knock scum bag waiter Robby's block off. Swayze was brilliant. They could not have cast a better actor for this part. The two of them together is really the point of magic. Grey and Swayze are just jaw dropping in this love hate, intense passionate incredibly sexy affair that they have. When they dance together you just can't take your eyes off of them. The supporting cast are almost as important as the main cast because there is just something so incredible about this cast. First of all the late Jerry Orbach is really something as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father. He really has a great role and is a significant player in the film. Cynthia Rhodes shines as dancer Penny Johnson who finds herself pregnant and alone and scared with only Johnny to turn to. Jack Weston as the caring but firm owner of the Kellerman's hideaway that they stay at is terrific, and Jane Brucker as the older sister of Baby far more concerned with menial things like her appearance and personality and her relationship with Robby the waiter. Max Cantor is downright slimy as the womanizer Robby who gets Penny in trouble and then moves on to Lisa Houseman. These are just a few of the really stand out supporting roles in Dirty Dancing.You just simply won't find choreography that stuns like Dirty Dancing whether it's the crazy kids alone in their compound Dirty Dancing or whether it's Baby and Johnny on stage, or the final scene dancing at Kellerman's...even if you're not a fan of dancing you can't help but stare in awe. Then you have the romance and the music...I could write an entire review on the music. Dirty Dancing has some of the best musical montages in history including my personal all time favorite and one of my all time favorite moments in movie history, the 'Hungry Eyes' sang by Eric Carmen montage where Baby learns to dance. I could watch that scene over and over and over again. Dirty Dancing is a hard film to explain because there isn't anything else like it. They've tried to repeat the success with a short lived TV Series (which I would kill to see) and a sequel: Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights which was average in every sense of the word. The only thing that can be said is that there was a magic where everything fell into place...the cast, the music, the setting, the story, the famous lines: ""I carried a Watermelon?"" ""Nobody puts baby in a corner."" ""...most of all I'm afraid of walking out of here and never feeling again the way I feel when I'm with you."" If you haven't seen this film...you're downright crazy because it's brilliant and an instant classic forever in my top 5 of all time. 10/10",Dirty Dancing
30,ElMaruecan82,"Not flawless, but when judged in the light of what is done today, ""Dirty Dancing"" is a definite classic ...",7,14 September 2013,"To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, ""Dirty Dancing"" plays like the third opus of an unofficial ""Summer 62-63"" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon.The first two films were ""American Graffiti"" and ""Animal House"", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. ""Animal House"" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And ""Dirty Dancing"" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three.But is that a criticism? In fact, ""Dirty Dancing"" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of ""9½ Weeks"". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal ""I've Had the Time of My Life"" finale, these considerations hardly matter.Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how ""Dirty Dancing"" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point.For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, à la ""West Side Story"". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of ""Dirty Dancing"" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't ""Grease"", or ""Saturday Night Fever"" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual?Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, ""I've had the time of life"" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression ""guilty pleasure"" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see ""Dirty Dancing"". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters.And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.",Dirty Dancing
31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Lock up your daughters...,5,3 September 2020,"Aside from its obviously problematic central relationship (yikes), there isn't really anything particularly 'wrong' with 'Dirty Dancing (1987)'. Having said that, it's never more than 'fine'. Though its plot is more impactful and consistent than the plots of similar work such as 'Flashdance (1983)' and 'Footloose (1984)', the picture doesn't really make the most out of its underlying themes and focal relationship. It's not bad, just somewhat unremarkable. It's never exciting or affecting, for example. It's engaging enough, though, and will probably appeal more to big fans of 80s dance movies than it does to me. 5/10",Dirty Dancing

33,A_Different_Drummer,"Original 'Feel good"" dance epic -- often imitated Never Duplicated",10,9 September 2016,"This is one of those rare rare films that needs a 30 year break between the time of production and the time of the review in order to appreciate it.Since 1987 I have seen this film 7 or 8 times. Each time it just gets better. As a Prolific Review here on the IMDb, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of films that improve with age like that.This is literally the original ""feel good"" dance film -- which spawned dozens if not hundreds of imitations. The script is perfect. The acting is perfect. The casting is perfect. The direction is perfect. And the music score is to die for.Nobody puts Baby in a corner? Well, nobody should ignore this film either! Also has an odd note of the ""one hit wonder"" label about it, which in my view only makes it more of a treat than it already is.Swayze's career was unfortunately cut short. Jennifer Grey, who practically made this role a part of her DNA, had a nose job and (the cynics say) lost a lot of later roles because the casting directors were afraid no one would recognize her. And the brilliant writer/Producer Elenor Bergstein for whom this was a labor of love (there was a documentary on this) also seemed to hang up her spurs when production wrapped.The IMDb rating is a joke. This is no less a classic in its genre than Maltese Falcon or the Matrix.See it, rent it, buy it. But don't forget it.",Dirty Dancing
34,Bored_Dragon,Guilty pleasure,9,15 May 2018,"This lovely melodrama has a fair story and acting, and on the technical side it is quite decent. Although I do not like Patrick Swayze, and I consider Jennifer Grey to be a bit on the ugly side, their chemistry is incredibly addictive, but the main advantages of this flick are great music, for which it won an Oscar, and a lot of erotic dance. Objectively, the film is about a six, but due to awesome music and the powerful emotion it evokes, it has become a cult hit, especially among the women. Thanks to my sister, who's crazy about this movie ever since she was a kid, I saw it countless times, and I must admit that it got under my skin. I was never bored watching it and I never managed to see it through without crying.9/10",Dirty Dancing
35,atlasmb,A Lovely Love Story,10,7 May 2015,"I first saw ""Dirty Dancing"" in the theater during its first release. I remember the hype surrounding the film--a kind of cautionary intrigue (not unlike that surrounding the release of ""The Exorcist""). I waited with great anticipation and I remember how captivated I was by the opening credits, superimposed over the dramatic and nearly abstract images that resolved into couples dancing.Since then, I have seen the film many times. It is a wonderful love story about a young woman who stumbles upon a magical world of dance and sensuality and is drawn to it, and to a charismatic dancer from less fortunate circumstances.The theme of the film concerns appearances and preconceptions based upon class and social station.Jennifer Grey plays the part of Baby, the young woman who learns to dance and who falls in love with Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Set against the summer season of a Catskill Resort, the story is filled with music of the period (1963) and from other periods, recreating a time that was pivotal in the loss of America's ""innocence"" as well.This film deserves its huge following.",Dirty Dancing
36,filipemanuelneto,A good love story is timeless,6,25 April 2016,"Since ever the rich families sought to protect their children from marriages that could jeopardize their status and prestige. Baby Houseman is a girl whose parents expect a lot, but things go wrong when her family learns that she is in love with a dance instructor with humble origins and dubious life. Directed by Emile Ardolino and with a screenplay by Eleanor Bergstein, it has Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in the lead roles.This is probably one of the most famous romantic movies of the eighties. Jennifer Grey was up to the challenge and did a good interpretation but, despite her talent and commitment, she ended up overshadowed by a huge Patrick Swayze. This film can be considered the best in the career of this actor that was, precisely, a dancer before beginning to play. It's undeniable that his taste for dancing and talent for gallant roles were essential to his performance, contributing a lot to make him a true ""male sex symbol"" at the time. The script itself doesn't bring anything new: rich girl meets poor boy and they fall in love, jealous people try to separate them, girl's family doesn't accept their love etc... We have seen this many times in film, theater or even in literature. Nevertheless, it's a story that works well and it's enriched by some interesting details that help to thicken the plot, as the situation around an illegal abortion that one of the characters has to do. In addition to the interpretation of Swayze, the most positive point of the film are the choreography's and an amazing and memorable soundtrack, marked by the songs ""She's Like the Wind"" and ""I've Had The Time Of My Life"". The latter can even be considered one of the most famous love songs of the eighties and won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Best Original Song (1987).Despite the time that has passed since it's release in the cinema, and Swayze himself has passed away however, this film continues to mean a lot to many people and to be a landmark of romantic cinema. Love overcomes barriers, and a good love story is always timeless.",Dirty Dancing
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Nostalgia, the soundtrack and a strong lead balance out a weak movie",5,27 May 2017,"""Dirty Dancing"" is a quintessential '80s movie, yet it takes place in the early 1960s during the waning years of the age of idealism, just before taking family trips to a resort in the Catskill Mountains was out of fashion. That imbues this summer romance movie with two layers of nostalgia, especially 30 years after its release, and it's nostalgia that by and large carries this film for those who love it, with one exception.The film follows 17-year-old Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) on her family trip to Kellerman's resort in the summer of 1963. Presumably no longer entertained by line dancing and the full array of family activities, Baby noses into what the resort staff are up to, which is where she sees Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) a dance performer and instructor. Since Johnny and the other dancers have to be on their best behavior and cater to the guests all day, at night they express themselves by having steamy, sensual dance parties. Baby, as proper a good girl as she may be, is helplessly drawn into their world (and Johnny's arms).That's the story  the plot is that Baby discovers Johnny's dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant after hooking up with a waiter at the resort and Baby helps her get money for a (then very illegal) abortion, the timing of which would leave Johnny in need of a dance partner, an opening Baby volunteers to fill. So there's a reason most people forget what actually happens in ""Dirty Dancing,"" which was scandalous for 1987 let alone 1963. The reason they can so easily forget is because it's really a movie about Baby. Her awakening from ideal daughter of a well-to-do family about to go to college and join the peace corps to a risk-taker and rule-defier who in the span of a week falls for a sensitive hunk is a classic fantasy. Baby is not your typical damsel in distress protagonist. She's got a good head on her shoulders. But she's curious. She's never let herself go. A lot of people can identify with that, or remember summer nights when they too wanted to indulge that fantasy.Baby being a character who so many people can see themselves as is the one strength of ""Dirty Dancing"" that isn't the choreography, director Emile Ardolino's sensual approach or the amazing soundtrack. The other characters and the scenarios are half-baked, awkward or laughable. That said, tearing into a film as beloved as this one has no real value.There does, however, feel like a missed opportunity. Writer Eleanor Bergstein undoubtedly drew from her own experience in telling this story, which is why the nostalgia factor is so effective. The premise alone evokes all those summer vacation emotions, meaning the right story would really connect. The problem is she doesn't capitalize. There's absolutely no logic at the basis of anything that happens or the way Baby and Johnny's relationship develops. You could argue that summer flings happen in this magical, ephemeral sort of way, but Bergstein undercooks all the scenes and Ardolino takes a largely serious approach. All the movie's best moments are when the characters let loose and act a little silly, when the script fades away to moments between Baby and Johnny in which Grey and Swayze just get to focus on chemistry. Other than repeating what ""Footloose"" already told '80s audiences about everyone needing to just ""cut loose,"" ""Dirty Dancing"" doesn't have anything to say. It opts to keep a rosy romantic bubble all the way to the credits and serve as a reminder of a certain time in American history; Mr. Kellerman's line at the end about the Catskill resort culture disappearing reveals Bergstein's true goal of simply remembering it. The truth is ""Dirty Dancing"" is about the 1960s, but it has the spirit and soul of an '80s movie; it's not a period piece but a recollection of one time period from the perspective of another.Trying to be as objective as possible, ""Dirty Dancing"" is a stupid movie, but one steeped in nostalgia with a respectable main character and an alluring style. Somehow, against anyone's better judgment, these components manage to create moments of resonance at a universal, multi-generational level, to the point that you can't simply write it off.~Steven CThanks for reading!

There she ends up hanging out with the staff of the resort and meeting an older dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Trials and tribulations ensue.A movie that most people have at least heard about. One of the most well-known movies of the 80s and still something of a classic with certain gender and age demographics. Personally, being an adult male, I don't belong in any of them, but I have to admit the movie was not half bad.And a lot of that is due to how earnest the film is. Sure, the plot is not overly complicated, the characters are kind of clichéd and the ending is insultingly predictable, but it has a lot of passion behind it. Both Grey and Swayze are giving it their all and that shows. They also have a surprising amount of chemistry, which is pretty much the selling point of these types of movies. I also like how progressive it is, especially for its time.You also can't forget the soundtrack, including a lot of songs that are still played today.Then again, the plot is so basic that it almost edges into a parody. The movie is also a bit tamer than I expected, given how people rave about it. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a thing to keep in mind. It's also a movie about equality and not dividing people into classes. But it's also one of the whitest movies I've seen in a while. Again, it's progressive for its time, but it's also over thirty years old.Still, I can see why people like it. Passion and honest emotion will get you far and this movie has both of those.",Dirty Dancing

Patrick Swayze(The Outsiders, Steel Dawn, and Red Dawn) puts on a spectacular role as the cool Johnny Castle. Jennifer Grey(Joel's daughter) plays the naive Baby Houseman, who learns the ropes of dancing. These two main characters build a chemistry so hot, you wouldn't bother neutralizing the two elements. The musical soundtrack is really the bomb, several classics like Bruce Channel(Hey Baby!) I danced along to the song dozens of times. It's funny when Baby and Johnny keep splashing in the water when maintaining their balance. Solomon Burke's ""Cry to Me"" is memorable all the time. I always shudder when Johnny removed Baby's top in that scene. Gives me the rush every time. Not only does Swayze acts and dances, he sings. ""She's like the Wind"" blows your mind every time. At the dancing finale Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes ""I've Had The Time of My Life"" will leave everyone singing and dancing at the same time, and the lift is PERFECT!

43,Chris_Docker,A cult milestone with substantial dance sequences elevating carefully delivered formula,8,3 December 2000,"After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the USA. The eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of 'modern jive', a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The 60s Ronettes' song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.'Baby' - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (played by Jennifer Grey) is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the peace core. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. ""Baby's going to change the world,"" quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it.At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances (like line-dancing) look appealing to the masses. Baby however, chances upon the dance staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden dance instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation, and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much-copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities. With the gradual demise of mass of studio-based song-and-dance films associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Johnny Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo - which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner - is sometimes called 'diabolo' - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance-romance movies that followed, this film features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed 'for real' rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts - as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, and provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of 80s indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness, combines with a James Dean style defiance, appeals to male fantasies The sugary love, of strong girl nevertheless rescued-by-dashing-handsome-man, woos young women. While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring strengths are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that emulated its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.",Dirty Dancing
44,Fluke_Skywalker,Doesn't miss a step,7,16 January 2017,"Plot; A sheltered teenager falls in love with a handsome older dance instructor while on vacation with her family at a resort in the early 1960s.I must've watched Dirty Dancing at least half a dozen times during the Summer of 1990. Not because I was in any way a fan of the movie, but because a girl I had a huge crush on seemed to have it on a loop. I had no idea I was in the Friend Zone. I didn't even know what a Friend Zone was. I just pretended to love it because she loved it.Fast forward 27 years (Wow. Just... wow) and I still have a certain affection for Dirty Dancing. I've always liked the soundtrack, even before that Summer spent in the air conditioned comfort of Denise Harvey's suburban Ohio living room. And of course the movie is sort of a touchstone to that place and time. So, when I saw the Blu-Ray poking out from the abyss that is the Wal-Mart bargain bin, I had to get it.The movie is first and foremost (and perhaps only) a feel good coming of age story. There's some pretense about being more, but really this is nothing more than a fairytale; and that's perfectly okay, as it handles that aspect deftly. Stars Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey have good chemistry, the soundtrack is a hip-shaking mix of 60s classics and anachronistic 80s hits (including one from Swayze himself) and though it's all cheesier than Chuck E., it does entertain, and yes, make you feel good. What's wrong with that? - You know you're in a feel good Hollywood movie when a heretofore obstinate Father's mind is changed by watching his daughter dance a sexy mamba with the much older dance instructor he's hated the previous 104 minutes of the film.Swayze was a dancer in real life, and it shows. Grey certainly holds her own (and there are no doubles here ala Flashdance), but it's Swayze who really shines in the dance numbers. I can't say that Swayze was a great actor, but he has absolute conviction in every role I've ever seen him in, and that's commendable. Grey however is a good actress, and she's very strong here. The movie really rests on her shoulders, and she carries the load with charm and grace. Kudos also to the late Jerry Orbach, wonderful as always in his role as the Father.",Dirty Dancing

The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history.Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although ""Ghost"" probably would give it some competition), ""Dirty Dancing"" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.",Dirty Dancing

We will never forget when Patrick Swayze hoisted Jennifer Grey up for the dance sequence at the end, timeless moments that keep this film alive and memorable. Dirty Dancing in its essence is a film about letting go of strict societal norms and letting the music embrace you. You dance and feel the beat as opposed to observing rules and steps, the music dictates the rhythm and mood. Perhaps this iconic film was significant in the departure from traditional dancing as fewer people know dancing. Dancing as we see in modern movies or real life is people moving to the music without any defined steps, perhaps started by this iconic film.This film is a must see and should be on your bucket list.

So my score of 6/10 is a testimony to how good a film this really is, for a film of this type to entertain me, even just a little surprised me completely. There is simply nothing to hate here, as it tells the story of a girls journey into womanhood, and the dancing is simply the catalyst for the change.",Dirty Dancing

Patrick Swayze knew it also because of that retarded line.""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"" is a pretty stupid line. But it's not so stupid that it makes my skin crawl or ruin the movie. Dirty Dancing is the story of Baby(Jennifer Grey from Ferris Bueller). Her and her family are going up to Catskills for the week. While there, Baby's sister meets a real a-hole. This guy is a man-w*ore. Baby ends up meeting Johhny Castle (Patrick Swayze)and the entertainment staff. Johnny and his dancing partner get into a pickle. His partner gets knocked up by the guy that Baby's sister met. I told you he was a man-w*ore. The entertainment group is screwed unless... Unless they teach Baby how to dance and disguise her as the dancer. Johnny and Baby soon become very close and fall in love. Of course. Dirty Dancing is an all time classic. It really surprised me that it got a 6.1. I think Dirty Dancing is a fun film to watch. I prefer Jennifer Grey to anyone.",Dirty Dancing
59,hnt_dnl,Lightning-in-a-bottle cult classic from the 80s!,10,10 March 2012,"I first saw DIRTY DANCING (1987) when it came out and it was just like any other 80s flick for me at that time, just basic entertainment. This is one of my Mom's favorite movies and I had to re-watch it to see why she loves it and it holds such a special place in the hearts of many cult fans. Some movies just WORK! And Dirty Dancing is one of those movies. It is an anomaly of a film, set in the early 60s at a summer resort, but with a definite 80s vibe hovering over it, since it came out in '87 and features several popular 80s songs on it's soundtrack, one of which is actually used in the film's concluding explosive dance sequence, the Oscar-winning tune ""The Time of My Life"".The film stars the electrifying duo of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, both general unknowns at the time, who seem to be perfectly cast for these roles. Ironically, it was well-publicized that the two immensely disliked each other prior to filming DD because of some troubles they had on a previous flick they had done 2 years prior Red Dawn. But, thankfully, they worked out their differences and, thus, this timeless cult dance-romance movie was born! In analyzing the acting, while Grey is wonderful as the innocent main character ""Baby"" (whose family is vacationing at the resort), it is truly Swayze who steals the show in an utterly convincing and brilliant performance as the very masculine and charismatic dance master Johnny! Swayze's Johnny is so authentic as an extremely gifted, hard-working and talented man (employed by the resort to give dance lessons), who is used, manipulated, and mistreated by the uppity summer residents, that it hurts to watch at times. Swayze truly conveys Johnny's pain and desire for a better existence. Grey's Baby provides that turning point in his life. Grey herself is pretty convincing as a 17-year old (even she was actually in her mid-20s at the time).I'm actually not a big fan of movies whose major plots are romance or love stories, but this one is probably my favorite one of all time! The Johnny-Baby romance feels natural and real, not contrived at all. Initially having a bumpy relationship and interactions, they slowly develop a mutual admiration, respect, and love for each other. They complement each other and bring out previously hidden and untapped qualities. Johnny unleashes Baby's underlying sex appeal (and dancing ability!), while Baby gives Johnny more confidence in himself and more trust that there are decent people in the world, not to mention the most important thing...TRUE LOVE!80s flicks had a tendency to use soundtracks a lot for montages, but DD does it better than any I can recall, underscoring several Baby-Johnny scenes where Johnny is teaching Baby to dance, my favorites being the ""Hungry Eyes"" montage and the ""Lover Boy"" scene of Baby teasing Johnny and Johnny playing along. These music-montage scenes actually propel the story as much as the purely dialog scenes.The supporting cast is good, including an effective Jerry Orbach as Baby's Dad, real-life dancer Cynthia Rhodes (from Staying Alive) as Johnny's former dance partner who has been impregnated by one of the other resort workers and Baby must take her place as Johnny's partner, a funny Jane Brucker as Baby's daffy older sister Lisa, and Jack Weston as the resort manager.DD is also an 80s flick that avoids the dreaded ""dated"" tag due to it being set in the 60s and capturing the vibe of that decade very well, and the film still looks very modern and vibrant, with crisp visuals, not cheap-looking like a lot of 80s flicks. A very breezy, entertaining, and romantic creation of the 80s, DIRTY DANCING is timeless!",Dirty Dancing

The relationship between Baby and Johnny is in there for the women, who demand some romance in every film. The film is mainly about how hung up everyone was in the early 60s and how kids used to ""dirty dance"" behind their parents' collective backs. I grew up in this time, although the dancing that my friends and I did wasn't quite as ""dirty"" as what was depicted in this film. But it was still ""lewd"" according to the older generation. Remember, these were the folks who wouldn't allow Elvis to be shown below the waist on TV for another couple of years.

64,FloatingOpera7,Films Of The 80's: Dirty Dancing,10,12 August 2007,"Dirty Dancing (1987): Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Jerry Orbach, Kelly Bishop, Jack Weston, Jane Brucker, Lonny Price, Bruce Morrow, Max Cantor, Wayne Knight, Charles Honi Coles, Neal Jones,Paula Trueman, Alvin Myerovich, Miranda Garrison, Garry Goodrow, Thomas Cannold, Heather Lea Gerdes, Karen Getz, Dorian Sanchez, Tom Drake, John Gotz, Karen Kaster...Director Emile Ardolino...Screenplay Eleanor Bergstein.What was the appeal in ""Dirty Dancing"" ? It was a popular and successful film when released in 1987, it made Patrick Swayze a star and the music for the film had young Americans doing their own ""dirty dancing"". The films of the mid to late 80's, much like TV programs, had ""pop culture"" written all over it. At first glance, Dirty Dancing appears to be like that. The soundtrack contains not only familiar and beloved oldies but 80's music, namely the theme song/duet ""Now I've Had The Time Of My Life"". But upon closer inspection of the film, one comes to realize it's a sort of American movie classic, a love story, a coming-of-age story and overall a terrific film the kind that just isn't made anymore. The film just turned 20 years old. Directed by Emile Ardolino and written by a woman (Eleanor Bergstein), ""Dirty Dancing"" is set in the summer of 1963. Born-to-money Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is the plain, timid daughter of a wealthy Doctor and his wife who are vacationing in the Catskill Mountains, New York. By chance, she comes upon a ""forbidden"" dance club where a new, bold style of dancing has been invented. It's lusty, provocative and strongly sexual (thrusting hips, sexual simulations). Before long, Baby is lured into the dance and rebels against her parents and her well-brought-up ways. Trained by star dancer Johnny Castle (Swayze) she becomes his dance partner and dives into the world of competitive dancing. This leads to a series of incidents that ultimately shapes Baby into an entirely different woman. At the start of the film, Baby is plain and lacks confidence. Much like in ""Grease"" (another film likened to this one and also this was said to be the ""Saturday Night Fever"" of the 1980's) she blossoms into a beauty and becomes more assertive. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze carry the film with their chemistry, not only on the dance floor, but as actors. We are swept away in their passionate romance. In those days, couples on screen had to wait for a prolonged amount of time in which build-up is made before sexual intercourse took place, unlike today's tawdry films that have the couples doing it five seconds after meeting. The others in the cast hold their own. Jerry Orbach, no stranger to dance and song himself as a Broadway actor (in 1991 he portrayed Lumiere in Disney's Beauty and the Beast) as Doctor Houseman is a strong performance, a perfect foil to Swayze. The doctor is bourgeois, stuck-up, elitist and old fashioned. Other elements that make this a fine movie is the gorgeous locations - the Virginia countryside, where within sedate communities, youth of the early 60's begin the counter-culture. This is only partly true to real life at that time. While dancing was a form of expression and certain dances were a little risqué, the extremities of the dancing in this film are more at home in the 1980's dance clubs and make this film seem very anachronistic. The hairstyles, clothing/costumes and attitudes are too 1980's to be convincingly set in the last ""innocence"" summer before J.F.K. was shot and the wildness of the 60's set in. The setting only served to enhance the coming-of-age story. Baby loses her innocence and is no longer ""Baby"" but a grown woman who can think for herself. Cinematography is by Jeff Lur and it is a wonderful-looking film, whether we are seeing a dance in progress or a lake in the moonlight. This movie put Patrick Swayze on the map. He had done many films by this time but his true celebrity came from this film. He is an expert dancer (and more so at the time of this film) having studied jazz dance, modern dance and even ballet (Mikhail Borishnakoff was a friend of his). A Hollywood hottie at the time, his fame has waned somewhat nowadays but his acting powers have proved to be versatile over the years. He would make a cameo for the sequel to this film ""Dirty Dancing Havanah Nights"" as a dance instructor. This film is a classic of American cinema, a look back at the 1980's dance scene, a love story and a feel-good movie. It may be too long for some people's tastes but that only adds a quality of seriousness to the film. Highly recommended as a date movie, a movie you can watch with a romantic partner or spouse.",Dirty Dancing

Jennifer Grey (daughter of Oscar Winner Joel Grey) turns in a star-making performance as Baby Houseman, the young idealistic teen who finds her head turned one magical summer by the flashy Johnny Castle, played with swiveling-hip sincerity by Patrick Swayze, who made it cool for guys to dance in the movies again. It is the undeniable chemistry between these two relatively unknown actors and some dazzling dance sequences that make this movie worth watching over and over again. Swayze and Grey are magic together and mention should be made of an outstanding supporting performance from the late Jerry Orbach as Baby's father. The film won the Oscar that year for Best Song ""(I've Had)The Time of My Life"" which is used in the film's spectacular finale.

67,oOoBarracuda,Dirty Dancing,8,5 April 2017,"Add this to the file of films I didn't think I would like nearly as much as I did. Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong Dirty Dancing. Emile Ardolino directed the 1987 classic starring Jennifer Grey and the late Patrick Swayze. The film centered around a sheltered daughter and the life-changing summer her family spends at the Catskills resort in 1963. What I had written off as ""just another '80's romance"" was actually a wonderful coming-of-age story of a girl discovering how the world exists outside of her privileged upbringing.Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) a daddy's girl from a privileged family has already surprised her family by announcing that she is to join the Peace Corps at the end of the summer. She had been expected to go college and marry a doctor, the same profession as her father and establish a financially secure life for herself. One night, however, a chance meeting changes her destiny. All baby thought she was doing was carrying a watermelon to a staff dance party when she first lays eyes on Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) the chiseled dance instructor of the resort. Johny knows no privilege, and unlike Baby, has had to struggle his whole life. His life is nearing a downward spiral since his dance partner has become pregnant and unable to get the money or the healthcare access to an abortion. Wanting to help a distressed woman and find a way into Johnny's heart, Baby lies to her father about the purpose and is given the money Johnny's dance partner uses to obtain her abortion. She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner in order to save his spot on the roster. As the two spend more and more hours together they fall in love and Baby is stuck between her family's expectations and her own romantic interests. As her father begins to find out what Baby has been up to and how he has been used in the scheme, her relationships with everyone are tested and she must decide how to mend them, and which to attempt to save first.Dirty Dancing begins with an opening narration, and I am an absolute sucker for a well-executed narration. The narration was used well and effective in providing a bit of background info into the background Baby had enjoyed all of her life. Throughout the film, it felt a bit like I was watching Double Indemnity with all the Baby's, so I only wish Baby had earned a different nickname; although, I suppose the iconic line ""Nobody puts sweetie in a corner"" would have had the same effect. The dancing was engaging, and not as annoying of a storyline as I presumed it would be. I thought it was going to be a tired ""spends a lot of time together so they fall in love"" kind of romances, but the added layers of the upbringing struggles was an engaging aspect. Patrick Swayze's performance was riveting, I haven't seen much, if any, of his acting roles so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with both his acting and dancing skills. Jennifer Grey nailed the dancing angle but came off a bit wooden throughout her non-dancing scenes. The supporting cast was wonderful, as well; I mean, has Jerry Orbach ever been less than stellar in a role he has taken on? Dirty Dancing proved my expectation of ""just another 80's romance"" wrong, I can assure you of that as I stand in line at Target waiting to buy a copy of the film.",Dirty Dancing

A mountain range in upstate New York when Hotels, motels and bungalow colonies sprung up up like dandy lions in an abandoned field. Some say the Idea or origins of the Catskills region was the location and natural setting just a couple of hours away from New York and Philadelphia areas where Jewish families could relax for a couple of weeks at affordable prices. In the 1930's and 40's Jews were denied vacancies in other hotels do to anti antisemitism. Jewish oriented luxury hotels, Motels, Bungalow colonies and Sleep-away camps of every description accommodated Jewish clientele in every price range. This made for a quick fix to rejuvenate the senses before the fall season/ school commences. Enough with the History lesson. On with the review. It's 1963 The Kennedy's lived in the White House and Rock and Roll filled the air waves with the sounds of WABC and Bruce Morrow at the mic, known as a DJ (Disc Jockey), who talked between songs . Song artists the likes of Jan & Dean, The Four Seasons, The Beach Boys and Lesley Gore performing as the teenage multitude tried to master the latest dance steps such as the FREDDIE or the FRUG or maybe the MASH POTATO or the SHIMMY? This brings us full circle to our story of loyalty, trust and for a lack of a better word, judgement. Dr. Houseman (Jerry Orhbach) and his Family arrive at Kellerman's resort in the heart of the Catskill Mountains . Along with Mrs. Houseman (Kelly Bishop) and their two Teenage daughters Lisa (Jane Brucker) and our centerpiece of this story Frances ,AKA,"" Baby"" Houseman. The family settles in on this country setting at Kellerman's Resort run by the chubby, lispy Max Kellerman played by character actor deluxe Jack Weston. Max Boasts about his Danish being pure protein as he assembles the patrons for the daily routine of dancing lessons during the day light hours. The help or dance instructors are basically teenagers or of college years. One stand out is the tall auburn haired, beady eyed Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is curious about the crowd beyond the main bungalows and is taken by Johnny Castle. Although Johnny comes from a humble background Baby is taken by his charm and elegance as Johnny regular partner Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) is pregnant and to complicate things further has an abortion. that renders her bed ridden and infected. Baby takes her place and practices as Johnny and Baby become a dance team working side performances at competing Hotels unbeknownst to her doting Father. Johnny and Baby are trying to master the famous swan catch. Diversions of infidelity and false accusations thicken as Dr. Houseman and Max Kellerman accuse Johnny of wrong doing. Fine performances by the obnoxious full of himself Neil Kellerman (Lonny Price),the Bosses son and the insidious, philandering Robbie the bus boy, (Max Cantor) add to this piece of Borscht Belt nostalgia. This Movie strikes a distant cord with me as I fall into a trance of past experiences going to the mountains with my parents. Homowack Lodge and Davos ski resort bring back a ton of wonderful memories. Just a bygone era captured on film. The success of this film is how the story captures the atmosphere of bungalow life.

Not my sort of movie, but there is no denying that this is a classic.The movie is about a girl who goes on holiday with her family. There she meets a group of dancers. She finds out that one of the dancers is in trouble and decides to help. To help she needs to learn to dance professionally. Whilst learning, she falls in love with her teacher and they have to hide their affair as he would get fired and she would be in a lot of trouble with her family.The film stars the late great Patrick Swayze. Patrick was such a good actor. He made so many great movies and even acted towards the end of his life in the TV show The Beast even though he was in a lot of pain. He is in my top 5 actors of all time and he is missed. Dirty Dancing is one of his biggest movies. The man knew how to dance well and he really shows it in this movie. Jennifer Grey played the girl in the movie. Jennifer is a good actress and she played this part well. She has been in a lot of movies and TV shows, but she will always mainly be famous for this film.The soundtrack to this movie is one of the strongest draws to this film. It is a near perfect soundtrack. It has a lot of great songs in it and it is made all the better by the song called She's Like The Wind which is sang by Patrick Swayze himself.The story itself is actually quite weak. It is a love story that has no deep meaning other than a holiday romance. Normally it would not be a good story for a film... But it works because of all the elements that work well together.I really like this film. I watched it a lot when I was younger as it was one of the first VHS I owned.

73,TaylorYee94,Tickling in the heart and butterflies in stomach,8,2 September 2020,"That's what the romance movie should be about. I can feel my heart beat again seeing two love birds fall in love and dancing their hearts out. Kudos to music and choreography team. Even though Dirty Dancing is not typically categorized as 'musical film', its songs and dance are magnificent, superior to average musical film with low budget and effort. I never know dancing can be sexier than actual sex scene. The camera closes up foot movement of two dancers too much at the early time of the movie, but it shows the development of relationship so clearly. When you first dance with someone you barely know, what do you do? You look at their feet. As the time goes on, the viewpoint moves upward to each other's face.It just reminds me of youth.. or rather I romanticize my youth, so pure before opening my eyes to sexuality. Then the right person comes along, and he awakens me, enlightens me to the 'feeling that I never felt before'. It was not as romantic and passionate as Baby's experience. However, this movie brings me back to those moments and, to be honest, paint them a little pinker.My favorite scene is when Baby visits Johnny's room after what happened to Penny and after her dad tells her not to see Johnny anymore. I think those two events burst what's been holding her back. She pours our her feelings to Johnny and dances skin to skin. The moment a woman crosses that fine line, something between honesty and innocence & emotions and intimacy, Grey really have it, her facial expression and her tone... It is one of the most romantic scenes in all films.",Dirty Dancing
74,Pro Jury,Repeated viewings reveal a well crafted story,10,4 March 2001,"When this film was released I dismissed as being lightweight pop nonsense. That was a mistake.  After repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal.DIRTY DANCING is a film about change.  The evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age, etc.  The story takes place during August of 1963, the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people.  The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the Kennedy assassinations and Vietnam.Female movie go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie.  As a male I find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very plain Jennifer Grey very hard to accept.  This would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers.The film's soundtrack found #1 status before the release of the movie.  To this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song.Near the midpoint of the film Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, ""Is anything wrong?""Baby's father, the anti-change family member, attempts to keep all that is happening a secret.

I can understand that it is a well liked classic, as I'm sure almost every part of it - from the music and dancing to the relationships in it - hits it target audience right where it should. The fact that I'm not a part of the target audience doesn't mean it's a bad movie.With movies like this, that doesn't really try (or need) to flesh out its character, it's always interesting to see how the characters hold up with time. How some of the characters are portrayed would maybe be considered mean if the movie was made today. Or maybe it's in those cases a realistic depiction of the time and setting it was set in? I don't know.The (acting) performances are not too impressive, and especially Swayze didn't always convince when showing emotions. The dancing is well done though, both when it is genuinely meant to be good, but also when the actors are supposed to be bad. I also really liked the setting itself, the naivë dance camp for rich families.So what can I say? I am not trying to be objective in my rating of this movie, but I feel I have to point out that much of what didn't impress me (the plot, the characters, the relationships) were done intentionally, and hits home with many.",Dirty Dancing

One of the girls, Francis ""Baby"" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love.Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s.

81,antagonist117,"A modern dance movie that stacks up well with the classics, in spite of cheesiness and overreach",7,12 December 2014,"When did dance movies get so serious? When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made them they were essentially comedies, with just a touch of melodrama to move the romantic plot lines forward. But by the time of 1977's ""Saturday Night Fever"" and 1987's ""Dirty Dancing,"" dance had become a framework for commentary about heavy topics like rape and abortion. It is arguable whether audiences really noticed; decades afterward ""Saturday Night Fever"" is famous primarily for its time capsule soundtrack and John Travolta's white-suited disco pose, while ""Dirty Dancing"" remains alive in the collective memory for one famous line of dialogue and for the slick moves that Patrick Swayze showed off and later parodied on Saturday Night Live.Yet to understand the non-dance bits of these movies, it helps to be familiar with the periods in which they were made. In the case of ""Dirty Dancing,"" it is helpful also to know something about the time in which it is set: the early 1960s, the brink of a major generational divide. Despite Jennifer Grey's clothes and hair, a few of the song choices, and the fact that the font and color of the title look like they come straight off a Prince album, this movie is consciously and by necessity a period piece. It is set in a family-focused lakeside resort, a kind of place with a kind of ethos that no longer existed by the time of the movie's release in 1987. Much is made of the emergence of new forms of popular entertainment, new interpretations of old words like ""baby,"" and the new social frontiers that would turn old- fashioned liberals like Jerry Orbach's character into conservatives without their knowledge. This is fertile ground for a drama, but a movie about dance—and this is, to its credit, a movie about dance—doesn't have time to do these ideas justice. The dangers of unsafe abortions in the pre-Roe era are highlighted, but in a way that is unfeasibly convenient. It is structured so that the romantic leads come out squeaky-clean heroes and their antagonists more villainous. The feelings of the woman ""in trouble"" are explored only in passing and only at moments calculated to serve the needs of the central story. Similarly, the prejudices of the upper middle-class are touched upon, but in the vaguest way. One oily sort speaks of sexual liaisons with the help as ""slumming,"" and Swayze's itinerant dancer is obscurely identified as coming from ""the streets."" What streets, exactly, remain unknown, as does his ethnic identity, which he seems to hint at through a very tenuous, arguably Italian, inflection.Though Eleanor Bergstein's script takes itself very seriously, and though its desire to ""say"" something meaningful is laudable albeit misplaced, its real power is, quite rightly, in the dance sequences. Unlike ""Saturday Night Fever,"" which spends far too much time away from the dance floor and among dislikable people, ""Dirty Dancing"" is a worthy successor to the classics because it spends the bulk of its time on music and movement. Grey and Swayze look genuinely happy when they dance, and when the world shrinks to them they generate a feeling of goodwill that overshadows the movie's missteps and instances of overreach. There is an unshakable cheesiness to the film that the great dance movies of the past were too self-aware and witty to fall into. The way Grey's character falls for Swayze's is so pat, the way he expresses himself is so hammy, and the way Orbach's comes around at the end is so cutesy and orchestrated. But the important scenes, the dance montages, all look and sound great, and it's easy to feel good while watching them.Happily, the film avoids the clichés of its genre. Nobody gives Grey a makeover, and nobody tells her to come out of her shell or to change who she is. In an early scene, she sheds an awkward sweater in favor of a sleeveless shirt without comment or even a visual acknowledgment of the wardrobe change. It's unclear whether that's a smart decision or just an oversight from director Emile Ardolino, but if it's the latter, it works in spite of itself. That's true of the movie generally.",Dirty Dancing

That was very generous of him - it's obvious who got the better part of that deal. However, this is a feel-good film so never mind; and never mind the darker subjects of possible under-age sex and abortion. It is all wonderful when everyone ends up having a great time dancing the night away and they all live happily ever-after.In the real world though, what would likely happen is that in a few weeks time, Baby will miss her period and be thrown out of the house, never to darken those doors again; and Johnny will be a fast disappearing dot on a distant horizon.So, for all those impressionable virgins out there, when your boyfriend is about to do it to you for the first time, it is not you who is having the time of your life, it is him.",Dirty Dancing

The story is an old one but well acted. Some parts are humorous and others mildly touching.

It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending! You know how it's going to end from the beginning, but that's really not the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!",Dirty Dancing
85,Old Joe,One of the biggest films of the 80's!,8,1 May 2001,"One rainy day, in the year 2000, 13 years after it's release, I sat and watched Dirty Dancing. I am upset that I didn't see it when it was in the cinema and in its popular run with the world. Baby's opening lines are a good place to start my review - ""It was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.""At a summer camp Baby meets Johnny Castle, who teaches interested vacationers how to dance, and in his off hours dirty dances with other dancers. When Johnny loses his regular dancing partner, Baby volunteers to learn his routine to help him out of a tight spot. As the summer winds down, the dancing pair must come to grips with responsibility, love and each others growing expectations. Undoubtedly, the greatest part of this film are the scenes where we get to see some great dancing. The very first scenes with it in my view where in some way erotic, yet had an infectious feel on me. The dancing is very intense and heavy. It is no wonder they call it 'dirty dancing'. It must have been hard to find the right dancers to perform in this movie, but I feel they did get it right. The main part of the cast must have been able to dance a little too, cause if they couldn't have it would have made the film very erratic, and nowhere near as good as it was. Plus the ending of the film is great, with the two main characters getting up and showing the audience what they do best.The cast of Dirty Dancing was pretty good. Patrick Swayze, who played Johnny proved to me how talented he really was. His on-air relations with Jennifer Grey, and his dancing parts of this film were great. His lead in this is also deserves much praise. Swayze has had an eventful career, starring in Ghost, one of the big films of the 90's, and Black Dog alongside music legend Meatloaf. However, Jennifer Grey is an actress who I had never heard of until this movie, yet I loved her role in this immensely. Her characters struggles in this film were well acted by her, yet by the end she really shows that she can dance too. I have recently seen one of her other films which i think the whole world liked, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I must admit that wasn't a bad film. However, Grey did not cash in on her success as Baby in Dirty Dancing, because I believe the movie loving public did not get to see enough of her afterwards, which was very disappointing.The one thing I do remember vividly at the time this film was doing well was the main song on the soundtrack, 'I've had the time of my life'. When I heard this in the film itself last year, I really got into it. The musical version of it is great. Yet the soundtrack is full of other great hits like Hungry eyes,  She's Like the Wind (performed by Patrick Swayze) and Overload just to name a few. Everyone I talk to about this movie says ""Hey have you got the soundtrack to that?"" It is amazing what effect a movie's soundtrack can have on people and Dirty Dancing's is great soundtrack to have.Finally, the movie's story is what I would call a bit 'mushy', but don't let that distract you from what a great film this is. The brilliant dancing and soundtrack is what I will remember most from this movie. I also like this movie for the fact that it shows some great dancing, which makes me a little jealous, considering that dancing is not one of my strong points. Lastly, let me leave you with this thought. I heard last year that an new version of Dirty Dancing was to be made, with people such as Ricky Martin and Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead roles. I believe that a newer version of this sort of film won't be the same, cause Dirty Dancing, the original, has a certain historical look, that no new film could ever capture the same. Rating: 4 Stars or 8/10",Dirty Dancing

87,stephendaxter,"A good, entertaining romantic drama that even today someone can enjoy",7,28 April 2015,"Dirty Dancing is a movie that was made before my time, and seeing that i am going to the Broadway soon i figured, why not check out the original film first. This was a romantic drama that was actually pretty good, for someone who didn't grow up dreaming about Patrick Swayze i thought this was still a pretty entertaining film. Now the overall plot isn't the most original thing because everyone knows what is going to happen in these movies but it does enough to surprise you and keep you interested. The main way they do this is through the characters, the characters are all so different that right from the get go you know the type of character they are and can see them change over the course of the film. The character chemistry is also really well done especially between Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Their dialogue and the way their relationship evolves throughout the film really holds the film together. Some of the other characters aren't as well setup in the film and only show up when the plot needs them to but you forget about that as you realise they aren't the focus. They both play their respective roles really well and you are at all times convinced that their relationship could be very real.The dance sequences are also some of the highlights of the movie, they really bring a positive and uplifting feel to the film to counter some of the more emotional scenes. And what would be a dance sequence without some music, the soundtrack in this film was great, filled with classic songs that even i knew some of the words to and really get you in a good mood. Where i would say the film gets let down is with its pacing. The movie does move at a pretty steady pace but there are quite a few moments in the middle that kind of drag on a little too much, and although it is for the character development, some of the longer scenes could have been cut down. But in the end this was an enjoyable film, not the greatest romantic drama of its era but definitely a really good one to watch. - 7",Dirty Dancing

I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole.Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like ""Lolita"" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing.

The movie houses some standard tropes/life lessons such as don't judge people before you know what they've been through. This trope is even more emphasized by Baby's dad.

This movie takes place at a summer retreat for wealthy families, and 'baby' (Jennifer Grey) is a rich doctor's daughter. She becomes infatuated with one of the dance instructors / entertainers at this retreat, despite some objections from her family. Patrick Swayze's acting is terrible. Dittos to Jennifer Grey.

94,Snowgo,Dancing in Handcuffs,4,12 July 2015,"You have to really try hard to get me to not like a movie whose main theme is dancing (especially, learning to dance). You have to really try hard to get me to not like a film with Patrick Swayze.., and/or Jennifer Grey in it. I liked Swayze in Donnie Darko, Roadhouse and Ghost. I liked Grey in F.B's Day Off and Wind.This film was not just mediocre in its dialogue, production and yes, it's dancing: It was actually obnoxious: (the ever-present, glowering, rich Jew who was the owner of the Jewish summer camp for Jewish families. Everything was askew in this film: Grey's embarrassingly-conventional garb, in contrast to the people she associated with, was hard to watch.Swayze's and Greys dancing was stiff, rehearsed and inexpressive. It was as though they knew the moves, but did not know how to express their lives through the dance. (A little smiling would have helped).The abortion reference and inclusion in the plot did not sit well with me. I did not find this entertaining, and when the young man said, ""I could hear her screaming in the hall."", I pressed eject. What I find particularly appalling about this abortion content is one line, issued by the Jewish ""father"" of the child (the mother was gentile), in reference to the woman he impregnated: ""some people matter.., and some don't.""I could not help but think he may have meant gentiles (non-jews) in general. We see in Dirty Dancing how the other main gentile in the movie is cast as the ""bad boy"".What Dirty Dancing needed was a more dynamic character played by Jennifer Grey. She would have certainly been capable of it. If you are going to create tension: (a 30-something lady-killer with a younger woman), then bring it to a crescendo and ""burn down the house"". Complete the transformation of demure ""Baby"" (sic) to the defiant and autonomous Frances.Swayze needed to have a life outside of dancing, perhaps taking on the restrictive (and possibly elitist) management of the resort. We needed to see a ""barn-burner"" in Dirty Dancing with hotter, more expressive dancing and a much-greater development of the main characters' identities. Grey's character needed to complete and fulfill her transformation. Swayze needed to interact more forcefully and cleverly with his antagonists.Swayze's original partner, played by Cynthia Rhodes, may have been much-better played by fire-brand Demi Moore, his later beloved in Ghost. A professional salsa/meringue/ dancer may have been even better, because the acting was not especially difficult. Moore would have rectified this role.I object strongly to abortion being tossed into a picture to liven-up what is a still-dreary-and-now-morose film. It is cheap.., and it is disrespectful. I would have given a ""5"" to Dirty Dancing, appreciating some of the difficulties the couple went through and because of the fairly-good acting by Swayze and Grey, but the tactless inclusion of abortion (as excitement) caused me to detract one star. Choose life. Stand and fight.The full-fledged transformation we need from Dirty Dancing never happens, and we are left wondering who these people really are.

It's not really necessary to detail the plot, other than it really is boy meets girl. The story is quite standard, yet it's done quite nicely and even delves into darker territory with abortion and the perils of promiscuity being sub plots.The leads Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze work well together, with Swayze a handsome lead and amazing to think he was 36 when he made this. Grey is nice as the innocent discovering herself, but I did find her a little too plain. The film's main element for me were the dance scenes an there's plenty of dancing to be had. The leads are excellent dancers and the choreography and camera work are very good; there is also a good soundtrack.The film has legions of massive fans and it is perhaps easy to see, it's quite a classic story and over the years has spawned a bad sequel and a plethora of wannabe films as well as many skits, parodies and references; one of the films most massive lines, indeed moments is when at the hotel's end of season show, Johnny comes to get Frances and says 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner', but I was quite taken aback at the delivery of this, it seemed really abrupt and almost done so quickly that if you weren't paying attention you may have missed it.

A macho boy who can dance....a dumb cute spoiled girl who can't....another girl who can dance but finds out she is pregnant and can't dance with macho boy in the dance-off....nerd son of the owner of the resort who has the hots for dumb spoiled girl....clueless sister of dumb spoiled girl....Macho dancing boy teaches dumb spoiled girl to dance as good as him (yeah right)....both macho boy and dumb girl fall in love and do the dance-off and live happily ever after. Instant classic.....yeah right,Dirty Dancing
106,dishlady69,Memorable Retro (No Spoilers),6,2 September 2018,"The dance scenes in this film have always been pretty memorable -- probably the Swayze factor imo. The constant reminder of the social divide between ""the guests"" and ""the help"" pushed throughout the film (no spoilers) was a major topic back in the '80s as women were really working hard to break through the glass ceiling both socially and professionally. The film seems to be making a comeback now as the opening film to an DVD double-feature with ""The Help"".",Dirty Dancing
107,texxas-1,NOT A FEEL GOOD FILM,2,4 August 2019,This is one of the most overhyped pieces of garbage films I have ever seen. Jennifer Grey is an eyesore and has a poison personality pouring out of her. Swayze was far too old to be playing a heart throb. He did not look good for his age at all. And his character was not nice. Yes the dancing was good but that was all. How about making it into a musical instead of the absurd plot? The guy who plays babys father almost seems brain dead. The women playing babys sister was even uglier than Jennifer Grey. You will not feel happy after watching this embarrassment of a film,Dirty Dancing
108,carolrmag,Perfect!,10,18 September 2017,"Not being a masterpiece in general, it is as a romantic movie. It touches girls/women the most. And I don't know one that saw the movie and didn't fell in love with it. Character lines and music get stuck in our brains forever. I was still longing for a sequel (before PS passing...). I will love it forever. And enjoy re-watching it when it happens to be on TV. Have the DVD, obviously. If you are a romantic, you must see this movie",Dirty Dancing
109,dwr246,"""That was the summer we went to Kellerman's...""",10,14 July 2005,"Delightful coming of age film featuring good acting, wonderful dancing, and a surprisingly well crafted story.It's the summer of 1963, and the Houseman family - father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), a successful doctor; mother, Marjorie (Kelly Bishop); and daughters Lisa (Jane Brucker), a shallow young woman, obsessed with fashion and finding the right guy to ""go all the way with,"" and Frances (Jennifer Grey), better known as ""Baby,"" a plain Jane, more interested in making the world a better place than in fashion - are off to Kellerman's resort in the mountains. Baby is just about to start college, and Lisa is a little older (although how much isn't specified). Once they arrive at Kellerman's, they are greeted by the owner Max (Jack Weston), and Lisa catches the eye of busboy/bellhop, Robbie (Max Cantor), a med student working there for the summer. Unfortunately for Baby, she is set up with Max's grandson, Neil (Lonny Price), a student at the Cornell School of Management with a higher opinion of himself than seems warranted. After spending her first evening there as an unwilling magician's assistant, Baby takes a walk to get some much needed solitude. She accidentally wanders down to the staff quarters, and ends up helping Billy (Neal Jones) carry watermelon to a staff party. At the party, she meets the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), to whom she is instantly attracted. Over the next few days, she finds out that Johnny's partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has gotten pregnant and Robbie is the father. When Baby confronts Robbie, he denies any responsibility for his deed, and shows absolutely no willingness to help out. Baby borrows money from her father to fund Penny's abortion (not telling him what it's for, of course), but when she goes to give it to Penny, she finds out that Penny can only see the doctor on the night that she and Johnny have a big gig at the Sheldrake, another hotel about twenty minutes away. And then Billy comes up with the idea of Baby taking Penny's place. As Baby learns Penny's dance routine, she starts to fall for Johnny. The performance goes well, but Baby and Johnny return to Kellerman's to find that Penny's ""abortion"" was not performed by a skilled practitioner, and she is in really bad shape. Baby gets her father to tend to Penny, revealing her dealings with the staff, Johnny in particular, to her father, who is understandably upset, and forbids her to have anything to do with them. Baby, of course, has her own ideas, and goes back to visit Johnny that night, intending to apologize for her father's behavior towards Johnny. She ends up spending the night with Johnny. Delighted as she is over her new romance, Baby still has a big problem - how can she tell her father that she loves the man he has forbidden her from seeing? Worse yet, how can she explain to Johnny her need for secrecy. The delicate balance is upset when an ex-lover (Miranda Garrison) of Johnny's accuses him of stealing a wallet, and only Baby can provide an alibi. Should she speak up and help Johnny? Or stay silent and protect herself? Her choice is her first adult decision. What will she choose? The story is beautifully written, using the resort as a backdrop for showing the disparity between guests and staff, which mimics the class struggle of society itself at the time. Almost all of the major characters grow in some appreciable way by the end of the film. Jake learns that by only observing the appearance of things he can miss the truth behind the appearance. Johnny learns that not all rich people are users, and that there are people who will stand up for him no matter what the personal cost. Baby perhaps learns the most, learning that hard work pays off, that you can find love in the most unexpected places, and that standing up for what - and who - you believe in sometimes requires painful choices, but that doing so is ultimately its own reward. Even Lisa appears to grow. The scene where she comforts Baby and Johnny has been sent away is one of the most touching in the movie. My only real complaints are that Jake's apology to Johnny is a little flat and the ending isn't really that believable, but given the rest of the film, I can forgive both of those things pretty easily.The dancing is phenomenal. Swayze's early training in dance is put to good use in this film. Rhodes and Grey are equally adept on the dance floor. The dance sequence at the end is amazing - especially the long awaited lift.The acting was also excellent. The chemistry among the cast creates believable relationships on the screen. Grey is wonderful as Baby, playing the part to perfection. Swayze does equally well with Johnny. Rhodes plays Penny with a complexity that brings her humanity to the forefront. Orbach's concerned father is good, if a little over the top at times. Brucker does a wonderful job of showing Lisa as a ditz who spends most of her time focusing on herself to the exclusion of others, but manages to make her support for her sister at the end both believable and touching. Weston is good as the stuffy, overbearing Max, and Price's Neil is wonderfully annoying. Jones' Billy is a likable, if not overly bright, young man. Even the bit parts were well done.All in all, a well put together movie that takes you back to the time before America lost its innocence. And a fun one to watch, be it the first time, or the hundred and first.",Dirty Dancing
110,McFrogg,I didn't have the time of my life...,1,9 November 2017,"...and I owe it all to this piece of crap. The characters are all unlikeable, except for the father...to a certain degree. The rest of the characters are dry-humping babykillers and Randroids. To be fair, the Randroid character is supposed to be unlikeable (the easiest way to make a character unlikeable is to make him a fan of Ayn Rand's insane ideas. How lazy), but at least he didn't pay for abortions.Growing up, I remember all of the girls talking about (and quoting) this movie. Personally, I don't think any girls should ever witness Patrick Swayze's character rubbing his manhood against women. If I remember correctly, this movie is rated ""11"" where I live...what the heck? More like ""Filthy Dancing"".Swayze's character is also a manwhore who sleeps with old women and almost beats a guy to death because he insulted his girlfriend. How romantic?The movie's ending is hilariously stupid. What a strange movie...it's supposed to take place during the 60s, but the song is clearly from the 80s. Maybe the movie is in the same universe as Back to the Future or something? Maybe there's a deleted scene where Biff Tannen inspires Patrick Swayze's character to rub his crotch against things.Not that the music is bad. It's the dirty dancing and babykilling I didn't like.",Dirty Dancing
111,charlessmith702210,"Well, the movie has some great dancing but could have a little more",8,3 October 2006,"The part I liked the most was the scene where Jennifer Grey (acting as Frances Houseman) had to be a dance partner in a mambo dance exhibition with Patrick Swayze (acting as Johnny Castle)...in a matter of several days.Of course, Jennifer realized that this mambo dance exhibition mandated a lot of practice on her part. The first mambo rehearsal scene I liked was especially when they had to do an opening part on the mambo called the Right Intimate Shadow Pose to Very Slow Masseuse to Rolling Off The Arm to Right Open Side-By-Side Position, to the song ""Hungry Eyes."" This was perhaps the most boring part of the flick because there are several rewinds of that sequence showing how these dance partners had to get that opening dance sequence absolutely perfect!I also liked another mambo dance rehearsal scene--the ending sequence to the mambo, which included a lady's rocket lift, a lady's Derby throw (aerial step) into an X-line oversway (picture line), and a finishing men's and lady's layback lunge in open promenade. The final dance move was too grueling for Jennifer until Patrick showed her how to properly do the aerial steps--outside the dance floor. So with the help of Patrick, Jennifer was in the air on an open field, and then, the water.Regrettably, Patrick should have told Jennifer that he was an Arthur-Murray-certified instructor earlier in the flick....but the mistake was that he did so in the middle part of practicing their mambo routine.Yet even so, when Jennifer's and Patrick's ""Mambo Magic"" exhibition occurred to the old-time Mambo hit, ""De Todo Un Poco"", I had realized why I love dance movies so much. When Patrick and Jennifer danced this Latin exhibition, I saw a new inspiration for me to take up ballroom dancing again--although I had read a very old Fred Astaire dance book at that time. In addition, Jennifer was able to fake what would have been major mistakes in the mambo routine---turning, for instance, a botched lady's star lift into a sort of rooting cheer with bent arms along with leg pumps.Another scene in the flick was slightly less interesting but still intriguing, when one of the employees said to Patrick that because dance trends were changing in the Catskills area, he should dance the pachanga instead of the mambo. I knew at that point that this dance will be different from before.......After I saw that final dance exhibition in the flick, the pachanga they did was different---an eclectic mix of a little twist of lambada, theatrical arts dance, and a taste of the mambo dance they did earlier in the movie. I didn't know what pachanga came from at first, but I realized that one version of the pachanga took place in the heart of Colombia. It was a type of salsa dance which had the famous foot crossings and swivels that you can also see in the modern mambo in American Rhythm dancing. The Spanish word ""pachanga"" means ""party"", and it referred also to the resurgence of salsa dance parties in the U.S. during the 1990s, when salsa had its rebirth with the salsa hit ""Cali Pachanguero"" (by the group ""Grupo Niche""), in another dance movie I liked---""Salsa: The Motion Picture.""With the pachanga dance in ""Dirty Dancing"", I also correlate that dancing as much less racy than ""The Forbidden Dance: Lambada"", which was released in 1990.",Dirty Dancing
112,mhubbard-54657,Guilty pleasure,9,3 September 2018,"I have been watching this film every few years for 3 decades and continue to get something different out of it each time. In the past, I simply enjoyed the romance, the dancing, the music, and the coming of age story. Now I see it primarily as a tale of economic and social conflics between the working class, and the privileged.Jennifer Grey was perfect in her role, in part because she looked like the girl next door, and not a Hollywood actress. Sad we have gotten to the point now where people are so preoccupied with the fear of molestation, that a 17 year old girl cannot sleep with an ""adult"" in a film about her summer between high school and college.I give this a 9 for the pure pleasure factor. It doesn't look at all like a low budget film, and the casting was really excellent. Patrick Swayze carried his role with aplomb, and he was indeed a great dancer. RIP.",Dirty Dancing

The film is so nicely done and is a real feel good movie that just wants to make you jump off the sofa and dance to all the catchy crazy songs my personal favourite songs from this film being she's like the wind & time of my life.

114,stephanlinsenhoff,This is my dance space - your dance space,10,8 July 2011,"Dirty Dancing, a low budgeted movie, shot in 44 days and based on screenwriter 'Babes' own childhood in the Catskills. Baby: ""That was the summer of 1963 - when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's"" (the Mountain Lake Hotel, Pembroke, Virginia). The last summer for this kind of resorts Max Kellerman thinks: ""the young go to Europe, seeing 22 countries in three days"". Regardless the not too good critics, the movie drew adult audiences instead of the expected teens, with viewers rating the film highly. Baby, seventeen and ready to cut the ties to Daddy, ready for Mount Holyoke College to study economics of underdeveloped countries and then the Peace Corps: ""Our Baby's gonna change the world (and) Lisa's going to decorate it."" The testing prelude are Kellerman's two worlds, divided by the sign Staff Quarters No Guests please. ... the guests world and the staff's. Baby passes the sign, warned by Johnny's cousin and Johnny asking: ""What's she doing here? Taking time out from playing?"" Is she worth it, can heart and soul really belong to the staff, the people, herself belonging to the (rich) guests? She helps Penny not only with the father money for the backstreet abortion, later calling for daddy when it went bad, not only a stand-in at the Sheldrake, before this the hard-work-rehearsal with the hostile Johnny. Not bothering Penny's: "" Go back to your playpen, Baby"" and Robbie Goulds ""some people count, some people don't"". The Kellerman's grandson tells Baby, seeing her sister with Robbie: ""Sometimes in this world you see things you do not want to see."" A minute later she sees the weeping Penny, something that is not meant for her eyes: and acts accordingly, worth her future at the Peace Corps. Not to recognize but see beyond Kellerman's peaceful playpen. Baby, named after Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet, knows what she wants. And Johnny Castle, the working class guy, both falling in love with each other. When he is accused for theft Baby frees him, admitting that she spent the night with him: followed by the father-daughter-confrontation. Johnny gets his summer bonus but has to leave by the back door. For the first time Johnny Castle experiences a persons courage. But Baby denies, pointing to the fact that she is nothing else but afraid of everything. Returning through the front door he pulls Frances out of the corner and up on stage: ""Sorry for the interruption, folks, but I always do the last dance of the season. This year somebody told me not to. So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing' with a great partner, who's not only a terrific dancer, but somebody... who's taught me... that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody who's taught me about the kind of person I wanna be. Miss Frances Houseman."" Then the dance – and: the lift. In the back the staff, the people. Suddenly everybody joins the whirl of Johnny's and Baby's dirty dancing, based on the rule: ""This is my dance space – your dance space. Keep our places and grip."" Dirty Dancings core is, as the director sees it: ""I think that Dirty Dancing is the most intimate communication outside the bedroom. It is not dirty at all. Two people looking at each other, looking into each others eyes and try to say: 'I love you.' Its beautiful."" This is my dance space – your dance space. The process from recognition to see each other: admitting in front of the audience love, able the lifts climax. Able and ready for the Peace Corpse. Beyond politics, religion: just the people, their needs. Inspired by JFK:s speech at 2:00 a.m. on October 14, 1960 addressed students on the steps of the University of Michigan Union. Possible.

116,jehaccess6,Dirty Dancing and early '60s American Mores,10,28 November 2007,"I grew up in the era depicted in the film. I was about a year younger than the 17 of the character 'Baby'. My working-class family definitely moved in the same circles as the busboy 'Billy' and the dance instructor 'Johnny Castle'. The world of the Catskills resorts was not even within my awareness at the time.I must say that I did not see the film in its era of release. It is only somewhat by accident that I picked up the VHS tape on a flea market table with the thought that not much was lost if the film failed to hold my interest. What a revelation!! I have never gone in for dance films before, but I have changed my tune!I was mesmerized by Jennifer Grey from the instant the opening credits gave way to the actual narrative. She was so innocent and compelling in the character of 'Baby', I was stunned to learn she was actually 27 when the film was made!Two main points stick with me about the film:1. The rich, professional Jewish clientèle of 'Kellermans' considered themselves the social betters of the mixture of the white working-class, Latinos, and Blacks that staffed the lower rungs of the employee pecking order. Here were the descendants of penniless Jewish immigrants from two or three generations back now lording it over less prosperous young people with a generally longer history in this country.2. The character 'Baby' was able to rise above this attitude and relate to the lives of the little people in a huge way. She was willing to jeopardize her whole future by providing an alibi for 'Johnny' when he was accused of theft.What man could fail to fall for a woman of such character combined with surpassing grace and beauty? No doubt there would be a rocky road ahead for the two lovers from such diverse backgrounds and values. But with their great love, their union would survive and prosper.Sadly, in reality Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had major difficulty working together. It never came across in the film, but that is probably why no reuniting sequel was ever made.I have watched this film about 50 times in two weeks and always catch some new detail I missed or misunderstood in previous viewings.

What a piece of American feelgood tosh! Unfortunately it keeps interrupting the excellent dancing. DD was made in 1987, so the heroine has to be a politically aware young woman who stands up for the underdog. American movies love teaching lessons, and the lessons of the 80s are made to sound like something from the Reader's Digest. You don't think that's all they were all along??? Plus Baby falls into bed with Johnny far too quickly and easily for a 17-year-old in 1963. We barely knew the facts of life back then.

The things that really grabbed me were the dancing (Swayze really was a good dancer) and a really awesome soundtrack including new songs at the time such as 'Hungry Eyes' by Eric Carmen, 'I've Had the Time of My Life' by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes and Swayze's own single 'She's Like the Wind'.

Jennifer Grey plays Frances ""Baby"" Houseman, a shy young woman who dreams of joining the Peace Corps and goes on vacation with her parents and older sister to a spa/camp. There she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the sexy older dance instructor. She becomes his dancing partner when his usual partner has to drop out due to an unexpected pregnancy. And as he's teaching her the new dance moves, they fall in love. Of course you love the romance in the film, but it's the dancing that makes the film most enjoyable. Every scene where Johnny is teaching Baby the dance moves is great. They're funny, sweet, and romantic. Makes you want to learn to dance! And if you're a woman it sure makes you want to have Johnny as an instructor! And then of course the climax. The final, main dance scene at the end is the highlight of the film. If you don't love seeing Johnny and Baby dance right on key then you don't' love this film! It is so exciting to watch and makes you want to be her! I think it's amazing how, from watching this film, you would never guess that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey hated each other during filming. Their chemistry is amazing in this film!

However, the casting really is well done because one of the movies themes is you sometimes have to take risks to find true happiness.The movie is enjoyable with the well choreographed dancing scenes and also nostalgic because many people today are glued to their television screens and computers and don't enjoy old fashioned fun anymore.

Sure, there are some cosmetic differences, but scrape away the makeup and change a few locations and you've got the same flick, over and over and over again.Having said that, I will guiltily admit I enjoyed the film when I last saw it.

Had she, and the director actually BEEN in the Catskills, (and given the movie, I can't believe she ever went there as a child, or was too young to notice anything much), She also must never have bothered to see what crummy housing. I'm not sure whether the iconic movie, 'Sweet Lorraine', which is, in fact, set in the Catskills and has a truly romantic as well as accurate historical portrayal, was released before 'Dirty Dancing', or after it. I would hope that it was after that release, because there is no way that Bergstein could have passed this movie off as having anything whatsoever to do with true Catskill resort experience had that been the case.Why would 'Johnny' choose 'Baby' as a substitute partner when his fellow employees danced so expertly and sensuously. Viewers are given no reason. There was not even an attraction between them. All the acting is stiff and awkward, even that of the entertainment director of the resort who, obviously, had never made it to a Catskill resort either.The film is plodding. The 'star' of the film would have to be Cynthia Rhodes, as 'Penny'. Viewed in 1986, or in 2021, that's all she wrote, folks.",Dirty Dancing

The second time was only because some kid in my acting class told me he had a cameo, so I rented it again just to watch for him ...At any rate, I found it to be a major disappointment. The script was cheesy, the plot was bland, and the ""Grand finale"" dance scene was ""just okay."" Certain elements of the storyline were unbelievable...The ""ugly duckling"" goes to the Catskills with her family, and falls for a handsome dance teacher...who falls in love with her. BUT her dad believes this guy A) got his dance partner pregnant (just because he was helping the girl...) and B) Stole some stuff (because an envious Matron set him up...)Even if he wasn't a thief, WHY would she even like this guy?? I mean he's a good dancer, but would YOU want a guy who slept around with wealthy older women? you could catch something. I kept thinking, if everyone would just come out and say the truth in this movie, there wouldn't be 500 misunderstandings going on at once.THe parts of the story that could have been played up were played down, and vice versa. None of the characters were endearing. At all. I felt empathy for no one. Baby was bland, her sister was a brat, Johnny was a revamping of Swayze's ""Outsiders"" character except for the dancing, and the late great Jerry Orbach was reduced to a cardboard cut-out character of a domineering father.

In addition, mainly the protagonist has a personality and charisma that bring something more to the film (in addition to the characters, in general, being truly interesting).

143,sherbetsaucers,Do Ya Love Me?,6,6 February 2007,"Growing up there was a movie I loved. Star Wars. I wanted to be Han Solo, I wanted the X-Wings and lightsaber. I wanted to live a dream. A little while later I became vaguely aware of something called girls. Now that I've learned to talk to them without pulling their hair and running away (generally) I've discovered that for many of them the reverence I hold for Star Wars they hold for Dirty Dancing. Why? I'll come back to that later.Dirty Dancing is a simple movie. Baby (Jennifer Grey) and her family go to an upper middle class holiday resort for the summer. She is only seventeen, naive and something of a Daddy's girl (Her nickname is Baby, this is not a subtle movie). Once we reach the resort we realise that amongst the staff there is a very distinct class system at work. It is acceptable, even encouraged that the waiters 'show the daughters a good time' but the dancers, led by Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are to keep well away from them. And why not I ask you, after all, he wears tight fitting t-shirts and a leather jacket. He's a wrong 'un and no mistake. Still, as is the nature of these things Baby and Johnny are thrust together due to circumstance, and decide to continue thrusting together due to them both being attractive and young. He teaches her how to dance and she teaches him that he can be anything he wants to be. Unfortunately their love is a forbidden love and Baby's father, Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach), cannot see past Johnny's working class roots, assuming that he is the one who got his own dancing partner pregnant. Of course it wasn't, it was that no good, rich waiter who is now making moves on Baby's sister! Still, Baby continues to see Johnny, this is after all true love, but of course they are eventually discovered, Johnny is sacked and Baby is miserable. Luckily her father knows she'll get over it. However, Dr. Houseman had not counted on the big finish. Inspired by Baby's belief in both himself and her ideology in general, Johnny returns to the resort and dances the last dance of the season with Baby in front of all the guests. The evil waiter is discovered, Dr. Houseman accepts Johnny, and the classes are united through the medium of dance. Huzzah! The performances here are absolutely fine. Grey is suitably cute and sunshine-filled, and it is actually hard to believe that she is ten years older than her character is supposed to be. Swayze looks fantastic and I can absolutely see why every girl I knew growing up wanted to be Baby. Orbach is suitably fatherly, giving what is actually a very subtle and real performance. Many parts of the story are contrived, but if you are going to believe that the boy from the wrong side of the tracks and daddy's princess are going to end up together in the end, I think we can accept that.Like many people I really enjoy the soundtrack to this movie. Mixing fantastic early 60s rock'n'roll with mid-80s ballads it starts your toes tapping straight from the start and doesn't give up until the very end. Then of course there is the dancing. I remember at the tender age of nine being at a friends house and having a feeling of pure horror when it was suggested that I be Johnny while she danced as Baby to 'I Had The Time Of My Life'. For a start I didn't think I had a hope in pulling off the lift. I mean, we had never even set foot in a handy, nearby lake.So, back to my original question. Why is this movie so popular, especially with women? Apart from the fact that Baby has a pretty amazing life, I think it is because she is the knight in shining armour. In Star Wars Princess Leia is no slouch but lets be honest, it's up to Luke and Han to rescue her. In Dirty Dancing it is the princess who rescues the lovable rogue. There is no need for a blaster or a lightsaber, here she is able to do it through simply believing in other people and believing in love.This movie will never mean as much to me as Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but I don't think it's awful, I don't even think it's bad. In fact I think it's quite good. It is an unpretentious, feel-good romance movie. I may not have had the time of my life, but it was certainly a pleasant enough hour and a half.",Dirty Dancing
144,ShaneofPg,One of the worst Movies of the 80's!,1,14 May 2002,"Dirty Dancing is in my opinion a dreadful, cheesy movie. I disliked it the first time I saw it and my opinion of it has not changed since then! It is a badly directed and produced film and far to sickly sweet. It is an awful movie which for some strange reason was very popular despite its awfulness.

145,reblit,The Movie Draws You In - and Back to 1963,10,28 March 2005,"I have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.I think the important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember ""before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came."" I can feel myself saying something like, ""I carried a watermelon."" and then realizing just how stupid that was! Jennifer Grey plays Frances ""Baby"" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is going to start college in the Fall. She goes to Kellerman's for vacation with her family (mom, Dad and sister Lisa).One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes!Baby's father (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. Around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.Lonnie Price plays a great conceited grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman.The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! The ""dirty dancers"" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, ""Where'd they learn to do that?"".Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, ""She's Like The Wind"" brings tears to my eyes each time I hear/watch it in this movie.The movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in Baby's and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.",Dirty Dancing

I thought Jennifer Grey gave a somewhat flat performance as Baby but Patrick Swayze did a good job as Johnny. My favorite song appears only briefly, during the scene when Baby and Johnny are coming home from their first dance appearance and the car radio is on. The song is ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" by the Drifters. This became one of my favorite songs and it no doubt made a mark on my memory. My favorite scene is when Baby and Johnny are playing around in the dance studio, just before the grandson of the owner of Kellerman's comes in.

I can say nothing good about it, the acting is crap, plot is as cornball as one can get, and it doesn't appeal to me.I also cannot stand any Patrick Swayze movies to date, that weighs in heavily. The only reason I have seen this movie is because when I was young, there was only one T.V., so not much choice with an older sister and mother who love this movie.

152,narine_tevosyan,Review,10,17 March 2019,"""Dirty Dancing"" is a classic - one of those movies that I watched as a child. The viewer not only dances with this film but also sings. This movie is about a girl, whose name is Baby, is traveling with her family to resort. There she meets with the professional dancers that hired to entertain the guests. SO it turns out that she helps them and she has to dance instead of a partner with a charming guy, in which Patrick Swayze himself plays. In the end, they perform their amazing dance for everyone at this resort, and they are all in shock. It is very hard to tell everything about the movie, but it's a worthwhile movie to watch. We see their father and daughter relationships, in particular, how Baby's father trusts her that gives her a large sum of money to her without knowing about the cause. Also, we see here human goodness, because she wants this money for helping the partner of Johnny, who got pregnant and couldn't dance with him. The parts where Baby agrees to dance with him and also how her father helps this girl not only financially by being unaware about what is happening, but also as a doctor, demonstrate the high qualities of people. Overall, the movie only lefts positive thoughts, because we see only these kind of acts from the side of the main characters and they can be beneficial for one's awareness.",Dirty Dancing
153,scholara2,Very good movie,8,9 July 2006,"I normally don't watch romantic, sentimental movies, but Dirty Dancing is so much more.The story centers around characters who grow and learn, and who you really empathize with.Add to this the performances of Swayze and Grey. They both did an excellent job, as did the supporting cast. I read another review here which said that the two actors really didn't care much for each other. If this is indeed true, then double kudos for their on screen chemistry.Who would think that two people who didn't like each other could generate such chemistry. I guess that IS acting :-)Jennifer Grey was about 27 when this film was made, but she looked at least 10 years younger (braces and all), which I thought was fascinating. And her performance was heartfelt.Also, kudos for the writers and Patrick Swayze. It would've been so easy to have his character as a two dimensional ""hunk/stud"" with no brains, but instead he gives a a performance that's both macho and sensitive (which is probably the reason why women went ""gaga ""for him).Another plus is the storyline. It dealt with subjects like abortion, which was especially taboo back in the early 60's, and a young girl's coming of age, by seeing what life was like outside of her sheltered upper middle class upbringing.And, need I say, the ending dance sequence was DYNAMITE! I have no doubt, in a dance contest, Swayze could probably give John Travolta and Christopher Walken a run for their money.The signature song brings back memories for me.All in all, a very good movie.",Dirty Dancing

It's a really great, inspiring firm that holds up well to time - 20 years later I found everything to be very compelling and pertinent.First of all, Jerry Orbach kicks ass. That just needed to be said. Jennifer Grey does a solid job, but Swayze carries the day. This character-driven plot line is relatable and wholly interesting. All in all, I found myself thoroughly engaged.Finally, it even prompted a bit of introspection - if I'm so reticent to dance, what makes me any different from the obstinate, prudish old man?

The proof is that you recognize the title, and you know what it means. My focus goes deeper than the ""ugly duckling/Prince Charming/red hot final dance"" story—for me, a couple highlights of the film are Baby's naiveté, and Baby's ingenuous embrace of the very hot Johnny, and her eager awareness of her rising woman's heat. In 1987 many moviegoers would have been more than slightly discomfited by the matter-of-fact abortion episode, and perhaps nonplussed by Baby's casual deception to come up with the $250 to pay for it. Wowee. It's great to help out a friend of a friend and all, but that seems like an unbelievable and baffling stretch for a timorous young girl of Baby's obvious unworldliness. On the other hand, Baby's hormones are ready to pop. Alone with Johnny, in the prelude to intimacy scene, Baby suddenly opens up: ""I'm scared of everythingI'm scared of who I am, and most of all I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you."" That's a heartbeat. You felt it, too. I hope you've had a moment, an embrace, a volcanic new feeling of desire that you feared you would never feel the rest of your whole life. I have.

I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. The plot, although exceedingly predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.`Dirty Dancing' is a truly powerful, magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance.

This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your ""Favorite Movie of All Time?""This is the movie that made me avoid ""Ghost"" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add).  Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable.  Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of ""Star Trek"" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're ""trying"" to be funny).  And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good.  But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.I can see people being entertained by this movie.  I really can (just not me).  But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!",Dirty Dancing

This movie brought something exquisite to the table and made me want to get up and dance because the music the performances of the two actors our outstanding and deserve the upmost praise for the feature film.

This movie got a wonderful soundtrack, great actors, lots of dancing, drama and comedy. Even if the movie is set in the 60s it has that long gone feeling of the carefree, happy 80s. Grey and Swayze are captivating and they just has that untouchable charm that you only can find in these lovely movies from the 80s. I will also give cred for the wonderful cinematography which capture the colors of the nature scenes. This is a must see for everyone!",Dirty Dancing
172,gio_vvanni,Aged like a good wine,9,9 September 2019,"Well as the title says: it did really age awesomely.
It's a damn good story, easy and pleasant though it hasn't got a banal nor obvious plot. Also some detail aged well with the obvious change of moral occurred in forty years, so it's not old stuffs.
The songs and the dances are good, well connected to the story and they are powerful, God if they're powerful. The feelings aroused by Johnny and Babe are really amplified or highlighted by the music, their dances, their movement, and this make the movie somehow really moving.
The act is pretty good, they maybe aren't the best in the world but the give a damn good performance, they are really well directed and the photography is as simple as neat.
I can see why this movie is a cult, I've waited way too much to watch it -and I don't know why-, but I'm totally going to watch it again, sooner or later.",Dirty Dancing

Baby yearns for the arms of the hot earnest gentile since her own culture is filled with wash-outs.

Also, cannot forget Jennifer Greys work, I admit it, when I first saw the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I had a crush on her, she was beautiful then(She is not ugly now, just different to me.), and the 2 of them made a spark, between them, that turned into a nuclear explosion, by the end of the movie, which is why they became a great actor/actress, because they put their heart and soul into their characters, not their characters into them! I would be appalled, if they were to try and remake this movie, there will NEVER be the same intense magic in it, as there was in this one! If someone were to ever try to repeat the magic through this movie, again, what they would come up with, would be an inkling compared to the magic of this version!",Dirty Dancing

Patrick Swayze is amazing and both he and Jennifer gray looked amazing. from when i first saw it years ago, i have rated it as my favourite film. the plot is simple but good. its nice to see that people can care about others so much that they will risk their feeling and reputation for someone else.I dont think that there are enough films that do this and it shows that relationships can work, whatever the circumstances. not only did Baby look after herself and johnny but she also protected others, showing that not all teenage girls are annoying little fools. one of the best films of all time.",Dirty Dancing
176,schumybv,Good movie with some bad parts,9,6 June 2005,"This classic movie was so popular when it came out and it still is. The acting is absolutely horrible, especially from Jennifer Grey, but what makes this movie great is the dancing and the music, which makes you forget all about the bad acting. The story line isn't that great, yet people (mostly women) loved it because it's the story where the girl who does not look like a model at all, manages to get the good looking guy who seems way out of her league. It represents the dream of many women of getting the unattainable guy and do some dirty dancing with him. It's easier for the average woman to identify with Baby. Speaking of Baby, I think they could find a much better nickname for her.The story appeals to the public, but the dancing also has a major part in attracting the audience. This movie may make you reconsider those dancing classes you gave up a long time ago. I say, forget the story, it's not that great, forget the acting, you'll be glad you did, and focus on the dancing, because it is great. And I gotta say I was pretty surprised by Patrick Swayze. He is one hell of a dancer. Can't say the same about Jennifer, but I guess she is not supposed to be a good dancer in the movie, since she is just learning. The bottom line is that despite its bad parts this is a good movie that is definitely worth your time. You may learn some moves along the way.",Dirty Dancing
177,Pat-118,If I could dance like that....,9,6 July 1999,"I LOVED this movie; the music really made it, though. When Johnny and Baby danced to ""Don't you feel like crying"", I wanted to scream Yes, Patrick, I do! for two reasons: one, I never had sex like that with any body who looked or danced that way, and two, I can't dance like that( I'd look like I was seizing or possessed by demons with no rhythm; not that demons HAVE rhythm!) And the opening scene where they played Be my Baby, was the second sexiest scene on film, with the first being  the one with ""don't you feel like cryin?""

179,Wardman3,"The little film that could! And boy, did it ever!!",8,13 October 2007,"Despite the obvious flaws, one can not deny there is a most definite magical quality in this film. Perhaps it is the nostalgic story line of innocent romance in an innocent time. Perhaps it is the feel good soundtrack and dancing. Whatever it is, it transcended many films of the genre and the decade. There is such a strong chemistry between and Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it outshines some clichéd moments in the script. The music works so well in the film. Even the juxtapositioning of the modern day hits, with the time period songs works.The stars aligned for this film, it came out at the right time and just exploded and even after 20 years, it is one of the few movies that is still enjoyable to watch every time. And Patrick Swayze was right! Nobody puts Baby in a corner!",Dirty Dancing
180,mls-11,Dirty Dancing,10,11 November 2005,"For anyone with a heart - a soul - ""Dirty Dancing"" is a great film.Seeing the verve of the young people in the film - doing what they can to break from the conventional bonds of their parents - was stimulating. Not appearing to be ""bad"" in the traditional sense, they were merely trying to carve out their own place in the world.Patrick Swayze's acting - overshadowed only by superb dancing - was strong. Playing the ""bad guy"" with a misunderstood spirit was a fine example of casting.Jennifer Grey, as ""Baby"" Houseman, nearly stole the film. Her innocence - her overwhelming beauty - was exceedingly provocative. Her dancing, too, was wonderful. Watching her with Patrick Swayze was so sensuous, and watching them dance was a heart-warming experience.It is interesting to go to the IMDb site and check out the filmographies. Some actors who continued on in their careers - some who drifted into seeming oblivion.Every once in awhile, a film comes along that grabs us. For me, ""Dirty Dancing"" falls in line with other excellent films that are ""grabbers,"" like ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" ""You've Got Mail,"" ""West Side Story,"" et al.I just finished watching ""Dirty Dancing"" for the umpteenth time, and NEVER tire of the story and the portrayal.

(Incidentally, chosen one of AFI's ""Ten Cheesiest Movie Lines,"" and deservedly so.) The line I thought made the whole movie worthwhile was Baby's tearful statement to her father, ""I know I let you down, and I'm sorry. But you let me down, too."" This one hit home really hard for me - maybe part emotion and part timing (going through an extremely rough phase with my own dad).As far as the rest of the movie went, Baby's sister was incredibly annoying (what was the deal with the eyebrows??!! They should have had a credit all to themselves!!). Penny's pose after she has the abortion, when Baby comes in to check on her and Penny's leg is ""a'la dancer"" with her toe pointed to show her calf to best effect always makes me laugh.The mother's character was not fleshed out very well. The only real insight you get into her character is right at the end of the movie, when she comments, ""I think she gets it from my side of the family.""

With it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (I've Had) The Time of My Life & the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. He sings ""She's Like The Wind"" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze scenes makes this. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't Dirty Dancing. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey Patrick makes up for that if you know what I mean!!!

The final dance and the line, Nobody puts baby in the corner, is iconic.
Did any girl watch that movie and not fall in love with Johnny Castle? I doubt it.

188,katstar1982,"frosted, fried, and leathern",3,6 December 2006,"Apparently, you are dirty dancing when you are sweating excessively in your tightest pair of matador pants and vehemently, jaggedly, irregularly slamming your 35-year old package against gawky underage girls who seem to enjoy your hideous ""white man's overbite."" Moments like this make Dirty Dancing an extremely, albeit unintentionally, hilarious movie. It is especially funny when watching it immediately after reading the comments posted on this site, many of which describe the movie as a powerful, amazing, sensual, touching, romantic experience. I, for one, could not help but keep such comments in mind while I was LAID OUT laughing at Johnny's ""free styling"" with Penny and company in the scene when Baby ""carried a watermelon"" to their secret dirty dancing party. I'm sorry, I know you all think Patrick Swayze is pure sex incarnate, but he looks ridiculous. I'm not saying he can't lead a woman around a ballroom because he can. I mean, obviously, the man is a trained dancer. It's when he starts snapping off though, trying to appear spontaneous to the beat of tacky oldies like ""Do You Love Me,"" that he exposes himself to be the rhythmless spaz he is. And for the record, the ensemble of extras scattered about in this scene are not really dancing so much as they are having a whole bunch of dry sex.Anyway, the thing that makes Dirty Dancing so priceless is that it takes itself dead seriously. Johnny isn't screwing around, for instance, when he explains that the vast number of rich, lonely housewives he's slept with under the guise of giving them dance lessons, were actually exploiting him: Baby - ""You were just using them, that's all."" Johnny - ""No, no that's not it, that's the thing, you see baby it wasn't like that. They were using me."" Then, instead of bursting into convulsive laughter like I do every time I hear the line, she falls for it and kisses him with all the passionate sympathy she can muster, trying very earnestly not to exploit him like the rich, lonely housewives did. Ha. Fool.So the movie should be no good at all, unless you are able to find the humor in Patrick Swayze's pained-looking danceface or his thrusting, perky butt or his weird ""street"" accent. Or in the frosted, fried, and leathern results of Cynthia Rhodes' time spent in the tanning bed with a bottle of peroxide. Or in Jennifer Grey's many shaky voiced monologues about blossoming into a woman and learning the ways of the world. In short, those who hate on Dirty Dancing because they cannot find the humor in these things are probably kind of stale. And those who adore Dirty Dancing because they cannot find the humor in these things are probably kind of daft.",Dirty Dancing

When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times!I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together.I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie!

It's one of those guilty little pleasures.  It's the perfect slumber party flick whether you're 13 or 30.  I literally think that the phrase ""chic flick"" was coined with this movie in mind.  I don't expect guys to understand--unless said guys understand what it's like to be a pre (or just post) pubescent 14 year old girl enamored with the likes of Patrick Swayze, ready to swoon at the sight of him in a black tank top bumping and grinding his way across the floor.  Sure it's juvenile and the acting is not Oscar quality, but there's something in it for every girl who has had a secret crush on an older guy or the ""bad boy"".  Like much 80s music, it's not great--hell some of it's downright bad, but you love it anyway.  So if you're feeling frivolous, in the mood for a totally improbable romance and some good old music, then this is a good choice.

200,heritage716,music,10,25 August 2007,"I think, like many others on here, that the music was exceptional. Last week, one of the channels had a ""dirty dancing marathon."" Good thing the husband wasn't home, because I watched it all day. I kept wondering why, I love it so much. When he came home, he said that it's the music I like---he's right. And, maybe the fact that we live a 1/2 hour northwest of the Catskills? They did a good job with the movie, to look like Upstate NY. (We don't get that much sun tho.) And I think I noticed Pilot Mountain, NC in the movie? Or near there? Beautiful areas. Just like here. I never tire of watching this movie, tho some on here thought it was awful. Too bad. One thing I really love, is a particular song; ""in the still of the night."" Growing up in the 50's, my brother and I always had to listen to a neighbor's brother, rehearsing a song-- and they wanted to know, if we liked it. Yep--it was that song! So it was so good to hear it played in a movie! I have to get the soundtrack, and the movie! I agree, about the clothes. Especially that blouse Baby had on, after they go to the Sheldrake. I remember those coming out in the very late 60's. And when her father says; ""when I say I'm wrong..."" well, he didn't really apologize IMO. Just said he was wrong, but not to him? It should have been; ""I'm sorry Johnny."" The sister and waiter play good roles too. They all played good parts. ""22 countries in 3 days."" I've been to Europe 8 times, and to me, that's too much!

I know for a fact there are blokes out there that either admittedly or secretly enjoy watching and love this classic film! (Not just English/British men-but men world wide!) and rightly so...nearly 18 years on, and this film is STILL watched and enjoyed- world wide, and people are still able to relate to it.I know all the words i've seen it that many times!Most of my dance moves i use for work-are taken from this film!There's so much energy.In fact it is my firm belief, if people were brought up thinking watching these types of films are deemed as 'cool' and OK to watch the world would be a slightly better place to live.An enjoyable film that doesn't make you want to go out into the world and cause havoc and heartache-do drugs or get into gun crime (coz its classed as being 'cool')this films makes you want to find a girl-that you can love and feel that special feeling felt in this film.It also makes you want to go out and enjoy yourself by simply Dancing!It's free,Legal and makes you feel good-while keeping you fit and healthy-not forgetting FUN! In my opinion, the films main two themes are 'LOVE', the true love story between Baby and Johnny (Jennifer Gray and Mr Swayze) (compared to Baby's sister's relationship-where she was just used for sex) plus classic Music. Yes music! The type you can really dance to! Every song on the soundtrack is fantastic! In true cheesy Dj style, i still play all the old classics from the soundtrack (especially 'Time of my life')and is still goes down a treat every single time! You just can't stop yourself! Anyway-everyone has wrote hundreds of reviews, and has pretty much summed up this film and explained the story...all thats left to say is....If you haven't seen this film yet...go treat yourself, buy the DVD (you can get if for an average of £5 or less (British pounds) Roughly 9 American Dollars (i think!)It's well worth it, and highly recommended.If, you enjoy the film-please go out and buy one of the 'Dirty Dancing' soundtracks- especially the Ultimate Dirty Dancing (released in the UK 2004 in celebration of the films anniversary- as it contains all of the songs and is digitally remastered. (I got my second personal copy from the British supermarket 'Tescos' for an amazing £6! (For anyone 'Up North' try 'Music Zone' as its only £6 in there too!Anyway-cheers for taking the time to read this-i'm sorry i went on a bit! If your planning on seeing this film for the first time...enjoy! And as everyone else has said-very cheesily! Try and have THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!I will go as far to say 10/10.

The music is amazing on its own, let alone the amazing dance sequences to go along with it. The story is about Baby growing up and falling in love for the first time. And as a result, her relationships with the people closest to her have to evolve and change – as everyone is forced to confront their prejudices and assumptions. It's a perfect coming of age story",Dirty Dancing
204,hilary-franoux,THIS is the holiday romance I never had.,8,22 August 2001,"I can't fault this film. The characterisation and subject matter had me hooked from the start. Despite the heroine's trials and tribulations, I would gladly have swopped places with her to get my hands Patrick Swayze. What more could you want? Holiday setting, beautiful people, romance, and more sexy dance scenes than you can wave a stick at. This is one of the few films I can view time and again and still get a thrill of excitement watching the plot unfold.",Dirty Dancing
205,robbids,A generation's fave flick,10,22 August 2003,"It's hard to explain why so many people love this film - but they surely do! I was a teenager when I first saw it, and like everyone else of my age, I fell in love with it... The ""summer"" atmosphere, the love story, the dancing, the great music... Everything is just as it should be. Each one of my friends know this movie by heart, like me! It was just so easy to see ourselves in the characters. And like every time you love a film so much, you can never stop liking it, even years later. Well done to Grey and especially to Swayze for becoming ""the"" sex symbol for all the teenagers of the late 80s/early 90s! A ""cult"" for a whole generation.",Dirty Dancing
206,farfromperfection,Still a favourite...,9,10 October 2005,"*Contains Spoilers* I rarely write comments. In my 20 years of viewing films and at times, over-analysing them to the despair of my partner, I have very rarely decided that a film in my eyes, is worth viewing 10+ times.Dirty Dancing - 1987 a low budget film was released, set in the summer of 1963 and focused on a teenager, Baby Houseman (Frances), her older sister Lisa and their parents visiting a Summer Camp, which was hosting it's final year. Baby was everything Lisa wasn't. Lisa loved fashion, dating and boys. Baby wanted to become a Peace Embassendor, enjoyed reading and didn't have many social interactions. She was the under the watchful eye of her father and did everything she could do to please him.This all changed in a matter of a few months for Baby Houseman. The prim and proper Daddy's Girl that never answered back found an outstanding hobby she excelled in, new friends and most importantly, her romance with Johnny Castle. Drafted in to take the place of Penny, Johnny's usual dance partner, the two struck a friendship up and within time, fell in love. The relationship was banished by Baby's father, and despite forbidding her to have anything to do with ""them"", Baby continued to see Johnny behind her fathers back. Her father is under the impression that Johnny is responsible for Penny's abortion - a child that was in fact fathered by Robbie, a med student doing a summer job in the resort and who was attached to Lisa. Jake Houseman refuses to talk to Johnny for this reason, and also is unaware of the fact Baby asked for money from him in order to fund the abortion.Johnny is then accused of stealing from one of the residences who he had a previous fling with, and who is jealous of his relationship with Baby after catching them unawares. Max, the owner of the resort approaches Jake and talks of sacking Johnny, which incites Baby who knows full well he is innocent as they were together. This is Baby's coming of age; admitting to herself she is love, and admitting to her father that she knows the man she loves is innocent because she was with him. In the end, as predicted, she announces his innocence to protect him and keep him in a job at the resort, which is his only income. She falls out with her father, her family, most of the resort and even then, Johnny is still fired for having a relationship with a resident (Baby). One of the most poignant moments of the film is Baby crying to her father, apologising for letting him down, as well as the moment Johnny leaves the camp.It is at this moment that you realise what is perhaps the most heart warming part of the film is. The way in which the characters all learn something from each other; Johnny realises that not everything is black and white, that people do not exist in this world to use him. Jake realises that his daughter is growing up, and learns to accept her choice. Even Lisa, the stuck up, spoilt sister of Baby learns that her sister needs her unconditional love and another moment in the film is when Lisa is comforting Baby after Johnny leaves. But Baby's plight is perhaps the most important - A girl who never stood up to her family; sheltered, spoilt and socially awkward. A girl who learnt to dance, learnt to embrace love and sociology, and a girl who learnt that sometimes no matter whether things are correct, they will always finish wrong. The two central characters rely on each other to figure these things out - Without each other they would have carried on for an undetermined time living a life where they knew no different. Some say this is a soppy, pathetic documentation of ""love"". I'm not sure if even the love story is the most significant factor here; I truly believe (or hope) the emotions run high for the viewers that enjoy this film is because of the massive change that happens to the characters personalities. The way they ""grow"" in just a few months. The way that they know whatever happens from this moment on, nothing will ever be the same again. This is why the film never fails to make me cry. The chemistry between Baby and Johnny (even if the actual actors themselves fought on set) is explosive - Even when they are practising and Baby frustrates Johnny with her ineptness. Everything clicks into place, and the ending moment is magical. What is worth noting in this film is for all those that bash it for being too ""slushy"" is that no ""I love you"" notion is utter during the film. When Johnny gets up on stage to announce his ""return"" and final dance, he is almost professional in his display of affection and love for Baby. He doesn't over-gush with sentimentality - Which I think is the same for the film.I admit I don't watch this every month like I know some fans do, but every time I do view this, I think it captures the innocence of Baby, the angst of Johnny and the acceptance of Jake perfectly. It shows a time before the Vietnam War, the downfall of the American Government after JFK's assassination and before the ""swinging sixties"" revolution brought on from the likes of Presley and the Beatles.A 9/10 from me - A timeless classic.",Dirty Dancing
207,aldri-39576,A gem,8,8 January 2018,"When I first saw Dirty Dancing years ago, I was stunned by how much of it I recognized from my past and how true it rang for me. Nobody except John Sayles (and later the authors of Good Will Hunting) had ever brought a time and a place so familiar to me so alive on the screen before. It was all there - the Ivy league protocol and manners (I went to Cornell, like Neil), the resort's silly entertainment, the lodge and cabins, the Houseman's table manners - everything was just as I remembered, INCLUDING the presence of other people that we werent really ""suppose"" to associate with as much. At least not invite them to dinner anyway, unless they were perhaps courageous bums like Jack Dawson in Titanic, or maybe....just maybe......handsome and talented dancers? Anyway, but thats just the set up. Author Eleanor Bergstein knew the era well and depicted it with stunning accuracy and brutal honesty. But the real story is about dancing and the sexual awakening of an innocent young girl, Baby Houseman. In that role, Jennifer Grey was perfect, and the transformation she undergoes throughout the film never strains credibility nor seems contrived or forced. Not an easy feat considering how much she was intent on growing up that summer.Other cast members contributed mightily to this classic. Baby's parents projected just the right mix of parental authority and love for their daughter, an essential ingredient throughout. Meanwhile, well educated Neil and Robbie were superb as the cocky nerd and womanizing cad, especially when contrasted with Johnny. And I especially loved Baby's relationship with Penny and how Penny ultimately came to respect her after treating her like trash in the beginning. Last but not least, Patrick Swayze was magnanimous - combining raw power and sexuality with vulnerability and a soft heart, I couldn't imagine the movie without him.Finally, the music and dance was absolutely essential to the success of this film. The dance needed to be sexualized as it was important to the plot, but it never crossed the line into bad taste or vulgarity. The musical choices were all superb, and the closing dance scene is one of Hollywoods most memorable. All in all, I never stop enjoying this movie, and expect to see it again and again periodically for the nostalia and memories it never fails to conjure up.",Dirty Dancing
208,sodapopgurlie,So it's not Casablanca...so what?,10,4 January 2001,"Yes, this movie isn't Casablanca. It's not Romeo and Juliet, or any of those so-called ""classics"". But so what? It's a fantastic movie, and a great love story. It's got a good cast, good music, a wonderful ending...this is one of my favorite movies. It's not a guy movie by any means, it's definitely a chick flick. But all in all, even though maybe some of the dialogue is a little cheesy, and the basic plot - good girl falls for (semi) bad boy, daddy doesn't approve - has been used a million times, and will be used a million more, it still stands that Dirty Dancing is a sweet movie that never fails to make me smile.",Dirty Dancing

It's fantastic. The holiday romance you never had. The dreams you always dreamt become reality here. It honestly is one of my favourite movies of all time, I must have seen it dozens of times, and I'm not one to judge lightly. I simply cannot believe that this wonderful film has an IMDb average of 5.8! I give it a definite thumbs up. Watch it. Again and again. Sit back, relax and enjoy.",Dirty Dancing
211,nxlcsdeo,Only Skin Deep,4,10 December 2007,"Set in 1963, ""Dirty Dancing"" is the story of an ordinary American family--a doctor, his wife, and their two teenage daughters--on vacation at a ritzy lakeside resort. The drama begins when ""Johnny,"" the resort's well-muscled dance instructor (played by a stunning Patrick Swayze), strides into the dining room where a bevy of waiters are setting tables, and is told by the hotel manager in no uncertain terms to keep his hands off the female guests. The rest of the film showcases Swayze's enormous sex appeal, both on the dance floor and off.And that's why I gave this film such a low rating--it's only skin deep. ""Baby,"" the younger daughter in the family, and a fresh-faced idealist, is entranced by Johnny's raw sensuality when she stumbles onto the hotel staff in a distant cabin one evening, bumping and grinding in an orgiastic dance party.When Johnny's dance partner Penny realizes she is ""knocked up"" by one of the hotel waiters who dumps her when he knows she is pregnant, Baby borrows money from her father to help the dancer pay for an illegal abortion, which goes badly. Baby's father is then called in to attend the critically ill girl, and she pulls through, but the father, disgusted by the behavior which brought on the girl's condition, insists Baby sever all ties with her new friends.Baby, however, begins lying to her parents--and after days of intense dance sessions with Johnny, starts sleeping with him. Wait--isn't that how Penny got into such deep trouble? The film never asks the hard questions. It's all about titillating youthful sexual appetites through lascivious dance, and then indulging those passions under the guise of ""young love."" This stuff is not just skin deep--it's downright deceptive. Couldn't Baby get pregnant after having sex with Johnny? We are not encouraged to go there. Instead, Baby and Johnny keep on dancing...Watch this movie, and buy into it, at your own risk.",Dirty Dancing
212,ar-imdb,an absolute classic. works on so many levels.,10,12 October 2006,"i don't understand why so many people have to hate on this movie. it works as a pure fun summer movie, and at the same time addresses much deeper political and social issues. every time i watch it, i see something new. here's part of the new york times article that eleanor bergstein, the writer and co-producer, said really helped the movie get serious publicity:The New York Times 'DIRTY DANCING' ROCKS TO AN INNOCENT BEATBy SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN August 16, 1987KELLERMAN'S, THE FICTIVE Catskills hotel that provides the setting for the new film ''Dirty Dancing,'' is meant to be more than the sum of its parts, which are golf, gossip and gefilte fish. It stands as a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963 - orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot. So when Frances (Baby) Houseman, the doctor's daughter at the film's center, loses both her virginity and her political naivete to a street-smart dance teacher, the collision should shake the audience, too, out of a certain complacency.These, at least, are the intentions of Eleanor Bergstein, the novelist (''Advancing Paul Newman'') who both wrote and co-produced ''Dirty Dancing''. It will be up to critics and the public to decide how well Ms. Bergstein and the director, Emile Ardolino, have managed to embody such serious ideas in a movie that also aspires to be a summer divertissement - one part ''Flashdance,'' one part ''Baby, It's You.''To Ms. Bergstein, the two poles of the movie are consonant. Growing up in Brooklyn, she moved effortlessly from tutoring inner-city students in the afternoon to shimmying in ''dirty dancing'' contests at night. Similarly, she says, the rock-and-roll that subverts the dance floor etiquette at Kellerman's during the film anticipates a whole array of exciting and disquieting things to come later in the 1960's - the antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, the uprisings in cities and on campuses.''I meant 'Dirty Dancing' to be a celebration of the time of your life when you could believe that a kind of earnest, liberal action could remake the world in your own image,'' Ms. Bergstein said in a recent interview in her Upper West Side apartment. ''The film couldn't have been set a few months earlier or later. The summer of 1963 was the first one after the Cuban missile crisis, which everyone had been following on television. The effect on kids was to make them very scared, and, for the first time, very suspicious of their elders: maybe things wouldn't work out all right.''But the thing that kept the optimism going was John Kennedy himself - young and energetic and sexy. So maybe you could have it all. It was the summer of the Peace Corps and the summer of the 'I Have a Dream' speech. It was like the last summer of liberalism. Because two months after the movie is over, J.F.K. is assassinated. And two months after that the Beatles are on the 'Ed Sullivan Show.' And after that, it's radical action.''''Dirty Dancing'' had its genesis years ago in a more domestic image that fascinated Ms. Bergstein - two daughters in the same family, one raised to be beautiful, the other brainy.Gradually, the writer's notion of the sisters coalesced with her sense of how some people live through dance and popular music. These ideas, in turn, dovetailed with Ms. Bergstein's autobiographical recollections of Catskills summers, ''dirty dancing'' contests and 1960's activism, providing a narrative framework for the screenplay. And by co-producing her own film, Ms. Bergstein retained a rare degree of leverage over its final form.Unlike some recent films,''Dirty Dancing'' treats the idealism of the 1960's as a genuine expression of faith, not a passing fad.Baby Houseman plans to study the economics of the third world and to enter the Peace Corps. Neil Kellerman, the grandson of the hotel's owner, expects to join the Freedom Rides in the South. Almost everything about Kellerman's attests to the heyday of New York, Democratic Party liberalism. Ms. Bergstein based her characterization of Kellerman's on memories of childhood summers spent at Grossinger's. She evokes some of the more familiar elements of the Borscht Belt, but with the affection of one who had shared in them.''I didn't want to make it ugly and vulgar,'' Ms. Bergstein said of Kellerman's. ''It was a world of grace and elegance and - yes - liberal values. I remember that when my family went to the Catskills, you had busboys who were going to take a semester off from college to go on the Freedom Rides. When the three civil rights workers were killed in Mississippi, there was a candlelight vigil.''But as ''Dirty Dancing'' shows in some moments and suggests in others, places like Kellerman's (and, by extension, Kennedy-era America) could not sustain their placid, satisfied existence. When Baby Houseman (Jennifer Grey) follows a friendly bellboy to the staff quarters at Kellerman's, she wades into a blue-collar life of jacked-up cars, raunchy rock-and-roll, and sneers at the affluent, all of it personified by a dance instructor named Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). She gradually gains some acceptance in this world by substituting for Johnny's pregnant dance partner in a mambo show at a nearby resort, after having lied to her father to get $250 for the partner's back-room abortion. Baby's father, Jake (Jerry Orbach), ultimately learns of the ruse, the abortion and his daughter's burgeoning romance with Castle; and the favored child, ''Daddy's girl,'' has to stand on her own. Baby becomes Frances....",Dirty Dancing
213,Zimmerman-1,A tad mixed-up,5,26 July 2003,"This movie appears to be shooting for 60s nostalgia, but comes off as dated-80s fare. Jennifer Grey is consistently dressed in 80s garb and many of the songs are the epitome of bad 80s-pop. Be prepared for a healthy supply of cardboard characters.  The conservative parents are ultra-conservative (they ignorantly wornder which section of the world is experiencing hunger this year).  And Jennifer's character (named Francis - but inanely called ""Baby"" - perhaps a nod to Judy Garland?) becomes so worldly-wise so quickly, that only moments after telling us she doesn't think she'll ever meet a man as great as her dad, she lies to him so that she can help a friend's friend that she only met days before. Right. My favorite continuity error: Swayze notes in one scene that just the year before he ""was eating jujubes to stay alive"".  Later, he tells a croud that every year he has always done the last number at the talent contest.  Which is it, Pat?",Dirty Dancing

I was one who during those years was kicked out of very many dances that I went to, for the type of close dancing the movie portrayed, mostly catholic school dances. I never dated the girl I danced with but we had a lot of fun. getting to the resorts: they were very popular back then. mostly rich folks used them. as the resort owner complains near the end of the movie how jet travel is changing all that, did happen. I like much of the music and the dancing. it will always be in my library. summer time was a time for kids to get jobs like those resorts....rich folks had no trouble getting their kids into one.....money talks.

After meeting dance instructor Johnny Castle, Baby finds herself immersed in the world of dirty dancing.Its the chick flick that reviews itself, Dirty Dancing is timeless. Every generation of girl finds her heart pounding at Patrick Swayze's Johnny and identifying with Baby's romantic faux pas.But Dirty Dancing is more than just a rom-com, its a coming of age movie; charting Baby's progress from innocent girl to woman finishing in an iconic dance set. Swayze is at his best as brooding sexy heart throb Johnny Castle and Jennifer Gray is a refreshingly unsexualised female lead. Set against a stunning mountain backdrop with a cheesy sexy soundtrack its easy to see why this low budget film became such an unexpected hit. The most memorable, quotable girly film of all time.

I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. It's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is OK,choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it.

Patrick Swayze is fantastic in this...the dancing, the acting and even the singing (they play one of his songs 'She's like the wind' in the later scenes). Even those of us younger ladies begin to find him strangely attractive.

I will always remember that, through all the bad times, getting together to watch Dirty Dancing.  Now that I'm a older, technically an ""adult"", I rented it to watch again, having forgotten the movie for the most part (except the dancing, me and my friend knew all the moves), even though I've seen it I don't know how many times.  Now I understand what is so absolutely great about this movie. It's about a chick who knows how to stand up for herself.  About a guy who's had some lucky breaks but is afraid to leave the line drawn for him because he feels that it could be all lost in one single step.  About family relationships.  About coming of age.  About BEING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Sometimes we disappoint people because we don't measure up to their expectations. This movie shows that its more important we follow our ""soul's song"".  It's about ""young love"", the kind of love you can throw away your life for.  And it's about making a stand.

A must see for someone in Love both with His/Her partner and dancing as well. Patrick Swazye and Jennifer Grey excel in their roles and just see them move along. Although I enjoyed the pairing of Patrick and Cynthiya Rhodes more, but then overall the film is a masterpiece. A film that lets you enjoy the true magic of Mambo, a film that teaches you how to love, a film that makes you remember that you can make a difference, and a film that makes you fall in love all over again. The songs are beautiful and the music is excellent. Some of the scenes just make you say, ""Wish I was there..."". A special treat for that someone special.

Most of the movie was just meh/okay. Some parts were dumb, and not even halfway through I was kind of bored. I was laughing at the fight scene, which is probably not what was supposed to happen. It just seemed to fake. The way some of the ""serious"" or ""romantic"" lines are delivered also made me laugh. It seemed way to dramatic or toned weirdly. This would be a fun movie to watch with someone and shout random things at the TV. I was going to rate it 6, because it wasn't bad, just bland/average, but I have to admit the end was really cute. It gave me High School Musical 2 vibes, so that movie was probably inspired a bit by this. While they were dancing on stage he looked at her with a little half smile and that was a really cute moment between them. I do feel let down about the ""Iconic"" line ""Nobody puts baby in the corner"". Like, how is that so iconic? I guess there weren't any other quotable lines.
Overall, an okay movie with a cute ending.",Dirty Dancing

Guys, i'm from Romania....but what's extraordinary about this film...it's the fact that in the '90, when I was at the high-school...many of my colleagues learned the final dance of the movie. I learned too... Now there are more then 14 years since we did that. I still watch this movie and still believe that this is one of the best movies ever made in the entire world. Many people said it's cheesy... I don't get this phrase, my English is not that good but, as I read, it is one o the most watched movie ever... so...back off. I love it. It's not about the dance, I still wonder why do they call it ""Dirty dancing"" cause I didn't see anything dirty in it. It's about a moments in our lives, moments that anyone experienced or... not. Or maybe we forgot that love, first kiss, first night of love are... are simple, honest and innocent.... and maybe we should make room in our life for love....and forget about...sex.I LOVE IT!",Dirty Dancing

The answer to both these questions is ""YES.""

235,spursbabe,A tale of romance that was so hard to get...,10,9 April 2006,"I have to admit, before i watched this film i thought, this is one of those soppy love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through. but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this. I found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter, baby, finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to disagreements with her father. But along the way helps another dance instructor, and risks the whole relationship...A truly heartwarming film, like no other.10/10",Dirty Dancing
236,verabursac,Classic,10,17 March 2021,"Dirty Dancing is a beautiful movie that everyone should watch. It's suitable for kids. I watched it at age 15, but I wanted my my little sister to see it earlier than I did, so we watched it together few days ago, it was terrific and she'll remember it forever, so as I will.It's very likely my favourite movie ever, even though I don't like coming out of age movies very much. Actors are amazing, Jennifer is so cute, and Patrick is magnificent, as always. They did very good job. It impacted so many lives, and every person in my family, from my grandpa to my nine year old sister, have watched it, so we call it our family movie. Music is so good too, I got soundtrack album just after I watched movie, because I've fallen in love with it. Long story short it's must watch!",Dirty Dancing

Some people categorize it as a chick flick, or a coming of age movie, but it's really a great movie! It's not as cheesy as some of the other movies in the above categories. It really is a timeless movie, that will continue to be enjoyed by people of all ages.",Dirty Dancing
239,idolhands-1,Just OK,6,1 April 2014,"Dirty Dancing is a movie that I literally did not watch until yesterday, many many years after I was born and many many years after it was first released.I always promised myself that I would never sit down and watch it because I knew what people said about it and the ""best parts"" to me all sounded pretty stupid, like the famous dance scene and ""nobody puts baby in the corner""...But it turned out to be OK. The music is pretty stupid now but I have to admit as a child of the eighties who heard the soundtrack on the radios and when friends played it on -- GASP -- cassette tapes at each other's houses and at school, so of them were good songs. At least songs you can listen to without puking.Patrick Swayze looks so young in this and he's really good in his part, and so is Jennifer Gray. Not sure why she got surgery to change her nose, she looks great in this and Ferris Bueller. A very pretty girl who is good in this and could also do comedy.Have to say though the whole age difference thing is pretty creepy, what is she in this like 16? And he's in his thirties? Ewwwwwww! Why, Patrick Swayze, why?!?!?!",Dirty Dancing

I have lost count of how many times i have watched this movie :) My dad threw it out when i was younger because he said i watched it too much! Patrick swayze wrote and sang some of the songs in this movie brilliantly. I have to say that i love the soundtrack as well. The time of my life track is my fave and i love it. My favourite part of this movie is when they are practising in the ocean. The cringiest and well known bit is where she announces she carries a water melon! :)Patrick swayze is awesome as Jhonny in this movie, he plays the character well and the chemistry between him and Jennifer grey is believable. I can watch this movie over and over again because it is great. I actually like her real name and the end when they all start ""dirty dancing"" is great!",Dirty Dancing
241,rubears,A very vivid love story and captivating music,10,27 March 2004,"I am obsessed with this video.  I had never seen Patrick Swayze act, and then when I found out he dances, I really like Dirty Dancing.  I have always been interested in learning to dance and never did so.  I really am captivated by the music.  Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze really have good chemistry between them and everytime I watch the video, I cry.  It is a very beautiful love story and it touches my heart.  I have seen Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights, but I am still obsessed with Dirty Dancing.  I watch it every chance I get.  I like to think Johnny came back to get Baby and to work out a relationship with her, and to find out if it was really love they had.",Dirty Dancing

I never get tired of it even though I can recite most of the dialog. I'm not sure why but this movie gets to me every time. I saw the play a few years ago in Cleveland too. I have two copies of the movie on DVD. The story isn't that great, the acting is not the best, the music is good but I cannot put my finger on why it's my all time favorite movie. The one I've watched more times than I'd like to admit. Some people don't get it but I do. It's just a great movie and I will continue watching it periodically. Sorry, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!",Dirty Dancing
243,ebyrne288,Learn to dance and have the time of your life!,10,26 April 2005,"When young Frances 'Baby' Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun! One night, after wandering away from a resort activity, she stumbles upon a all night dance party with Johnny Castle and other fellow dancers. Quickly enthralled by the raunchy dance moves, 'Baby' is eager to learn when she has to fill in for Penny just so she and Johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort. But young 'Baby' soon finds herself in a sticky situation; she has fallen in love with a man she knows her father will never approve of. However, when Johnny is accused of stealing wallets, it is up to 'Baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken. Johnny is fired anyway for getting involved with a visitor, but quickly realises what a mistake it was leaving 'Baby'. He comes back with that famous line 'No one puts Baby in a corner' and they show the resort exactly what they're made of.An amazing film, perfect for a girly night in. With groovy tunes, inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside, this has got to be the greatest film of all time! **********",Dirty Dancing
244,jenhowell77,Watch it again - one of the best-written movies there is,10,16 July 2014,"In a just, non-patriarchal society, this movie would have at least an 8 out of 10. All I can figure is that a bunch of guys who don't like ""chick flicks"" came through and downvoted this film without even watching it, or perhaps after half-watching it while trying to hook up with a girl. Because, quite frankly, this movie is just objectively great.It's perfectly written, directed and edited. There isn't one scene in this entire movie that doesn't belong, not one moment. The whole thing, from start to finish, is nearly a textbook example of how to write a good movie, without ever feeling formulaic or rushed. This movie has heart, and it was written by a woman who actually had a personal connection to the story. This movie wasn't written or made as a star vehicle or to become a big blockbuster. Its success, indeed, was entirely unexpected. It succeeded because of its quality, not because Patrick Swayze is hot - although he is very hot in this movie, despite never really doing anything for me in any of his other films. That's down to the quality of the writing and characterization. His other films never gave him as much to work with.Anyway, if you've never seen this movie, see it. ESPECIALLY if you are a woman or girl, but if you're a man, also see it. It's not a ""chick flick"" - a term which implies a movie churned out in a shallow attempt to make money off of a demographic. It's a good film made for humans. Humans who love, humans who feel, humans with complex family dynamics, humans who dance. Don't put this movie in a corner!",Dirty Dancing
245,greenridersharysa,I LOVE this movie!,10,19 August 2005,"Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies. I've only watched it two times on ABC because I haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea Jennifer Grey was 27 at the time she made the movie, because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood she has a very flat chest, which is why I was fooled so easily about her age. So both physically and emotionally, Grey pulls off playing a teen very well. I also loved the dancing--who WOULDN'T? Both times I've watched Dirty Dancing, I keep wanting to look up dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I do recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I would LOVE to be able to watch this in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year. And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. That's one of the best moments in the film.I can't believe I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title?",Dirty Dancing
246,mdudeza80,a classic,10,24 March 2006,"I am surprised this has a relatively low vote... i absolutely love this movie, it is a classic and the music is fabulous. This movie is so sexy, but there are no actual sex scenes which is something i really like... the power of suggestion is so much sexier then documentary-style visuals!!Patrick Swayze is so sexy and sincere in this movie, this and Ghost are his absolute best and are both classics for me.Jennifer Grey is perfectly cast and I think she is beautiful. Such a pity she destroyed her lovely nose with surgery... it just goes to show that smaller is not necessarily better.If you're looking for a real teenage love story that captures the passion, confusion, love and lust of that age, this is the movie. It is also about class distinction in modern America - and pseudo-liberalized values.Add to that amazing and ridiculously sexy dancing and a fantastic soundtrack.Nobody puts Baby in a corner... I carried a watermelon...have the time of your life!",Dirty Dancing

I have to admit, I have probably seen the movie over 100 times... and I do know most of the words and dance numbers by heart!

Patrick Swayze is so sexy in this movie! I wish I was Baby so I could dance with him! Oh, and I looked up Patrick Swayze's age. I can't believe he's 54. That's unreal. I want him to be the same age he was in Dirty Dancing and always look that great! He's really hot!Anyway, I watched it 2 more times in 24 hours. I'm obsessed but what can I say, I love it!

256,sneuberg-1,Bad directing,9,8 April 2011,"Dirty Dancing was an excellent flick. I enjoyed it the first time and every time since. Nonetheless I think it could have been better. The director should have noticed that every time Jennifer Grey was given a long line sincerity went down the toilet. She'd huff and puff and it came out badly. Otherwise she played her role well.For example, when she finally told Johnny that she had feelings for him. That was an ugly line for her and she was huffing and puffing. The line was too long for her. A good director would have broken it up for her. Something like: Johnny: ""You fear nothing"" Baby turns her face from him, and with tears dripping down her face says, ""You have no idea what I've done and what I fear."" Johnny: ""But you are so good."" Baby: ""I'm not so good. I love Penny now, but I'm corrupt."" Johnny: ""How so?"" Baby: ""I did everything just to get close to you. I loved you since the first dance. Now my fear is that you don't feel anything for me."" .I do not claim these would be the best lines, but I will assert that Jennifer Grey could have had better lines.",Dirty Dancing

I was pretty young when I saw it the first time, 7 years. And Oh Boy! (I think that because I was so young it had some kind of extra extra influence on me) I could'nt stop talking about it. I would sit in my window with my radio on the top volume and just sit there and enjoy the late Swedish summer sun of 94 and my wonderful music. Orh, I loved it so much!If there's anything that I really remember from my childhood is the love for this movie. It has unconsciously had a very positive influence on me ever since, Yes, It made me much more interested in life (Honestly). And it made me much much much more positive! Since then.. I've practically sung every day, maby not 'Be my baby' or 'The time of my life' but it made me fall in love with music and the magic of both life and love. I will always love it, always!!",Dirty Dancing
260,British_Aussie_chick,Absolutely Amazing!!,10,13 May 2005,"I first heard of this film from a friend. She loved it and always watched it. When she told me about it and said how old it was, I immediately decided that I wouldn't like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing film! I love the music and the dancing. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were brilliant in it. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both such good dancers. After watching the film I wished I could dance like them and I'm hopefully going to take up ballroom and Latin dancing soon. I've become a fan of that sort of dancing and am now hooked on all films and programs about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. My favorite parts of the film are when Baby goes into the Staff's headquarters and sees them dancing and obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I believe that everyone must watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, it's their loss!!",Dirty Dancing

This wonderful movie opens me up to joy of the time and the love and happiness that can be developed from dancing. The love story between these two gives me chills even after my hundreds of times watching it. ""Nobody puts baby in a corner"" will forever be my favorite movie line. I love the emphasis placed on their love without there being too much drama. This love story is filled with passion, romance and strength. I wish there was a sequel! The love that Baby had for Johnny is no longer seen in recent movies. Current love movies only contain love that makes a girl lust over a man.

263,jim-344,Well done evocation of 1960s Catskill Kitsch and the Class Gap,8,30 August 2009,"I guess being old enough to remember the Catskills at their peak and the culture helps me write more favorably about the film. I think it captures the schlocky nature of much of the entertainment. I am talking about some of the lesser acts---of course there were some name entertainers at the top of the bill, but the fillers were on a par with the amateur talent show. My impressions of the Catskill ""borscht belt"" was from the 1950s, and this film represents the early 1960s, when as Max, the proprietor says, ""It all seems to be slipping away"". I didn't get a sense of the degree class snobbery (shown in the film) in the 1950s, but perhaps by the 1960s this factor was important. I worked as a waiter for a New Jersey hotel that was a sort of ""Catskills South"" and there was some condescension between wealthy guests and working stiff employees. The guests could be petty and demanding, and we were expected to cater to their every whim for low pay and no benefits.",Dirty Dancing

You can just listen to it anytime and it'll make you smile. The songs just want to make you get up and starting dancing around. I'm listening to ""(I've Had) The Time Of My Life"" and I'm seeing the whole dance scene again.  ""Dirty Dancing"" has the greatest dance moves and the best actors and actresses.  I wish I could learn those dance moves.  My eyes are glued to the TV whenever I watch this because it's very appealing and interesting.  Get out there and watch this movie!

You have to have veins of ice if the cabana/dance/love scene between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray doesn't make your heart race a little. The only other movie I can think of right now with a scene that can move me as much is maybe the elevator kiss scene in Drive. Both just beautifully filmed, staged, choreographed, put to music and delivered.And yes, while this movie is somewhat 'cheesy' in places, there is no denying that is played a huge part in American cinema. The Penny story line, the young love, the family situation, all hot topics the year this was filmed.Lastly, the soundtrack is amazing. Not ONE of these songs feels out of place or superfluous.

The movie was amazing and now almost 20 years later I still make sure to have a Dirty Dancing Night once a week. The music fit the tone of the arrangement. I loved the Scene where Johnny says, I'll never be sorry. That is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. The ending dance was probably one of my favorite parts. My only wish is that a movie was brought out to tell you what happened to Johnny and Baby. If anyone that wrote Dirty Dancing reads this. Please come out with something new..

It wasn't. It was a great family love story that I related to. My favorite part was when Johnny and Baby were playing around to the music of Mickey and Sylvia's ""Love is Strange"" which was one of the songs I loved when I was a teenager. But I think I loved all the movie, especially when I went out to buy the DVD which had a lot of background info on it. The cast was perfect. The song at the end by the camp staff reminded me of the summer camps I had been to. The music I didn't originally like that much, but it has grown on me and I think it was perfect for the film.

272,a-eustace,The best girlie movie ever!!,10,31 August 2006,"I was only a baby when this film was released but I remember having watched it since about the age of 9 and absolutely loving it! There are the obvious likability factors...gorgeous male lead,fantastically cheesy ending and amazing soundtrack, but the film should also be appreciated on a deeper level. It is not a traditional chick flick, where there is not a lot to focus on other than the love story...there is definitely more to it. There's the conflict of class between the dancers and the waiters. The issue of abortion and the pain and anxiety it can cause. The film also follows a good and well respected mans realisation that he had misjudged people based on their profession and class and that he was wrong. 'When i'm wrong i say i'm wrong.' He deems Johnny the bad guy and Robbie the good,when in fact this couldn't be further from the truth. With all of these other subplots going on it would be unfair to deem Dirty Dancing as simply a light hearted chick flick. It is undeniably a girlie movie (and a fantastic one at that), but the other issues that it portrays ensures that the film can be taken much more seriously and watched again and again. They give the film much more substance,which means that men can enjoy it without feeling too embarrassed!! In conclusion, Dirty Dancing is my favourite film and I hope these comments can help you see why!",Dirty Dancing

As soon as I heard the title I knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when I saw it believe me I wasn't disappointed!This film had everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues, (that were at the time, 1960's) , such as abortion.The dancing in this film was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too!Although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. It really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the: ""Where are they now?"" period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!",Dirty Dancing

277,benhur21,Very Over-Rated,3,7 September 2002,"This is not a good film by an standards.  It is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par (some performances are well below par, but Swayze and Grey do a very good job with little to work with).What was good:The dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, Swayze and Grey were high points.What was bad:The script.  The ""bad"" guys were simply too evil to be believable.  The best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil.  These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOTHING that would leave me to believe they could be real people (perhaps there are guys like them, but I sure don't want to see a movie about it).Another scene, the first where Grey and Swayze meet when the employees at the resort are ""dancing"".  Swayze and Grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves.  The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile towards her.  Why? What happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered the line ""Nobody puts baby in the corner"".  How did he EVER do that with a straight face.)Another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960's.  Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's!  Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?The music (original music for the film) was laughable (with the exception of ""I Had the Time of My Life"" which was a good song).Not the worst film I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY the most over-rated",Dirty Dancing

I saw this film in 1987 when it was released and was completely blown away and like Baby I fell in love with Johnny and Patrick Swayze. It has such classic lines as ""I carried a watermelon"" and ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner"" and too many others to mention. I loved the story, the characters, the setting, the dancing, and well  the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.",Dirty Dancing

280,superstar418,Some kind of wonderful,10,24 December 2004,"I don't really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I've watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I'm watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece",Dirty Dancing
281,justinr7,A very exceptional movie!,10,2 April 2010,"It's about breaking away from expectations and boundaries. It's about growing up and figuring out who you want to be. It's about the time in our lives that we've all experienced in which everything changes, and personalities and emotions clash, and the puzzle pieces finally begin to fit together! It's about taking chances and falling in love. It's about our last free summer after we graduate high school. The time when we begin to enter the real world and venture off into the next huge part in our lives.In my opinion, it's a wonderful movie. Very nice set design, excellent casting and choreography, great music, and very interesting cinematography.

Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From ""Love Man"" to ""Cry To Me"" to ""The Time of My Life"", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood.Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.",Dirty Dancing
283,sad_eyed_girl1705,Nobody puts Baby in a corner!!!,10,17 March 2009,"After the decline of ballrooms as a popular night out, partner dance enjoyed a revival with the rise of mambo and various forms of salsa in the US. The Eighties also saw an upsurge of partner dance in Britain with the development of modern jive, a simple dance that anyone could learn. Tapping into this enthusiasm comes Dirty Dancing (1987), a well-constructed if cheesy love story that has partner dance at its core. Fronted by the charismatic Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it also contains a note of rebelliousness that appeals to its teenage target audience.The opening credits (in luminous pink) set the tone with sepia shots of sexy dance routines, slowed down to emphasise sensuousness. The Sixties Ronettes song, Be My Baby, hearkens back to an era before the Beatles, before the death of Kennedy.Baby - the insultingly diminutive name for the heroine (Grey) - is a young girl ahead of her time. She can't wait to join the Peace Corps. But for now, she is being whisked off to summer camp with her protective parents and her superficial sister, Lisa. ""Baby's going to change the world,"" quips her father, whereas Lisa's going to decorate it...At the camp, glamorous female dance teacher Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has the job of making staid dances, like line dancing, look appealing to the masses. Baby, however, chances upon the staff's private party, where a much raunchier dance is practiced. Johnny Castle (Swayze) is a downtrodden instructor from the streets. In contrast to the Harvard and Yale educated (and outwardly respectable) youngsters, he is labelled with an unfairly bad reputation and with strict instructions not to flirt with guests. As Castle and Baby follow their hearts, each striving towards a moral high ground forsaken by society, they are drawn inevitably together.Why such a formulaic and much copied movie has held such fascination is sometimes a mystery. Its strengths are the tightness of its construction and the first rate dancing abilities of its stars. With the gradual demise of studio based song-and-dance films, associated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, came a shortage of stars who could both dance well and act. Swayze not only had considerable acting experience, but was born into a dance family and trained with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School. As is evident from the companion (dance instruction) video, Swayze Dancing, he toned down his abilities as a dancer to play Castle, but still looks riveting.Mambo, which can be performed in a very erotic and sensual manner, is sometimes called ""diabolo"" - the devil's dance. Unlike many dance/romance movies that followed, this one features many actual dance sequences, augmented by a spontaneous style of acting, but with the dancing obviously performed for real, rather than produced as a result of extensive fast editing cuts, as was the case, for instance, in films like Chicago (2002).The dirty dancing in the film is ultimately a mix of styles, principally mambo and showcase, which provided momentum for many of the popular dance schools of the time and in the years that followed. The film is part of the wave of Eighties indie films that convinced the big studios to diversify and join forces with independents to capture teen audiences. Its sexiness combines with a James Dean style defiance, appealing to male fantasies.While Dirty Dancing lacks greatness, its enduring qualities are too easily overlooked. If nothing else, it provided a template for dozens of lacklustre movies that followed its song and storyline formula without emulating its strengths.Written by Alexandra D.",Dirty Dancing

Sometimes you simply have to watch a movie and ENJOY it without having suspenseful and dramatic twists. This is a very straight forward girl meets boy and ""rescues"" him from his jaded existence. The music is good, the chemistry is very good and if you just want to watch a movie that is fun to watch, select this one. It is unfortunate that Jennifer Grey went on to have plastic surgery on her face (and nose), she is virtually unrecognizable now. She has turned into a Hollywood clone. We have probably seen her in other films but is so different that we do not recognize her.",Dirty Dancing

I loved everything about this and not because im a girl and im supposed to but because the films has aged so well thanks to the strength of the central performances. I also really loved the way the dancing really brought the characters together in a strong yet vibrant way. it seems crazy to me that the film is as old as it is as it feels so un dated. Once again i really enjoyed the film and will be looking out for more films with these two in as they both gave a really great performance! Overall i would give the film an eight out of ten as some of the dialogue is fairly clunky but pretty good score!,Dirty Dancing

Patrick Swayze is by far the most gorgeous actor and Jennifer Grey could not compliment him better. The most romantic line has to be when Johnny says, ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner."" Every time I see the movie I cry as Johnny leaves down the dirt road and comes back for the sake of true love. This movie gave me hope that anything is possible. Baby turns a rugged dance instructor into, ""the kind of person he wants to be."" This movie inspired me to be a better person and stand up for other people no matter what it costs.

291,jeff_the_HOUR,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE (few spoilers),1,12 August 2004,"This is one of those movies that I will never understand how anyone with half an amount of common sense would ever like. I was once convinced to watch this movie with a certain girlfriend who was thoroughly upset and unable to understand how I could say it was AWFUL. And yes. I am ashamed enough to admit that I really have seen it.Painfully. ALL of it. The ""love"" story itself is straight cheesy and pathetic, but however, one can come to expect this in the case when a movie like this is made to fit in a specific genre like ""chick flicks"". So I can cope with that. I myself am a sucker for good (emphasis on GOOD) romantic movies. But this. This specimen clearly trashes all conception of what a love story SHOULD be.1. Patrick Swayze as a macho stud/tough guy does not work.2. Patrick Swayze as a macho stud/tough guy who dances competitively does not work.3. The dialog in this movie is terrible. I need only point out the part in which Baby asks Johnny if he has ""had many women"". Ladies. If you feel the need to ask a question such as this you already know the answer regardless of what is said in response. 4. The part that REALLY gets me. The above scene in which Baby hops in bed with Johnny IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS another scene in which Baby has witnessed another character that is her female friend having gone through (what is assumed to be) an abortion(or painful complications). You get my point. It defies and basically destroys any sort of good character that this film tries to present.Now I understand this movie is a product of the late 80's. So I will accept that as responsibility for SOME of it's major flaws. But realistically, the only good thing I can say about it is the job that was done compiling the soundtrack. Go buy it. It is honestly outstanding. But this remains the sole gem among a large heaping of disgusting trash that everyone just seems to keep digging into and claiming it's really good stuff.For the sake of sparing yourself a waste of 100 mins that could be used doing otherwise useful (and enjoyable) things, I advise you to avoid this movie at all costs. It is certainly not what others crack it up to be, regardless of what they tell you. And in case you do end up seeing it...just know you were warned.",Dirty Dancing

I've watched this movie multiple times and very time it captivates me! The movie stars Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze and was first released in August 1987. It's placed at a summer resort, where the entertainment staff is considered the lower class. Baby, the vacationer at the time, is intrigued by the entertainment and seems to fit in better with the lower class personalities. Her open-heart personality gets her more involved in their life than in her family's, yet she still respects them greatly. Her vacation at Kellerman's takes on a whole new meaning for her than she expected. This movie keeps your attention in full. The dancing keeps you're eyes locked on the screen.

Baby then dumps a pitcher of water over his head and tells him to stay away from her.

I, however, have never been more mesmerized and taken by a movie before or after this one.  Everything is perfectly placed and the subtle details entwined in the major scenes are excellent: I will always consider the car scene after Baby and Johnny's dance at the Sheldrick to be one of the most masterful cinematic scenes in film history.But, alas, all Dirty Dancing fans know that the only reason they watch the movie is for the last scene. Everything building up to it is necessary and, consequently, moving . . . but that scene leaves me breathless and goosebumped to this day.Do not avoid this movie because it is seemingly a superficial teenage romance.

Whatever it was (and is), Dirty Dancing captured my heart and I'm not alone.  Millions of people all over the world loved it.

This is not the case for Baby though. Not taken in with any of the activities provided, she stumbles upon the staff's headquarters one night and finds herself watching people dirty dancing. Taken in this, Baby is envious of those good dancers when the head of the dirty dancers, Johnny Castles,and there is instantly a spark between them. When Penny, Johnny's dance partner, finds out she is pregnant, she is unable to compete in the dance competition. Baby offers to do this, but she has no idea how to dance. She spends many days training with Johnny, and while he is not always too patient with her, the chemistry is definitely there.

326,reallyshortpeoplerule,Gotta Love it,10,25 June 2006,I LOVE this movie. It is a true classic. Sure if you really think about it the whole basis of the movie is illegal but oh well. The acting is great Sawyaze is gorgeous as ever. The story line may get a bit weird at some points but it's all made up in the last scene. How can you not love the sight of all of the resort workers dancing up the isle toward her and then that final lift. And the water scene when they are practicing the lift. It's just a great movie. It has great actors in it to. Though I honestly don't get why Baby is supposed to be the ugly duckling while her sister is supposed to be the pretty one. It is completely the opposite. And if you really don't like to hear bad singing I would skip the scene where the sister is practicing for the talent show. OWW. But you really shouldn't go without seeing this movie so go rent it.,Dirty Dancing
327,charlykitten,I have been watching since I was 5 and am glad i did it is truly brilliant.,10,22 March 2001,I really adore Dirty Dancing i watch it at least 5 times a week and am glad that when I was small I creeped in on my Dad watching it and begged him yo let me see it all the way through.I think it has a marvellous storyline and it has made a great impression on my life. It taught me not to jump to conclusions like Jake does.So i have learnt alot from that film and you feel heartbroken at the end when Johnny leaves. The music is also brilliant I have both CD's 'Dirty Dancing' and 'More Dirty Dancing' it really is brilliant. It should be on T.V more.,Dirty Dancing

To my utter amazment though, I was caught up in the magic of the whole movie. From Baby's first look at ""dirty dancing"" to the incredible ending, this movie captures what everyone wishes their childhood could have been like.The locations they used for the Kellerman's resort were beautiful, and the soundtrack makes everyone want to get up and dance in the aisles.

The music I remember from my teen years are great to hear again!.....the 60's music is nostalgic and in a time when my life was simple and uncomplicated compared to now.

I have never forgotten this film , my family and I got free tickets from KFC so we saw this film a few times but what I have found is a good soundtrack + a great leading cast equals a hit movie. I was only 10 years old when this movie came out but even then I thought Patrick was good looking and wanted to look like him. I just wish I could have been there when this movie happened(time and place). I have always had a fascination with America, I think it's because I grew up with every American programme that has been but oneday I will travel that country and experience that great American hospitality.

Rock and roll was no more so modern. The new dances were cha cha cha, mambo rock, etc. I watched this film at the end of 2005, when I was living with a great love, a girl 21 y.o. So, one can imagine, a man 67 yo, who loves a girl 21y.o. We watched this movie and were emotioned for the mixture of ages, for the differences in behaviours among the different times, but most of all for the love story in it.

I can't recall when I first saw this movie, but I do know that until I purchased it on Video, I watched every time it came on TV. Which, TV does not do the film justice, because it has to edit too many scenes to make time for commercials. Getting the DVD Ultimate Edition was the best thing I did. I recommend everyone who loves this movie, like me, to get it. There is so much more insight into the movie, the characters, the making of the movie etc. I can't count the number of times I have watched the movie with the commentaries of the writer/producer Eleanor Bergstein all the way through; and then Kenny Ortega and the other assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison, and others who are listed in the commentary section. I love watching the music video section of ""She's Like the Wind"", 'I've Had the Time of My Life"" and ""Hungry Eyes"". It is a great way to enter a stress free time. I love this movie and I don't believe it would have been such a success with anyone else than Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Music is terrific, story line is exceptional, all actors are wonderful and believable. For such a limited budget, it outshines many high cost popular movies of today. It is a classic and I'll never get tired of watching it. I pop in ""Dirty Dancing"" whenever I just want to shut the world out and go back to the 'Summer of '63'. It is a better substitute for antidepressants.",Dirty Dancing

He thinks Johnny got Penny pregnant and hired a quack to look in on her (not knowingly), but it was Robbie who got her pregnant. Baby has to earn her father's trust back. Her dad forbids her to spend anymore time with ""those people"" and she goes behind his back. Johnny ends up getting the girl and says those famous words, ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner."" I loved the movie because you could feel the passion deepening between Johnny and Baby.

But what I never imagined was that my young kid would be one day sitting at the table, having breakfast and singing ""I've had the time of my life, and I never felt like this before..."". He's only 8, for God's sake! The performances are great, the dancing is amazing, the directing swelling and the musics just unforgettable. I must admit this is not a hell of picture, but I'll be damned if this is not a good show to look at and just enjoy for two hours. I guarantee that when the credits appear you'll be asking someone to shut the lights off and dance with the love of your life. Like any good movie, but not great, there's a sequel to ruin the business. So don't make any mistakes.

351,amhuss,Dirty Dancing (1987),8,29 September 2008,"The summer of 1963 at Kellerman's summer resort changed Baby Houseman's (Jennifer Grey) life forever. The Houseman family traveled to New York for a family vacation, and came home with a well-matured daughter and a closer relationship as a family. Dirty Dancing opens with the family driving through the mountains to their vacation destination. Upon arriving at the resort, the owner, Jack Weston, tries to put his matchmaking skills into practice and attempts to set up Baby, an ambitious, daddy's little girl who wants to join the Peace Corps, with his selfish, cocky grandson. Fortunately, Baby sees right past Mr. Weston's plan and discovers how much of a spoiled brat his grandson really is. Plus, she has her eyes on someone else and that is Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the best-looking and top dancer at the entire resort.In search of adventure and a fun vacation, Baby discovers one night in the staff's dormitories a whole different world in contrast to that of the structured, resort atmosphere. Rock'n'roll music is blaring from the stereo and the entire staff is inside dancing in a way Baby had never seen before. This is the first night Johnny saw her. Initially, he does not care about her in the least, but he soon starts falling for her when Baby fills in for Johnny's dance partner, Penny, after she becomes pregnant and cannot dance. Complications from Penny's abortion cause Baby to ask her medical doctor dad to help Penny and he assumes it was Johnny's baby. Her dad forbids Baby from seeing Johnny, but do teenage girls listen to their parents? That answer is a clear ""No."" Baby continues seeing him, learning how to dance and falling more and more in love with him. Inevitably, turmoil occurs on several fronts. For the much anticipated last dance of the season, Johnny chooses Baby to be his partner. After all, as Johnny so aptly puts it, ""No one puts Baby in a corner."" There are many cinematic, theatrical, and literary elements that enhance this movie. The director does a good job of casting Johnny as a ""god-like"" figure to Baby by using low angles when the camera is on him. This is especially noticeable at the beginning of the movie when Baby sees him as a powerful, strong, and untouchable being. In addition, Baby is cast in some high angles at the beginning of the movie, where she is portrayed to be an innocent, powerless daddy's girl. By the end of the movie, she breaks out of this role. In the dancing scenes, there are many close-up and medium shots that portray the emotion of the dancers about what they are doing and how they feel about each other. The set, at Kellerman's summer resort, is a perfect place. It is out away from the busy cities and allows the characters to interact with each other. The two main settings  the dance floor and the rest of the resort  allow the audience to see Baby's struggle of discovering herself. The dance floor can be a symbol of what Baby becomes at the end of the movie, a strong-willed, free-spirited young lady, while the rest of the resort can be the symbol of the life that Baby is leaving behind. The resort represents Baby's innocence and her sheltered life.The summer of 1963 changed Baby's life forever. She became a mature young lady in the setting of her former innocent, sheltered world. Dirty Dancing portrays the trials and tribulations that every girl faces while growing up and becoming her own person. Although this movie is predictable in its conclusion, I personally love watching it whenever possible. I highly suggest it for any young girl dreaming of what she will become as she grows up.",Dirty Dancing

353,weissgang,Female Sexual Desire - On Screen!,8,6 December 2002,"Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and actual sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change. I also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality.  Of course, it is sappy at moments - it is, after all,  a movie musical - but all in all it is a real pleasure - a fun romance and also politically enlightened.  This movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines: ""I carried the watermelon.""",Dirty Dancing
354,connie-bowling,Compare Dirty Dancing with Girls Just Want to Have Fun,7,18 June 2009,"I have always loved the movie Dirty Dancing but just recently I saw the movie Girls Just Want to Have Fun and I see a lot of similarities. I looked up the release dates on IMDb and it turns out that Girls Just Want to Have Fun came out in 1985 while Dirty Dancing didn't come out till 1987. Does anyone else see the similarities? Both movies have: young people dancing, the main couple have to over come their problems and learning to get a long, the father of the main female character is overbearing and doesn't like what she is doing until the final dance, practicing the overhead lift, winning the hearts of everyone, the girls are stepping out, taking chances, and breaking the rules.

355,kamihaly,how can the soundtrack make an average film to be good,8,28 September 2003,"For this film I would give a 6 for the story and directing, because it has a lot of holes in the story and main role (Baby) was badly casted. But I give a 10+ for the music, because every time I watch the movie it gives me the chill. It has a great power to put you in that time and create the atmosphere. Although it is not an artistic film, it is a good film and I think the shallowness of the story and the characters is understandable and fits better in ""the whole picture"" than a more serious and deep would. So it is an 8, and I recommend it because it is an epic film in his genre.",Dirty Dancing

I was mesmerised then as i am still today of DD. The well known fact that Jennifer Grey & Patrick Swazey didn't get along behind the scenes shows you what magnificent acting was portrayed. The sexual chemistry between these 2 characters was binding! I can still watch DD today and feel the same energy as there was in 1987. 17 years ago Eleanor Bergstein brought her beautifully written story to be directed by Emile Ardolino who unfortunately pass away 20 November 2003. Their vision unsurpasses any Dancing Film that has come since. The year was 1963, it was a time where all 'Baby' had in mind was that she wanted to join the 'Peace Core' and her father was the most important man in her life. The first time she sets her eyes on the rebellious dancer 'Johnny', was a moment to change her life forever. A timeless classic, Dirty Dancing will always be a coming of age movie for myself. Dirty Dancing is a film that will not be forgotten, and no other dancing film that has followed, and will follow (in my eyes) can match the intensity that it portrays. 10/10 in my eyes, because I had the 'time of my life'.",Dirty Dancing

It is a story of its time. Top Gun may have been more intense, from the male view, but both films connect to the soul in the same way. Jennifer Grey and Meg Ryan, as women, make profound connections in the two films. It matters not that they are so different. Different is what makes the connections so comfortable. It is a complete pleasure viewing Dirty Dancer and looking forward to watching Top Gun. Beautiful stories, beautiful women, set around the most beautiful photography ever. All that said, it doesn't even break my top 50. Mike",Dirty Dancing
362,loveslife2004,The Best,10,29 July 2003,"Over the years i have watched Dirty Dancing so many times that i know the words off by heart. I get great pleasure from watching this film over and over again, but when Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights first came out i was disgusted to see that they were trying to replace the original with the second. This film does no justice at all to the original and i will not be taking time out to watch it again. Dirty Dancing to me will always remain the best well over any other film that i have seen. plus patrick swayze is mighty fine!!",Dirty Dancing

Definitely one of my top-10 movies",Dirty Dancing
368,lilsunshine68,Wonderful (:,10,6 February 2012,"This movie is your classical, summer romance movie.I am not a person who is very fond of romance movies because, of the ""happy ever after""endings. The story takes place during the summer in a resort where Baby and Johny meet, and fall in love. This movie is actually nice, and delightful. Personally for myself, I absolutely fell in love with Patrick Swayze. He had an incredible dancing talent, and many people from my generation absolutely love this movie no matter how old it is. But, enough said, It is a must watch for all you Hopeless Romantics. I'm not sure if it will make you cry but what I do know is that, it is available on Netflix. (:",Dirty Dancing
369,jmarano1,"The dancing makes this movie the fabulous classic that it is. I could watch a million times, and still be in love with it",10,19 November 2012,"It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqué than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages.The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like ""Did people really dance like that?"" and ""Could I learn how?"" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of ""boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love"" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance.As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other.I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think.Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, cliché classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.",Dirty Dancing
370,charest58,guilty pleasure,10,3 August 2004,"I first saw this movie with my fiancée many years after it came out. I thought I would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great. We've spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie (""Sylvia?!Yes Mickey?"" or ""I'm sorry you had to see that Baby. Sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to.""). My financee cracks up every time I imitate Neil. Also the music is classic and fun to sing along with, especially on road trips. Of course I don't admit any of this to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I seriously watch Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time. Jennifer Grey is also so cute in this movie. Its too bad her career never really took off.",Dirty Dancing
371,serendipity152,I enjoyed it ...,8,29 August 2004,"I've seen a number of the ""80s dance movies"" (Flashdance, Dirty Dancing, Footloose, Fame), and I have to say I enjoyed Dirty Dancing most. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was cute, funny and romantic. And the dancing and soundtrack were amazing.Jennifer Grey did a great job as the shy-turned-rebel Baby, Patrick Swayze also made the movie enjoyable with his performance as Johnny, and I especially liked Cynthia Rhodes as Penny. She added a serious level to the movie, and did it well.If you can overlook the obvious flaws (in my opinion, extreme cheesiness) that most 80s movies, especially the dance ones, have, you'll enjoy Dirty Dancing. I really did.Now Havana Nights, that another story.",Dirty Dancing

It was great and Patrick Swayze is so fine. And this new movie is not half as good as the first. The story line is not even the same. But, I must also give them props for having Patrick in this one as well.You people who are raging on the first movie are retards don't you know that sequels are NEVER EVER as good as the original.You people must have a few screws loose up in your heads.

I just wonder what happened to the gal's that played in this movie, seems like they all went away. What a shame. If you enjoy music that beings back memories of the 50's and 60's you will love the music in this movie. Seem like this movie just warms your heart for so many reasons. Take the time to watch it, you will see why it has become timeless. I had heard that this movie was a low budget movie but it does not seem like they cut corners. The resort where this was filmed brings back the days when families spent vacations together. Just a simpler time.",Dirty Dancing
374,crumbylittlebirdy,Who thought it was cute when...,10,7 January 2006,"Did anyone think it was cute when Johnny came into the hall on the last night and saw Baby sitting with her parents, and walked up to them, murmuring ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"" before whisking her away? I thought that was adorable! I also found it cute that her dad tried to go after him, but the mother pulled him back. Personally, I thought that was one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen, and the fact that Baby's father actually goes up to Johnny and say's ""when I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong"" and then tells his daughter how wonderful she looked on stage was a great thing to see. You don't get endings like that anymore for some reason. In my opinion, Dirty Dancing is one of the best musicals of all time, better than Saturday Night fever, and high up there with Grease.",Dirty Dancing
375,white_angel68,Excellent,10,10 November 2004,I only saw the movie last weekend & I totally fell in love with it! (SPOILER)I think that the way Baby & Johnnie look into each others eyes it's just... you can just tell that they are in love. I also love the dancing in it! I love dancing & singing & stuff like that how they use their hips to keep balance is absolutely amazing!!! I think the acting is quite good but not great but I think that the movie itself is tops! I cant wait until I buy it because it's such a good movie that if you haven't seen it run out to the video store now & hire it! Because thats what I did. Although there are a few close-minded people that I know that wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face. (Oops sorry I think I just broke one of the guidelines).

I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friends house when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and got hooked!! I saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after, I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage, I have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it. ''I carried a watermelon?!'' It's gotten so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone!! Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I don't care what they think of it, I know it's brill! I was reading the comments earlier and I have a few questions for you lot - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions like what ages Lisa and Baby are? I don't think it matters that much. They are teenagers in the 60's, isn't that enough? 2. Where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about? It sounds VERY interesting... Please reply to this. I'd like to see other fans opinions...

I remember my parents wouldn't allow me to watch it, but me and my sister would watch it anyways. I remember waiting every year for Channel 11 or the WB to play Dirty Dancing in their Sunday afternoon movies, right before spring started. I fell in love with it, and then dancing. I didn't stick with the dancing sorry to say. I did buy the DVD, and i can say it was good investment. I hope everyone sees this movie its a true romance, maybe a little to girlie fro many men but is a classic in my eyes. By the way i love Patrick Schwayze and if he wasn't 50 something, I would definitely try to date him :-). I just loved the whole movie.

It wasn't until years later, maybe even around the time Patrick Swayze was dying of cancer, that I came to appreciate its worth. Since then I have become entirely enamored of Jennifer Grey - I am now absolutely in love with her. When she was on Dancing With The Stars I was rooting for her every week and think she deserved to win the season as much as anybody who has been on the show. I was born in the sixties and grew up in the seventies but this still brings back nostalgic feelings of a simpler time. A better time.

379,dustyshoes2003,Empowers and Inspires,10,2 January 2008,"Movies should awaken and invite viewers to focus attention on what transpires on the screen. Dirty Dancing does this very well. The story plot is easy to relate to for those in their teens and older. The cast seemed perfect for their roles, the music fit the scenes and told the story in sound to compliment the visual effects beautifully. A really good movie is watched over and over again with similar emotions being stirred up again again each time it is viewed; Dirty Dancing is such a movie. Not only did I enjoy watching this film over and over again with wishful thinking and dreaming, I actually made some of my thoughts and dreams develop into reality by dancing more often myself (which is great arobics, by the way). Dirty Dancing inspires a zest for living and empowers one to action. When a film grips you and motivates to make dreams come true, it is an excellent film that did it job of stirring your soul and mind to make fantasy a reality in your life.",Dirty Dancing

Flat story based on even flatter subject-matter. I don't know what is worse, that this film ever got made or that Hollywood continues to find reasons to make films about *dancing*. Let's just pretend that the story was good, the dialog anything other than flat, the direction and photography somehow original...it wouldn't matter. *Dancing* has to be the least-compelling base subject matter for any story or film. But don't worry, if if the whole idea of dancing doesn't make you want to vomit, the flat acting, directing, and dialog will, I assure you.

So I did. Now maybe it was because it was so hyped up for me, or maybe it was because I have no nostalgic connection to it, but I thought it was really overrated. The choreography was good, and it had some funny moments. But for a lot of it I couldn't get past the fact that she was supposed to be 17 and he was supposed to be 24, which is pretty gross to me. Also, I didn't see them together, they didn't seem like they were great for each other. I just think that the movie was really overrated, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great. It was a pretty generic and predictable story. The only thing it had going for it was the dancing, and that was pretty good.

As the movie proceeds, we are sucked into their relationship, and believe every single one of their actions. The soundtrack is amazing, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby & Patrick.The last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line ""Noboby puts Baby in the corner.""

396,miranda_k821,Symbolic Expressions Powerfully Reinforce Characters (contains spoilers),4,12 December 2005,"Movement and color aid in the identification of character's personalities because warm colors and motion represent Frances 'Baby' Houseman's radiant energy and aspiration and because cool colors and stillness represent Lisa Houseman's insignificant, unsuccessful role. In addition, the physical appearance of each sister suits her character well. Contrary to the norm, I viewed the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, before I had ever seen the original film, Dirty Dancing. I am basing this information on two occasions that I watched Dirty Dancing. The first time was on November 15, and the second on November 17, 2005. Both viewings were during the evening, in my home.As Frances 'Baby' Houseman learned various dancing techniques, the upward motion of her body seemed soaring and free because it followed the natural tendency to move upward over a composition. Her movement in this direction indicated a strong sense of aspiration and joy as well as a position of power. During various dance routines, Baby often moved assertively toward the camera, reinforcing her confidence. This closeness also forced the audience to follow Baby on a more personal level throughout the film. The red, orange, yellow, and pink colored dresses that Baby wore were stimulating, attractive, and clearly portrayed her radiant energy. Cool colors, including blue, green, and gray, were worn predominantly by Lisa Houseman. Lisa played a much more subtle role than her sister, Baby. Her movements seemed to be choreographed with much less complexity that was hard to appreciate as opposed to the kinetic richness and beauty of Baby's dances. The relationship between the audience and Lisa was distant and rather impersonal because she often withdrew from the camera. Uncomfortable stillness upheld her role. In addition, the sisters' physical appearances suited their character well. Baby was a blue-eyed-blonde of medium height and had a bubbly personality. Stereotypically, this stood behind her successes in the dancing world, and her flamboyant relationships with the opposite sex. Even though she was beautiful, Lisa's pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes, made her role much less memorable.Symbolic expressions powerfully reinforce each actor's character in the film Dirty Dancing.",Dirty Dancing

Baby takes no interest in the activities held at the resort but then when she offers to help carry some melons to the staff headquarters she finds a dance party on the go. Baby is eager to join in the festivity and even more so when she sees the sexy Johnny Castle (played by Patrick Swayze) who is the dance instructor of the resort. She then joins in the raunchy dancing and gets hooked so returns most nights, without her father knowing. Then her relationship with Johnny starts to develop, even though Johnny has specifically been told to not hold a relationship with any of the guests. Baby then enjoys the rest of her holiday with overwhelming consequences. The genre of the film is a romance/drama and is directed by Emile Ardolino. It's set in the 1960's but was actually made in the 1980's. I think the film would be most enjoyed by women, probably teenagers and above. I don't think men would appreciate the romance in the film (maybe some would) and I think younger children wouldn't be able to understand or relate to it as much as teenagers or older people would. The film is set in the Catskill Mountains and the film has some beautiful scenery. The opening scene focuses on the Houseman family in the car on the way to the resort and the surroundings around them are stunning: great big, fresh looking trees border the road they are driving on. Then comes a shot of the mountain, which looks superior, covered in these trees that seem to be all around. When they arrive at the Kellerman's the camera focuses on the actual resort and the camera shot is moving at the pace that the car would be, showing what the Houseman's see from the car window. Trees just like the rest of the area, surround the resort. It looks like a great place to stay: very high class and makes you think how lucky they are to be there. Many people are already out and about enjoying the activities held; it looks a lively fun place to be. Throughout the film the scenery is always full of fabulous greenery and even when it's raining it still doesn't make you feel dull. It's just like a typical, entertaining, holiday resort that looks like lots of fun. The actors in the film dance excellently all the way through and it contains some great modern jazz music. Including a very well known track ""(I've had) the time of my life"", which won an Oscar, ""Be my Baby"", and a song, which has been released again recently ""Hey Baby"". It almost wants to make me want to learn to dance but always certainly gets me up dancing. One of my favourite dance scenes is when Baby first discovers the art of ""dirty dancing"" and when she first walks into the room the shock on her face is a priceless picture she is truly shocked by what she can see. They're hot, raunchy dancers all in one room, and you can see the steam in the air and it makes me feel I can almost sense how sweaty and steamy the room is. The camera changes from different couples and you can see the great amount of passion between them. As Baby walks through the crowd carrying a melon she looks quite scared of what she's seeing. Then Johnny arrives with his dance partner and put on a fabulous performance in the middle of the floor while Baby watches in curiosity almost dancing herself. Johnny then comes over and asks Baby why she's here, and she replies, ""I carried a watermelon"". I find this line really amusing because how many times is it that the hunk you have a big crush on comes over and asks you a question and you reply with a silly, pathetic answer like that, it made me feel that I knew exactly how she felt. But then he drags her to dance with him and she relaxes and let's herself go, getting really into the dancing. The film deals with many important issues such as abortion, relationships and family. It covers them greatly in a way you can relate to them and understand what they are going through. When Johnny's dance partner ends up getting pregnant by one of the waiters that work at the resort (who is also going out with Baby's sister), you really feel for her and unless you've been in that exact situation couldn't begin to imagine what she's been through. It's such a touching subject to watch. At the start of the film Baby is a quiet teenage girl who wants to go into the Peace Corp and change the world. She doesn't really care that people call her Baby. But then when she meets Johnny and starts to really get into her dancing that's when she changes and becomes more adult: wearing make-up, which her father doesn't approve of, basically taking more care of her appearance. She loves her new passion for dancing and Johnny her dance instructor and has ""the time of her life"" on her break to the Catskill Mountains. Even though the story line is kind of predictable in places I love the whole film and the actors play it really well,adapting to their roles brilliantly. It's a movie I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored and gives out a great message  Have the time of your life.",Dirty Dancing
398,angelgirl21788,A coming-of-age story sure to spark a love....,10,8 October 2005,"One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, Dirty Dancing was a low-budget film with high-budget returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to a love story that all of us wish we could live (at least if you're female), this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.The music, which is what drives the movie, is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer. From classic '60's hits like ""Love Man"" by Otis Redding and ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" by Frankie Valli to pure '80's hits like Eric Carmen's ""Hungry Eyes"" and Frank Zappacosta's ""Overload"", Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more.The dancing in ""Dirty Dancing"" is not to be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills, not just as an actor, but dancer and singer as well. And Jennifer Grey shines as Baby, while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well.All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time, and well worth watching at least once. It's doubtful that the first beats of the Ronette's ""Be My Baby"" in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.",Dirty Dancing
399,rmgirl1,My favorite film,10,14 October 2005,"This is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion. Some say it's cheesy but I think it is truly a beautiful film. The chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze it's like no other I have ever seen, and that is what makes the film so perfect. I always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed, because not just one them did it for me, they both did. If you have never seen this film, when you do you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason, like magic- and the soundtrack LOVE IT. Besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. As you can tell I am in love with this film, and I know you will be too.",Dirty Dancing
400,ally-82,The original (& best) girlie movie,10,14 October 2005,I saw this movie for the first time in many years on Channel Five and it didn't fail to make me shed a few tears of happiness during 'that' last dance. The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey gives you goosebumps. It's such a shame that there are no movies made like this anymore.I know on one level it's a very corny movie and most definitely a chick click...but I have to finally admit to myself that it's one of my favourite films ever.Long live Dirty Dancing.,Dirty Dancing
401,marce_puerta,Great Movie,9,16 November 2005,"I just think it's a wonderful movie.The first time I saw it I was maybe 6 or 7 years old. and I loved it! today, being 22, (and after seeing it hundreds of times) I still do. And believe me, it doesn't has anything to do with Patrick Swayze being on it! I just think you can never get enough of this amazing dance scenes, those beautiful location and the best soundtrack ever. No matter how you are feeling, watching Dirty Dancing it's always a great experience. What I think it's so great about this movie is that you can see it whether in a superficial way ( like a classic love story) or in a deep way, and you will always love it.",Dirty Dancing
402,rinkedeboer,Best dance movie ever!,10,22 September 2019,"There isn't one movie, in this genre, that's better than this one! Don 't mind the 7, it is definitely a 10!",Dirty Dancing
403,roniaussieactress,Dirty Dancing,10,21 January 2006,"this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was 6yrs old with my big sister. it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile, and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie's. it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family. i love it :) when ranking from 1-10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 every time. Itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (Johnny)their relationships within the family, the changes in baby's and Johnny's view of the world during their relationship.DIRTY DANCING WILL FOREVER LIVE ON AS A TIMLESS CLASSIC. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment.",Dirty Dancing
404,tatgirl-2,one of my favorite movies,10,25 February 2006,"I too thought this would be a fluff movie with no substance, but was proved wrong. Many people call it a 'girl' movie, but I think there's several messages hidden in it, not to mention some wonderful dance scenes. The best part of it is that it doesn't come across as a 'message movie', so it can be enjoyed by both people who prefer 'message' movies, and by people who just want entertainment. I think Patrick Swayze plays a wonderful sort of Romeo/bad boy, and Jennifer Grey is great as an upper middle class girl who stands up for what she believes in. Another message brought home by the late Jerry Orbach is not to judge a book by it's cover, to use a tired old cliché. In the end, he has to be proud of his daughter (Grey) for sticking with Johnny (Swayze) when everyone brands him as a thief and an irresponsible womanizer. Both Swayze and Grey do a fantastic job with the dancing, which was rather a surprise to me. It's one of those movies to watch on a rainy afternoon, all by yourself with a box of Kleenex. I seem to find it every time it's on TV, and never tire of watching it.",Dirty Dancing
405,foisy_2003,viva!dirty dancing!,10,30 October 2006,i remember that the first time a saw dirty dancing i was at my fathers house back in 1989.my stepmother was watching it and at first i dint not care for it..but as the movie went on i was cut in it..and to my surprise i actually enjoy it!the music was great the dancing was fabulous !and Patrick Swayze with Gennifer Grey look great together on screen!a classic movie of the 80!it reflect very well on the problem that a 17 year old girl face in the sixties and shows that every problems comes with a solution!and in her case with help from her dad!it made me think a lot about my life and how to deal with my own problem and overcome it!made me feel like a winner!!,Dirty Dancing
