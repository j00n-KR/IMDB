0,TheLittleSongbird,A tangled spider's web,5,13 December 2018,"Love the books and the first Swedish 'The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo' and really liked the follow ups and David Fincher film. Another big attraction was Claire Foy, like her very much as an actress, with her fair share of great performances, and wanted to see how she would fare in a different role. 'The Girl in the Spider's Web' was also part of my seeing as many 2018 films as possible quest.While it was by no means a terrible film, 'The Girl in the Spider's Web' was a disappointment. Not just when comparing it to the Swedish films and the Fincher version, all vastly superior, but also on its own (which is a fairer way to judge for me), the latter even more so. It is not one of the worst films of the year but it's one of the weaker films seen the past month or so at the cinema (saw five films in one and a half weeks at the cinema at the time of seeing this, and of those five 'Widows' was the best with 'Robin Hood' the worst).'The Girl in the Spider's Web' does have good things. Claire Foy attacks Lisbeth with fierce intensity and gusto, no question of her commitment to this role here, and hers a more than admirable interpretation of the character. Really liked the production values, with some jaw-droppingly stunning scenery and stylishly bleak photography. The music has the right amount of rousing intensity.In the early parts of the film, the action is well staged and exciting, one of the better ones being the motorcycle/frozen lake sequence. The prosthetics are very well done, there is particularly one grisly bit that won't be spoilt but that made for one of the more unsettling scenes for any film seen this year. A few supporting performances are decent, Lakeith Stanfield is the most involving while Stephen Merchant makes the most of little and Sylvia Hoeks brings an imperious iciness to a rather underwritten role.However, most of the supporting cast are at best forgettable. One of the biggest disappointments was how much of a spare part with not much personality plot device Mikael was rather than playing a properly crucial role he did in the stories of the other films. Sverrir Gudnason was rather bland in the role. The character development most of the time was barely there, Lisbeth is the only character that was properly explored, the rest were completely soulless generally with the underwritten villains not being as threatening as ought and pretty uninteresting and vague flashbacks.Later on the action does become somewhat too noisy and predictable that they are more tedious than exciting. The dialogue completely lacks tautness and fails to properly intrigue. Alvarez's direction is competent but not exactly inspired. But it's the story that's the biggest issue here, it started off well with a dark tension but that gets lost too early and the steely intensity, psychological depth and glued to the seat creepiness are absent. Any promise is undone in the wildly improbable final act in particular, with some truly nonsensical moments, vague ones (the technological element gets muddled) and reliant on unlikely coincidences. There was an attempt at emotion in the climactic confrontation but it was too forced and tacked on, failing to resonate.Concluding, watchable but a disappointment. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Girl in the Spider's Web
1,Leofwine_draca,Watchable but shallow spin-off,5,29 December 2019,"THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB is the spin-off from the Millennium trilogy, based on a novel written by another author after the death of Steig Larsson. Like the Daniel Craig movie before it, this one has more of an American rather than Scandinavian feel. It was directed by the guy who did the EVIL DEAD remake and it certainly looks nice; the cinematography is fine and the film packs in all of the usual icy vistas that you're used to in this genre. The plot itself is rather simplistic and much more geared towards action and thrills rather than dark character drama. In some respects it feels more like a Bourne movie than anything else. I was indifferent towards Claire Foy as the lead - she's no Noomi Rapace - and the guy playing Blomqvist is far too young, which doesn't help matters much. Otherwise this is watchable but shallow, and not a patch on the quality of the original Swedish trilogy.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
2,SnoopyStyle,turning into Bond,5,16 March 2019,"As a girl, Lisbeth escaped from her psychotic Russian mob father leaving behind her sister Camilla. In the present, Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy) is an avenging angel for abused women. She is hired by Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant) who is desperate to retrieve his computer program from the American NSA which is capable of controlling the world's nukes. NSA agent Ed Needham (LaKeith Stanfield) tracks the theft to Stockholm but thugs had already attacked Lisbeth and stolen the program from her. Her only clue is a security pic of a man with a spider tattoo. She recruits Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason)'s help who hasn't seen her for three years. The spider's web leads back to Lisbeth's father and her sister Camilla Salander (Sylvia Hoeks).It's the second movie in the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo franchise. The story is new from a different novelist. Everybody is new. Lisbeth is new. Mikael is new. The director is new. That's all the more reason why the central relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael needs to be re-established much earlier. They aren't actually in the same room until over an hour into the movie. There is also a change in Lisbeth's crusade where she is normally a vigilante figure for female victims. In this one, she turns into James Bond with global nuclear war as her crusade. There's the NSA and the Russians. It's a Bond movie. It's not the same as the original. The story is not that confusing but it can be more focused. I like the concept of Camilla but like Mikael, she needs to get into the movie sooner. As for Claire Foy playing Lisbeth, she is fine but needs a bit more darkness and her sexuality. It's really like a Bond movie where darkness and sexuality exist but The Dragon Tattoo franchise is supposed to take it to a grimmer level.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
3,Hitchcoc,A Bit of a Mess,6,1 January 2020,"Boy, a lot of people disliked this movie. It suffers from the strength of its predecessors. It also suffers from too much for one film. We don't get enough psychological foundation, for one thing The bad guys have way too much power and this thing they can launch is pretty hard to swallow. Imagine that she and her sister have the future of the world in their hands. Thirdly, it is based on a book, written after the original series (an average book but entertaining). the problem is it ignores major plot elements. I doubt we'll see any more of these films.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
4,boblipton,Stuck On Accents,5,15 July 2020,"My first impression was puzzlement over the fact that all these Swedish characters speaking Swedish in Sweden speak with Swedish accents. I guess they're Swedish accents, even though no one speaks like Garbo or the Swedish Chef, but they don't sound like standard English speakers of any variety. Ah, you say, they're speaking English! Yes, I snap right back, but it's notionally Swedish, because who would expect two people in what is labeled right off the bat ""Stockholm"" who are Swedish to be talking to each other in but Swedish? I've never seen A Doll's House or Hedda Gabbler with anyone speaking in any Scandinavian accent, even though Ibsen set his works at home and all the characters are from there. They never sound like they've just gotten off the boat, or even El Brendel. Usually they're speaking in British Stage accents. And don't blame Hollywood, because the producers and several key actors are Swedish. And the director is Uruguayan.I saw the Swedish version of this about a decade ago. I recall nothing about it, except that it was terrific and, like all Scandinavian cinema, made me glad I wasn't Scandinavian, because I would have to kill myself. However, I'm pretty sure this is not the same story, because somehow Claire Foy as Lisbeth Salander, aka ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"" has become Batman, or perhaps Batwoman, complete with a Tragic Back Story and a sister who is her dark side, like a feminist Alan Dwan movie from the 1950s. She tootles around Sweden on her Batcycle -- I suppose we should call in her Dragoncycle -- or stolen Maserati, hunting down men who are abusive to their wives or assignations, hanging them upside down and draining their bank accounts; everyone knows who is doing this, but no one can find her because Computers.Her paying job, however is calling. An American computer whiz has developed a program to control every nuclear missile in the world. He's decided it's not such a good idea, so he hires Miss Foy to find it and steal it. However, Sauron wants his Ring back.... I mean there's a three-way hunt for it, since the American NSA has sent Lakeith Stanfield to fetch the program -- he doesn't speak with a Swedish accent, but he does use his White voice -- the Swedish government is blaming her for everything, and her Evil Blonde Twin, Sylvia Hoeks, has been hired to fetch it for an unnamed employer, whose identity will surprise you (No, it won't).There are some fine shots in this movie, all of which have been used in the trailer and TV commercials.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
5,Horst_In_Translation,I thought it was okay overall,6,9 December 2018,"""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" is the newest film release based on the character from late author Stieg Larsson's literary work. This one here runs for almost 2 hours and after Rapace and Mara, British actress Claire Foy is in charge now. Boy is she having a year. Won her first Emmy earlier for ""The Crown"" and managed a Golden Globe nod next to Ryan Gosling in ""First Man"", for which she also definitely has a shot at her first Oscar nomination, mostly thanks to the final scene. But now back to this one here. I think she is better-looking than Rapace and it's a close call between her and Mara, but yeah the Lisbeth Salander character is not really about looks anyway. Instead, it is all about grit. This time, it becomes a family affair as very early on we get a glimpse into Lisbeth's childhood, her criminal dad and what became of her sister when she did not manage to leave her family the way Lisbeth did. Early on, there is the obligatory lesbian stuff and some depiction of brutal torture when Salander takes care of a wealthy man, who has not been treating his women too well. It's okay as an introduction for everybody who is not too familiar with the franchise. But yeah, this is really not the core of it all.The major focus, major plot here is about a child prodigy who knows the secret to a powerful weapon and the man/organisation who are behind everybody and trying to follow the kid and everybody else. While Salander tries to protect the boy with her buddies: a hacker, a journalist and also an NSA officer, who seems like an antagonist early on, but quickly joins forces with our anti-heroine. Brief interesting cameo by Vicky Krieps too for me as a German audience member, even if her turn was not even half as spectacular as her performance next to Daniel Day-Lewis in another recent project, but looks like she made it safely to Hollywood now. Director is Fede Alvarez from Uruguay and he is also enjoying a strong breakthrough still as this is his third full feature film I believe. The most known names from the cast to me here apart from Foy were Hoeks, Merchant (did not expect him in here) and Bang, who I enjoyed recently in ""The Square"". Claes Bang as a henchman to Hoeks' character was great fun as well in my opinion, one of the highlights of the film, and he made up for how forgettable the Blomkvist character was this time. Could have made an excellent main antagonist too, but yeah they clearly wanted to go with the sister conflict story line and that was okay. Seeing Hoeks' character at the end in her bright red clothes with the huge contrast to all the white snow was fine, even if I felt the film visually and in terms of cinematography really could have been much better.I don't think it will get close to scoring any Oscar nominations. The reception just wasn't good enough for that and I am also not sure if Foy is a great choice for Lizzie Salander to be honest, even if she tries her best for sure. This franchise for once may not be her thing. It's for good reason probably that right now there don't seem to be any plans for a sequel. Starring Foy or in general. And that's fine. It wasn't a bad watch, but I had issues during some particular scenes like the action scenes or when the villain kills the dad, but is amateurish enough to not take the priceless boy with him. Or how quickly it all gets solved at the end. Or the slightly cringeworthy chess scenes. And I still struggle with this meager girl taking out all the main antagonists to be honest, aside from how she easily hacks into NSA and hardly anybody recognizes, does something against it or seems to care at all when they are only sending one agent there to see what has happened. Oh well, this agent also gets bullied by local investigators, like the older woman who turns out to be linked to the bad guys eventually too, even if her intentions were somewhat noble, but yeah that was another plot twist that felt 100% for the sake of it and not offering any depth or realism whatsoever. A bit of a shame there were more than this one. So it's a close call for me whether to give this movie a positive or negative recommendation, but I think I will be going for the former. It could have been much better, but it's still not too bad I guess. If you like Foy, then go for it. By the way, David Fincher, who directed Rooney Mara years ago as Salander, returned as an executive producer here. Maybe he should have directed too, then it could have been a more positive outcome. Okay film, but not a must-see by any means.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
6,nogodnomasters,The past is a dark hole,8,28 November 2018,"Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy) who has a dragon tattoo, is a vigilante going after rich men who abuse women. She is an expert computer hacker and semi-partners with journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) perhaps the only person in her trust circle. She is hired by the program author to retrieve ""Firefall"" a computer program that can launch all the world's nuclear missiles from the Americans, dismissing the fact they need local codes and keys. The program she steals gets stolen from her.Lisbeth attempts to get the program back from the bad guys who want to do her harm. She is also wanted by the Stockholm police and there is an American NSA chief (Lakeith Stanfield) who wants the program back.The film is filled with action. Lizbeth uses alcohol, super glue, and staples to keep going, but never sews her arm back on in midair. If there is no action on the scene, wait a minute. And then there is the sister/daddy thing.I did have 2 issues. There was a spider web in the opening scene on a chess set while two girls were playing with the set. Doesn't seem likely. Also after an apartment has a major explosion, it still has electricity.Guide: F-word. Brief sex, very brief nudity.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
7,kosmasp,Caught up,6,6 May 2019,"More stories with the Girl that has tattoos. And while the original swedish trilogy had the same actress, the americans replaced the original actress here. Now it may make sense because of the time difference (the US remake with Daniel Craig in it was done quite a lot of years ago), but that is up to you to decide and if it plays any role in you enjoying the movie.So if you can cope with the change in actors, go ahead and enjoy the story. Or also backstory this gives the character. With a lot of technical equipment that does not shield or protect against certain things - one of them being cliches. If you don't mind that, there is an action packed narrative (predictable), that will have you at the edge of your seat. The visual effects are really good, almost flawless. I witnessed some of it in a special they did in the cinema (special event because the guys working on them were from Germany). So from a technical standpoint, this was great ...",The Girl in the Spider's Web
8,classicsoncall,"""There is a client asking for the impossible. Interested?""",7,25 October 2019,"This is a film for anyone who believes that tracking devices are always accurate, a marksman never misses his target, and a protagonist who knows exactly where one would find the 'Up' button on an elevated bridge. Oh, and that same protagonist is able to make remarkable comebacks from taking falls from impossible heights and brushing off foot long, bloody wounds to keep on ticking. The Bourne franchise is full of this kind of stuff too, with the added thrills of exceptional car chases. This movie had one too but it was pretty tame by comparison. I don't mean to be so critical because I did enjoy the film while watching, but there's so much stuff that defies credibility that you have to take it all with a grain of salt. I wasn't too keen on Claire Foy in the role of Lizbeth Salander, but that's probably just me. Sylvia Hoeks had the looks and charisma to be a real nasty villain, which she was, though I tried to picture her and Foy if their roles were reversed and I think I liked that idea better. What really struck me was the sentiment expressed by Camilla near the end of the story castigating Lizbeth for abandoning her at the expense of a brutally abusive father. It made Lizbeth a morally compromised character who couldn't do for her sister what she had been capable of as a vigilante on behalf of other abused women. In effect, Lizbeth failed to save her sister twice, but you could also consider that Camilla might have made the jump with Libby when they were both still young and innocent.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
9,Tweekums,A very different Lisbeth Salander,8,5 October 2020,"This film sees Swedish hacker/vigilante Lisbeth Salander hired by the creator of a computer program that gives access to supposedly secure systems, including those that control nuclear weapons, to steal it back from the American National Security Agency so he can destroy it. The program is designed in a way that means it can't be copied but can be moved. Lisbeth manages to acquire it but before she can hand it over the computer she placed it on is stolen. She must get it back before those who took the program figure out how to access it. To make matters more difficult NSA Agent Ed Needham has flown to Stockholm to retrieve it and local law enforcement are searching for her; believing she stole the program and is involved in an increasing number of deaths.Having enjoyed the original film trilogy I was unsure about this as I knew it wasn't written by the original author. It is indeed very different and I'm sure, for that reason, many viewers will be disappointed. I however found myself enjoying it, just in a different way. The plot feels far more like something that would occur in a 'James Bond' or 'Mission Impossible' film with lots of action and car chases and a hunt for a device that, in the wrong hands, could be a threat to the world. This new Lisbeth Salander is fun to watch if you want a solid action heroine who manages to get out of numerous scrapes. Claire Foy is really impressive in the role. The rest of the cast are solid too. There are some weaknesses; the identity of the person leading the villains is perhaps unnecessarily melodramatic and some of the twists aren't that surprising. Overall though I found this to be a fun action/thriller; well worth watching if you are a fan of the genre but don't expect it to be like the original trilogy.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

11,CinemaSerf,"A half-baked ""Bourne"" in the snow escapade.",6,13 November 2020,"This had such potential - but fails on just about every level. The casting of Claire Foy as super-hacker ""Lisbeth"" seems to owe far more to her box-officeability than to her suitability for the role, and I doubt she will ever consider this one of her crowning performances. The developer of a top secret computer program ""Firefall"" - an equally curiously cast Stephen Merchant (""Balder"") is worried that in the wrong hands, it could wreak global havoc. He engages Foy to steal it back from the Americans, only for her to have it stolen by some nasty guns-for hire. When ""Balder"" thinks he has been betrayed, he informs the authorities and soon the Swedish Security Service join the hunt. It has all the ingredient of a good story; the plot is straight out of ""Mission Impossible""; the snowy settings evoke beauty and bleakness in equal measure and there are plenty of double-crosses to keep us on our toes, but it all takes far too long to progress. The establishment scenes introduce us to some rather underwhelming characters and as we near the end, after all-to-commonly finding her falling from the frying pan into the fire - the obligatory family rivalry rears it's ugly head to make you want to hit the fast forward button. The whole cyber-crime environment is ripe for the picking if only the directors can focus more on the quality of casting and writing, and less on the theoretical peril and doom scenarios that become quite sterile after a while.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Get stuck,7,3 November 2018,"The NSA have a program that can control all nuclear missile launches around the globe. Balder(Merchant, determined), the man who created the program, has decided that it's too much power for any player, regardless of who it is. Of course, stealing it means being hunted down. So he needs a pro. Lisbeth(Foy, not quite up to Rooney Mara's performance but better than Noomi Rapace's excellent one) has been on a real vigilante kick since we last saw her, and agrees to take the job. Blomkvist(Gudnason, making the most of the material which does not do much with the relationship between the two leads, when that has been a strength of both language versions) helps out by doing research. A group of dangerous criminals try to get it from her. Who are they? And what is the real identity of their mysterious leader?As confusing as it is, this is an adaptation of the fourth book, which was picked by the studio in 2015 when it came out, to be adapted before(or even instead of?) novels two and three. It's also a soft reboot. Basically, the continuity does appear to place this after the events of those, despite many Americans not having watched the Swedish originals, since subtitled foreign films are not for everyone. You are told just enough in this that you can go in without knowing them - heck, this can be the first you watch of the whole franchise. You'll be able to follow it fine. This has interesting elements. Chief among them are the personal history between hero and villain, Salander having to take care of a child who, like her, also has a form(but not the same one) of autism, and the memorable action(I do wish that these scenes were not facilitated by the bad guys making stupid, out of character mistakes) and settings. It does feel more like James Bond or Mission Impossible than ""Millennium""(the magazine that this series is named after. I maintain that it should be called ""Men Who Hate Women"", since that theme is more important to these than that publication). It keeps to a fast pace and is admirably restrained in how little the US plays a role in it.There is a moderate amount of violence and strong language, as well as a little sexuality and nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone willing to go along with the shift this takes from the other entries.

I know the titles and I have a faint memory of what occurred in the movies but I don't remember them well enough to just seamlessly pick up with this part in the series without scratching my head at times to wonder who is who and what are the strengths of the protagonist.It wasn't long before I found out that the main character, Lisbeth (Claire Foy), is a super hacker. I'm talking Robotman level or greater even. Her hacking abilities are worthy of a marvel superhero character. She even had on somewhat of a mask at the beginning of the movie when she served justice to a unwitting bad guy.The broad premise of the movie was that Lisbeth was employed to hack the NSA in order to retrieve a program that gave the user the ability to hack any defense system in the world and potentially deploy weapons of mass distraction. Of course a program of this magnitude is going to attract all sorts of malicious types.The movie was hi intensity and hi tech. The action was measured and doled out in short bursts.

Well, this third version of the capers of Lisbeth Salander, yes, still written by the same group (David Lagercrantz, Stieg Larsson et al) and now directed by Fede Alvarez, doesn't come close to those films, but does provide some technical prowess and a rather breathless showcase for Sweden.In Stockholm, Sweden, vigilante hacker Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy) is hired by computer programmer Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant) to retrieve Firefall, a program capable of accessing the world's nuclear codes that he developed for the National Security Agency, as Balder believes it is too dangerous to exist. Lisbeth successfully retrieves Firefall from the NSA's servers, with some assistance from journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason), attracting the attention of agent Edwin Needham (LaKeith Stanfield), but is unable to unlock it, and the program is later stolen from her by mercenaries led by Jan Holtser (Claes Bang), who also attempts to kill Lisbeth. When she doesn't attend their scheduled rendezvous, Balder mistakenly believes Lisbeth decided to keep Firefall for herself and contacts Gabrielle Grane (Synnøve Macody Lund), the deputy director of the Swedish Security Service (Säpo), who moves Balder and his young son August to a safe-house. Meanwhile, Needham tracks the unauthorized login to Stockholm and arrives to seek Lisbeth and Firefall...The odd opening sequences introduce Lisbeth and her sister Camilla in the home of their brutal father, and later the mature Camilla (Sylvia Hoeks) draws focus as the instigator of troubles for Lisbeth.Sound jumbled? It is, and while the special effects/CGI drama plays very well indeed, the story falters. Beautiful cinematography by Pedro Luque and musical score by Roque Baños become the elements that are impressive.

16,FeastMode,my notes,3,27 July 2019,"I dunno man. i feel like this movie completely missed what ""the girl"" is about. i could tell pretty early that it was trying to be more of an action thriller than a mystery. so i tried to go with it, to think of it as a new type of movie featuring the same character. only problem is, the action wasn't good enough for it to be a spy-action type movie. and the story was too weak to make it an intriguing mystery of any kind. i don't even really know what the point of the story was. it was basically a mindless fun movie but without the fun.there were no characters, just card-board cut-outs. but the worst was mikael. played in the first movie by daniel craig. now played by some lame younger guy who is completely unlikable and lacks any character whatsoever. as soon as i saw him i said please don't tell me that's mikael, but it was. so again i tried to go with it, different telling of the story can have different takes on the character, but they knew each other so it seems like a continuation with a bunch of changes. the worst part is he was completely useless in the movie, they could have and should have taken him out completely and this would have been a better movie.it felt like it had a checklist of things from the first one to do again, which they did in the first 10 minutes of the movie. the tone was off. loved the music in the first, not a fan in this one. also lots of really stupid things that make no sense. and some really terrible fight scenes. bunch of parts where i didn't know what was happening or why. there was almost nothing shocking in this movie like in the crazy and awesome and memorable scenes in first one (1 viewing)

17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The Girl In The Disappointing Sequel,5,26 November 2018,"'The Girl In The Spider's Web (2018)' is not quite a sequel, not quite a reboot, but something altogether more confusing (a 'reboot sequel', if you will). This adaptation of the fourth book in the 'millennium' series is an incredibly strange case, in terms of both its conception and its execution, because not only did someone behind-the-scenes think it was a good idea to, essentially, skip out two whole films (yet reference them as if they occurred, nevertheless) but they also thought it'd be a good idea to dilute what was once a seedy, unsettling and sometimes straight-up disturbing series (in all of its incarnations) into a washed-out, pseudo-'superhero' and comparatively tame affair through and through, one that treats its survivalist outcast of a protagonist as some sort of near indestructible comic-book spy. It's weird that they wanted this franchise, of all things, to be a 'mainstream' one - considering that it has basically relied on its non-mainstream and more realistic characters, scenarios and general feel to find its audience in the past. It's actually this that has done most of the damage, turning the end result into a generic and sort of sub-par 'action-thriller' that's never really entertaining or, even, engaging, despite its more than competent direction, performances and score (which is arguably its best aspect). In their attempt to make the series ""fun"", which it has never been, the filmmakers have removed any of its impact and, in effect, reduced its potential audience by trying to widen it. It's incredibly disappointing, to say the least. 5/10",The Girl in the Spider's Web
18,ThomasDrufke,Disappointingly Generic,6,11 November 2018,"I'm a huge fan of the american version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, starring Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig. The tone, atmosphere, and mystery in the film is fascinating. And that's not even mentioning Rooney Mara's transformative performance as Lisbeth Salander. With The Girl in the Spider's Web, Salander is given a different portrayal, this time from Claire Foy. It's less hidden and a tougher character, but I think it's missing the deceptive vulnerability that Mara brought to Salander almost 10 years ago. But the story is also just far more generic and uninspired than what Fincher brought. Which is disappointing, because I like Fede Alvarez a lot as a director and ""Don't Breathe"" was one of the more unique horror/thriller films of the last decade. There's nothing overtly wrong with ""Spider's Web"", but unfortunately, there's nothing all that memorable either.6.3/10",The Girl in the Spider's Web
19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,6 February 2019,"The Girl in the Spider's WebIf hackers are going to rig elections why not just elect them to office?However, the cyber-terrorist in this thriller has her fingers in something more illicit.While she currently crusades against criminals as a masked vigilante, Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy) occasionally does hack-and-grab gigs like the one an ex-NSA agent (Stephen Merchant) just hired her to undertake. Unfortunately, the nuclear launch codes she stole for him have now made her the target of an active agent (Lakeith Stanfield) and a secret cabal called the Spiders.Not only does this continuation of the Millennium series reduce its intricate lead to an action movie cliché, but this adaptation of the 4th novel also softens the edges of the risqué series creating a sterile knock-off that pales in comparison to both of its American and Swedish predecessors.Incidentally, the only people on earth who can safely date a hacker are the Amish.

23,cruise01,Visually entertaining with its direction but lacking in plot and its darker tone from Dragon Tattoo movie.,8,9 November 2018,"The Girl in the Spider's Web (4 out of 5 stars).The Girl in the Spider's Web is the next entry in the Millenium book series which follows up after David Fincher's film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. With a brand new casts, a new direction, and definitely out of order from the book series. Fede Alvarez direction is a visually entertaining piece, Claire Foy performance as Lisbeth Salander was not as bad, and the plot felt a little different from the others. I will say David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is still the greatest film from Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara performance, and the electronic music score from Atticus Ross. Everything from that was missing in this film.The plot follows Lisbeth (Claire Foy) were she is assigned to steal a program from NSA programmer Edwin (LaKeith Stanfield). When she is double crossed and a group called ""spiders"" steals it from her. She asks for Mikael (Sverrir Gudnason) help on investigating who this group is and how are they link to Lisbeth. When Lisbeth discovers that her past and mysterious sister Camilla (Sylvia Hoeks) has something to do with setting Lisbeth up.The plot was still entertaining. Less complex than the dragon tattoo movie. And shorter with more action. Also, what I really enjoyed about this film was Lisbeth Salander is a bada** character who tries to protect women and the innocent people. From the opening moments, were she beats and blackmail a guy cause he was abusing his wife. And she empties all his funds to give to his wife. She is that antihero, she is a hacker who would steal a car, escape the police, and do whatever she can to get what she wants.There is more action in this film than the others. A group of bad guys break into Lisbeth's warehouse. She avoids danger. She escapes the police by riding her motorcycle onto a frozen lake which was a cool sequence. Then, the climatic fight with her being trapped in a house with the bad guys and going head to head with her sister Camilla.Fede Alvarez direction is entertaining. It is visually exciting from the set drop of locations in Sweden. Bike chases, fight scenes, and more escaping from the bad guys and running. The plot was different. The music score did not add anything to the tone of the movie like David Fincher's film did. Nor was the plot complex with a layered story.Overall, The Girl with the Spider's Web is a good crime thriller film. Claire Foy was good as the character. Sverrir Gudnason was okay as Mikael, his role felt undeveloped. Sylvia Hoeks was good playing as the villain. Fede Alvarez does build its dark tone with its visual direction. And the plot is a forgettable one.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
24,eddie_baggins,A death knell to the series,2,4 March 2019,"It didn't set the world on fire or break new ground, but 2011's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was an above average thriller that was elevated by the great David Fincher and a star making turn from Rooney Mara, giving us all hope that we had a new trilogy to enjoy in the form of Stieg Larsson's Millennium novels, that focused on vigilante hacker Lisbeth Salander and her quest for out of the ordinary justice.Seven year's is a long time in cinematic terms however and come 2018 a lot had changed for the dire The Girl in the Spider's Web.Gone is David Fincher, replaced with up and coming director Fede Alvarez whose previous films The Evil Dead and Don't Breathe are much better than this offering and gone is the previous cast members of 2011's outing, here replaced by Claire Foy as Salander and Sverrir Gudnason as Daniel Craig's previous reporter and love interest Mikael Blomkvist.Also replaced is any of the previous films logic and believability, that was always stretched quite far (ditto with the novels on which it was based), that's here replaced with a seriously unbelievable script, a wasting of Salander's layered complexities and a general sense of a film doing a by the numbers rendition rather than bringing anything new to the table of vigilante/investigative thrillers.Set year's after the events of Dragon Tattoo, Spider's Web focuses on Salander and her quest to stop a dangerous file of nuclear launch codes from getting into the hands of nefarious evildoers, that just so happens to include such delights as Salander escaping a neighbourhood shattering explosion by jumping into a bath tub, a motorcycle getaway across a frozen lake, a quick recovery from numbing drugs thanks to some household pills and most surprisingly an I.T guru's sudden skill as a sharpshooter.It's all extremely silly, often offensively so and while much of this is likely to be because Larson's series has gone to a new author in the wake of his untimely death, it's no excuse for Alvarez and his team when the results are this dire.Foy gives it her best shot in her highest profile cinematic lead yet, but Salander has become a non-event in her own story (even worse is Gudnason pointless incarnation of Blomkvist) and no other character in this tale is worth mentioning, although Salander's ""surprising"" close connection to the group that want this launch codes is quite hilarious in its randomness and unlikelihood.Final Say -It's filmed with a Hollywood sheen and designed to be a hacker Jason Bourne with a female twist but The Girl in the Spider's Web is more like a loud death knell of a franchise that at one stage seemed wholly appealing. A pointless and lifeless film, it's odd that anyone even bothered.1 cattle prod out of 5",The Girl in the Spider's Web
25,leonblackwood,Mediocre movie that's only worth a one watch!,5,26 March 2019,"Review:
This is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and some impressive action scenes, but it's not in the same league as the previous movies in this series. My main problem was with the main character, Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy), who didn't have as much screen charisma as Naomi Rapace, who was great in the first three movies. Also, the movie takes ages to get going, and there are a lot of unnecessary shots that could have easily been taken out of the final cut. I was expecting more action, and the predictable plot did seem to go round and round in circles in parts, but the intensity keeps it going, even though I was hoping for some sort of emotion from Salander. Anyway, the movie is set in Stockholm, Sweden, were vigilante hacker Lisbeth Salander is hired by computer programmer Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant), to retrieve Firefall, a program capable of accessing the world's nuclear codes that he developed for the National Security Agency, as Balder believes it is too dangerous to exist. Lisbeth successfully retrieves Firefall from the NSA's servers, attracting the attention of agent Edwin Needham (LaKeith Stanfield), but is unable to unlock it, and the program is later stolen from her by mercenaries led by Jan Holster (Claes Bang), who also attempts to kill Lisbeth. When she does not attend their scheduled rendezvous, Balder mistakenly believes Lisbeth decided to keep Firefall for herself and contacts Gabrielle Grane (Synnove Macody Lund), the deputy director of the Swedish Security Service, who moves Balder and his young son August (Christopher Convery), to a safe house. Meanwhile, Needham tracks the unauthorised login to Stockholm and arrives to seek Lisbeth and Firefall. Lisbeth asks her hacker friend Plague (Cameron Britton) for help and they contact Lisbeth's former lover, investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason), for help identifying her assailants. Blomkvist learns Holster previously worked for Lisbeth's late father, crime lord Alexander Zalachenko, and is now affiliated with an elusive international crime syndicate known as ""The Spiders"", hence the title. Lisbeth puts surveillance on Balder's safe house, and when it is attacked, she intervenes to protect Balder and his son. She is intercepted by Holster, who kills Balder, frames Lisbeth, and kidnaps August. Lisbeth pursues them in a stolen police car and is able to rescue August and take him to another safe house, where she confirms that he is the only one capable of unlocking Firefall. Elsewhere, Needham locates Lisbeth's girlfriend Sofia and persuades her to arrange a meeting between them, intending to lure Lisbeth into a trap, but Lisbeth manages to evade him, and Needham is later arrested by Grane. Now you know why I said that it seems like it goes round and round in circles! Lisbeth helps him escape in exchange for Needham safely escorting August back to the United States to be reunited with his mother and begrudgingly agrees to give him Firefall as well.Once again, the Spiders attack Lisbeth's safe house and kidnap August. Lisbeth and Blomkvist manage to escape, and Lisbeth learns that their leader is her twin sister Camilla Salander (Sylvia Hoeks), whom Lisbeth believed to be dead. When they were children, Lisbeth decided to run away from their abusive father, and when Camilla hesitated, Lisbeth left her behind. After years of torture, Camilla faked her suicide and went underground to form the Spiders. Camilla and the Spiders take August to her base of operations at the sister's childhood home. Grane had hired the Spiders to retrieve Firefall for her and informed them of Balder's location, but Camilla kills Grane instead. Lisbeth, Blomkvist, Plague and Needham track August to the building, and Lisbeth breaks in to give Plague access to the buildings surveillance system but is caught and taken to the room where August is being held, where she learns that Blomkvist has also been captured. When Camilla threatens to torture him, Lisbeth tells August to trust her and reveal the password to Firefall. Camilla then tries to suffocate Lisbeth by wrapping her in a rubber coating and suctioning out all the air, while describing the abuse she suffered at the hands of their father. Armed with a sniper rifle and guided by Plague, Needham eliminates Camilla's henchmen, saving August and Blomkvist, while Camilla escapes with the laptop containing Firefall. Lisbeth escapes Holster, having been injected with a poison that includes blindness, stumbles around in the forest and gets hit by Camilla's car, causing the vehicle to plunge into the woods. An injured Camilla escapes from the crash site. Lisbeth pursues her to a nearby cliff, where Camilla tearfully asks why she never returned for her. Lisbeth tells her sister that she chose to remain with their father, rather than escape with her. It is then that Camilla realises the error of her ways, but she ends up committing suicide by jumping off the cliff, despite her sister's objections. Meanwhile, Needham attempts to access Firefall, only to discover Lisbeth has already destroyed it. Personally, I think that this movie needed some characters that the audience would care about, except for the usual European gangsters that seemed to be dropping like flies. Also, the dark palette that was set from the beginning of the film, made it feel pretty dull, which is why it's only worth a one watch. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Fede Alvarez, who also brought you the Evil Dead remake, which wasn't that great and Don't Breathe. With such a limited filmography, he wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this movie, especially after the success of the previous movies in this series, and the novels. Also, with Claire Foy's limited action experience, she wouldn't have been my first choice either, but that's not to say that she isn't a good actress. On the plus side, all of the action was done without the help of CGI, which is impressive for this day and age, but it still wasn't enough to save the day. Judging by the poor takings at the box office, I'm not alone with thinking that this movie really needed some A-List actors to make it compete with the previous ones, even though they didn't have any. There just wasn't enough substance to make this movie a hit, which is a shame because Salander is an intriguing and unique character.Budget: $43million

26,TheMovieDiorama,The Girl in the Spider's Web is unable to stand up on all eight legs.,5,26 November 2018,"After the Swedish 'Millennium' trilogy and Fincher's edgy adaptation of the original, Sony have opted to reboot the franchise instead of adapting the second book. That's all well and good, but when western audiences have most likely only seen the first film, it's somewhat idiotic to adapt the fourth book and presume the audience knows everything that has already happened. Salander is hired to steal a program that can remotely control missiles and return it to its owner, however she is quickly entangled in a web of deceit and greed. Foy is the main and only reason this should be watched. She gives yet another transformative performance both physically and with her accent. She is able to produce emotional turmoil and unsociable behaviour when required. Alvarez adds a cold style to his directing, although occasionally ""overdirects"" what is just another generic techno thriller. However, I have problems. The focus on action in an attempt to appeal to general audiences, loses the journalistic thrills that made the previous chapters so compelling. Sure, the action is watchable (aside from the gas mask scene) and many will enjoy it. But from someone who has watched and enjoyed the 'Millennium' trilogy, this reboot is very different and unfortunately mediocre. The convenient action, especially the sniping shots, results in less development on Salander who is arguably the pivotal character. She's supposed to be enigmatic and commanding, yet she somewhat takes a backseat and becomes this invincible super soldier, able to hack literally everything. As mentioned previously, this is an adaptation of the fourth book. Salander's father Zalachenko was an important character when dealing with her development, but is rarely discussed due to the lack of western adaptations. You can follow the story without seeing them, however it's slightly hollow. Also Gudnason made for a dull Blomkvist, I must say. As an action film, the film is good and will keep many entertained. As a reboot of a franchise, it unfortunately loses half of its eight legs.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

28,paul-allaer,"Action movie lacking and suffering as compared to the previous ""Dragon Tattoo"" movies",5,21 November 2018,"""The Girl In the Spider's Web"" (2018 release; 117 min.) is the latest film about the (mis)adventures on Lisbeth Salander. As the movie opens, we see Lisbeth and her sister Camilla as young girls, playing a game of chess, and then confronted by their abusive dad. Lisbeth escapes by jumping through a window. We then flash forward to the present day in ""Stockholm"", where Lisbeth is hired by a terminated National Security Agency guy to hack a software program that allows an individual direct access to any and all military defense system in the world. Lisbeth succeeds, but along the way incurs the wrath of many people... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a reboot of the ""Dragon Tattoo"" movie franchise, which until now included the 3 original Swedish films from 2009 (adopting the 3 original ""Millennium"" books) and the 2011 US remake of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" directed by David Fincher. While for me the 2011 remake was really not necessary (die to the excellent Swedish original movie), at least Fincher kept the original tone: a dark psychological thriller, helped enormously by Rooney Mara's performance (although nobody is ever going to surpass Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander). Now 7 years later, we get this film. I must admit I was skeptical from the start, I mean, the US franchise simply skips books 2 and 3 and instead now brings to the big screen a book that was not even written by the original author of the ""Dragon Tattoo"" series (Stieg Larsson, who passed away in 2004). To complicate matters further, the original 2011 US cast is dumped altogether, even though Rooney Mara made it very clear that she was very much game for retaking the Lisbeth Salander role. Instead we now get Claire Foy, whom we just saw in ""First Man"". While Foy does an admirable job, at no time can she replace Mara (let alone Rapace). But more disappointing is that what once was a dark and brooding book and movie franchise, this is now a straight forward action movie, nothing more, nothing less. Think James Bond for the 21st century. In fact, the opening credits montage is VERY MUCH like a James Bond movie, as is the overall approach to character development (slim to none). And all the plot points all get a clear resolution by the end. Of course. No expense was spared for this film, and it all eyes nicely, but the movie simply lacks and suffers as compared to the previous films.""The Girl In the Spider's Web"" opened a few weekends ago, and has decidedly underwhelmed at the box office. I finally got around to seeing it this week. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (3 people including myself). Given the film's big budget and meager box office return, it is not clear whether a next ""Dragon Tattoo"" will be forthcoming. If it were up to me, I'd re-engage Fincher and Mara to adapt Book 2 ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" for a US remake. If you liked the earlier Swedish movies or the 2011 US remake of the first film, I'd suggest you keep your expectations for this 2018 movie as low as possible, and then check it out, be it in theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
29,jtindahouse,A series that just can't quite find the mark,6,24 March 2019,"'The Girl in the Spider's Web' is the first entry in the Millennium series to be penned by a different author after the untimely death of Steig Larsson. It's noticeable too in movie form. It feels very different, not so much in tone but more so in story structure. This film wants to be more of an action film, whereas the original trilogy were more about slow-burn stories and building the characters. If anything I probably prefer the style in 'Spider's Web' to what the originals were trying to create. There always has to be a balance, but I think this finds it better.Claire Foy as 'Lisbeth Salander' does a pretty decent job I thought. She nailed the accent but maybe just didn't quite have a hard enough look for the role would be my only criticism. 'Salander' would be a very hard role to take on I imagine. She's someone who in real life would be incredibly unlikeable and yet everyone who plays her is expected to make her the hero of the story and extremely likeable.I notice these films keep flopping at the Box-Office. Perhaps they just aren't supposed to work as films. Perhaps people want what only the books can give us which is to get into these character's minds. I feel like these films should feel unique from any other film on the marker, yet they never do. Maybe one day a director will work out how to achieve it, but as for now we continue to wait. This isn't a bad film, but it's pretty forgettable nonetheless.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

36,kluseba,The best in the franchise,8,12 December 2018,"This franchise was all the rage about ten years ago when the novels became popular and were made into three movies. I watched all three films back then and found them quite hard to sit through. They had a gripping bleak atmosphere but everything else was rather uninteresting. The acting performances didn't impress me much. The films were slow, plodding and overlong. The plots were predictable and tedious. You might wonder why I even watched The Girl in the Spider's Web. As a matter of fact, I wanted to watch a completely different film at my small local cinema but the film got cancelled and I was given the chance to watch a film for free. Since this one was just about to start, I gave it a chance. The film turned out being much better than expected. Needless to say that this is the best film of the franchise in my opinion.The film has the same bleak atmosphere as the original movies. However, the acting performances are much better than anticipated and especially Claire Foy convinces as creative, emotional and intelligent young woman with a sinister past and she shows many more facets of her character than any other actress did before her. The story has a steadier pace than earlier entries in the franchise and is interesting from start to finish as all the side stories and supporting characters are cleverly linked and end up being at the same place for the film's intense conclusion. The story is diversified, emotional and entertaining as it turns out being gripping from start to finish despite not being the most creative plot I have come across. The film reminds me of the critically underrated The Snowman which was released about one year earlier.Fans of the franchise should like this film but even those who didn't care about the franchise should give this intense psychological thriller a try. This film is atmospheric, emotional and intense as it mostly avoids pretentious social criticism that slowed the previous entries in the franchise down. One even gets to witness some dynamic action sequences and especially the final thirty minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Girl in the Spider's Web is one of the best thrillers released this year and a very welcome positive surprise.

The activities of this Angelo Morte are not appreciated by the Swedish Police. Lisbeth is hired by an ex-NSA contractor Balder (Stephen Merchant) to steal Firefall, a program capable of accessing the world's nuclear codes that he developed for the National Security Agency. She succeeds in doing so but comes under attack, barely surviving and the program is stolen.It quickly becomes obvious that a criminal organisation is behind the attack, one led by her estranged sister Camilla (Sylvia hoeks). An NSA agent, Needham (LaKeith Stanfield) traces Lisbeth's hack to Stockholm where he soon comes into conflict with Grane (Synnove Macody) a Swedish Security Service official. The hunt is on for Salander who the authorities believe still has Firefall. Lisbeth reaches out to journalist Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) for assistance.A sequel and partial reboot sees more of Lisbeth's past revealed, how she escaped from her family and the grudges which her sister has held for years. Blomkvist also still carries a torch for Lisbeth even though he hasn't seen her for three years and it affects his ability to work and maintain relationships. Lisbeth herself also seems unhappy in some aspects of her life but proud of her role as the vigilante hacker. The tensions generated by these links takes the film way beyond the James Bond type thriller that some critics have styled it as. This bisexual Jemima Bond is far more complex a human being than the dour Scot even if the program title Firefall is suggestive of a 007 movie.Car chases, secret hideouts, extreme violence and death-defying escapes including a wonderful motorbike ride across a frozen river do add the the techno-thriller strands of the film. As indeed does the constant surveillance, the hacking of cctv systems; the placing of cameras by Lisbeth herself is crucial at several points in moving the plot forward. Balders son August (Christopher Convery) in echoes of Mercury Rising holds the key to resolving some complications.Director (and co-writer) Fede Alvarez has delivered a superior Conspiracy-Techno-Thriller in which Claire Foy proves herself as no ordinary action hero. 8/10.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Directed by Fede Alvarez (The Evil Dead remake/Don't Breathe) & now starring Claire Foy (taking over for Oscar nominated Rooney Mara), Salander is hired by a weapons programmer to steal his 'baby' from the NSA only to be thwarted by her long lost sister (who has since taken over their dead father's criminal enterprise) & pursued by an American analyst determined to get his hands back on the stolen data. I thought the film worked like gangbusters & its always nice to see a heroine using her brains to topple the bad guys rather than a gun (we do see her armed in the film but she never uses it). The box office returns haven't been kind so who knows if we'll see another adventure on the horizon.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

There are numerous edge-of-your-seat moments and two (count two) amazing cliffhangers. The locations are dazzling. Actual cliffhangers. The tech is supreme. Isn't that what we want to see in a modern movie? Tech handled with such panache it resembles science fiction? All the best bits of the other movies come together in this one, but the story isn't in any way an afterthought. There's the terrible injustice corrected angle. There's the government cover-up angle. There's the against-the-odds fights and gun battles. There's the Lisbeth tearing full-throttle through icy Sweden on a motorbike to save the day angle. But there's more. The story is an evolution of Lisbeth's story, a side that we haven't seen before. This is a genuine new instalment. How about the brutal and spooky new villains? Did anyone notice the cool cgi work under the opening credits? The deft touches from intimate camera angles? The perfect editing? The full-theatre sound?

42,eric262003,The Most Emptiest of the Millennium Universe,5,4 October 2020,"To say that this addition to the Millennium Universe was bad is a major underscore in my point of view. Even the aforementioned ""dragon tattoo"" has been altered over the years making look less scary from each movie adaptation. In the Swedish adaptations starring Noomi Rapace as the heroic character Lisbeth Salander, has a dragon tattoo situated on her back and the long claws are itching for a battle. In the David Fincher version starring Rooney Mara, the dragon is located on her left should with the wings folded and the long scaly tale going down her back. In this latest version under the direction of Fede Alvarez, the dragon is located on Salander's back, its wings spread out and looks like a hungry baby bird wanting food from its mother. The bird reminds me of this addition to the Millennium Universe, anti-climactic and generic.British actress Claire Foy take over from Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander who seems more buffed up then the other installments and resembles more like a bounty hunter assassin rather than a computer hacker. Sure she's getting into people's personal files and hacking through the systems, but now she's been fully upgraded to to a tough person fighting criminal minds and toxic males. At times it feels like Salander is acting into her inner James Bond.In a way it deeply pitiful that they had to take relatively original character and had to transform her into the familiar modern-day female characters we've seen over and over again. To be fair, Salander is not generic when it comes to her hacking capabilities, or the fact that she has the super strength and can beat down men nearly twice her size. What makes her character so bland is the constant in your face modification of touch female troupes we've seen many times before. She is just a walking stereotype of buffed-up, merciless one-woman army with an attitude to boot. Her role is a slippery slope being that she's both scary but not evil, she's not guilty, but not all that innocent, she may not be masculine, but she's not fully feminine either. She's basically just everything in between.The idea to have a character that's both female and male to try to promote an in-between character to appease both genders might not be bad, except that it has been done many times before and it gets at time very monotonous. It looks like Foy herself doesn't seem to match the other roles she has played before. To say it was her fault why this movie is so bad is unjustified. Foy is a great actress as she was seen in the Netflix series ""The Crown"" where she plays the young Queen Elizabeth II shows that she's always up for new challenges and proves to be one of the more versatile performers out there. In this movie her subtlety is concealed and her efforts of doing a Swedish accent can still impose traces of her English accent and that we can blame that on the filmmakers.And there's no reason to blame it all out on Steig Larsson who originated ""The Millennium"" series who sadly died in 2004. The novel was taken over by David Lagerkrantz who made two more stories in the franchise who felt that this character was too fragile to fully evolve into womanhood. As a spider she's like a black widow, who will lure these bad men into her webs and keeps them there hanging upside down until they confess their action all for the sake of feminism. But after that it's a tangled web of her being both the predator and the prey as she deals with family issues, cracking codes and dealing with some of the most deathly secrets on Earth.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

(R)The further grimdark adventures of Lisbeth Salander (now played by Foy) is sort of a sequel, sort of a reboot, only sort of entertaining. Here, Lisbeth tracks a secretive, anarchic organization trying to get their hands on a dangerous program called ""MacGuffin"" (actually, ""Firefall,"" but, well...). Physical, well-mounted production with a solid performance from Foy (though she can't quite compete with either Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara); unfortunately, most of the intriguing, bristly edges of the protagonist have been sanded off, transforming her into a fairly generic action hero--there is (of course) a child in peril, and the airport scene feels lifted wholesale from a Jason Bourne picture. The unimaginative script also sets up a tangled, emotionally-brittle reunion for Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist (Gudnason), then all but ignores the relationship during the back end. Based on the way Lisbeth sits in her chair while doing her hacking schtick, if they end up doing another sequel/reboot, it better be called ""The Girl with the Terrible Posture.""46/100",The Girl in the Spider's Web

As a stand alone movie, it is almost a super-hero action movie (the petite Lisbeth seems to miraculously recover unbruised or unbroken from physical encounters with assailants twice her size and weight). It has a couple of profound moments and definitely a gut churning sinister vibe. Under that revised criteria, I give the film a 6.9 (average good) out of 10. {Action Adventure}.

The plot developed well with a strong cast and narrative drive led by the investigation was in the spirit of Nordic Noir. Some elements were very impressive and the mood captured well by the editing and cinematography.Now I'm going to be picky.Lisbeth Salander is so damaged in the books she barely functions as a human, her foil is Mikael Blomkvist who is both funny, cynical, kind and above all human, this is missing in the movie.These two main characters bring different skills to the investigation that is the narrative drive of this Nordic Noir, it is this partnership that makes these books truly great.Lastly, why oh why has this franchise been sanitised, in the first film, Lisbeth raped a man with a dildo after beating him up and then tattooed, without anaesthetic, rapist on his chest. In addition the language was adult and nudity throughout, Lisbeth was portrayed then as an animal with animalistic passion. This movie was dumbed down to a 15, Lisbeth seemed quite pleasant, you could imagine her baby-sitting for a neighbour, nothing was viscerally repulsive accepting the way Foy ate a sandwich with her mouth open.This was good but it could have been so much better.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Rather than Lisbeth the role of Mikael Blomkvist ( Sverrir Gudnason is a perfect casting in the contrary of Daniel Craig ( in the Girl with Dragon Tattoo 2011). The genius little boy August (played by Christopher Convery) is also an attraction of the story. Hi fi technology with higher level hacking for Firefall ( or Firewall? )is main part of the story.

Yes, very much so. Lisbeth is no longer that street-smart struggling survivor I've come to respect. No matter what she got into, I knew she would overcome harrowing trials and impossible odds using urban skill; technology and measured patience. Well, all that is gone. Hollyweird has transformed Liz into just another superhero in search of her cape. While on that topic let me share little FYI; In America, the assassins are expert shooters until our superheroes become targets and then they just plain suck. I don't know how Stieg Larsson would take this rendition, but if I were him, I would be climbing the walls. Lisbeth is missing something, depth maybe? Her huma side? Claire Foy is a talented actor I guess, but she does nothing for this character. I understand that Noomi Rapace felt she was not up to revisiting the role - too bad - she is the only Lisbeth in my book. Additionally, I do miss Michael Nyqvist, his presence was so strong and important to the original Swedish versions. To me, so much in this renditioned is hackneyed.

52,rockman182,The Girl in the Spider's Web (2018),6,13 November 2018,"I have seen the extended version of the original Swedish Millenium trilogy and thought it was really good. Especially the first film. Fincher's American remake with Rooney Mara starring as Lisbeth Salander was absolutely fantastic. Thought it was a complex and gripping film, with a stellar performance from Mara. I was really not happy about the recast of Mara and Fincher but of course I decided to give this new loose sequel a chance. It's not a bad film, just too mediocre and it's hard to not think what could have been with the same crew on boardThe latest adventure of Lisbeth Salander involves people trying to get access to a top secret program that has information about unclear missiles around the world. While trying to deal with this, Lisbeth soon realizes that people are trying to kill her and she must try to find out what's going on. The mystery runs deeper than she thinks, tying back to her troubled childhood. Claire Foy takes over the duties of having the lead role.I think Foy is a super talented actress and she is good in this film, no doubt. I still was longing for Mara's portrayal though. I'd say Foy's portrayal doesn't have the complexities and unique nature as the Lisbeth that Mara created. The film is simpler but still feels like it didn't iron out its plot and character development properly. The villains are about as stereotypically generic as they can get. You feel the raw and deep nature of the other incarnations, this feels like a much tamer storyline.The film isn't bad and it's a decent watch but it doesn't reach the level of the mastery of the original and Fincher's re-imagining. Its just an all around average watch which shouldn't be the case when it comes to this series. It's certainly watchable but needed to be in the hands of someone who could make the mediocre something special, and sadly that's not the case here. Decent effort but leaves a desire for more.6/10",The Girl in the Spider's Web
53,RforFilm,The Girl in the Spider's Web takes a badass hacker and makes her...into a dull superhero that doesn't make much sense,4,4 December 2018,"In the mist of guarded computer networks and closed circuits, is the vigilante hacker Lisbeth Salander. She's the title character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it's subsequent sequels written by Stieg Larsson. This is an example of a dark character with a dark past and I mean really dark. The Millennium series, as it's often called, uses her background to tie in with the stories themes of humanity on the brink of insanity, with people willing to engage in rape, torture, and even incest. Because of this, these books have a history of being bleak, but very gripping thrillers that should translate to screen fine.The first three books were made in the book's home country of Sweden and the first got an American remake by David Fincher. Each of the movies were capable of adapting the darker material while offering some relief by getting to know more of the characters like Lisbeth and publisher/writer Mikael Blomkvist. Their not easy stories to watch, especially with family, but they still manage to be entertaining movies. It had baffled me for a while for why more American adaptations haven't happened. We finally get a continuation that was written after the author's death, The Girl in the Spider's Web.Underground hacker Lisbeth Salander (played by Claire Foy)is hired to acquire a program from the American NSA, something called Firefall, which is capable of accessing nuclear launch codes all over the world. She does get it, but finds that the password system is a complex puzzle she cannot figure out. On top of that, the program is taken by a gang who attempt to kill her. She manages to get out and evade authorities when it's believed that she kept the program for herself.Upon seeing she's a wanted criminal, former lover/partner Mikael Blomkvist
(played by Sverrir Gudnason) manages to track her and he agrees to find out more about the gang that attacked. It's believed that the gang, called ""the spiders"" had worked for Lisbeth's father. This is an area that Lisbeth had tried to ignore, due to the bad memories of growing up with him. Regardless, she's also in a complicated state as her sister Camilla (played by Sylvia Hoeks) chose to stay with her father and may be coming back into the picture. It's a race to see if Lisbeth can finally deal with her haunted past.I have to give some credit to The Girl in the Spider's Web for trying to give Lisbeth more of an insight into her character's history. The problem is that unlike the David Fincher original that still felt like a bleaker mystery, this tries to make the character into a superhero. Don't get me wrong, in the books, Lisbeth loves taking on a challenge, but with how many people she's willing to work for, it seems way too out of character to want to work for any of these characters...or be a target of these organizations.The other big problem of the story is how useless Blomkvist is this time around. Much of his material could have been cut and nothing would have been missed. Actor Sverrir Gudnason is so bland and generic as him, that I barley remember anything he added, and yet I still recall everything that Daniel Craig added before. Don't forget, he has a big part in the other Steig Larsson novels!If there is someone that is giving a hundred and ten percent, that is Claire Foy. She does embody much of the anger and angst I'd expect out of Lisbeth Salander. She was probably the one that even got me to remember the majority of the movie.Speaking of which, let's get to another problem of the movie; it's story. The previous American movie had Blomkvist and Salander solving a major family mystery. Now, their trying to stop government corruption, gang warfare and nuclear missile codes. This is a lot their trying to add on to make the hero seem important. Again, everything goes back to motivation and I see little cause of Lisbeth to become interested. They try to throw in her character's sister to make it more personal, but we rarely, if ever, get much of a reaction. If she doesn't care and wouldn't change from this, then why should I care?I'll give this four Stieg Larsson books out of ten. In an age where people are demanding more diverse characters, it's strange that more care isn't put into these Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movies. Maybe a different writer could have done something much better. But if this is where things are going for Lisbeth, I think you can log off and search elsewhere.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

You will be disappointed.It's not like ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" is bad entertainment, it's just that it's ordinary, slick, high-budget entertainment. It's almost so predictable that the script could have wrote itself as it went along.I'm really stretching to find much to say about this film, because it's so basically ordinary and forgettable, merely rehashing characters that seemed so much more original the first time around. And as far as its major plot device or ""MacGuffin"", I don't want to spoil it, except to say, ""Really, that tired, worn-out thing again?"" You also probably won't feel much emotional attachment to any of the characters, most all of whom have been around the block many times before.In summary, you'll keep watching this slick and sometimes brutal production, but it's an obvious money-grab after the success of the original, and you'll probably forget or confuse it with a different film not too long after watching it.

I thought, ""do we need another one""? I got my answer.We don't.THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB continues the story of crusading, crime-fighting, techno-punk computer hacker Lisbeth Salander as she continues on her journey to right the wrongs committed to women from no-good men. She is joined in her quest, once again, by journalist Mikael Bloomkvist.Claire Foy (The Crown) takes over the title role and she is the ONLY thing in this film worth watching. Her Lisbeth is interesting, intense and doggedly-determined. Foy is a charismatic actress and this charisma comes off on the screen. Unfortunately, the other characters/actors that Foy is asked to play with (and off of) are bland, boring and very, very forgettable. Staring with Sverrir Gudnason as Bloomkvist. This character is supposed to by Lisbeth's partner and former lover, but there was no spark of recognition or connection between the two of them and this fellow could have been ANYBODY. Sylvia Hoeks, Adreja Pejic and even Vicky Krieps (so interesting in THE PHANTOM THREAD) were all disposable and interchangeable. Only Stephen Merchant (in a serious role) and Lakeith Stanfield showed any spark of interest.The plot of this film didn't help matters either. Where the first GIRL IN THE DRAGON TATOO is a very intimate, very personal story, SPIDER'S WEB is bigger and broader (almost entering into James Bond territory) making the stakes superficial and phony (even though the plot involved her sister and her father, which SHOULD make it VERY personal). Director Fede Alvarez (working from his own screenplay) also brings nothing to the table, visually, making this a very slow, very tedious slog, indeed.But then, Foy/Salander shows up on the screen and interest increases - at least until she leaves the screen again.Avoid this Spider's Web and go find the original Dragon Tatoo films.Letter Grade B- (for Foy's performance)6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Girl in the Spider's Web
56,spookyrat1,"It's Lisbeth Jim, but not as We Know Her!",6,24 May 2019,"I've liked all the offerings so far; the original Millennium trilogy of Swedish films with Naomi Rapace as our girl, David Fincher's big budget remake flop of the first film with Rooney Mara and even this one, the first not associated with the late Stieg Larsson. But perhaps unsurprisingly, this one, with Claire Foy taking over the central role (very comfortably), now based on David Lagercrantz's version of Lisbeth Solander, is the most unorthodox of the films. Lisbeth has suddenly upgraded and moved into Ethan Hunt and James Bond territory. From primarily being a Swedish domestic vigilante, righting wrongs especially perpetuated on women, she is now saving the world.The Girl in the Spider's Web is an entertaining enough, well-made film with excellent production values, an enhancing soundtrack, good acting, great Swedish locations, attractive cinematography and some excitingly choreographed set action pieces. Unfortunately it is burdened with a storyline of near absurd proportions. Consider the following brief examples that avoid spoiling anything other than the known outlines.This is a movie where whenever opposing sides are presented with a task of apparent insurmountable odds, will resort to some unbelievable , even unexplainable technologies to solve those problems. Failing that, they'll rely on good luck . So (i) Lisbeth is asked by its creator, to attempt to hack into the NSA to retrieve Firefall, a program capable of accessing the world's nuclear codes that Balder the creator believes, is too dangerous to exist. Yes, we know she's a good hacker but we're asked to believe that ... she's done it by the very next scene!!! Who cares about firewalls? But then rather preposterously, she doesn't seem too worried about covering her own tracks. (ii) The NSA has just had the most dangerous technology in human history swiped from under its high-tech nose by someone in Sweden, so it deems to put 1 (yes folks, that's ONE) of its agents on the trail. (iii) Swedish Intelligence have put 2 VIP's into a safe house, guarded by your typical 3 or 4 sleepy-eyed officers who you just know are there to be cannon fodder. But only our Lisbeth it seems actually has CCTV eyes on the vicinity and springs into action while the rest of Sweden is completely unawares of potential clear and present dangers. (iv) She pursues some Spiders (bad guys) across a bridge where she disables their car and inflates their air bags using her mobile phone (???) as you do, I guess. (v) She proceeds to rescue a VIP, but then our Lisbeth laughingly shows she's still very human, by not telling him to throw away his mobile phone, allowing them to again be tracked by the bad guys. (I reckon 95% of IMDB members wouldn't have missed that one after watching countless thrillers). I could cite numerous other examples of cinematic technological outlandishness, but time, space and spoileritus preclude me from doing so.Safe to conclude that Salander fans will be both pleased and disappointed in our heroine's return. Though I think the disappointees outnumber the enthusiasts, as many know TGINTSW was a rather big bomb. It's a pity as it means we may not see our favourite tattooed avenger back on the screen for quite awhile.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

58,bob-the-movie-man,Would the last straight woman in Stockholm turn off the lights?,6,23 November 2018,"You've gotta love a Scandi-thriller. Well, that was until last year's hopeless Michael Fassbender vehicle ""The Snowman"" which devalued the currency better than Brexit has done to the pound! The mother of them all though was the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy (in Swedish) in 2009. Although subject to a wholly unnecessary English remake two year's later by David Fincher (with Mara Rooney and Daniel Craig) it was Noomi Rapace who struck the perfect note as the original anarchic and damaged Lisbeth Salander: a punk wielding a baseball bat like an alien-thing possessed (pun well and truly intended!).Now though we have ""A New Dragon Tattoo Story"" (as the film's subtitle clumsily declares) based on the book by David Lagercrantz, who took over the literary franchise after the untimely death of Stieg Larsson. Picking up the reins as Salander is that most British of actresses Claire Foy.... which seems an odd choice, but one which - after you get past the rather odd accent - she just about pulls off.Lizbeth Salendar (Claire Foy) has an interesting hobby. She is a vigilante, like a lesbian Batman, stalking the streets of Stockholm putting wrongs right where abusive boyfriends/husbands are concerned.She is also a hacking machine for rent. And Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant) has a problem. He has invented a software program that allows its user to control every nuclear warhead in the world from a single laptop (cue every other Bond/24/Austin Powers script ever written). But he has had second thoughts and wants it back from its resting place on the server of the NSA's chief hacker, Ed Needham (Lakeith Stanfield). Balder recruits Salander to recover it, but when things go pear-shaped Salander finds herself on the wrong side of both the law and the encircling terrorist ""spiders"".Scandi-dramas work best when they exploit the snow; maintain a sexual tension; and go dark, gritty and violent. On the plus side, ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" ticks most of those boxes adequately. Foy's Salandar is smart, sassy and sexy, outwitting the best of the best, and only once finding her intellectual match. (If you're a lesbian, Stockholm is most definitely the place to be: there only seemed to be one hetero-female there, and she was an adulteress).But Salander also has a Bond-like invincibility that unfortunately tests your incredulity at multiple points. Contributing to the excitement is the stunt team, who keep themselves busy with some great car and bike chases.So, the movie has its moments and is great to look at. But the film ends up a sandwich or two short of a smorgasbord, thanks largely to some totally bonkers plot points and more than a few ridiculous coincidences. There are without doubt an array of well-constructed set pieces here, but they fail to fully connect with any great conviction. An example of a scene that infuriates is a dramatic bathroom fight in a red-lit gloom with identical protagonists that is cut together so furiously you would need a Blu-ray slo-mo to work out what the hell is going on... and then I fear you might fail.So it's an A- for the Production Design (Eve Stewart, ""The Danish Girl"") and the Cinematography (Pedro Luque, ""Don't Breathe""), but a C- for the director Fede Alvarez (also ""Don't Breathe"").I will save my biggest source of wrath though for that major bug-bear of mine: trailers that spoil the plot. I've asked before, but for a film like this, WHO EXACTLY PUTS TOGETHER THE TRAILER? I'd like to think it's some mindless committee of marketing execs somewhere. Because I HONESTLY CAN'T BELIEVE it would be the director! (If I'm wrong though, I would point my finger at Mr Alvarez and chant ""shame, shame, shame""!). For the trailer that I saw playing in UK cinemas does it's level best to not only drop in the key spoilers of the plot (including the climactic scene), but also spoils just about every action money-shot in the movie. It's all so pointless. If you've by any chance managed to get to this point without seeing the trailer, then SAVE YOURSELVES and AVOID IT!As I mentioned earlier, Claire Foy again extends her range by playing Salander really well. She is the reason to go and see the film.The Daniel Craig part of Blomkvist is played here by Sverrir Gudnason, who was in ""The Circle"" (which I saw) and was Borg in ""Borg McEnroe"" (which I didn't). Blomkvist really is a lazy ****, since he works for the publication ""Millenium"" but writes absolutely nothing for years. It must be only because the boss (Vicky Krieps) fancies him that he keeps his job. Gudnason is good enough, but has very little to do in the movie: its the Salander/Foy show. Slightly, but only slightly, more involved is Lakeith Standfield as the US intelligence man.Stephen Merchant is an odd casting choice for Balder. Not withstanding that he was brilliant when almost unrecognisable in ""Logan"", here he looks far too much like his ""Ricky Gervais sidekick"" persona to be taken seriously: and it's not even remotely a comedy (there is only one humorous moment in the film, a nice ""clicker"" gag in a car park).I had high hopes for this film from the trailer, but I was left disappointed. It's not classic Scandi-noir like the original ""Tattoo""; and it's not going for the black comedy angle of ""Headhunters"" (which I saw again last week and loved... again!). It falls into a rather ""meh"" category. It's not a bad evening's watch, but perhaps worth leaving for a DVD/cable showing.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

59,silvermistvio,Not so bad. But...,7,30 April 2019,"The Girl in the Spider Web film is kind of a good film. But I didn't say great, just good. Almost flawless. So, I don't have that much to write in this review. Hence, my review is going to be shorter than those ones I've recently written.Almost flawless which I said in above doesn't make it to be a great film. As I've said, it's just a good film, not great. In order to be a great film, it really needs to improve more. The film is basically fine. Acting and all, they look fine. Actions are at the acceptable level. I mean if they could do better job, it'd be great.There is one thing which I don't like. And I believe that this is the one and the biggest flaw of this film. When August was with Mikael while Lisabeth was out, there was a call coming in to Auguest's mobile. It said ""Dad"". August took the call and that's how they tracked August's whereabout. My question is why didn't August know that wasn't his dad? August already knew that his dad's dead. He said it himself with his own mouth. If so, why the hell did he take that call and say ""dad""? He actually, really thought the caller is his dead dad. I mean if he didn't know his dad is already dead, it's possible. But he already knew it. So, that scene is complete nonsense.Except that fact, everything looks fine and the film is enjoyable. I'd say it's worth watching.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
60,tm-sheehan,Nothing near the quality of the original film adaptations of the Trilogy,5,27 November 2018,"Great Titles , Good Beginning, Great Ending but
Nothing in The Middle!Don't expect the quality of Stieg Larrson who wrote The Millennium Trilogy ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo novels ..It's so obvious this story or script is not up to the same standard and just trying to cash in on a great story. To me it's a pity it was even written as it adds almost nothing to the original stories and seems at times like a cross between James Bond and Spider-Man or should I say Jane Bond and Spider Woman .Imagine if another author other than JK Rowling wrote a sequel to Harry Potter ( she's busy writing her own anyway) it would be an insult and I think this story is an insult to Stieg Larrson.It has had millions spent on great action shots and cyber weapon play but in my opinion misses out big time.Claire Foy is s very versatile actress and good in the role as Lisbeth Salander but her talent seems wasted in this silly Trilogy sequel .A thumbs down from me for this movie.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
61,JohnRayPeterson,And what a web it is... Loved it.,8,11 February 2019,"Whatever some critics and users have written about the David Lagercrantz take on the forth Millenium in the series' book and movies, or the comparisons of Lisbeth Salander's character as played by Claire Foy with those of Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara, I approached this movie with a blank slate and I'm glad I did.Claire Foy did a splendid job. Her quasi stoic demeanour, as Lisbeth, when she interacts with other characters is spot on, what the character calls for. In this tome, we continue to discover Lisbeth's horrible past, in much the same way as we have before, via flashbacks. From the previous three movies we learned about her despicable father, who she killed, then her psychopath half brother who she set up to die, but we didn't know about her sister until 'The Girl in the Spider's Web'. As it turns out, there was more to the depravity of her father and it infected her sister, the foe of the 4th Millenium series. The very troubled and indubitably criminal sister Camilla will not be killed at the hands of Lisbeth; in fact Lisbeth had always wanted to protect Camilla but the sister did not have the strength of character our heroine did. Even as a foe, and a mean one at that, Camilla was not marked for death by Lisbeth. The first scene and second to last have a dark ominous foretelling parallels, but Camilla dies, an inevitable fate brilliantly thought and written.There is much action in this movie, the suspenseful kind, and more than in previous episodes of the series Lisbeth is a kick-ass fighter, in addition to being a master in use of technology. I've never seen so many tasing of bad guys' groins on top of her punching and kicking that vulnerable area. None of Lisbeth's attacker were blessed with her half brother's insensitivity to pain. It's a smart plot. Lisbeth is one hell of a motorcycle driver in this one, more even than before; and, she also handles four wheels vehicles like nobody's business.For a moment I was under the impression there would be an American's NSA vs Lisbeth Salander storyline, but I was wrong, the plot is a bit more complex and I understand now how some reviewers missed the simplicity of the NSA's involvement with Lisbeth, or rather her involvement with them. I'd tell you more but I must leave you something to discover. Actor Lakeith Stanfield plays the role of NSA agent Ed Needham and he delivers an excellent performance; he is more believable than anyone in the movie and in the few crucial scenes at the beginning he showed us he can convey angst as well any of the best or our favourites. Watch that actor, I trust he'll rise to the top, or should.The one disappointment, for me, was the character of Mikael Blomkvist; he is younger than we are accustomed to and plays a lesser part in the development and outcome. Sverrir Gudnason plays Blomkvist but not nearly as well as Michael Nyqvist had; Nyqvist died at the age of 56 in 2017 and he will be missed. The last movie Nyqvist starred in was 'Hunter Killer' released in 2018 and he did a good job in that one too (I liked the movie).I don't hesitate recommending you watch 'The Girl in the Spider's Web'. I'd watch a Claire Foy movie again and will. If you've read negative reviews of the movie from some Millenium purists, set those aside and make up your own assessment by viewing the film.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

All its problems are balanced enough by the movie´s biggest asset: Claire Foy. She´s the best part of this movie, the best actress to play Lisbeth Salander and one of a hell reason to watch and enjoy this movie. Several undercovered meanings behind the sister´s relationship (much more of a sexually charged rivarility over the love of their father and their own incestuous love -vaccum bag is a torture to Lisbeth but a sexually pleasure for Camila-), it´s clear that this movie could have benefit from a better writing sometimes.

""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" isn't based on one of the novels written by S. Larsson, it's an adaptation of a later Salander adventure written by D. Lagercrantz and unless previous installments, this one plays out more along the lines of an action-thriller rather than an enticing mystery. It's a relatively paper thin plot, but Hollywood make it all seem a lot more complicated than it really is. I'm not sure what the impetus was for the studios to revive this franchise again in 2018 but they've given us another chapter in the Dragon Tattoo collection that doesn't even feel like it's in the same universe as what's come before.

78,thebricks,"Really awful, derivative movie about a SJW superhero",1,12 November 2018,"Had A-list, so watching this wasn't really a big deal. Just wanted to pass some time. It was really bad. You could make a list of the things this movie lifted from Dark Knight, James Bond and Bourne movies. It was just embarrassing writing.The plot holes in the movie just showed how rushed it was. LIzabeth has a fancy apartment in some run down industrial building that clearly looks like it took a lot of work to build in spite of the fact she is wanted by the police for several crimes. Knowing that several people want to kill her, she still keeps several personal effects and electronics that she knows she can't take with her if she has to run. In spite of the fact there was an explosion at the place and the police come, all those items identifying Salander are not taken from the apartment! One bad guy kills a character in the film, tries to set up Salander, but takes out a knife that has his blood on it and throws it on the ground, which is mind-bogglingly stupid. Salander is on the run with a kid, can steal any vehicle, but chooses a very conspicuous lamborghini with rear wheel drive to drive around in snow. Remember, she is supposed to be smarter than us. There are many more, but I gave the screen a dirty look when Lakeith Stansfield's character glowed about how the NSA paid better than whatever hacking career he used to have, which I found hard to believe. He wouldn't be working in Silicon Valley? Come on.Did I mention the lame, subtle attempt to criticize mass migration when the customs guy gets stuck with the people about to be deported?Simply put, this was not a well-made movie. You can see things coming from a mile away, the lead is a totally unlikable Mary Sue and the number of things lifted from other movies was absolutely unbelievable.

79,jb_campo,Foy excels in cool thriller,7,27 April 2019,"The Girl in the Spider's web continues the journey of Lizbeth Salandar in the role of a somewhat-vigilante figure like Charles Bronson from Death Wish fame.Claire Foy (First Man) is outstanding as the standoffish, isolated, single-minded Lizbeth Salanadar. Black leather, tatoos, punk hair, body piercings, all while she demonstrates unbelievable hacker and research skills. This time though, she seems to have met her match - the Past.Salandar has exceptional concentration skills, as she demonstrates in the awesome opening scene that you see in the trailer. She has planned all the outcomes, again somewhat like Robert McCall (Denzel Washington - The Equalizer). Just without the slow-down frames. But the brutality, oh yes, it is there. She will take out her pain on the bad guys without thought.In Spider's Web, the plot revolves around a computer genius who contacts her about some special project he worked on. The project is now in jeopardy of getting into the wrong hands, which could have catastrophic consequences for the world.The American spy network gets involved. Her geek friends get involved. But when the Past comes back to catch up with Lizbeth, she gets knocked off her game, falters, and several times you think she is finished. Is she though?The story is scary, but not super complex. The cinematography is pretty good. The acting by Foy is terrific, while others deliver, especially her encounter with the Past. Flashbacks are used sparingly, thankfully, as the terror reveals itself in real-time.The climactic ending has you breathless, somewhat like Atomic Blonde (Charlize Theron) and the fight on the stairs. This time, the fight is everywhere.Two thumbs up for Spider's Web. Good pacing, strong story, terrific Foy. Plus, I love the vigilante stories where a somewhat bad good-guy takes on the bad bad guys. I look forward to the next installment. Enjoy.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
80,darkreignn,"Unfortunately, more generic then it had any right to be",5,10 November 2018,"I'm a big fan of David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" and I honestly think it's a pretty perfect film. It masquerades as a murder mystery while slowly becoming a dark, depressing character study; you'll never see people act so morally bankrupt as you will in that movie. It's suspenseful, romantic, thrilling, horrifying, disturbing, and ultimately downright sad.So when I saw that they were rebooting the franchise, my first thought wasn't disappointment, but actually excitement. Because let's face it, David Fincher was never going to do a sequel to his film, but I love it so much that any excuse to see Lisbeth back on the screen was good enough for me. And with a director like Fede Alvarez at the helm? People have called him ""Fincer 2.0"" (I'm the only one who called him that), so he seemed like a solid choice to direct this film, what with his stylistic, dark, and moody visual flare he adds to his other films. So when I bought a ticket to this movie last night, I was, let's just say, sufficiently excited, you could say in a sexual way. But as the movie went on, I found myself becoming increasingly more bored, and increasingly less interested in what turned out to be a generic thriller.Look, this movie isn't necessary a bad film, but it is a disappointing one. People have complained that they turned Lisbeth into a superhero and this movie into an action film, but I would disagree. Lisbeth gets her ass handed to her time and time again, and there really isn't that much action in this movie, which actually disappointed me because the 2nd act of this film is piled high with stale conversations about things that won't keep your interest and that you won't remember as soon as the scene ends. I was really nodding off during this movie because of how boring some scenes were, and not because I took 10 Kratom capsules (I ""don't"" advocate drug use). No one enjoys technical conversations about government software, but yet millions of action films are filled with this, I guess to lend the movie some sort of realism or credibility. Worse than that though, millions of action movies have a plot that has to do with the bad guys getting some sort of software that will allow them to control the world's nuclear weapons, turning them into a god with control over life and death. I can honestly tell you that walking into this movie, I did not think that it would take this route, but it did.When you think of Lisbeth Salander, you don't think of a story that would better belong in a Steven Seagal movie from the 80s, but for some reason the producers decided that to reboot this franchise they had to do so by utilizing one of the most generic plots I have ever seen. A movie with a powerhouse character like Lisbeth Salander deserves to be much more constrained, much more straightforward - why was there much pretentious convolution? When you have one of the best characters in literature and film history right in the palms of your hands, perhaps the better decision would've been to focus on her and build her character more, because if someone is going to see this movie, they're going to see Lisbeth, not to see some overly convoluted plot about a computer program getting into enemy hands.The story was by far the most disappointing part of ""The Girl in the Spider's Web."" It would be a better fit in a Bourne movie then in a Dragon Tattoo movie, but I digress, because unfortunately, the story isn't the only thing that I disliked about this film.There really are some gorgeous shots and sequences. The opening scene looked lovely while being very disturbing, and there are other nice shots that are literally all in the trailer. Everything you see in the trailer, those are the best-looking shots of this movie. Everything else really looked like a made for television film. Fede Alvarez is a really good director - just watch ""Evil Dead"" or Don't Breathe,"" both films that drip style and mood. In this film, however, he seemed to either not care, or perhaps he wasn't allowed to do what he wanted, because practically everything looks and feels very generic and safe. There were times when he was channeling David Fincher, but for the most part the visuals were not impressive - he just played it safe, which is a good description for the movie as a whole. The soundtrack, too, was average. Nothing stood out about it, which is a shame because Fincher's soundtrack was abrasive, a sensory overload.By far the best part of this movie is Claire Foy, who plays Lisbeth with the upmost respect. Lisbeth is just as moody as ever, I enjoyed watching Foy eat up the scenery every time she was on screen. And honestly, her performance is the only reason why I would recommend watching this movie; she really is mesmerizing. And because of this, because of the stellar opening, and because of a few impressive action sequences (that, of course, the trailers all show), I can't say I hated this film. I was enjoying it at the start, and there were moments that did keep my attention, but the generic plot and lack of visual flare really dissipated my enjoyment, and as such I cannot rate this movie as anything above average, because average is exactly what it is.5/10",The Girl in the Spider's Web
81,itsbobr,Used the past movie the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to lure us in,7,6 February 2019,"NSA employee Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant) writes a program called Firefall that will allow the user to control all missile systems world wide. Then he has misgivings about it and contacts Lisbeth Salander (Claire Foy) to hack in and take it from NSA and hide it so no one can ever access it. Lisbeth does this but the program is stolen from her. The rest of the movie is Lisbeth trying to recover the program.That is all you really need to know. We see some really brutal fight scenes and this is something many movies are prone to do and why the excessive and brutal violence is something Hollywood needs to look at and hopefully tone it down. We see Lisbeth act like a vigilante in helping women who are helpless to defend for themselves and these scenes are pretty good, but they don't last long because Lisbeth needs to locate that missing Firefall program.Of course the bad guys called Spiders are after the program too. Of course, also NSA has a vested interest in getting Firefall back. They figure it's theirs.To be honest we didn't care for any of the characters in here. This movie didn't need to have been made. We see some fight action scenes, explosions, shootings, but very few scenes that would allow for a human connection, and even when that is attempted, we still didn't care because none of it was done right.Let's face it we went because we liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo because that was good, but in here we see Lisbeth act as an Action Hero with hardly any help from her partner from that past movie: Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gunnason) who had very little to do in here. This was an action movie, okay a thriller, that didn't need to have any basis in Lisbeth's past as a hacker like she was in the Dragon Tattoo movie.Notables: Lakeith Stanfield as Ed Needham, an NSA Agent who believes Lisbeth stole the Firefall program; Sylvia Hoeks, as Camilla Salander, Lisbeth's sister who is in charge of that bad guy Spider Group; Christopher Convery as August, Balder's son who has the key to activating Firefall.The biggest mistake I saw was when Lisbeth was trying to hide August from the Spider gang, she let August have his phone and the Bad Guys pinged it and now knew where August was. Now you just know Bond, James Bond would never have let that happen.This movie could have been made on its own without any reference to Lisbeth, but they used her because we liked the Dragoon Tattoo movie. In that movie Lisbeth was a hacker looking for the truth about a missing person, but in here she acts like Bond, James Bond out to save the world. See? (7/10)Violence: Yes.

82,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Are you not Lisbeth Salander, the righter of wrongs? The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?",8,8 November 2018,"The original book trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest) were written by Stieg Larsson. There were movie versions of each released in 2009 starring Noomi Rapace. In 2010 there was the Millennium TV mini-series, which was a compilation of the three Swedish films with extended scenes/more stuff added back in. The three movies were re-released on DVD with the extra stuff added back in and these became the 'Extended Versions' of the films. In 2011 came the US remake of the first film. Since then, another author (David Lagercrantz) started writing a new series of books continuing the story on from the third book (as the original author, Stieg Larsson, had passed away). This new movie starring Claire Foy is the first film adaptation of the new series of books. The only 'remake' so far has been the 2011 version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.Sadly, not enough people were first introduced to the character of Lisbeth Salander through Noomi Rapace's unparalleled performance, setting the standard by which all other portrayals should be compared. She did all the hard work/heavy lifting, bringing this character to life onscreen for the first time. Quite unfairly, she never scored an Oscar nomination (which I think she *should* have), nor did these original films receive all the praise that the US remake got. Whether it was the fact that the original film trilogy had subtitles, which people simply couldn't be bothered reading, I don't know, but it's a shame that the big flashy US remake got all the glory the original films/actress to play Salander should have. Those who told fans of the original Swedish films to 'Give the US remake a chance!' and dismissed the recasting of the Lisbeth role now know what it feels like. All the people whose first introduction to the characters of Lisbeth, Mikael, etc was the Fincher version clearly couldn't take their own advice, as a large percentage of them seem to be damning this new film, despite the fact that at least it's based on a book that *hasn't* been filmed previously.I've seen complaints about Claire Foy as Lisbeth not looking vastly different to how she normally looks, and this is a result of Fincher going overboard with Lisbeth's look in his version, where she was downright alienesque in appearance. No, it *isn't* normal for Lisbeth to walk around with panda eyes/bizarre make-up. If you watched the second film in the original trilogy, you'd see she reserved the theatrical makeup for special occasions. That's what we get here in the opening scene, with Foy's Lisbeth sporting a swath of white paint over her eyes as she helps out a wife with an abusive husband. And the mohawk only appears here and briefly towards the end of the film. Fincher decided to go all 'comic book' with Lisbeth's look and created a 'heightened/hyper-reality', whereas this film is a bit more 'restrained'. No elaborate fights on escalators this time. When Lisbeth fights a guy hand-to-hand here, it's in a small enclosed area, brutal (not flashy), and she doesn't magically win.We're now seeing the reaction from those who dismissed the part Noomi Rapace played in making the character of Lisbeth Salander as widely recognsied as she is (or who simply don't wish to accept that the role originated with her), because they fell in love with the remake version, when the shoe is on the other foot. The outcry over 'their' version of Lisbeth being replaced is no different to those who didn't wish to see Noomi replaced. Yet they're acting like the US version is the ONLY version. Sorry to break it to you...she's not. Claire Foy gives us a more 'grounded' performance as Lisbeth, as she conveys the character's weaknesses/vulnerabilities, making her feel like more of a 'real' character as opposed to the comic book-like US version. To those complaining about this film's 'action'...so what if there's action? It's not like the remake was devoid of elaborate action scenes. Plus, here she uses her brains for getting out of sticky situations more often than her fists.Sverrir Gudnason might not be as recogniseable as Daniel Craig...but that actually works in his favour. Rather than watching a non-action version of James Bond onscreen, we're getting to see a Mikael as he comes across in the books. He's more or less just a regular guy, and I think the actor portrays him believably. We only get short scenes between him and Foy's Salander, but their 'relationship'/friendship feels like it's already established. The remake seemed to put them together in no time and I didn't feel that was 'earned' like in the original. Sylvia Hoeks does a lot with limited screentime also. We don't really meet her Camilla until late into the film (though we're introduced to the sisters as children at the beginning), but she plays the 'coldness' well, showing just hints of vulnerability.I read the book this movie's based on/adapted from when it was first released and didn't think much of it. The author just wasn't able to capture what made the original three books (which I've read each of multiple times) so great. However, I decided to give the book another try in preparation for seeing this movie. Maybe it's that this movie's such a 'loose' interpretation of the book, with it being quite a bit different, but I found the film version much more interesting. The problem is some people who only know the US remake are ignorant of what came before. They think that version is the ONLY one that exists. This is no doubt what has contributed to the IMDB rating being so (quite unjustly) low. Claire Foy *is* the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo...whether you like it/wish to accept it or not. Hopefully we get to see more of her in the role. Until then, do yourself a favour and watch the original trilogy.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
83,Lewis_Heather787,Its surprisingly quite good!,7,16 November 2018,"Now to be perfectly clear I thought that this film was going to be awful and would tank not just financially but be pulled apart critically as well. You know what I was pleasantly surprised with this film, I genuinely enjoyed watching it and it is nowhere near as bad as the critic scores suggest.However I must pause myself hear by saying that even though I very much enjoyed this film and actually think its good, I in no way think that this is any better than the previous film incarnation. Personally for me and I know I'm in the minority I can take or leave the Swedish versions, there good but nowhere near as good as the David Fincher version in 2011 which is believe is perfection. That film I believe is the best and the gold standard that future films such as this one should not only be aiming for but trying to surpass.Overall I think the film is good, the directing from Fede Alvarez is very good from start to finish and definitely has some striking imagery which we have come to expect from these films. I was really nervous going in because I just believed that this would just try a copy the other films but no it doesn't. Whereas the other films are more investigative thriller this is more investigative action thriller.....if that makes any sense. There is a lot more action in this film but it really works, the action scenes are directed really nicely, this film for me at least was never boring.The cast overall is again good, Claire Foy unfortunately isn't one of the standouts of the film which I can understand is a huge negative for some people. For me its just disappointing but I never really thought that she was ever going to be better than Rooney Mara. Foy is just fine in the role, she is not terrible by any stretch of the imagination. Sverrir Gudnason to be fare takes a bit of a back seat in this incarnation of the character some its unfair to compare him to the great Daniel Craig. Gudnason does absolutely nothing wrong but he also pretty much does absolutely nothing in the film.For me personally there is only one performance that not only stood out I think it sort of saves this film a bit from being just ok. That is the performance of Sylvia Hoeks who plays Camilla Salander. She was the standout in Blade Runner 2049 last year and again in this film. She was absolutely utterly fantastic, although I can 100% understand why her performance could ruin the film. Your either gonna be on board with her or not, and I bought into her character 1 million percent. She is not just playing the quote in quote villain there is so much more to her character and for me, I completely understood her character motivations. The best way to describe her character is as a soft, sweet, innocent, beautiful and haunting woman. One minute she could be seducing you and the next killing you, brutally brilliant.In all honest I believe that if the Swedish versions and the David Fincher version didn't exist, this film would have been raved about, it would have been critically and commercially successful. Unfortunately or fortunately thats not the reality we live in, for me it was almost impossible for this film to get anywhere near the David Fincher version. However I was really pleasantly surprised because this is a good enjoyable film that probably isn't as in depth or methodical as the other films are.Overall its 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 its a good film as long as you don't compare it to any of the other films...... which is sort of impossible to do so I can completely understand if you hated this film. Maybe my expectations for this film were so low thats why I enjoyed it as much as I did. My advice to those who did hate go and watch the 2011 David Fincher version.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

89,hunter-friesen,Spider's Web is as lifeless as its setting,4,26 November 2018,"After watching ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"", the only thing I could think about is how badly this film tried to be like James Bond. There's the dark protagonist that uses questionable methods to serve justice, the villain that wants to control the world, and the underdeveloped love interest that always gets in the way. ""Spider's Web"" even has an opening title sequence that serves no purpose other than to make you think you're watching a James Bond film. One could say that the only thing that the 007 films have that this film doesn't is a sense of quality, which in the end makes ""Spider's Web"" a pale imitation of its far superior predecessors.""Spider's Web"" is directed by Fede Alvarez, who previously proved himself with the horror thriller Don't Breathe. Unfortunately, he brings none of those thrills to this film as it ends up being a boring slogAlvarez really tries to make this a hard action flick, which totally goes against the source material. Lisbeth is treated here as a heroine who is able to fight off five guys at a time when really she's a tortured anti-hero that uses her genius skills to be ahead of her enemies.Alvarez also relies heavily on action set pieces in order to mask the overall drabness of the story. Unsurprisingly, the set pieces are just as drab as everything else. The car chases and stunt work are by the numbers and hard to watch as the editing jumps around at a frenetic pace.Going along with the theme of unoriginality is the writing.The main MacGuffin plot follows Salander as she goes around Sweden tracking down a laptop containing a program that can control the world's supply of nuclear weapons.The plot feels more in line with a cheesy 80s Schwarzenegger flick rather than a modern thriller. It also goes against the hard grounded tone that the film tries to convey. Lisbeth deals with her inner demons in one scene and in the next she is trying to stop a nuclear holocaust. It's a crazy shift that rips the film of any tension and believability.Filling the boring world is some equally bland characters. Many don't have a name or are so basic that you'll forget their name immediately after hearing it. The writers try to make each one cool by giving them super skills like fighting or hacking, but they forgot to give them personalities. Each one feels more like an object to move the plot forward rather than an actual human with feelings.The one good thing that can be said is Claire Foy as she fearlessly dives into the role of Lisbeth Salander. Her accent is on point and she brings a good amount of grit to the character. It's a shame that she is wasted with such lousy material.The rest of the supporting cast fails to make an impact and feel cut and pasted out of any typical action movie.Lakeith Stanfield plays Edwin, an NSA agent who hunts down Salander in a game of cat and mouse. Stanfield has done much better work than this and just seems to not really care, and really, who can blame him.Sylvia Hoeks plays the archetypal villain that wants to hold the world hostage. She tries to give her character an edge by being playful and menacing, but it backfires and ends up making her laughably bad.Lastly, Christopher Convery plays August, a kid that gets trapped in all this mess. Now he's only just starting out his early career, but Convery was terrible in the role. His painful delivery ruined about every scene he was in (which is a lot) and immediately crushed any hopes of sympathy for his character.Just like its frozen tundra setting, ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" is cold and lifeless. Save for Claire Foy, everything in the film ends up being a cheap knockoff of other generic action thrillers. Instead of watching a film that wants to be James Bond, just watch a James Bond film, because at least those are pretty good.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

93,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Lots of action but nothing reminiscent of the originals' brilliance.,3,13 November 2018,"It is really sad to see such a hugely successful series as ''Millenium'' to be mangled by movie writers and directors. I absolutely loved the two novels written by David Lagerngrantz (''The Girl in the Spider's Web'', ''The Girl Who Took An Eye For An Eye'') which continued the initial ''Millenium'' trilogy written by the late Stieg Larsson, but this adaptation does a truly poor job in transmitting the thrilling atmosphere of the novel, even though it retains some of the book's central plotline themes. The protagonist Claire Foy delivers a performance which is not bad but seem to be mediocre, at least, when compared with that of Noomi Rapace, or even Rooney Mara's in David Fincher's American remake of ''The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo''. The other characters, like Mikael Blomkvist or Erika Berger seem almost alien to a fan of the book series while the pace of the story is uneven and the script seems to suffer in cohesion and escalation rhythm. The result is a b-movie quality film that falls short of the previous Swedish productions of the three first novels. The hardcore fans of the novels and those films will be disappointed or even angry at this disgraceful attempt of bringing legendary characters like Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist on the silver screen.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

95,torrascotia,The female James Bond.,6,14 November 2018,"I managed to catch this on preview prior to the UK general release.
Anyone familiar with the franchise will know the tone and premise of these movies, having watched the originals this was the first of the English language Salander movies I got round to watching.
This does feel like a departure from the tone and feel of the originals and that may or may not be a good thing, depending on how invested you are in the written material.
There is far less of the feminism which permeates the first three movies, this may be a reflection of current mood and also the fact that its just not sensible to have a main character who hates and targets men, when the audience is predominately male.
We have already seen how a possibly small but very vocal group can derail even the biggest movie franchises by feedback on twitter and youtube.
There is only once scene in which LS is seen to be attacking one of these stereotypical abusive men and once that is out of the way you can enjoy the movie.
While there has been talk of a female James Bond, after watching this its hard to see the point. We have a story about a nuclear weapons controller which is stolen by a gang of thugs, headed up by a criminal mastermind. This could not be any more of a Bond movie if it tried. LS basically does what JB does, silly stunts, gadgets, sleeps with women but discards them, wins unbelievable fist fights and can jump from tall buildings and land with barely a scratch. Not to mention the sarcastic one liners.
If you enjoy the Bond movies you will likely enjoy this, it has a similar style and level of action.
Its nowhere near as dark as the initial LS movies although there is a brief episode of gore.
If you just want a decent action movie without all of the dodgy politics of the initial LS movies then this is for you.
It certainly wont satisfy the die hard LS fans who want to see the same story about bad men being bad to women all over again getting their comeuppance. We have a female villain here.
The producers have instead opted for a more mainstream movie and should find a wider audience as a result, plus you will not have to have seen any of the previous movies to enjoy this.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

102,paulijcalderon,Are you Lisbeth Salander the... Action hero?,6,29 October 2018,"I'm gonna sound biased, but the truth is that I am. David Fincher come back! I miss his take of ""Millennium"", which was brilliantly engaging. But we gotta accept the fact that the whole trilogy couldn't be adapted because of the first film not being financially successful enough. The fourth book was also the first in the series to not be written by Stieg Larsson, but instead by David Lagercrantz. Must have been a daunting task following in the footsteps of the world-wide bestsellers. I remember that my dad recognised him in a store once. So he went up to Lagercrantz, said hello and then left him in peace. My dad said he didn't wanna say anything else because he was being criticised and under pressure for taking over the series. That's when I first heard about it - and yes, I was sceptic as well. The trailers had me worried. The direction was gonna be faster, more action oriented and appeal to an even wider audience. I get that, sure. But the brilliance of ""Dragon Tattoo"" is its investigate dark mystery. Look how the story is told and how the audience is always interested in finding the answers to the questions. Was ""Spider's Web"" any good? Well... Better than I expected.Fede Alvarez is not a bad director choice. I underestimated him. He knows how to get the stylish imagery. There's a good eye here since many creative ideas are being used for the shots. It gets points for that. He uses some shaky cam in the intense scenes. Thankfully there's a good balance of steady and hand-held camera use. I've seen Claire Foy getting much work recently. My bets where that she would portray Lisbeth Salander being hysterical or explosive. I was wrong because she lands a solid performance. Subtle when she needs to be, and even showing the emotion that's underneath Lisbeth's tough exterior. Surprisingly she's even funny. Sverrir Gudnason shows a warm interpretation of Mikael Blomkvist. He comes across as a friendly person who's presence lightens the mood. Not a bad take either. I would in all honesty have been ecstatic if Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig had returned. Then again Fede Alvarez felt he wouldn't had done 50% of his job if he took Fincher's cast. I don't really agree, but I understand what he means. The first act of the film was pretty alright. The look, the pacing and the introduction of the story worked. You can tell by the beginning that the style direction will be something else: An action-thriller. Salander has become a vigilante. That's something I feel kind of ""Eh.."" about. Clearly not the original intention. If you look at it as a James Bond type film, you'll enjoy it quite a lot. Don't go in expecting a moody crime mystery. That's not what you'll get. The story is not as isolated but more expanded involving Nato or Swedish Special Forces and people running after computer programs. Seemed more far-fetched than what it needed to be.The experience of watching ""Spider's Web"" was enjoyable. You can have fun with the action and your suspenseful scenes. As a typical action movie, it does the job. The villain in the piece stood out to me. Sylvia Hoeks (who we saw in ""Blade Runner 2049"") delivers an eerie enemy for Salander. I get the feeling she's not gonna get enough credit for this role since her entire character doesn't fit the ""supposed"" realistic tone. It's a person straight out of a James Bond movie. And there I go again with that comparison, but it's actually got more in common with that now that I think of it. The villain is acted well - The issue is just that she belongs in another film entirely. I went in afraid of what the film would turn out to be, and it wasn't bad. Although it doesn't capture the greatness of ""Dragon Tattoo"". Stick to the originals for real grittiness. But if you want a fast thrill-ride, then this is decent. Biggest take away: Nice to see Stockholm depicted this nicely in american production again.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Instead of, say, not allowing it, the system just notifies hacker/apparent super soldier Ed Needham. The 3k byte file takes just enough time to download as to make for a thrilling moment.Lisbeth is supposed to deliver the code to the programmer, but Russians blow up her home and take the code.

Claire Foy would make a great Camilla Salander: Sylvia Hoeks would make a great Liz Salander. Of course, that's my personal opinion.Third, hackers are a community, this original 2009 showed a strong mysterious community of hackers. Also the 2011 remake.

110,Field78,Not quite of Swedish quality,6,8 November 2018,"The first Millennium-novel adaptation was a slam-dunk piece of world cinema, featuring plot- and character-driven tension, a very moody atmosphere, stellar performances from the cast, and, equally important, daring subject matter. The dark underbelly of Swedish society (or Western society in general) wasn't ignored but often shown in its full ugliness. The two sequels made for television may have lacked the great plot but still had most of the other ingredients that made this series so deliciously unglamorous and un-Hollywood. Even David Fincher remained very respectful to the material, and re-adapted the first book as Swedish as could be, with equal parts plot and character, great actors and beautiful photography of the cold Swedish landscape. There was rejoice when it was announced that he would also adapt the next two books back-to-back. But then there was silence.... and probably studio interference.What exactly happened is still unclear, but for some reason, a decision was made to skip book 2 and 3 and go straight to the fourth, written by David Lagercrantz after original author Stieg Larsson had died. Fincher (no stranger to studio indecisiveness since Alien 3) and his cast probably skipped town after that, so the studio decided (or had no other choice than) to do a ""soft reboot"" with a new cast and crew. And that didn't go flawlessly.Fede Alvarez, the guy who made it rain blood in the Evil Dead remake, didn't exactly sound like the logical choice as director; then again, neither did Peter Jackson for Lord of the Rings. And Alvarez also made Don't Breathe, where he didn't shy away from an insane and dark twist at the end. Being originally a non-Hollywood director, he could have brought some unique sensibilities to the table. But alas, it wasn't meant to be, because The Girl in the Spider's Web just got the Hollywood treatment, and not in all the good ways.Gone is the deliberately slow pace that gave ample opportunities for character development and world building. Where the previous movies fully integrated the Swedish environments into the storytelling as a character in itself, they are now mostly relegated to being extras. There is nice photography and some photogenic locations, but they feature mostly in brief establishing shots or as background (with the exception of one nice setpiece involving a vertical-lift bridge). Partially to blame are the film's excessive pacing and action, which leave little time to linger on the locale. Apparently, the makers thought it necessary to beef up the story with fast-edited, Bourne-like action and slick explosions. Now admittedly, it looks good on screen, but this is not necessarily the film for it, because the plot and characterizations noticeably suffer from this need to keep things constantly in motion.The story feels kind of familiar: Lisbeth Salander agrees to help a client, but powerful criminals interfere and set her up for murder, making her intent on getting the perpetrators and staying out of the hands of the authorities. If you thought this sounds like The Girl Who Played With Fire (book 2), then the appearance of an unstoppable muscular blond guy will not be too surprising either. The problem, however, is that the thin plot comprises little more than everyone chasing a technological McGuffin. If it isn't easy enough to shoot holes in such a premise, the implausibilities and coincidences pile up throughout the story, like people with selective memories, and police cars that can conveniently track and control a random car by GPS. Towards the end, the movie starts to rely more and more on high-tech gadgets that belong in a James Bond or Mission Impossible movie. Granted, it makes for some pleasing action scenes, but it removes much of the vulnerability and humanity that the previous films were famous for.The most unfortunate consequence of all that plot-driven storytelling and blockbuster treatment is that the characters remain so underdeveloped. Claire Foy is adequate as Lisbeth Salander, although her performance doesn't feel as lived-in as Rooney Mara's and definitely not as Noomi Rapace's (who got way too little credit for it). We are well aware of Lisbeth's capability to stand her ground, and seeing her take on a bunch of henchmen incidentally is always a joy. But re-inventing her as an action hero was a mistake, because it takes away from what makes her most interesting: a woman with a brilliant intellect and survival skills, trapped inside an antisocial mindset.A bigger victim is Sverrir Gudnason as Michael Blomkvist: a seasoned veteran and determined, complex man in the previous films, he has been reimagined as an insecure rookie, hardly getting anything more meaningful to do than advance the plot when the script calls for it; everything that could have rounded his character more (like the situation at his work, his relation with Lisbeth or his affaire with a colleague) is immediately cut short.But the shortest end of the stick goes to my fellow Dutchie Sylvia Hoeks, who was an adequate bad girl in Blade Runner 2049. Here, her character gets a minimum of motivation and some Freudian flashbacks to justify a ridiculous scheme that hardly makes any sense. So much more could have been done with her character other than filling the role of one-dimensional Bond villain.In all fairness, director Alvarez and his fellow screenwriters incidentally find the right tone. The first scene between Lisbeth and Michael is both appropriately awkward and visually appealing; there is a nice and suspenseful scene on a bridge, and an airport scene where the fast editing and Lisbeth's inventiveness are used to great effect. Lakeith Stanfield of Get Out fame has one of the more grateful roles as an American NSA agent who will either be a burden or a an asset, something that plays out quite satisfactorily. And despite overrelying on technology, the climax is well executed, and at least better than the almost laughable final confrontation.To summarize, this reboot has its moments, but unfortunately turns out as an overproduced and too well-polished action-thriller, where a slow-paced, raw drama-thriller would have been more effective. Especially with such strong characters that we have come to love over the years. Let's hope that the reverse will happen here, and the Swedes re-adapt the book on their own terms in the future.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

113,KathleenK22,Most enjoyable and exciting,9,7 December 2018,"I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews I suspended my expectations.However, I need not have done. My husband enjoyed it too. It is filled with interesting characters and the lead is played by the star of ""The Crown"" which also had me intrigued as I could not imagine her in this role. She did it justice, however. There was suspense and twists and enough to keep you riveted throughout. It was not too dark either. Good vs evil is a common theme and we see it portrayed in this film. A range of characters fill out the script and intertwine to deliver a story that is interesting and suspenseful. An innocent and gifted child is one of the characters and children always bring something special to a movie. Loyal friends and new allies are needed and support the female protagonist. Another one of Larssen's novels brought to life which would have met with his approval. Ignore some of the poor reviews. I did and was glad I did!",The Girl in the Spider's Web

One thought it failed to capture nuances that Rapace and Mara presented such as the complexities of a genius mind, bordline personality, and possible spectrum disorders. The other thought it wasn't her cup if tea. I found it tense, enjoyable, entertaining...a great escape from the mundane. I came home and began re-watching the Noomi Rapace series.I thought Rooney's E.Salandar was iconic and played against Craigs Blomqvist was an unexpected treat. A film I can watch over and over. This film does not reach that caliber, but it is not a bad film. It has pace, unpredictability, continuity, good acting and nothing boring. Foy it not as edgy as previous occupants of the role but a little more determined, and proves to be good with children; like a female James Bond freelancing rather than a genius hacker with personality disorders. But, the story sort of encourages it with a sibling as the arch enemy.There are boring films out there but this not one.

119,scottsideasare,Wooden acting and too long,5,17 February 2019,"The movie is tedious and overly long. The acting of Claire Foy is wooden, cold and devoid of emotion. At first I thought it fits the character but it wears on you rapidly. I won't post spoilers but it seems that everyone in the film did their parts in front of green screen since they are all disconnected from the story emotions. There's a strong secret agent/terminator vibe to the main character, but that's not a compliment.
The plot is just as unlikely as her wooden emotions. Everything in the world is NOT connected to the internet and certainly not important and sensitive defense systems. Enough said, if they'd shaved 30 minutes off the movie it would've been tighter and more interesting. As it is, it's an ""ok"" rental for when you can't find anything else to watch.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
120,joanacatbagan,Has potential,6,26 April 2019,"Not the sequel/reboot I wanted, but as a big David Fincher worshipper, and a Rooney Mara fan- this is a sequel/reboot that I am pretty content with. An average 6/10. Millenium trilogy is one of my favorite series from Steig Larsson, it was written perfectly. Unfortunately, The Girl In The Spider's Web wasn't written by him, ergo it was less exciting- I couldn't really blame everything that this film is lacking to it's director (Fede Alvarez).Alvarez tries to recreate the magic touch of Fincher, but still putting his own dark spin on things, as proven with the opening credits visuals that mimic that of Fincher's film. As an action/thriller, it works well. As a mystery/suspense, not as much. I think that the story gets a little predictable at times and some of the twists aren't as surprising as they should be later on in the film; this could be due to the script or due to the marketing/trailers for the film giving away too much of the story.Claire Foy, of course, is the scene stealer (as she always does on all her films. She is the reason why I gave this a shot). Being the third iteration of Lisbeth, I was skeptical at first- Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara were incredible as the character, but Foy is able to still bring to life this cold, yet caring character and make it her own. Other notable characters/actors were Gudnason's Blomkvist and Stanfield's NSA agent. I only wish that we could have spent a little more time with Vicky Krieps' Erika a bit more after her stunning performance in ""Phantom Thread.""If Sony's plans are to continue the franchise, I hope they keep the momentum and don't wait years to tell a new chapter in this story. They could give it back again to the Fincher and Mara tanderm but they could also keep the talent on the screen and behind the camera; Foy has the star power and Alvarez has the ability to lead this franchise in new and surprising directions.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
121,BBogus,"Your typical run of the mill action flick which has none of the feel, atmosphere of Stieg Larsson's Millenium.",1,17 January 2019,"Although it tries so hard, there are oh so many things wrong with it (won't point them out, others have done already, but what the hell is up with the inconsistency with the stupid accents) The main problem is that it does not have the Stieg Larsson's ""Millenium"" feel, atmosphere and depth of the characters. What angers a lot of people and me is that it has been rendered down, dumbed down to your typical superficial, trivial Hollywood action film with empty, wooden acting for cheap action thrills which are rather mediocre. When you want to see a well executed action film better watch one with Tom Cruise or Jason Statham. The original Swedish series of the trilogy were excellent, the Hollywood remake of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was very good, this one can only be labelled as a pathetic attempt which is trying to bank on the Millenium name. At best a very mediocre B-movie with a big budget. No wonder with Fede Alvarez who is an insignificant B-movie Horror director. A horror of a movie indeed which Stieg Larsson didn't deserve.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
122,mallaverack,A qualified assessment,6,19 February 2019,"As far as being an entertaining thriller, I've given this movie a 6 star rating. Some implausible plot lines but overall acting, cinematic features (cinematography, settings, direction) quite good. However, in light of the frequently stated shortcomings cited in reviews here, it is entirely understandable why fans of the Millennium trilogy and the Lisbeth Salander character would consider a 6 rating highly unrealistic.Because it seems that this movie has little resemblance to the book in so many significant ways, die-hard fans will be insulted by this production.
Concerning the central character Lisbeth, it is hardly Foy's fault that she comes across as somewhat more vulnerable and sensitive than originally. But again, it is understandable how such a character portrayal would irk fans.So if it's at all possible, pretend you have never heard of the mind-blowingly successful Millennium novels and characters and view this movie as if wholly unrelated to same!

127,Unknownian,One major error,8,2 September 2019,"We can discuss the fact that Blomkvisk might as as well not even be in the movie, and that's true, however, I don't watch these movies for his character at all.We can discuss Foy's job as Lisbeth, and in my opinion it was adequate, and certainly didn't detract from the film's quality. However, removing her sexuality by eliminating any nudity, and keeping her sexual activity virtually nonexistent, could have been a grave error.We can discuss that the movie is absolutely nothing like the book, however, this is a movie, not a book, and the director did a hell a job keeping the pace up, and the action scenes were excellent.The major issue is that this movie was one of the biggest box office flops of the century, and for me it all came down to one moment in one scene. If I was in the theater watching this movie, I would have walked out after the ""bridge scene"". Watching it at home, I just got a bit pissed off that I bought the Blu-ray, however, it was good enough everywhere else to warrant my rating in my opinion.For those of you that might not have been paying attention, that scene was just plain STUPID, and it's hard to understand why the director didn't change or re-shoot that scene after reviewing the daily's or in editing.The bad guys are killing everyone in the movie, and have tried to kill Lisbeth on numerous occasions, the last incident involved her being injected with a numbing agent during a life or death battle, they kidnap the boy, kill everyone in their wake, and when she finally out maneuvers them on the bridge, instead of killing them and ending it all, she leaves them ""alive"" in the crashed car, just so when she gets back in her car with the boy, they can simply start shooting automatic weapons at her again.It was such a rookie mistake, that the director must take the blame for the box office failure, and go into some serious meditation for an indefinite period of time.
:-)If she killed had them, the movie would have been an improvement, because she would be done eliminating the original trio of killers, she then could have looked back and saw her sister standing on the bridge. ""There"", is where she would make the logical decision to leave the scene, as to not kill her sibling. That makes sense, and the movie would have proceeded with the remaining pack of bad guys the sister had anyway, and we could have gotten some midway movie satisfaction from Lisbeth at least finishing off the original team of murderers.Fixing that scene, and keeping Lisbeth true to her sexuality, may have saved the box office.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
128,pedroquintaoo,The girl in the boring web,4,8 November 2018,"When this reboot/sequel was announced with a new cast, my expectations were really low, however I decided to give a chance, since the director is the same of 2 horror movies that I really loved (Evil Dead and Don't Breathe).The Girl in the Spider's Web is the opposite of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (I'm referring to the Swedish movie and to the American remake), in the originals we've seen an interesting story full of mystery, well developed characters, two great protagonists and some good twists, unlike this reboot/sequel/whatever.I tried to like The Girl in the Spider's Web, because I respect Fede Alvarez, but I need to be honest with my opinion about him, he's amazing to work as director in horror movies but not in another different genres. This movie is just awful!
The plot is cliche, uninteresting, with some predictable scenes and the worst action sequences I've seen in a movie with a ""big"" budget (seriously, even my grandmother without any knowledge about cinema could film better those fight scenes of Lisbeth fighting the bad guys in some bathrooms). The cast is so weak, Claire Foy is a good actress and she tries to do her best with her poorly developed character, but stills the weakest Lisbeth Salander. They're not bad actors, but all of them seem to be in this movie by obligation.I can't say I'm disappointed because my expectations were already low, I'm just a little sad because it could be an awesome film if Sony had chosen a more appropriate director and better screenwriters.Rating 3.5/10",The Girl in the Spider's Web
129,SeamusMacDuff,Lisbeth Salander - Double 0 Sju,4,23 May 2020,"I enjoyed the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and was expecting more of the punk hacker's adventures along those lines. Lines were erased.Plot: An NSA scientist creates a pocket-sized program that can control all the world's nukes (riiiight), then decides it's too dangerous and hires Lisbeth to steal it. It can only be transferred, not copied. (riiiight) He travels to Sweden for this with his savant son, for no reason. (Except he knows the password.) She easily does (riiight), but the only reaction from the USA is a personal one from the guy who oversaw it's development. Meanwhile, Swedish mercenary thugs decide to get involved. So everyone's trying to get the mcguffin back from others who stole it.Lisbeth is no longer just a hacker. With just her phone, she can do anything to any system having a computer at any time with no prep. She's also a butt-kicking warrior who can hold her own against mercenaries twice her size with only her stun gun. She can get a major injection in the neck from something designed to incapacitate if not kill her, but she can grind up and snort some random prescriptions and after wobbling for a few minutes is good as ever. Still, she has to enlist the journalist Blomqvist, who really has no role here other than he was on the other stories. After several highly implausible chase and escape scenes, the bad guys get the son. Somehow they know he has the password. The Swedish security agency is also in the mix, as is another super-hacker ally of Lisbeth.It's a decent action movie on its own, but you'll have to suspend disbelief many many times. Lisbeth can drive 5 meters off a pier on her motorcycle and drive away on the ice. Diving in bathtub saves you from a propane explosion that sets off car alarms a kilometer away. The Swedish guard steps into the other cell so she can lock him in and free the American. Her Twisted Sister (!) is behind all of this. They keep devising complex, Bond villain type ways to kill people (gassing an entire room, a latex body suit vacuum) instead of just shooting them.Foy is too old for the role and not edgy enough. Since Lisbeth barely speaks, she needs to convey more non-verbally; Foy has the same look on her face throughout. Sorry, if you're going to be a freaky emo lesbian, we should see you naked. Blomqvist is too young and really adds nothings. America's non-response to all nukes being controlled by others is particularly unbelievable.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

So spider web puns are pointless.What is this film?Why should you watch it?The film is a rehash of a countless other ""thrillers"".Something that will destroy the world, the ""bond"" type character trying to stop it against all odds, some disturbing back story that really isn't disturbing enough but It is, things blowing up, cops are always too early to foil the the heroine or too late after the party is done and dusted, clueless henchmen and so on.Cliche after cliche.All very pretty. All very neat.The twist of course is that our protagonist is female. But it though? It can't be that. Is it because Lisbeth Salander had turned into ""Bond""?

I know that these movies are pretty much always like this but I would like to see Lizbeth have a bit of levity every now and again. I loved the opening title sequence akin to the James Bond openings. The action was a bit generic and am I the only tired of the female action hero having to care for a child through the entire film?? There are so many that do this. Aliens, Elektra, Resident Evil Retribution, Proud Mary, etc. I enjoyed the stuff with her creepy sister. I wished they would've focused on that more. Her sister remained this enigma throughout the entire film and I felt like we never got a real pay off moment between the two, other than in the very end which made me teary eyed. I did enjoy Claire Foy as Lizbeth. You could tell she really through herself into the character. I just felt she was ill served by a generic action flick.

141,rcastl2335,Another American miss,3,24 November 2018,"For a confused action movie, this one isn't bad. It's chockfull of fistfights, car and motorcycle chases, explosions and gunfights. It's only missing two very vital things: a reason to exist and an interesting leading actress. Skipping over the two sequel books and movies, this one takes its generic plot from a fourth book not written by the late Stieg Larsson. In doing that, it dumps Larsson's harsh critique of male privilege--and loses its relevance in that devil's bargain. The very biggest deficit in the film is the same one that dogged David Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: an actress that brings the fierce, feral, sexual Lisbeth Salander to life. Neither Rooney Mara nor the star of this film, Claire Foy (who looks rather like Audrey Hepburn with a nose ring) have come close to original star Noomi Rapace's ferocious performance. The key failures in Foy's performance are allowing Salander's punk/Goth look to be laughably sanitized and an interpretation leaving the character reactive rather than active. Foy spends most of the film looking wide-eyed at what's happening to her. She's not helped by the unknown, pedestrian actors that people the film. Or the drab grey and white cinematography.

This book differs from Stieg Larrsson's original trilogy having not been written by him but using characters he created.In 2011 we were introduced to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, American style with Rooney Mara in the main role. For me, this remake worked. However, having seen the Swedish movies and being hugely impressed with both the interpretation of Lisbeth by Noomi, I did wonder whether Claire would pull this off.If you're watching this because of the book, then abandon that straight away. This film is NOT the book. The characters are the same ones but there, the similarity ends. We are introduced to Lisbeth and her sister Camila's relationship with their father from the first moment. Lisbeth Salander has become a computer hacking female vigilante hell bent on teaching errant men a lesson. She also lives, at least in this film in a disused converted warehouse in Stockholm and has a casual attitude to sex. She crosses paths with Frans Balder and his son August. Balder has developed some kind of online programme aimed at activating nuclear missiles. Salander moves it and attracts the wrong kind of attention, most of it connected with a group called 'The Spiders' which is run by her sister Camila. After that, everyone is out to get Lisbeth and kidnap August. She also enlists the help of her former lover journalist, Mikhail Blomvist.Visually, this film is dark. It is also very fast paced and doesn't let up from the word go. Salander as portrayed by Foy is not as feral or wildly dressed and pierced as either Rapace or Mara. She is certainly not as distant as either of them. Her performance adds more dimensions to the troubled character and the film gives a better insight into why the character is as she is. It is not a film you can afford to rest on your laurels with. You have to pay attention, but its worth it.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
145,brenswee,Godawful,2,25 August 2019,"No wonder this flopped. The movie meanders through contrived plot point onto more of the same. Claire Foy just has a look throughout like it's a teen angst movie and her parents are continually nagging her to take out the trash. Yes I know her character has had a difficult past and people are trying to kill her, but I recommended that she take one night off and chill with a takeaway and a movie (not this one). Okay I'm kidding, but I'd actually rather watch her doing that to be honest.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

147,fbmike,Now this is a good movie,10,8 February 2019,"So much crap from Hollywood that comes out. This is not one of them. I have reviewed quite a few movies here on IMDb and this is the first one I've reviewed that I've given a 10 to. I don't throw a 10 out lightly like a lot of other so called reviewers here that that throw them out like popcorn. I absolutely loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I'm talking about the one with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, not the foreign one. When this one came out and I saw that Claire Foy was going to take the role that Rooney did, I had some doubts about it. Didn't know if she could pull it off. Well she did. She did justice to the role just as good as Rooney did. I would give the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a 10 also. Two very good and very entertaining flicks. If you didn't like this movie, you just don't like movies and better stick to sitcoms and reality TV like arrogant housewives of Miami or something. This movie kept me interested throughout. When it was over I did a fist pump and said, ""this was good"". This movie is a keeper for me cause I know I will watch multiple times. If you haven't watched this movie yet, grab yourself a comfortable chair and sit back and watch it. Don't listen to the negative reviews, check it out yourself and make your own mind up. On the other hand if something is wrong with you and you didn't like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you probably won't like this one either. To each his own.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

I truly wish I had not bothered. Firstly and most importantly the whole movie is accompanied by the most banal soundtrack which would have been better leaving out altogether, it is so,bad it detracts from key scenes. Secondly Claire Foys Salander is an empty soulless character , not bad bad, but not stand out enough in a poor story and film score.The film looks good in parts but gets so boring that I ended up picking it apart whilst watching.The story, frankly is embarrassing. The back story of the abusive father, sister, chess game is shown in tedious flashbacks. The current story of a scientists, a computer program and the CIA is just mediocre and bordering on WTF, the director must think the audience is stupid. I don't want to spoil the plot but make your own mind up. Even with any source material this could have been a lot smarter and a lot slicker.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
151,RustyShacklefordd,A Disgrace To The Novels!,2,8 January 2019,"When I first saw the trailer I was dissapointed that the original cast and director of the first film were not returning, but was still interested to see them continue the series. This was nothing like the books or previous films!The new cast isn't bad, but still nowhere near as good as the cast in the American version of Dragon Tattoo. But what really made this movie terrible was how it was nothing like the book! Not only was about 80% of the plot changed, but they tried to make it too much of an action movie when anyone who has read the books or seen the US or Swedish version that these are crime dramas, but the people who made this one wanted to make it more of a Hollywood Blockbuster Action Movie. The action is not very good and the story is incredibly boring! This was the first movie in a long time that I nearly walked out of because of how bored I was.If you are a fan of the books and the previous movies, do not waste your time or money on this one! It's nothing but a cheap attempt at Hollywood to try and cash in on the name of the originals.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Nope, I approach this movie as a complete virgin, a blank slate ready to be entertained. My review does not compare the last movie or the books to this movie, it simply critiques this movie as a standalone feature film.Honestly, the movie is erratic. We start with the girl showing chess genius, seemingly to emphasize her intelligence. And yet the entire rest of the film there was no real display of genius on her part. In fact the loser of that initial chess battle is the one who seems to be able to make all the right moves.
Lisbeth somehow survives a fall and then somehow attains good fighting and hacking abilities, I honestly don't know how, but don't need a huge explanation. Let's take it at face value. So this girl who can hack into the most secure facility in the US cannot stop being traced, cannot stop a boy from being traced on his phone, cannot think of a better way to monitor a captive than literally place a camera on a fence. Inconsistent.
This wild girl who can survive a major explosion by jumping into a bathtub of water, escape cops by driving a motorcycle on ice, make elevators stop on cue, struggle against drugs by snorting amphetamines, and is expert a pickpocket enough to perform one of the most obvious steals / plants in movie history, also can't help but give every clue to the authorities and her sister throughout the movie. We see no genius, but only luck, time and time again. No masterful planning. Just inconsistency.
The plot itself was inconsistent -- somehow you have a piece of software that can hack into every country's most secure military assets, and the author of that software decides to endanger his only child as being the key. And somehow everyone knows the child is the key... Then there's the US agent and hacker who arrives on Swedish soil to be told by Swedish authorities that he will be deported if he is not a tourist, and yet his first stop is the girl's apartment, left unsecured, with valuable information left strewn about -- you know, after the explosion that wiped out everything except all the important bits that weren't picked up by the police so that any random stranger or intelligence officer could randomly walk in and miraculously find these essential bits of info... all without any sign of the Swedish authorities caring at all if he is not a tourist...
The frustration is that most of the plot holes could have been easily fixed. This could have been a 9 or 10, to hell with relying on any book history. The elements were there for a great film. But it was let down by lazy script writing and inconsistencies. Such a shame...
My rating of 6 is in support of the quality of acting and high production value of the film, but not for the writers or director.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
153,jmalmsten,"I can't say I'm mad, I'm just dissapointed.",2,30 March 2019,"First off. Yes I'm a Swede. Yes, I've seen the previous films (not the extended cuts of the Swedish films). But no, I haven't read the books. And frankly, I am not in the camp of CHANGE NOTHING! that a lot of fans are in.But, also, frankly, the worst thing about this newest edition was that it bored me. It didn't make me angry or anything. It just drained me of excitement.I was dismayed when I heard that David Fincher had his plans for his Rated R trilogy of films scrapped by the studio (Sony). And then, after years, we got trailers. A seemingly semi-rebooted franchise. With new actors, new direction, and a take somewhat different to Finchers and the Swedish one. Ok, I said, with little in terms of reassurement. I like different. This won't be a simple rethread. And hey, I actually like both Don't Breathe and the Evil Dead remake. Maybe Fede Alvarez can get something worthwhile out of his mission statement?Well. Now that I've seen the result. I'm hoping Sony just stops it with these films.The decision to remake the films in english but keep the Swedish setting was bizarre enough in Fincher's adaptation. But he did do the story justice and his visual mastery was a joy to behold and the man simply knows how to direct a thriller. This film? There are some nice camera work but that's about it. The script is a jumbled mess. The characters are nonexistant. The logic is far fetched at best. And seeing this franchise devolve into outright scifi tech and Roger Moore era James Bond hijinx was especially hard to stomach in a movie that wanted me to take it seriously as a gritty thriller.That's not to say that the original series of films was devoid of far fetched events. Lisbet crawling out of a grave and getting rescued by real life boxer Paolo Roberto was quite a sight to behold back in the originals. But it was motivated in a weird way and earned.In short. Nothing in this film feels earned. Stuff just happens. Characters merely exist. The accents are baffling and hard to decipher. The tech and leaps of logic done are pretty much pulled out of crevices.While I didn't expect Fincher, I did expect something that could grab my attention like the other works I've seen from the director.

Who did they think would be interested in a badly made stupid second-rate plot hole filled nonsensical farce?This film was just irritating and an insult to the late Stieg Larsson.
Hopefully the film will bomb at the box office and the people involved with this utter crap will then find it difficult to make any more movies.That is the only good thing that could come out of this truly dreadful movieWe were expecting a clever psychological thriller with cyber punk influences but what we got was a small unlikely butch female lead, who makes James Bond look like a weed.Does Claire Foy expect to be taken seriously after this role?She should apply to be the next James Bond, that would finish off that franchise too.So disappointing",The Girl in the Spider's Web

160,R-P-McMurphy,Fede Alvarez doesn't deserve Claire Foy,6,24 December 2018,"Claire Foy is one of the greatest young actresses working today, every single performance of hers I've seen is brilliant. To see her work with one of the lamest and cheapest directors to somehow find a way to even get a job in the film industry is both a tragedy and a mystery to me.His films are sort of like the filmmaking equivalent to Jordan Belfort's penny stocks and I don't plan on being the sucker who falls for it anymore. If I do choose to see another film of his, which I probably will, I will not pay for it. So let this be a warning to you Fede Alvarez, I will never ever pay to see one of your little to no effort films ever again so you better move to Netflix or Amazon Prime or something if you're looking forward to me even giving it a one or two second thought as to whether I should give it a click, otherwise I will not even give it any consideration.On the other hand, Claire Foy plays a damaged female equivalent to James Bond. I should write a role like that for her at some point soon. I also have to admit I thought this was way more entertaining than the Fincher adaptation of the book that came before and the Swedish version. However, with material this good I kept wondering why it felt so soulless. Then I thought of Timur Bekmambetov's career and how it turned into the filmmaking equivalent to penny stocks with all his cheap horror films and whatnot. Then I thought about how the same could be said about most thrillers, think of Silence of the Lambs. The first thing you think of might be Hannibal Lecter, who is framed inside of a portrait with little to no production design. Then I thought about Prisoners, same terms apply. However both of those films have something else going on and it's not style over substance.To sum it up I don't exactly feel like Fede Alvarez is a lost cause, I just feel like I get sold on this idea that never really comes to fruition by the time the movie ends. Whether it is a case of one of the greatest artists of our time being restrained by the studio system or some guy just pitching anything that sounds like a cash grab and doing his thing is something I've been wondering about for years now.

And there is no chemistry between any of the characters. I didn't know how much I appreciated Rooney Mara until I watched Claire Foy. As Lisbeth, Mara was tough, quirky, a little odd looking and vulnerable. There was a very interesting dynamic between she and Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) despite the age difference. In 2011 Mara was 26 and Craig was 43. And Craig could have passed for 50.In the sequel Lisbeth got older and Blomkvist got younger. In 2018 Foy was 34 and Sverrir Gudnason was 40. And Gudnason could have passed for 35. Regardless of their ages, there is little interaction between them in ""The Girl in the Spider's Web."" And no chemistry whatsoever. Just 2 people who occasionally interact for the same cause. Foy's Lisbeth does not have the quirky appearance of Mara other than her haircut. Other than one scene at the end she never displays any vulnerability.

171,alvesmarceloalves-73751,The return of Lisbeth,6,9 November 2018,"Three actresses have played Lisbeth Salander in five films in the Millenium saga. Noomi Rapace appeared in the first three films. Then came Rooney Mara and now Claire Foy. Each brought a bias to the mercenary hacker who leaves Sweden doing little Republican work and saving women from the yoke of violence and male horror.Claire Foy brought a combination of her loaded British accent with a somber side that combined too much with the gloomy mood and the Swedish cold showcased in ""The Girl in the Spider Web,"" Lisbeth Salander's new plot spilled into the movies.This story, however, is not the Swedish author Stieg Larsson, creator of the series and who died in 2004 of a heart attack after only three books released. The story of the spider web is by David Lagercrantz, a Swedish author and journalist who was hired by the publisher Norstedts to continue the saga left by Larsson, who had plans to release ten books.The difference, however, in the narrative is very clear already in the approach compared to the previous film, ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"" (2011). If this was a story of suspense and mystery that gradually developed the curiosity of the viewer until the end of history, there is a classic story of reckoning with the past and family drama, associated with a clothing that involves politics, corruption, mercenaries and a criminal organization. All with a posture as if Lisbeth Salander was a dark version of a James Bond or Jason Bourne. And this does not necessarily need to be seen on a 100% positive or 100% negative aspect.Claire Foy is a case in point. In the movie, she finally gets rid of all the imposing and liturgy imposed by the two seasons living the queen Elizabeth in ""The Crown"" to interpret this Lisbeth without physical barriers, of the body and the soul. It is curious to see this transformation of who has been the face of the queen until 2017 and now amends two works in the cinema so different and interesting. The role of Janet Armstrong in ""The First Man"" (2018) and now by Lisbeth.""The Girl in the Spider Web"" is a good movie. Nothing remarkable, somewhat predictable but a good movie to accompany. Although this evaluation is impaired by the lack of basis to analyze comparatively to the literary work. It is impossible for me to analyze whether he is faithful to the work. But only as a movie is it interesting to follow.Perhaps the big problem with this film is the somewhat erased presence of journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Sverrir Gudnason). Gudnason's Blomqvist does not have the same strength as Daniel Craig's in the previous film. And neither the same protagonism. In ""The Girl in the Spider Web"", Blomqvist is still in crisis, but it's just one more move in Lisbeth's personal chess. Which she uses when necessary. Although it is clear that the two share a past of issues unresolved.Some of the merits of the film fit the Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez. He knew how to capture the mood of the saga very well. A Nordic dark style, many dark tones, icy faces - and the villain Camila, lived by Sylvia Hoeks, is an exponent of this - and the economy of the movements contrasting with scenes of claustrophobic struggle. The looks also say a lot of what you want to get through.These are qualities that have kept the series going. Maybe ""The Girl in the Spider Web"" is no better than ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"", but I would like to see Claire Foy again playing the character. Lisbeth deserves this great actress.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

This starts with radio broadcast montage about Lisbeth doing vigilante attacks on men, and continues with obvious explication popping up on computer screens when characters are doing magically instantaneous research. 8) Police cars arriving at crime scenes choreographed to look like dancers entering the stage in Swan Lake. 9) NSA magical computer spy is a famous former hacker. 10) NSA guy gets bumped into in the nightclub, and everyone in the world except for him knows that something was lifted/planted on him. 11) Guy who created insane fantasy program to launch nuclear weapons put the passwords into the possession of his magical supercomputer-like 10-year old son. 12) For some unknown reason, villains know that little boy is key to accessing fantasy program. 13) Are security police goons all wearing the same tie, like it's a uniform? 14) Lisbeth survives gigantic explosion by outrunning flames to jump into bath. 15) When NSA guy goes to scene of exploded Lisbeth apartment, obvious bits and pieces of clues are there on the floor for him to find and audience to see, like a picture of him and Lisbeth's ID, and Swedish investigators just left that stuff behind for what reason who can comprehend, other than to serve up a steaming hot pile of explication for an audience of 10-year olds. 16) Lisbeth lets boy keep his phone, inexplicably, except so that the otherwise magically genius child can answer a call that looks like it's coming from his dead daddy and reveal his location to baddies. 17) Scene where Lisbeth is answering knock on door intercut with NSA guy going to place where he traced her call to, but surprise! they're in two different places. Never seen that trick before (more than 100 times). 18) Lisbeth steals a Ferrari in matte black paint color because she likes to be low-key.That's all I can think of at the moment.

174,TalulaGrey,Wait until it's on TV and you're hungover.,3,19 January 2019,"First of all, if you are expecting this film to be like the book, you will be disappointed. I expected more and although I did read the book I was not expecting a carbon copy. Two of the biggest problems were the editing, and the story. Production values were pretty good. I liked the coldness of Sweden and it was captured very well. The airport scene was pretty fake but I could live with that. The story itself was not as good as the book but at the same time I only gave the book 2 and a half stars on goodreads. Lets face it, David Lagercrantz is no Stieg Larsson, not even close! The screenwriters made it even worse.Now to the acting. I love Clair Foy but she is no Lisbeth Salander. And although she was the only one in the film that could act, she was not believable as Lisbeth. Sverrir Gudnason as Mikael Blomkvist was another fail. It seemed to me that he played no real part because the stuff he did, Lisbeth could have done herself. Sylvia Hoeks as Camilla Salander was lame because Camilla was supposed to be drop dead beautiful. The most laughable was having Andreja Pejic as Lisbeth's lover. She used to be a male but is now a female. She still has an adam's apple for god's sake! And it was so obviously a political move to have her there.So overall, I'm not impressed at all. I give it 3 out of 10 and that's for the scenery/production, but that's it. I do not recommend this film, especially if you have to pay to see it. It'll be on TV soon enough.

175,Maryjnberry,Girl in the Spiders Web,8,4 August 2019,"This is a nicely put together thriller, Hollywood style. Claire Foy is adequate in this role, but much better when she played in First Man, as the first wife of Neil Armstrong.
Noomi Rapace is the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander is legendary. No other actor has come close to showing the depth of the character that Rapace did when playing the role of Lisbeth and her hatred of all things ""establishment"", her father, all of his gang, the psychiatrists and the police, and the Swedish government for the treatment she endured while under their care, not one other actor has shown the depth of that hatred. Lisbeth Salander is a very complex character and needs the best possible actor to emote her feelings on screen.

176,meganmarie-19902,Caught In The Web Of A Brilliant Thriller,8,23 November 2018,"It has been many years since the release of the American remake of The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo, so I was excited about hearing there will finally be a sequel. I was intrigued by how the new cast and director will impact the film, especially as Fede Alvarez directed horror hits such as Evil Dead and Don't Breathe. I expected it to be dark and filled to the brim with thrills, which it was. Claire Foy gave a solid performance as the punk heroine Lisbeth Salander. For me, this was important as Rooney Mara played the socially awkward hacker outstandingly. The dark awkwardness that comes with her character, that icy stare, and her exceptional hacking ability were intact. We delve more into Salander's abusive childhood which makes you understand not just her attitude towards men, but also women.
Whilst I was confused with why producers decided to jump to book four, the movie still worked really well. The criticism it gets is often unjustified and do not let it put you off seeing this movie.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

But this kind of flick can still be entertaining on a Sunday afternoon.. Not this one, though. There are so many mistakes which reveal that the director knows nothing about Stokholm or Sweden. And the acting is really bad throughout, as well.Not one single actor has anything near a convincing Swedish accent, not even Sverrir Gudnason who is the only Swede! Claire Foy is the worst of them all, quite laughable.All the registration plates on all the cars are wrong. The letters Q and ! Are not used in Sweden (not to cause confusion with O and 1), and the letter combination SUP is forbidden as it means ""drink"". The typeface and the letter/number spacing is also all wrong. Even the old Säpo Volvo S60 has this style of plates - the plates issued that model year had a totally different look. Also, Säpo wouldn't use 11-17 year old cars, they would be more likely to be no more than 5 years old.There is no ""774 Birger Jarlsgatan"", it only goes up to 131.There are no external elevators on the Kungsgatan towers.If you want to go unnoticed, you don't steal a Lamborghini Aventador - which will no doubt be fitted with a hidden tracking system.

I'm always on the lookout for vivid female characters, but they're hard to come by. Lisbeth Salander is a most excellent example of what I'm always looking for. Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara were both fantastic and riveting and were perfect embodiments of her. I thought the Spider's Web book was a weak imitation of Dragon Tattoo because it turned her into an invulnerable super-heroine with no weak points. I loved her original depiction of being physically tiny and nearly childlike, but constantly using her formidable mind to move obstacles out of her way. Claire Foy's version was a big letdown because the script gave her no depth at all and the director took away her bizarre, anti-social appearance. Definitely not Miss Foy's fault. She does her best but she has very little to work with, and she was made to look like a fitness instructor with short hair. Reading Dragon Tattoo, I always pictured Lisbeth as a startling, jarring, alien presence that would take some getting used to. Noomi and Rooney were given that look, but not Claire.Anyway, I did enjoy it as a very good action flick with lots of great stunts. I like Mission: Impossible and this was very similar that way. It would've been fine for people unfamiliar with Lisbeth Salander, but it disappointed me in that aspect.

When I heard the main characters, Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig were being replaced, I kind of figured this was doomed for failure.
There was absolutely no chemistry between the new Mikael and Lisbeth. Not only that, Mikael looked younger than Lisbeth, where as the first movie Daniel Craig was much older than Rooney.
They really didn't even need Mikael to be in this movie as he was basically a non factor.

I would say Claire Foy didn't made a bad role, but Mara Rooney played a better Lisbeth Salander role. I think she had more wilderness in her :)
Lakeith Stanfield playing the NSA expert role, also seemed more like a dude, than a real expert. He had more like a dude face, not a serious employee of a serious american agency.
Also Sylvia Hoeks, playing Lisbeth's sister was really annoying and it was completely inappropriate for the role.
The frozen scenery was pretty nice, but as far as I noticed, they picked only a few places to film.
It's clear that David Finch made a better film with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" than Fede Alvarez in this movie.
Maybe if he would had chosen at least one higher rated actor, and more places to film in, the film would have had a bigger impact.
This doesn't mean that I don't have faith in young actors or fresh talents, but doing this he would have attracted more audience in my opinion.

Claire Foy is a terrific Lisbeth Salander. I've seen the Swedish trilogy and the Fincher directed remake, and I still actually enjoyed watching this film the most. Perhaps that means it is the most palatable of all the versions. There really is nothing here that causes aversion in the viewer. In this regard the negative reviews citing the absence of source material do have a point. That aside, Foy's portrayal is certainly, for my money, the most captivating version of Salander to date.I could nitpick away at a few things, like for instance how they've reduced Blomquist to eye candy and made Salander the main agent of action. But I actually kind of liked that. After all, she's the reason we go to see these movies. And yeah, I could have used a storyline that had elements of her getting revenge against her male oppressors, which I believe to be the overall theme of the source material, but again, I actually like that we've moved on from that. In a way, she has grown up and now she's just ready to do her thing: be a lone wolf bad ass and you know, save the world from nuclear annihilation (hence all the Bond references), while working out her past childhood trauma. Overall, if you're looking for a solid dark action/thriller, then leave your baggage at the door and enjoy the ride. I sure did.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

197,dgriggs6,"A thrilling remake of Girl with Dragon Tattoo, but one that has some issues.",6,20 February 2019,"I just saw this movie twice by renting it. The plot is very interesting, starting with the heroine of Dragon Tattoo, Lisbeth Salander, as a young girl with her older sister Camilla in rural Sweden. Their father is only parent, and a ""devout"" sex offender and probably a torturer. Lisbeth escapes, taking an impossible-to-believe swan dive off of a balcony with 100 foot drop. She lands in snow and miraculously gets up running. Fast forward to present day, and Lisbeth is back to her avenging of male sex offenders.
But after that, she gets involved with a Uppsala Univ. male professor and his Firefall program. Which he developed for NSA of US govt. And moved it!! Plot takes off from there. The plot twists are excellent. However .....
In my humble opinion I think the movie suffers from being too linked to very modern technology, instead of linkage like Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara had in Dragon. Good old fashioned research with some help from new technology. I may come to like Spider more once I see it more ..... but I must admit I desperately missed Craig, Mara, and Robin Wright.

213,mram16,Lackluster entry in the Millennium film series,5,22 November 2018,"A solid performance by Claire Foy (First Man, Unsane) can't do much to elevate a weak script that, quite often, not only asks you to suspend your disbelief, but to abandon your disbelief altogether.This film is based on the fourth of five books (to date) in the popular ""Millennium"" series of novels, which happens to be the first of the books written by author David Lagercrantz after the passing of original author Stieg Larsson. The first three books were adapted into a trilogy of films in their native Sweden (all of which were released in 2009), and the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was given an American adaptation helmed by David Fincher in 2011.The story of the newest entry in the film series revolves around a top-secret program called Firefall, which would allow whoever wields it to take control of the world's nuclear weapons. The program was designed by Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant), who has a young autistic son. Balder, having come to realize that the program is too dangerous for any government to control, contacts super-hacker Lisbeth Salander (Foy), asking for her help to find and destroy the program. Unknown to them,however, a mysterious group known only as the Spiders are also after the program. Salander receives help along the way from good friend Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason), a journalist working for Millennium magazine (from which the book series gets its name). In the meantime, Lisbeth's attempt to acquire the Firefall program leads American National Security Agency security expert Edwin Needham (LaKeith Stanfield) to travel to Sweden in hopes of tracking her down.Action abounds, and as the film progresses we learn the identity of the leader of the Spiders, a secret tied to Salander's murky past. Eventually all parties converge on a house in the mountains that is all-too-familiar to Salander, where the film's climax plays out.The film appears to retcon certain details from the previous films (e.g. Blomkvist is younger than he should be), which can be off-putting to those familiar with those films.. Vicky Krieps, who audiences may remember from her fantastic performance in 2017's Phantom Thread, is wasted in a brief appearance as Millennium's publisher Erika Berger. While Salander has been established as a first-class hacker in previous films (as well as in the books on which they're based), here her hacking skills often reach levels of unbelievability. An example of this: in one scene Salander hacks into a car's systems while actively pursuing in another car.In the end we are left with a film that could have been greater than it is, but which was hobbled by a poor script filled with overly convenient contrivances.

I have not read this one, which uses the same two main characters but is effectively ghost written well after the death of creator Stieg Larsson.
I saw this in a multiplex on the big screen and should have been impressed, but as it turns out the movie consists of a series of expensive-looking but very derivative action set pieces, familiar from the Bourne and Bond franchises. Apart from the ludicrous and semi-fantastical climax which severely pushes belief, to say the least.
The plot manages to be simplistic and yet confusing and no-one really gets to make a mark as a human being. It's all more like a computer game.

But this is a movie you can't help compare...i don't understand why they don't pay the swede's to do it instead... It didn't feel swedish at all and not for real here... Like one thing made up police cars for example.. And one thing i couldn't stand is whyyyyyy o whyyyy do they put on this dialect to the characters... We do not sound like that when we talk... Sounds more like they are making fun of us... It drove mu nuts triyin to not think about it... The same in ""Vikings"".... It made me quit after just one season beacause of that dialect...

This went from an amazing movie with Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig to a very bad fantasy/science fiction disgrace of a movie with Claire Foy. Claire Foy does not even come close to following in the footsteps of Rooney Mara. Everything about Claire Foy is inconsistent, unbelievable and weird (in a crappy way). Huge mistake from Sony.

221,FreedomWatchTower,Unimaginative Assembly Line Product,3,19 April 2021,"After having seen David Finchers US Remake THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and being sceptic about it, I must admit that it actually is a pretty good Film, even better then the Swedish original, in every possible way (only Rapace is on the same level, just a different kinda Salander Version).Like everyone I waited years and years for the Sequel, the reasons should be known by now (or look it up, its by now standard Studio idiocy).What made Finchers Film so God D' good was that visually, Acting, casting, Soundtrack, Setting, Plot Structure, subtlety... it got all of thatlretty Masterfully done. The best thing about all of it, was that it took its time in developing all of its characters (if necessary) and especially all of its Plot points.With all of the stuff going on in Finchers Film, youd imagine it turns into a highlight Reel of Plot points, but no it didnt.Now imagine everything I have said goes into the exact opposite and in some cases reaches passage me quality. It turns me off to say this, but Spiders Web turns into one unimaginative assembly line studio trash Flick, it was so CNN competent, that after the first minute you were able to see where this is going.The Music was just horrible, the while Plot sis mostly not make any sense, and by the end I didnt even understood what even was going on, which doesn't mean the film is clever...it is dumb and has Lita of scenes and characters that don't name sense.This film felt like a poor Mans James Bond, or to make it more clear, it was exactly like: Bourne Legacy, Taken 3, American Assassin.. and whatever those run of the mill carbon copy flicks are.Dont watch it!!!",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Brilliantly directed from the guy who did DON,T BREATHE.
Great characters I especially love that Dame who was the baddy in Bladerunner sequel. Claire Foy was really good also as MAD LIZZY.

Instant favorite, Lisbeth was the best female , high tech badass. This movie does not disappoint, Claire Foy steps in to carry the character into the future.

Without knowing any part of the books, the movie is all over the place. Super confusing, weird, and random connections between characters, then no real explanation of who they are or how they fit...and let's not dive into the question, where was Michael Blomkvist for the majority of the movie?!
Action scenes are just there, like they were added in order to create fireworks but no real substance.
In regards to any connection to the book, it was terrible and twisted the real story. Probably 20% based on booked then the remaining 80% just a completely different story. If you're going to do a movie based on a book, why is it even based on the book if it has nothing to do with the story??

The Girl in the Spider's Web is easily better than a couple of Daniel Craig's offerings. Let's not even discuss Roger Moore or the worst of Pierce Brosnan.You don't need a female James Bond. You have Lisbeth Salander. She is an original character who delivers all of the heroic attributes you need. It is shocking that this movie is poorly reviewed at the same time female audiences are crying out for a woman to play James Bond.If you ask nicely, I'm sure they will develop a scenario that requires her to wear a tux.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

This movie is barely more than an attempt to try and get Salander over as an action hero who can do everything at any time. The plot is all over the place, main characters are barely used and the action movie cliche book has seen heavy use.Claire Foy actually does a decent job with the material given but it's hard to surpass Mara or Rapace's performance with this poor script.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
231,Supes909,Superb Thriller,10,11 February 2019,I am surprised that this superb thriller is only in 6's. Clare Foy shakes of her Queen Elizabeth persona to go bad ass Lisabeth Salander. The film is well paced and well written. Clare Foy is superb and maintains that dark look that was made famous by Noomi repace in the original swedish films then by Rooney Mara in the US version.The film toos and fro's between good and the bad with a hint of predictability when Salanders real nemesis is revealed.All in all as a pure entertainer it lives up to its goal - Well for me at least.,The Girl in the Spider's Web

So it doesn't matter how much leather you put on top of Claire, she's never going to resemble Lisbeth Salander, the punk skinny girl with the dragon tattoo on her back. Claire is also ""old"" for the role. Claire is 34. Lisbeth somewhere between 24 and 26. It wouldn't matter so much except that the books depict Lisbeth as someone that looks fragile, even child-like. Claire on the other hand looks like a mother of two or three kids dressed in a Halloween custome (no offense).And then we have Sverrir Gudnanson, who looks like he is 32 when Blomkvist is a fater-type figure.Top that with changing the character's motivations and archetypes completely and you get a disaster. ""The Girl in the Spider's Web"" could very well be called ""Lisbeth Bourne"" because somehow in the three years between Dragon Tattoo and this book/film Lisbeth became a 00 type agent.Terrible movie for fans.

Look I'm not saying this is a critically acclaimed film in anyway there are flaws but it's wasn't too bad either. Go for it you will really have a good time.I think the only reason it got low reviews is because there are some butthurt fans from the first part (no offense) as I'm a casual cinema viewer i found this good this may hurt the fans of the series.And its a bit predictable so..

237,sgraf_x,This is not a Lisbeth Salander story,4,12 February 2019,"This is a generic action-thriller with a weak, lazy script and much of it is eye-rolling and cringe inducing. Claire Foy does a good job taking up the mantle from Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara but other than that the entire feel of the original series is lost. The very best thing about the original series and including the DF American remake is that is was always very well written and what was clever was actually clever. But here is a hack script that uses almost every tired old plot device that is available and makes you really appreciate Stieg Larsson's original polished writing. This film is clearly a money-grab by Sony and I am glad it tanked at the b.o. If you are a fan of the original material do yourself a favor and skip it as it only sullies the character of Libeth Salander. You will not find the girl with the dragon tattoo, the righter of wrongs and the punisher of evil, wicked men here. Instead she is relegated to a less-strong, less-smart generic action hero.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

The original Swedish movies based on his books need to be seen before viewing this movie (the English versions are okay too, but imo, the Swedish ones are superior.) This English-language movie is inspired by but not based on the original books. It is based on a fourth book by another Swedish writer who gives us a look at what Lisbeth's childhood was like, gives her another case to work on, another computer or three to hack, and more injustices to right. Claire Foy is fine as Lisbeth. Users complaining she's been turned into a cartoon hero are taking the first few scenes too literally. Maybe they're memories, maybe dreams; either way, a bit surreal. She is no superhero -- like all the other Lisbeths she's a survivor, feels pain, is guarded and compassionate.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
244,esther70,Deeply Disappointed,4,26 January 2019,"Claire Foy is badly miscasted. She has no badass vibe at all. I love the other two actresses playing Lisbeth but Claire lacks the toughness. You can tell she tried very hard but she just came off like a spoilt princess Even the girl playing her sister would be a much better Lisbeth.
The budget is much bigger than the other four movies on Lisbeth but going to exotic location, explosions, elaborate sets etc. does not help tell a better story. It now looks like a female Jason Bourne or a dark avenger for women hurt by men. The music is horrible, just so 80's. Most references to lesbian and child sexual abuse are watered down. The edginess of the originals are all gone.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

It wasn't really thought provoking at all, as it alternated between hunting someone/something and being hunted.It was interesting in that it didn't take place in the US, and they didn't drag the fight scenes out so long that I felt the need to fast forward through more than one. There were several unbelievable things that occurred in the movie, but not so many that it was constantly bothersome.

And they hired a writer to finish the fourth book, to cash in on Stiegs work.
And with Stieg gone, the soul is gone aswell. And it shows in the book, and it reflects in the film.Now, the acting is not bad. They make the best of what it is.

The 3 originals were drama based and the storyline built up to a climax, which made the characters interesting and you could invest in them. Salander was never an action based character, but she was a damaged, highly intelligent young woman who took care of her own problems. The story was emotionally complex and raw.
This movie throws you into the deep end immediately and Lisbeth is a full blown action hero with an infinite knowledge of computer hacking and more. The villains are uninteresting and one dimensional. There's no in depth understanding of them and they just come across as robotic and bland.
I can't view this as a follow up to the Stieg Larsson books, they're more like a disappointed feminists idea of a female James Bond. Plus the casting was not great Claire Foy was too old to play Lizbeth Salander and didn't portray the character as well as it was in the original Swedish movie, and Sverrir Gudnasen was obviously far too young to be playing the mature Mikael Blomkvist.

In all I thought the movie was great you definitely won't be disappointed. I only say this if I really mean it!

327,towsleysteven,Claire Foy is Worthy of Lisbeth Salander,8,11 January 2019,"The appeal of the Dragon Tattoo series is in no small part the character of Lisbeth Salander, a survivor of child abuse who has become a young woman, a misfit loner with a genius for computers and mathematics. Her exotic and anti-social nature were perfectly captured first in a Swedish language trilogy by Noomi Rapace and then in the feature film of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Rooney Mara.The primary question for Girl in the Spider's Web other than production quality was whether the actress to play Salander this time around was up to the task of inhabiting the role. We needn't have worried. Claire Foy does a spooky job of recreating the character in the same tradition as Rapace and Mara.The earlier films had worked through and disposed of Salander's own history of abuse by men, and we didn't need to mine that history further, so it is gratifying that this film smartly carries the story into fresh territory -- without completely losing that element of Salander's driving force.This means of course that Spider's Web need not be quite as hard to watch in terms of details of Salander's own violent debasement. The mystery is not as complex nor the tone as Fincher-dark, but still moves along at a clip and thank God avoids the mistake of so many movie sequels by turning the Salander character into a soulless superhero mechanism. In fact, future sequels can continue to let Lisbeth stretch and still pull her back moment-to-moment to her proper milieu, the seamy side of a real world.Let Salander be Salander, a damnably clever girl with a vulnerable heart caged by mistrust, pragmatically devious and almost always the smartest person in the room. That's more than enough dimensions to admire in a strong woman.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

However this movie does not have even a whiff of the same atmosphere that the other movies had. I mean it wasn't too boring and a pretty decent action movie if you're not interested in the Millenium series and are just looking some entertainment. The hacking scenes with hacking airport security and elevators and cars is just ridiculous and in general this just has too much action for a Millenium-movie. The ""Haunted House"" in the beginning kinda debunks the original movies plot and just is dumb with the fact that she had a step-sister who was of course the bad guy. Claire Foy was good however as Lisbeth even though this plot/script does not do her any favors as Lisbeth is quite different from the other movies.

To wit: 1) An expert computer wiz and hacker who doesn't even know enough to use a sophisticated VPN to mask an originating IP address (the set-piece that provides the whole initiating action of the story); and, 2) The ""Spiders"" master assassin who doesn't even know enough about basic DNA forensics that, after setting up Salander to take the fall for a murder, he removes the broken toothbrush with which she stabbed him in the thigh and casually drops it on the floor. As if Swedish law enforcement will be too ignorant to notice a bloody stick lying meters away from any of the other bodies.I stopped watching there.

If you haven't read the original book, just give this movie a try. This is worth to watch. Although the length is quite long (2h), it's still good as long as the story is given properly.
I also give thumb-up for Claire, she did her part very well.

And then you go and deliver a less than average movie with a plot that is so shallow and a Michael blomkvist character that is nothing more than a mere marginal role and a Lisbeth that is the least appealing...Do the other two damn stories in a good way and stop being so money hungry Hollywood; shame on you",The Girl in the Spider's Web

One shall not regret the two hours he will spend watching this movie. It is dark, Thrilling, Intense and filled with oddly satisfying cinematography. And do I need to mention the stunning performance of Mrs Foy?Yeah, there were some parts where the movie could use improvements. Like the absence of emotional touch between the two sisters. Mainly due to the lack of interaction. There are very few scenes in the movie where you see these two main characters actually communicating with each other. But It surely does not act like some kind of a major flaw ruining the whole plot. For the most part, you'll be busy enjoying the gripping action the film delivers.I think The Girl in the Spider's Web deserves more.

The worst part is the story which for some reason was changed in so many ways that the whole movie just feels like a blender of ideas randomly thrown throughout the movie. Some of the actors are terrible, the casting of this movie is probably another one of its giant flaws (maybe a couple of actors are ok and that's about it).

Not here. Guns and gas and hidden explosives are everywhere. Characters have little personality.In a matter of international importance, one American agent goes off to Sweden, pretty much on his own, and the Stockholm police seems like the primary arm of international law.To save money nearly every scene looks like it was shot on Sunday morning:little or no traffic and almost no street scenes. Where is everybody?Like a pinball Salander goes from one rough bump to the next. She always survives, despite stormtroopers like in Star Wars. Plus, she gets help from a little boy who knows amazing things, and her chief adversary is either unknown for a while or a character without a personality.At the end her sister explains why she is angry with Lisabeth. Well, the real Lisabeth was a bit more caring than this story line allows. Two hours I will never get back. But see the 3 Swedish movies if you have not. They are darn good. The one American film is not bad either.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

It's not a terrible movie, it's entertaining, but it's just not something I'd spend a lot of money to watch. To start off, the movie was entertaining and gives a good show of female empowerance and defending other women against abusive partners, but what it fails at is to really keep you into it. The first 20 minutes was confusing as they kept jumping back and forth between different characters. The rest was very action packed but at points would seem slow and dull because it felt like at certain points the action would just drag on for too long and it felt like I was watching the same stuff over and over",The Girl in the Spider's Web

For me, this is what makes the books so engaging, this counterplay between her unlikeable personality and the trials she has endured.

Boring movie, dumb plot, an a total disrespect for the source characters and creator.

August Balder was a mute savant in the books. In the movie he is a normal kid who does good math.

399,dmworsech,No. Just no. Boooo!!,1,15 April 2020,"I'd give it a zero if I could.The only way you could possibly like this movie is if you have no prior experience with the Millennium series. None of the books, none of the original Swedish movies, or the US remake. If you have read or watched any of those this movie will damn near ruin the series for you.Personally, I like my adaptations to stay true to the source material, and boy did this butcher the book! It was absolutely unrecognizable. The character's names are essentially the only similarity.""Well, just pretend it's not part of the series."" But it IS part of the series! It's named after a book in the series, it uses characters from the series, and it's marketed as being part of the series. If it had a different title with different character names fine, but it doesn't.Even the cast is nothing like the characters in the series. Lisbeth is too old and somehow James Bond, Jason Bourne, Ethan Hunt, and every other action/spy star rolled into one, and Mikael is too young and so easily forgettable that I already can't recall a single one of his scenes.If you are a fan of the series please, pleeease do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you have no experience with any of the books or previous movies go ahead and watch, but be warned this is busy your average, run of the mill, eeeasily predictable action/spy (non)thriller.I would absolutely love to see more movies of the series, but please bring back the original Swedish cast & directors, or Fincher, Mara, and Craig.

She gets taken again and again because she has no security and no awareness. I suppose she must have spent the hundred million she took.

413,unknownfear,Good Fun,7,12 November 2021,"This is an enjoyable action movie that I feel is somewhat under-rated. I will admit upfront that I have never read the book on which this is based, nor have I seen any of the other Lisbeth Salander movies, but just judging it purely from a general audience perspective I feel this has some good action, an interesting plot and a great performance from Claire Foy, who plays the fascinating and charismatic protagonist.Director Fede Alvarez goes an excellent job, the film is well-shot and is paced very well indeed, which seems to be an increasingly rare commodity in movies these days. It's also nice to watch a movie that doesn't drag on for over two hours! There's some decent action here, from car chases and crashes to shootings and good old-fashioned punch-ups. I didn't notice any really obvious CGI effects here either, which makes for a nice change.According to IMDb, this had an estimated budget of $43,000,000 but only made $35,164,920 at the box-office which I feel is a bit of a shame, I mean it's not the greatest film in the world but it's still a pretty good one and I for one would have liked to have seen a sequel with these actors returning, but I don't suppose that'll happen considering this didn't even manage to make its money back. Technically the movie is as good as you would expect for that kind of money, the snowy Swedish locations are beautiful and the action is well-handled. The acting is very good, Claire Foy is great in this, though it's pretty strange to see comedian Stephen Merchant (who is very well-known here in the UK) playing a serious role in a Hollywood movie!As already mentioned I've never seen any of the other films in this series nor have I read the books, a lot of the criticism here seems to be from people who are comparing this to the apparently much more character-driven books. I personally would rather watch an action movie than a character piece, plus I had no pre-conceived notions about the characters or storyline so I was able to just sit back and enjoy it for what it was. Of course there are plenty of parts that rely heavily on coincidence and unfeasible or illogical actions from certain characters, but at the end of the day this is a Hollywood action movie, so I think most people would be willing to suspend their disbelief and just go along with the ride, if you want realism then watch a Ken Loach or Mike Leigh film! Good fun, and definitely recommended.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
414,germaineaarnold,An insult to the Millennium series,1,23 November 2018,"I don't usually review films but I felt compelled to after watching this.I should say that this from the perspective of someone who has read the Millennium books, and perhaps you would feel differently if you hadn't, but I doubt it because this film is a total mess.The set pieces are boring, the plot is all over the place, the characters' motivations are unclear and it generally felt hugely pointless and unsatisfying.When I read the Girl in the Spider's Web I felt it was okay but not up to Stieg Larsson's standards, that the plotting felt a little clunky, and certain characters felt off. This film makes the book look like the greatest work of literature of the past few hundred years.** Spoilers follow **Most adaptations excise a lot of side plots to condense a story down to two hours. I wasn't surprised to see everything about August's mother, a lot of Sapo and NSA stuff and much of the Millennium ownership go.However, the introduction of a big standard ""nuke the world"" plot, Ed Needham becoming a stupid action hero with Plague as his sidekick, August not being mute...(I could go on) made it feel like the writers might as well have not bothered with the book.Add to that, the main twist from the book, about lisbeth's sister is revealed immediately (it was in the trailer!)But the very worst thing was that not one of the characters acted in a way that you would expect. Blomkvist was a spare part throughout and he decided not to publish! It would have been better to not have Erika in it at all given what she had to do. Gabriella Grane became a villain who died as soon as you realised she was and Ed the Ned was unrecognisable.The idea of Lisbeth as a random vigilante who, throughout the film, even before the Balder saga, is Stockholm's most wanted, is particularly stupid.** spoilers end **Claire Foy is not bad, but is definitely less convincing as Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara. It's ridiculous that Mara says she wasn't even asked about reprising the role when she was the best thing in the last film and really committed to the role. Mara actually got piercings and shaved her head for the role, Foy by comparison looks like she can't wait to get back into her normal gear.The other roles are so flimsy that it would be unfair to judge the actors, though I suppose Stephen Merchant did okay with limited material.In summary, if you have read any of the books, please do not see this film. The Swedish adaptations of the original trilogy are infinitely better and even David Fincher's US remake of the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a masterpiece compared with this. If you have not read any of the books, please still do not see this film. It is a totally mediocre thriller, with no stakes, no drama, confusing motivations and no payoff.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

Mikael, now more or less unneeded for the script, has the same problem of what to publish, decides to not look for the possibilities of telling the truth in such a way that it helps, but rather decides to stay quiet... Then comes the hollywood effect where professional raussian mafia went to stormtrooper school of shooting and a jerry can can blow up a big 2 story-house. Then comes how the evil people need to call in order to triangulate the phone? Or the computer with no operating system, which still works, so Lisbeth can deliver a message.

435,Vibradiant,Unrecognizable,5,15 February 2019,"Watching this version of Lisbeth was like making contact with a quirky friend who underwent a personality-altering trauma, and just hoping a flash of the original charm would emerge. Unfortunately, however, the issues are hardly confined to Claire Foy's radically sweetened take on the lead character. Blomkvist is transformed into a ""pretty faced"" young man incapable of being father to the older religious daughter who showed him the significance of the Bible verse clues in TGWTDTN. Plague is suddenly psychologically capable of and set up with sci-fi tech capable of directing a hacker-turned-sniper to perfectly eliminate everyone inside a house. If her guardian was still in the picture, he'd could be a bionic cyborg given the license taken with the original characters.But it doesn't stop there. Except for parts where plot demands it, Lisbeth is possessed by such abilities as to be prescient, from her trick with sharing the domestic abuser with a sculpture (how did she know where he would be standing), to the trick with knowing where to place the phone and club for Needham, to knowing exactly where and when he would need to use the club, to striding through a house, encountering an armed assailant about to kill her and not even pausing due to the off-chance Newham would be implausibly aiming through walls at THAT guy at THAT time... Just too many contrived coincidences masquerading as planning and ability finally chip away too much of the aesthetic distance needed to buy into an already thin premise populated by unrecognizable people, right up to the point that the only reason the villain doesn't succeed is because of the virtually impossible coincidence of her primary henchman BLINDLY stumbling through a forest on a fully broken leg to suddenly emerge on a road at exactly the moment she is being driven past, and somehow the driver didn't see him despite perfect visibility.I wanted to enjoy this continuation of a favorite character, but it just felt too much like a committee-baked cash grab which would've done better as an offshoot of the world of John Wick than a literary maiming of Stieg's baby.",The Girl in the Spider's Web

It's not like you were taking a boring book and tried to spice it up- you took an intense thriller that I couldn't put down and turned it into a movie I almost walked out of at the halfway point.Examples:Needham went from a middle aged, pot belly, scruffy computer nerd that saw Salander's hack as a defeat to him personally. He didn't care as much about the content as the act itself. Now he has turned into a special forces sniper than can also hack and wants control of the nuclear code program???August went from a mute savant that broke the case with his drawings and math to a kid that can speak and happens to know the password???The technology in question went from cutting edge AI that makes you think about how far we should push quantum computing to a 1980's Van Dame style nuclear code key??? So cheesy and dated. Gross.This movie took a book from my favorite series and gutted it.

I couldn't stay silent and not to say that this movie is feminist propaganda from my side. It portrays men as violent persons, while women are fighting this, while they are actually equally violent towards each other..
to conclude - personal traumas are okay while they stay personal",The Girl in the Spider's Web
452,kevintibbetts-16833,Much better than expected,9,28 November 2018,If you liked the girl with the dragon tattoo books you will like this. You are gripped throughout. James Bond type excitement. Enjoy the ride.,The Girl in the Spider's Web
453,evahoubrechts,Inconsistent with the book,2,23 January 2019,I'm very disappointed as it is not at all like the plot in the book.,The Girl in the Spider's Web
454,jensong-14341,Great plot and twist..lots of mystery,9,29 January 2019,"I disagree with the other reviewers who are basing their biased ""critique"" on previous sequels. Come on... move on and this is a great one. I enjoyed the plot..it is NOT BORING, fast paced, it GOT MYSTERIES and suspense as well. The story shows a hacker though advanced in hacking.. still the film gave her weaknesses and came out victor in the end. More so it gives the viewer false impression of what might be the outcome.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
455,fsegura-44353,Amazing movie.,10,7 February 2019,"I loved the storyline, action and drama. Nothing better then a hacker with assassin skills that rides a motorcycle. For me this was an awesome watch.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
456,tumbleweedtoledo,Wow...was anything in this movie based on the book by Lagercrantz?!!,5,7 February 2019,"First of all I wanted to like is movie. I like Claire Foy and I think she's very talented. However there are some fundamental reasons why this movie lost me. I've read every book each Lisbeth Salander movie is based on, seen the original Millenium series, as well the Hollywood version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Each of these movies I liked...yes they somewhat deviated from the books, but you could still see a correlation. In the Spider Web movie there was very little similarity to the book from the beginning to the ending...all of the characters were wrongly portrayed. If want to change he storyline at least give the characters some background! Besides, The book's storyline is very good so why deviate from something that works? Maybe the producers didn't want to pay rights to the original story? Not my problem! I can't see how they could even do a sequel because the movie changed so much of the original storyline. Furthermore Larsson and Lagercrantz spent a lot of time and detail painting Lisbeth as a warrior badass who doesnt really need help from anyone and who is always ten steps ahead of any of her enemies. The Spider movie made Lisbeth seem weak and always needing to get bailed out for some reason or another. Come on, seriously?!!! Doesn't this really kill the spirit of Lisbeth Salander's character?!! Shame on those responsible!!! This movie will definitely be forgettable for me!!",The Girl in the Spider's Web
457,missvicki-09038,The original cast and story was so much better,1,24 February 2019,"They should never let someone else write another's book series. Larsson was fantastic, I read them all. Would I read the new ones, hell no. The new movie is slow, boring and does not stick with the same story. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.",The Girl in the Spider's Web
