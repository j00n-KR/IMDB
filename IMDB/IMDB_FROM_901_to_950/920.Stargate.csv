0,bkoganbing,A Revolution In Another Part Of The Galaxy,10,26 October 2009,"Taking a leaf from Indiana Jones where someone will one day presumably dig up the Ark Of The Covenant out of storage and see how it works, in the inscrutable ways of the Washington bureaucracy, somebody in the Defense Department has taken an interest in something called Stargate and now want to see how it works. The somebody they sent for is archaeologist/linguist James Spader who deciphers some ancient Egyptian writing and poof, the gate is upright and operational.At that point the military takes over led by a hardnosed professional played by Kurt Russell. He's going through that gate with a team of special forces and with James Spader presumably so they can communicate with whatever life is out there.Stargate is a teleportation device and the team travels through time and space and ends up across the galaxy on a primitive planet where the people worship a being called Ra played by Jaye Davidson. He and his much technologically advanced confederates enslave the rest of the population.To see the changes the earth expedition makes and what the connection of this being to the Egyptian sun god Ra you will have to see this very well made and exciting science fiction film, one of the best films made during the Nineties. I saw it in theater when it first came out and seeing it again on the small screen still excites and entertains me. It's one of those films that with repeated viewing you get still another perspective.I liked best the interplay with Kurt Russell and James Spader. Two very opposite men in temperament and in training over the course of the film gradually gain a great respect for each other. Both deliver performances that would rank in the top five for both these players.One of the ways that Ra keeps his people subjugated is the forbidding of any of the nomadic types that are under his thumb to learn to write or even create a written language. In that culture and in every culture, literacy is the strongest weapon against tyranny. In fact one of the characters makes quite a sacrifice to secure the permanence of the revolution they've wrought on this world in another part of the galaxy that has a strange connection to our Earth. Stargate succeeds at being both thinking person's science fiction and also has enough action and adventure to keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the second half. It's not to be missed when broadcast, ever.",Stargate
1,Leofwine_draca,Fairly typical,5,14 December 2012,"STARGATE should be the perfect movie for me: an interesting premise, grounded in real-life theory (I've been reading Graham Hancock's FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS recently, and am familiar with Von Daniken's writings) and made with a high enough budget to do the special effects justice.And watching it, it's hard to fault the production. The performances are pretty good, from Kurt Russell's hard-ass soldier to James Spader's nerdy Egyptologist, and the aforementioned SFX are decent. It's just that the film ends up feeling relatively mundane given the extensive set-up; it all turns into an entirely typical good guys vs. the bad guys type film, with little of the intelligence or thought-provoking questions I was hoping for.I'll lay the blame squarely at the door of Roland Emmerich, who has quite the habit of dumbing down his source material (INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, need I go on?). Imagine if this had been made by somebody with more interest in the questions raised instead of the size of the guns!",Stargate
2,SnoopyStyle,fun sci-fi with a bit of camp,8,20 February 2015,"It's 1928 in Giza, Egypt. An archaeological dig unearths the Stargate. In the present, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an ancient Egypt expert but his theory is dismissed by everybody. Catherine Langford offers him an opportunity to prove his work. He is brought to an underground base in Creek Mountain, Colorado. Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) is the new military commander of the mission. He is suicidal after his son accidentally shots himself and is the perfect man for the job. Daniel assures them that he can dial a return and Jack leads a team to explore the world at the other side of the universe. It is a world ruled by the mercurial dictator Ra (Jaye Davidson).There are a lot of little problems with this movie. There are little logic problems all over the place. However the basic concept of the movie is so cool. James Spader is terrific as the odd science guy. He has his weird Spaderness and is actually slightly funny. Roland Emmerich overcomes any little hiccups with a rip roaring sci-fi that's a little bit campy. Jaye Davidson only adds to that campiness. The CGI and the action needs a little work. The battles could be better but the design is all there. It's simply a fun sci-fi.",Stargate
3,claudio_carvalho,"Almost Twenty Years Later and after Watching at Least Six Times, the Timeless ""Stargate"" is still a Fantastic Sci-Fi",9,21 September 2013,"In 1928, in Egypt, a strange device is found by an expedition. In the present days, the outcast linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is invited by a mysterious woman to decipher an ancient hieroglyph in a military facility. Soon he finds that the device was developed by an advanced civilization and opens a portal to teletransport to another planet. Dr. Jackson is invited to join a military team under the command of Colonel Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that will explore the new world. They find a land that recalls Egypt and humans in a primitive culture that worship and are slaves to Ra, the God of the Sun. But soon they discover the secret of the mysterious ""stargate"". ""Stargate"" is still a fantastic sci-fi after almost twenty years and watching it at least six times. The story is intriguing and entwines action with humor and romance. The cast is excellent, with Kurt Russell and James Spade in the top of their careers. The special effects are still great after almost twenty years. And the haunting music score completes this timeless classic sci-fi with a touch of class. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Stargate - A Chave para o Futuro da Humanidade"" (""Stargate – The Key for the Future of Mankind"")Note: On 18 May 2017, I saw this film again.",Stargate
4,classicsoncall,"""I created your civilization. Now I will destroy it.""",7,14 May 2021,"This film plays like a blend of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and if they hadn't come along after this picture, I would include the Brendan Fraser/Tom Cruise 'Mummy' films as well. Consequently, I didn't sense a whole lot of originality or creativity in the story, with it's principal characters going up against an evil ruler on a distant planet that had all the trappings of ancient Egypt. The monarch encountered by crossing through the Stargate even had the name of the Egyptian sun god Ra, and his acolytes went by Horus and Anubis, the idea being I presume, that the corresponding characters of Earth's past history were derived from some connection to this alien world. Ra has subjugated his people to an existence resembling slavery, and once they get the lay of the land, Colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) and civilian Daniel Jackson (James Spader) take the lead in fomenting a revolt and freeing the masses from their bondage. Oddly, Ra has fashioned a rather modern appearing bomb with the explosive power of a hundred nuclear weapons he intends to send through the Stargate portal to destroy Earth. Thinking about that, you have to wonder what his motivation might have been, seeing as Earth was on the opposite side of the galaxy. But it's called science fiction for a reason, and sometimes the reason doesn't have to make sense. Visually, the film has some interesting special effects and colorful cinematography, but it's not enough to bolster a mediocre story.",Stargate
5,gavin6942,Illegitimate Child of Indiana Jones?,7,26 February 2006,"Stargate is a science fiction film starring James Spader as a cunning linguist and Kurt Russell as a military action hero with the worst haircut imaginable. After the government has Spader decipher an ancient Egyptian writing, they are able to open a portal which leads to the great unknown. This unknown turns out to be another planet millions of light years away, which mysteriously looks exactly like Egypt.As far as science fiction goes, this one is pretty entertaining. It's not technical enough to scare off the casual viewer, but is original enough to attract even the most reserved of science fiction purists. Are there flaws or plot holes? Of course. Most movies have these things. But you won't find them unless you're looking for them. And besides, where else will you get to see James Spader looking like the kid from those 1980s Encyclopedia Britannica commercials but getting a woman no geek deserves. You know the commercial I mean, where the kid has a report due on space? If you're a conspiracy theorist or believe in aliens as the creators of the pyramids, you're a complete nutcase. But also, this might be the film for you. Because they get to explain the connection between aliens, Egypt and the dawn of civilization. Those plot holes I mentioned above? Your love of conspiracies will help fill those in.But seriously, overall this film had a great plot, good acting, and moved at a respectable pace to keep you in the flow. Unless you have some serious aversion to science fiction or Kurt Russell, you won't have a problem watching this film. Recommended.",Stargate
6,lee_eisenberg,"Roland Emmerich made something so cool here, so why did he betray us with ""Independence Day""?!",7,15 August 2005,"""Stargate"" is unlike anything that you've ever seen.

Let me tell you, what they find is more than anyone would expect, especially given that the ""Crying Game"" guy is there.Considering that ""Stargate"" is so interesting, it begs the question: why did Roland Emmerich follow it up with ""Independence Day""?

7,jboothmillard,Stargate,7,21 September 2005,"I remember seeing this as a kid, and I knew I had to see it again because I could not remember any of it, including the fact that it is from director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow). Basically Egyptologist (translator of the language and hieroglyphics) Dr. Daniel Jackson (Secretary's James Spader) is brought to an underground military base to decode symbols on an Egyptian cover. He decodes them as star constellations, and they are able to activate the alien device known as the Stargate, and lead by Air Force Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) and Jackson, a team go through the gate, travelling across the known universe to a distant planet. At first it seems like just a deserted desert area with this little temple housing the gate, but soon enough they come across the near culture. For a while they seem to get on well with this civilisation, and Daniel learns to talk their Egyptian language more properly, but this friendship is threatened by the villain who has banned writing and drawing, so the people cannot find out that he is pretending to be the Egyptian sun god Ra (The Crying Game's Jaye Davidson, in his second and last film before returning to his original job as a fashion designer in London). Daniel wasn't aware that O'Neil had brought a nuclear weapon to this world, with orders to destroy the gate when their mission was complete, and unfortunately Ra has plans to destroy their Earth. In the end, everyone stands up for themselves, the bomb is recovered, and they blow Ra with it, and everyone goes home except Daniel, who is happy staying with his love interest Sha'uri (Mili Avital). Also starring Viveca Lindfors as Catherine, Alexis Cruz as Skaara, Leon Rippy as General W.O. West, John Diehl as Lieutenant Kawalsky, Carlos Lauchu as Anubis, Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Horus and The Mummy's Erick Avari as Kasuf. The special effects are impressive, the depiction of travelling through the gate and being hurtled across the universe at the speed of light is one of these great achievements. The film also has a good plot, good characters, it is just a fun and enjoyable adventure. Very good!",Stargate
8,Tweekums,A quality sci-fi film that launched a franchise,8,5 April 2017,"In 1928 archaeologists in Egypt discover a circular device and an accompanying cover-stone; cutting to the present Dr Daniel Jackson, an Egyptologist with some radical views, finds himself invited to work on a secret project run by the US Air Force; they want him to translate the symbols on the cover stone. At first he can't identify some of the key symbols but then he realises they represent the constellations and together they point to a location the other side of the universe. At this point he is shown the device the 'star gate'. Programming the symbols in activates the device and opens a gateway between it and a second star gate on a distant planet. A team, led by US Air Force Colonel Jack O'Neil is to be sent to explore, Jackson will accompany them to program the other gate to bring them home.Once there they learn that they are no symbols for them to copy into the device; they will have to find them if they are ever to see Earth again. Soon they discover a primitive society, not dissimilar to ancient Egypt. Here they gradually learn the truth about the star gate and things that happened in Egypt millennia ago. An alien being with godlike powers arrived seeking immortality; he took over the body of a young man and took slaves from Earth to work for him before a slave revolt in Egypt shut off his access to Earth until now. When Ra turns up he is far from happy and attacks the people; the small group of troops and Daniel will end up leading a revolt that will save not only the local population but also that of Earth.It shouldn't be a surprise that this film is pretty good given that it led to a successful TV series and various spin offs. The general idea of what is going on is quickly established and little time is wasted before translation difficulties are solved and the team are on the distant planet. This world is interesting without being obviously alien; apart from a creature the only living beings we see are human. I liked the fact that it took a while before they could understand the local; trying to understand each other with gestures seemed more real yet having Daniel eventually realise how their language was related to one he knew meant they could communicate when it was essential. Similarly I liked how the science fiction was combined with ancient Egyptian mythology. The cast do a fine job, most notably James Spader as Dr Jackson and Kurt Russell as Col. O'Neil. There is a decent amount of action although it isn't too violent even so I was a little surprised to see a severed head in a (UK) PG rated film. The effects are pretty good; especially the armour worn by Ra's troops and the Star Gate itself. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of action sci-fi who want a film that is suitable for all but very young viewers.",Stargate

10,Quinoa1984,Emmerich in a space-desert and it's... OK!,6,25 June 2016,"It's interesting to come to Stargate about 22 years after it first came out without having seen it before; I didn't have the nostalgia for it that people I know have or had (my wife at one point in her very young life called it her favorite film), and it also comes after seeing everything else that Roland Emmerich (with occasional collaborator Dean Devlin) put out since. The impression that I get from it is that it's clear why it got so many sequels and spin-offs and TV series and books and so on. The premise - and in fact the first half hour of the movie - is terrific and stimulating for a science fiction fan: what if you could get a gateway to other worlds? What would you go to to find? The set-up gives us James Spader as a nerdy scientist (a less overbearing version of what was presented with Matthew Broderick in Godzilla years later) who is plucked from semi-obscurity/mockery as someone who believes the pyramids may not have been made by the figures history has taught us. He's selected to look at some hieroglyphics and... something else - there's a series of stars that makes up a constellation that maps out how we're at an origin point to go into other dimensions. And as it turns out the very device is in the possession of some, uh, government types I suppose, and with the leadership of military man Kurt Russell a team is dispatched to check out what is beyond the Stargate.I was on board with this idea, if only on the basis of 'hey, what can we explore and use as data and so on'. What the characters find is... a lot of clichés and hokum, a desert world that is equal parts Return of the Jedi Endor and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome with Egyptian 'natives' and then other assorted Star Wars and other ""homages"" (or plain rip-offs) from other movies, not least of which Lawrence of Arabia and Indiana Jones and so on. This may be all on me though, since this is me as an adult coming to this and having years of knowledge of cinema history... on the other hand, large chunks of this movie are dumb. There's no other way to phrase it except moments show characters and situations with stupid things, though they're still ""stupid-movie"" things, if that makes sense.So there's some wasted opportunity for something, I won't say 'unique' as far be it from me to expect that from Emmerich, but less expected and hokey. But the story moves at a great pace, despite its wacked and dopey moving parts, and Spader and Russell ground it as two characters you can care about in a sea of people who are walking-talking tropes and types (oh, there's also the element of Aliens with it being a military group dispatched to check out this alien land and the violence they come up against), and things like culture-clash and language/communication barriers and villains with amazing Egyptian masks and sets and all sorts of things.Stargate has parts that work really well in a sea of things that flat-out don't. It may be perspective considering what else Emmerich would do with himself in the intervening years of Hollywood, but there's at least a, shall one say, 'restraint' with what he puts out here, at least when it comes to cheesy Hollywood sci-fi. I won't say it's very good, but it's also not terrible either.",Stargate
11,BandSAboutMovies,Fun science fiction,7,14 March 2019,"Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich were the dynamic duo of the 1990's, between blockbusters like Universal Soldier, Godzilla and Independence Day. They always envisioned Stargate as being part one of a trilogy, but the other two films have never been made. It's a total popcorn film, unafraid of its own silliness, a movie that Roger Ebert selected as one of his least favorite movies of all time.Daniel Jackson (James Spader playing a good guy, which is way out of character) is a linguist and Egyptologist who is invited by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors, A Bell from Hell, Creepshow) to help translate the Giza cover stones that her father found in 1928. Soon, he's taken to an Air Force base where Special Operations Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell!) oversees the project.Daniel is able to translate the hieroglyphs in no time at all, showing how they're really coordinates for a stargate. They use his translations to open the gate, which creates a gateway to Abydos, a planet across the galaxy where Ra (Jaye Davison from The Crying Game) and his soldiers rule a human-like race of people. Ra has enslaved these humans, forcing them to mine resources for him.Meanwhile, the army troops that have passed through the gate meet up with a tribe led by Kasuf, who presents Daniel with the gift of his daughter Sha'uri. The commander becomes friends with Skaara, as he reminds him of his son who accidentally shot himself with the soldier's service weapon. Soon, they come into conflict with Ra, who has set himself up as a god, and his soldiers like Anubis and Horus (a very early role for Djimon Hounsou). Of course, goodness wins out and the humans - other than Spader - all return home.Alexis Cruz (Skaara) and Erick Avari (Kasuf) would go on to reprise their roles in the TV series, Stargate SG-1. If you have Comet TV, there are all manner of Stargate spin-offs to watch, like Stargate Universe and Stargate Atlantis.Stargate is one of those big dumb 90's movies they just don't make these days. It's packed with effects, costumes and huge crowds of people (and some mannequins, which were cheaper than extras). None of it really makes any sense, but it has plenty of explosions and fight scenes, which is all you really need.",Stargate
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Oh, the chicken man.",7,12 March 2009,"When scientists and historians finally figure out the meaning of an ancient Egyptian artifact, it opens a portal to another planet.Stargate was panned by the critics on its release, no A list stars they cried, a plot line that bore a resemblance to a 1970 film called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, and apparently caught between being an adult picture and a child friendly blockbuster. Those critics were forced to eat their words as Stargate promptly went on to be a monster smash, making $196,567,262 worldwide, and spawning a hugely popular TV series. It is for sure a no brain popcorn piece, suspension of disbelief should be at the forefront of any prospective first time viewer, but it's great fun and snazzy in all its set piece work.Led by square jawed Kurt Russell as an on the edge Colonel, our band of merry men adventurers face peril in their new world via the weather, language barriers with the locals, oh and something a touch more sinister!. James Spader does an impressive turn as a geeky Egyptologist, on who's fate the groups survival may well rest, while Jaye Davidson serves a reminder that yes, he did act in movies many years ago. It's cliché ridden, and most of it is hacked together from far better pictures in the genres that Stargate wants to emulate, but it's damn entertaining and looks fabulous in High Definition. 7/10",Stargate
13,Theo Robertson,Old Fashioned ?,7,21 September 2004,"I first saw STARGATE about seven years ago and left with memories of thinking that it was in some way an old fashioned movie . I couldn't put my finger on why I thought this was an old fashioned movie but after seeing it again tonight I can perhaps explain it better now STARGATE isn't so much as "" old fashioned "" , it's just got a rather old type of plot that's versatile . It's almost like a Tarzan movie from the 1940s where a bunch of good white guys ( In movies in those days bad guys were usually white - The good guys were always white ) team up with the king of the jungle in order to fight a bunch of evil slave traders . The story could easily be reworked with a bunch of 18th century good guys led by Errol Flynn getting shipwrecked on an island where they meet noble natives and defend them from evil pirates . Rewatching this movie again after a gap of several years I often forgot that I was watching a far fetched SF blockbuster and thought I was watching a historical drama , something that's not to be taken as a criticism . I also became aware of subtle plot points that I'd missed on first viewing . For example I thought the death of O'Neil's son was so underdeveloped that it was totally unnecessary to include this in the movie but there's a couple of scenes where it is important to the plot later on . I also knew that the movie wasn't going to be an ALIENS type of movie , something the original trailers confused me about . let's face it , a special forces team creeping about a dark pyramid . It's got be similar in tone to ALIENS . If that's what you think STARGATE is going to be about you'll be as disappointed as I was first time I saw itOf the cast Kurt Russell and his special forces group are slightly wooden but I won't criticise the cast since these type of characters always lack flair in these genre movies . James Spader is slightly unconvincing as hero Dan Jackson due to wimpish nature and effette hairstyle ( Was Jackson conceived as a female character ? ) but Jaye Davidson is absolutely superb as Ra . This is the same Jaye Davidson from THE CRYING GAME and I was totally shocked to find this was the second and last feature film he appeared in . According to the trivia section of STARGATE it appears he's difficult to work with but someone cast him in more movies pleaseAs for the Roland Emmerich / Dean Devlin partnership there are a few faults . One is the opening of the script that contains no hook and fools the audience into thinking they'll be watching a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK type movie which they won't be . The script also contains a few unlikely plot holes such as the special forces team taking some GPS equipment with them something that wouldn't work on a planet where humanity had never been , and also discovering in an unlikely scenario that they won't be able to return to Earth thanks to Jackson . There is a very interesting point to the subtext however and that is that if there is a god it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be benign or good . Food for thought . Thankfully Emmerich doesn't go overboard on the CGI while he also had the good sense ( Say it again ) to cast Jaye Davidson as RaBy no means a classic SF movie STARGATE is solid entertainment and is rather more enjoyable on second viewing",Stargate
14,LeonLouisRicci,Ancient Astronaut Theorists and Fans are Still Waiting,6,10 November 2012,"The Ancient Astronaut thesis definitively started in the late 60's with Erich Von Daniken, was matured and intellectualized by Zecharia Sitchin starting in 1976, and is here today in a plethora of TV shows, documentaries and extensions of previous works. It is a fascinating and totally believable subject that has limited, if any big screen incarnations. Thus speaks Stargate.The movie starts off great with the whole thing collapsing under its own weight of misunderstanding the concept and turning it into a good looking but incredibly inept military exercise with dull action scenes and unbelievably uninteresting cultural exchanges.The Alien look is outstanding as are the sets, but it shamelessly uses a deep concept and ridicules its insights. It has no taste for the intellect and the cartoonish presentation of the Marines is clichéd and dated. There is still a great movie to be made with this subject matter and if it is handled in a respectful manner it could be the biggest brainy blockbuster of all time. Ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey (which had undertones of the theme) fans of the Ancient Astronaut theory have been waiting and one hopes that Hollywood is listening.",Stargate
15,poolandrews,Decent sci-fi adventure film.,6,23 May 2008,"Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) & given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet & investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long & has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich & producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth & formed our society & Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids & human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough & it's a very watchable & overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times & I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd & predictable. The character's are alright & it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster & would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) & The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work & on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he & Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film & it show's with a real sense of scope & scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel & the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited & it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California & Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold & detached performance & only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand & I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons & two hundred & thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now & the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season.",Stargate
16,lastliberal,Djimon Hounsou Film Festival #1,7,25 March 2007,"I was immediately reminded of Chariots of the Gods, a book written in 1968 by Erich von Däniken, when I sat down to watch this film. It is centered on the theory that many ancient civilizations' technologies and religion were given to them by space travelers who were welcomed as gods.I have seen Stargate several times and I find it to be an interesting concept for a film and thoroughly enjoyable. The cast included Kurt Russell as a typical military type, and James Spader as the Egyptologist that solves the puzzle. The special effects contribute greatly to the film and are not overdone.This is the one that started two TV shows and worth a look.",Stargate
17,Boba_Fett1138,Greatly made movie!,8,14 January 2008,"This is the sort of movie that shouldn't had really worked out but yet it did. Everything about this movie screams B-movie. Just look at the title, read the script, see the characters, the cast, etcetera. Yet ""Stargate"" works out tremendously fine as great and above all fine entertainment. It's for most part due to the fine directing skills of Roland Emmerich, show really knows to uplifts this movie and its story. This movie also really marked the big breakthrough for Roland Emmerich. Yes, it's true that his real breakthrough movie was ""Moon 44"" and even though that movie was by no means a great one, it still showed that the director had lots of potential and took the maximum out of the movie. So, ""Moon 44"" got him Hollywood's attention but with ""Stargate"" he for the first time really proofs that he can handle a multi-million dollar production as well and successfully, since ""Universal Soldier"" was only a successful movie in certain circles. If it weren't for ""Stargate"", then now way we would had had movies such as ""Independence Day"", ""The Patriot"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Some people wouldn't had minded that by the way.Even though the story itself is not that much special, it still has a great and original as well as an intriguing concept, that somehow knows to connect an alien world to ancient Egypt and their Gods. It's a great science-fiction story without ever really getting too 'science-fiction' like. It's uses lots of great and imaginative elements.Once you start really thinking about it, there isn't an awful lot happening in this movie, mostly action wise. Yet it's a very entertaining movie to watch, which is due to the fact that it's made with lots of pace and because of it's greatly and perfectly adventurous concept of traveling to a far off planet. It's a movie that never bores and is a perfectly fun one to watch actually. The movie gets also really uplifted by its David Arnold musical score.The movie is fair enough looking. For 1994 standards the special effects are good, especially for the masks worn by the 'Gods'. But because the movie is for most part set in a dessert like environment it's not really one that jumps out in its looks and actually also really doesn't looks and feels like a multi-million dollar production, even though it is. The movie actually looks and feels more cheap, which is also one of the reasons why this movie has already become a sort of a cult-classic.The movie is greatly cast with James Spader and Kurt Russell in the lead roles. But man, did James Spader look still so much different and younger back then. He's just not the kind of person that aged well. He went from a boyish look in 1994 to an old dirty wrinkly man look now days, even though he'll turn only just 48 next month. Also greatly cast was Jaye Davidson as Ra. He's a true memorable villain and it makes you realize what a great shame it is that Jaye Davidson has never acted in many movies, simply just because he never really enjoyed acting much, despite having also received an Oscar nomination for his debut role in ""The Crying Game"".Truly a recommendable science-fiction classic from the '90's.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Stargate

Yes. It's going to have a lead who's a dorky, socially awkward, extremely smart yet ignored scientist of some field that will relate to the plot, which will be something big, requiring a lot of costumed extras and loud special effects, and be set or deal with something fantastic that isn't that closely linked to reality. Seriously though, for using the same basic formula, his flicks tend to be fun and enjoyable escapism. Plus, this marks the possibly unique occasion of James Spader not(!) playing the role of a sexual deviant in the movie he's in. I guess he wanted to branch out. Russell, as expected, nails his part as the hardened military man who does have a heart, and in general the acting is great. The story is interesting enough, and it develops fine throughout. Pacing is good, and this does notably not overwhelm or overstimulate the audience, in spite of presenting a world that we can't directly relate to. Stephen Sommers, are you paying attention? The FX are excellent. This is exciting, entertaining and cool. The action is awesome and not excessive. As for music, this uses a broad, sweeping score, and that works well. The humor is reasonable, the jokes and gags are hit and miss. There is infrequent mild to moderately strong language and a little violence and one or two hints towards sexuality in this.

There is much scientific mumbo-jumbo, a hardline military man who is going through a crisis of conscience, a faction of the enslaved peoples who take to the idea of a resistance movement, a romance between the scientist and one of the slave-y people, connections discovered with ancient Egypt (well, duh) and so on.It never takes itself seriously with the possible exception of Kurt Russell's damaged military man, and his hard performance is no bad thing.

This one does just that, I feel the movie also ended in a way to satisfy me so I never really had the urge to watch the shows. This one has a strange artifact found and brought to a place where it is discovered to have the power of teleportation. Well they determine that they can send some people using this device so they get a soldier who is seemingly very depressed and a guy who is good at decoding things and is kind of a intellectual type along with other army type guys and send them on to the other side. Well what they first discover is a desert type environment, really not much different than what we would have here on earth. Well they soon discover a group of people who seemingly are afraid of them and at the same time revere them. Soon the soldiers and guy find out why as this strange flying pyramid appears and within it a strange being that has been using these people as slaves and once did the same thing on earth as well.

Having seen it I had my doubts about starting the series. The flick doesn't blow me away. The effects were good and no that much of CGI was used but it was the story itself that wasn't my cup of tea.It starts rather good going back to 8000 years before Christ to see some kind of space ship landing on earth. Flash forward to early 1920's to see the discovery in Egypt of some weird objects. Flash forward to nowadays were Dr. Daniel Jackson(James Spader) is brought in into the army to help solving a two year problem, what are the symbols standing on the objects found in Egypt, in comes Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell with a weird haircut) to solve the problem once they see that the object is some kind of Stargate. Off they go into the stargate to another galaxy and from here things go wrong for me. Here we move away from a science-fiction to a story were the white people are the superiors of the black coloured. They need the whites to help them against the Egyptian looking aliens with a god called Ra. Anyone. In comes also a bit of a love story with Dr. Jackosn. Even when the aliens attack it's a bit low on everything. It's a bit of how humanity started and what went wrong with a lot of blah blah and no action. Still, for some it's a classic that spawned a new flick Children Of The Gods (1997) with a whole new cast which leads to the series for ten years long.As I said, the effects were rather good and luckily the monsters and original alien were not done in CGI but there are better SF's out from that era.

27,lasttimeisaw,a thinly veiled propaganda piece of colonialism,5,30 March 2018,"Having laid the foundation of a nexus of television spin-offs thenceforward (persisting two and a half decades and ongoing, with a possible reboot in gestation), Roland Emmerich's filmic progenitor is de facto less a hardcore Sci-Fi adventure than a thinly veiled propaganda piece of colonialism, which nominally transports a contingent of earthlings (all American soldiers bar one scientist) into a terra incognita through a wormhole generated by Stargate, a mysterious instrument disinterred in Egypt. A classic pair of brain and brawn, Daniel Jackson (Spader, when he is personable to a fault), an Egyptologist and Colonel Jack O'Neil (Russell, sporting a neat crew-cut) takes the leads, what they discover is a desert planet inhabited by Ancient Egyptians, enslaved by Ra, the God of Sun (an epicene Jay Davidson in his second and last film role before retiring from the showbiz altogether), a big question mark should be alerted for the ethnic semblance here, which can be readily construed as a crass fable boasting USA's heroic inference of a less developed nation here on earth, liberating its downtrodden people and debunking the truth of their God (or any totalitarian figure), tellingly, the film's atheist and scientific stance looks promising, but soon a sweeping whiff of smugness and self-congratulation will swamp everything and tenacious to dissipate. As it turns out, the real identity of the so-called Ra, is an alien hosting a human body (thousands of years before he hijacked early humans to this remote planet and started his draconian rule), and what he presides over is a pretty tinpot reign (in spite of his stately pyramid-shaped spaceship), not only is he doomed to be vanquished by a team of earthlings in the end (yes, O'Neil follows the order, and surreptitiously brings a portable nuclear bomb on board in case of contingency, this is very American), but also he is clearly in short measure of both materiel and personnel in the first place (a dozen underlings and three laser-shooting aircrafts, that is all), not to mention the sole victim subjected to his seemingly almighty puissance is after all, one of his own incompetent guard.Among the extraterrestrial hoi polloi, due focal points are projected to a rebellious youngster Skaara (Cruz) and a beauteous Sha'uri (Avital), who is bequeathed as a wife to Jackson by her father Kasuf (Avari), the leader of the tribe, whose awakening-to-rising route is a well-trodden but insipidly crafted one. If one must single out an asset from the entire enterprise, it could only be the set-up of the titular Stargate, an abstruse device can literally open portals to every nook and cranny of our cosmic universe (depending on which group of coordinates one employs), however, Emmerich is not a Sci-Fi polymath but a workmanlike skin-scratcher, so the end result is proximate to anyone's skeptic forecast.",Stargate

It has a solid story, well-developed characters, and a good sci-fi setting. This is one of the early films of Roland Emmerich who directed such hits like Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow. We see his flair for action and explosive special effects here. I liked this movie because this is one of those films which doesn't require thinking with a overly-complicated plot because all this film does is entertain and it clearly shows that.Emmerich's film is about this device named Stargate which creates a wormhole through worlds. Linguist Daniel Jackson and Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neill travel through this device to a world resembling Ancient Egypt where they fight the forces of Ra so they can go home and free the civilization from slavery.This film doesn't require strong acting but in my opinion, it does have strong acting. Kurt Russell maintains his on screen presence with his tough persona. James Spader does a good job as Daniel Jackson who is interested in learning about new culture. Jaye Davidson as Ra is very good and menacing as Ra.Overall, Stargate is a great, action-packed escapist film. It reminds me of films of old and all this does is offer a good time at the movies. Obviously, it's not the greatest movie ever but it doesn't have to be. I really liked this film and the premise of it. I was entertained and this features Emmerich at this best.

30,inkblot11,"Few outer space flicks deserve the phrase ""out of this world""; this one does!",9,17 May 2010,"Bumbling, allergy-sneezing, penniless Egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) suddenly gets a nice job offer. This is good news, since his last lecture was a failure, due to his controversial theories about ancient civilization. Presenting the position is Catherine (Viveca Lindfors), who curiously works for the United States Air Force. At a secret enclave in Colorado, Dr. Daniel discovers an Egyptian artifact he never knew existed. It is, as he translates it from the inscriptions, a ""stargate"", an opening into another part of the universe. The huge spiral has other codes which no one can break. Until now, for Dr. Jackson knows his stuff. With his help, the gate suddenly appears, in a flash of brilliance. A mechanical probe, sent in to take readings, brings back the information that it has entered another planet, very similar to earth, galaxies away. Therefore, a manned operation is planned. Along with Dr. Daniel, the troupe of players will consist mainly of military personnel, headed by Colonel Jack (Kurt Russell). With grit and fortitude, they cross through the gate. Once over, they find pyramids, like those in Egypt, which confirm Dr. Daniel's belief that the huge buildings were not built by the ancient Egyptians. But, they also make two other startling discoveries. Firstly, there is a primitive culture of humans, similar to nomadic Arabic tribes, at work in the mines of the planet. Are they indeed from earth? Secondly, the mineral in question is needed by the ruler of the planet, who arrives in his elaborate spaceship from time to time. He is Ra (Jaye Davidson), the sun god of the Egyptians, who has used the ore as a rejuvenation tool for over 10,000 years. It works very well, as he still appears as a young man, very handsome and lithe. In fact, he was once the last member of a dying alien race who searched the universe for a new body. He found one, one of a young male, in ancient Egypt and took it over. With his help, the great civilization on the Nile appeared and the stargate was established between the planets, Ra's home and earth. Whew. However, problems arose and Ra buried the stargate and fled. Now, he is terribly distressed that modern humans have arrived to upset the apple cart. The American military versus a sun god, just who will win? And, can the Yankees make it back home? This a grand movie that truly deserves the phrase ""out of this world"". Before it spawned a television series, Stargate was this brilliant film, with a tremendous scope, settings, costumes, musical score, ideas, cast, and visual effects. Its fusion of Egyptology and intergalactic travel is truly awe-inspiring and has to be viewed to be appreciated. That said, the cast is also very fine, with Spader, Russell, Lindfors, Mili Avatel, French Stewart, and especially Davidson doing great work. A star of the much-lauded movie The Crying Game, Davidson was also magnificent here as the imperial Ra, even though he has no English dialogue. Just where did this talented actor go?

31,ironhorse_iv,Open the floodgates. I won't be in denial. Stargate is an enjoyable guilty pleasure of mine.,7,25 September 2020,"With a mostly capable cast, beautiful music from David Arnold, still pretty good dated visual & special effects and excellent costume & set production design, the movie directed by Roland Emmerich tells the story of a group of recon soldiers led by Colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) with the help of unorthodox Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) trying to find their way home after going through an ancient wormhole that leads them to a desert-like mining planet run by the ruthless alien Ra (Jaye Davidson). Without spoiling the flick too much, while Spader detest the script for its large amount of excessive use clichés like force stock romance, convenient amount of timing before a bomb go off and others. The film was just so darn entertaining. I would love to see more 'Ancient Aliens' movies. This unique sci fi genre that blew Giorgio A. Tsoukalos's mind rarely get explored. Regardless, do take the concept with a grain of sand. There's no need to deciphered hieroglyphs here. So, don't get your academic historian's panties in a bunch even if the film kinda insulted fame Egyptologists E.A Wallis Budge and Howard Vyse by calling them frauds. The ideas of this flick are clearly not to taken serious as legit history lesson. After all, this movie also takes great artistic liberties when it comes to science and math. Things like constellations being used for coordinates markers for a transportation system for thousands of years, really couldn't exist in real life. Stars are always on the move and not points in space. To add onto that, the constellations would look different from every planet with a gate. It wouldn't match. Then there is the 3D space problem. Even if you carefully have all the right 38 markers including the point of origin. You still have to find the perfect geometry plane for the six, if you want to dial in for the Einstein Rosen transport. If not, connection might not happen especially in an entirely different galaxy far away. Even if the DHD system does dial, such long one-sided wormholes in the Stargate would likely be created by excessive gravity and large power that would destroy any potential traveler's matter once in it like a black hole. Although if they do arrive, the planet's close alignment of three moons would impact the surface with a tidal force that would kill anybody stuck there. The subsequent TV series of similar name recognized this flaw and reworked the dialing DHD system to make a little more sense by taking account to stellar drift and moving the desert planet now known as Abydos into the Milky Way. Nevertheless, much of the conflict within the film involving with the travelling could had been solved by trial and error, as the show display that thousands of failed combinations can be tried without the gate locking like a safe forever. After all, there is only a finite number of symbols on the gate in order to find the seventh symbol with 36 possible answers. And similarly, once stuck on the desert planet with the coordinates for Earth with no point of origin; why couldn't them just keep plugging in sequences finishing with a different symbol each time until they hit the right one and the gate opened? The stargate on Earth is no longer buried and they do have a DHD machine even if the film didn't mention it. It's not as suicide mission as the film makes it out to be. Much of the elimination has been done when the cartouche reveals the other six. Just test them all for the seven. You don't really need Daniel to solve that puzzle. It's simple as that. It's worth a try since math probably wouldn't change overtime. Language on the other hand, does. The idea that Daniel would learn to speak an ancient proto language with no vowels sounds in a few days is too much of a stretch; seeing how it hasn't been spoken on Earth for a few millennia. It's like learning Modern English by only reading Anglo Saxon. Seeing how it's also spoken from people from another planet. The evolution of the language would be way different than Earth due to the unique surroundings and society standards. Since there was also a ban of writing and technology. I doubt Daniel would understand the alien word for atom. Regardless I still kinda dig how he told the villain's story. It built up the suspense for Ra's arrival. In the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD, Emmerich kinda ruin that by opening up with the 8000 BC footage and then reused later in Daniel's flashback exposition. That version felt very repetitive. Nevertheless, it's still begs the question how Ra was rejected and cast out by the ancient humans in Egypt, yet still worshipped for many years afterwards? To add onto that why does he still need human slavery with primitive tools to mine his minerals with all the technology he has? It makes no sense. Originally, two feature film sequels were planned to explain more of the backstory, but they were scrapped once they got sued by Omar Zuhdi for supposedly stealing the story from him which I doubt. Nevertheless, the show altered the canon so much that they had to recast all the characters that originated in the movie except for a few. After all, we can't have suicidal O'Neil nuking children and Daniel accidently killing the natives with his weird allergies. Still in the end, Jaye as Ra was amazing. Sucks that he retired after this movie. Nevertheless, the action scenes with all three leads are still top notch even if some modern viewers may see the soldiers freeing the natives from Ra as a case of White Man's Burden. I like to think otherwise, as the natives independently plan and lead the final assault against the God. Regardless, the film is still Naquadah solid.

33,filipemanuelneto,Forgettable,3,28 July 2019,"This film is based on a crazy, but real, theory about the visit of extraterrestrial beings to our ancient civilizations, namely ancient Egypt.The script is based on the discovery of a portal during excavations in Egypt. Dr. Daniel Jackson, an unorthodox egyptologist, is called in by the military to investigate the finding and finds that the portal links two worlds together and can be rebuilt and opened. He then embarks on an expedition that crosses the portal and finds himself in another desert world, where people live under the slavery of strange, extraterrestrial beings, very similar to the Egyptian gods.Personally, this movie has only interested me recently. Unlike the two TV series it gave rise to, it seems to me to have some quality... but, after all, is not very good. There are a lot of problems, starting with the lack of logic that arises when we analyze the details: for example, how can those people, used to using primitive tools, instantly handle and fire modern machine guns? The most logical thing would be they don't even know how to grab them! And how did Dr. Jackson manage, within a day, to discover the real usefulness of a portal that has puzzled academics for decades? There are a lot of problems like these ... little details that, when clearly analyzed, make no sense and undermine the credibility of the plot.As for the cast, I believe everyone did the best they could, but there are some obvious casting errors. James Spader is good as a strange scholar, but slips when he has to do action scenes. Kurt Russel is more suited to pure and hard action, but all attempts to make his character denser and give him a heroic accent are too cliché. Jaye Davidson was very unlucky with his character: a weak villain, effeminate to the point of being almost feminine, who doesn't scare and seems almost dependent on the tough guys who protect him. There is also a poor attempt to do romance between Spader and Mili Avital's character, but it always seems unnecessary and predictable to the point that we immediately know how it will end.The film is poor, has an uninspired script, a very amateurish direction (assured by Roland Emmerich), actors who can do little to help make things better, predictable action scenes, and dated visual and sound effects.

37,funkyfry,Amusing but stupid,5,7 November 2009,"With an interesting basic idea and a nice cast headed by Kurt Russell and James Spader, this should have turned out a bit better than it really is. The problem seems to be that any opportunity for originality or resonance was sacrificed in favor of bland action scenes. The director of this film, Roland Emmerich, seems to possess little in the way of imagination.Spader plays a scientist who, although he's been discredited by his peers, is drafted to head a major project for the U.S. military. Using his knowledge of ancient Egyptian languages, he manages to open the ""stargate"" which allows people from our world to travel to the other side of the galaxy. Lo and behold -- thousands of primitive humans are being held prisoner there by a super-powerful alien masquerading as the sun-god Ra.For a basic sci-fi premise, it's just so weird that it's fascinating. But unfortunately everything has been turned into a cliché by Emmerich and the writers. Why, oh why, would the first expedition to this new planet be undertaken by an incompetent newbie scientist and a bunch of soldiers with machine guns? It seems as if no one is taken by the sheer scientific possibilities of the situation. Basically they've taken a somewhat interesting premise and combined it with basic action formula in an attempt to replicate the success of ""Predator."" That film managed to look expensive by setting itself in a barren jungle; this film looks cheap because so much effort is made to create an elaborate civilization that ultimately feels like a copy of ""Mad Max beyond Thunderdome."" There is just too much stupidity here to be believed... Spader, although a scientist, never considered that the people might be speaking Egyptian with a different accent until just the right moment when the plot needed him to figure it out. But if only the director wasn't as short-sighted as the characters. His setups hold no interest and this is just totally functional film-making, not any better than a made for TV movie.It's fun however to see Kurt Russell in a sci-fi movie like this, and Jaye Davidson is an interesting choice for the villain.",Stargate

My studies of ancient religions, beliefs, and rites combined with my love of archeology, sociology, anthropology, and science fiction literally came to life with this movie. I loved every aspect of this work.This movie had enough imagination to inspire Disney writers, so it would seem. The opening of their ""Atlantis,"" was very similar to the opening scenes of ""Stargate."" At least, I found them to be nearly identical in feel, and very much alike in content.The entire concept concerning the origins of our civilization were reminiscent of Erik von Dankien's ""Chariots of the Gods,"" creatively presented, and stunningly executed.The pace was good without being plodding. The story line was beautiful and the dialog was natural. Wonderful CG-Eye-Candy, beautiful sets, designs, and wonderful story more than entertain you.I highly recommend the 2 disk Ultimate Edition with added scenes, featurettes, and a beautiful presentation.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Stargate

In 1923 there were many finds in the deserts of Egypt. A year earlier, the famous tomb of king Tutankhamun was discovered by noted archaeologist Dr. Howard Carter. This movie adds a more mythical aspect when tomb explorers discover a huge circular object with strange markings on it's circumference. When the symbols cannot be properly interpreted, a specialist, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is called in to help and discovers Star Constelations are the key. Nevertheless the project further proves dangerous and the civilian project goes military under Gen. West (Leon Rippy) and Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Once the device becomes operational, the Earth team travels to the far side of the galaxy and meet an extraordinary being called Ra. (Jaye Davidson who is incredible) He explains, he was responsible for Earth's Egyptian culture and it's pyramids. Because he created it, he will now destroy it.

40,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,8 April 2017,"Like so many other movies this one has been politicized in some of the more negative reviews because...well, I really can't say,I honestly have no clue what Stargate has to do with international politics...at all.Ostensibly it's because it is the American Military meets folks still living like its Ancient Egypt and kill their god that critics are objecting to on IMDb......Forgetting, of course, that their god enslaved them all.I am further to the left than most people I've met and...I just don't buy that this has ANYTHING to do with politics.I think this flick was pitched as ""Indiana Jones meets Star Wars"" and I am 100% certain that it was made to be Indiana Jones Meets Star Wars.And of course they can't name it that so they called it ""Stargate"" And I am going to review it like it was meant to be reviewed.This film is Indiana Jones meets Star Wars. It was made to be a hit, in fact, it should have been a far bigger hit than it turned out to be.I mean, just the concept makes me want to watch it all over again...It's the same concept as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" except they remembered that Indiana Jones has no place in the world of Aliens.In fact I would have even loved the TV show if, you know, all the Alien worlds they visited didn't look a lot like Canada.All you have here is a really fun action adventure sci-fi movie that doesn't try to make any statements.

Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary.",Stargate
42,XweAponX,Great Haircut on Kurt Russel!,10,17 September 2007,"Everything about this moovie looks real good. You wonder if they found some pyramid in Egypt that was pristine and filmed in and around that. The aerial shots above the pyramid look real.The only kind of crappy effects are those in the Stargate control room, the graphics on the monitors are too good for the PCs of 1994, and too lousy for any Military computers (Which are about 20 years ahead of what's available to the public, so I hear). However, the director is using the gadgets in the control room to explain whats going on to the viewer, without having to use up to 5 minutes of Dialogue explaining the operation of the Stargate. Instead, the monitor says ""Molecular Deconstruction"" and this is worth 15 minutes of Star Trekian dialogue.The story is a good story, but toward the end of the film, too many things are happening too fast, and it just seems that RA is a little bit too easy to get rid of... But then again, the Goa'Uld, although clever with science, are rather stupid when it comes to social behaviours and strategies.If this guy was enslaving these people for 12,000 years, he would be a little bit more of a sonuvabitch. So, I don't buy it that Ra was ready to fly away, but... It was good for the story on film, so they could blow up his pyramid ship, and if anyone notices, the explosion of the pyramid ship is almost the exact same explosion of the moon Praxis in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Actually someone did notice, see the trivia section of this movie).But overall, everything fits. The extended cut has a few shots that should have been left in the theatrical version. One thing that was done very well what that huge Buffalo thing looks like a real animal, I wonder if they took a buffalo and stuck a fake head on it, and how they got the buffalo to accept it.I've watched this film at least a dozen times, and it is still fun to watch. No disrespect for what the TV series has done, but that show is not capable of showing the scope of the material revealed in the original... Cos it does not work on a 25"" TV screen.Back then they had not named everything, we did not know that the name of the planet of the slaves was Abydos. Well, just like David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia... We lose the desert when we pan and scan this film.The characters do not fit well on a TV screen, and so, frequent trips back to Abydos via the extended cut of this film are required.",Stargate

Despite the genre, plot and general tone, it lacks traditional action sequences, settling instead for short bursts of action that only come in fits and starts. The villain doesn't show up until the half way point, and though suitably motivated (self preservation), he is, to say the least, undercooked. His heroic counterparts are likewise one-dimensional, reduced to either archetypes or cannon fodder. That said, there's a real charm to Stargate. Mostly eschewing navel-gazing pathos, messages or agendas, it's a rather old fashioned adventure. It never rises to the level of its many inspirations, but it's a refreshingly straightforward escapist escapade.",Stargate

One of the worst things I saw that has yet to be mentioned here, was that Russel and his two lieutenants (and Spader), supposedly experienced military men, stood silhouetted at the top of a dune looking at the alien city, rather than peeking over the top, and sure enough, are soon spotted.
The archaeology here is probably all crap, but it is richly detailed crap. You have to hand it to the filmmakers for the sets and costumes. In spite of its flaws, this film is at least somewhat original, something you don't find in Hollywood very often.I have never heard of the long version mentioned below. Sounds interesting. Also, I wonder why the correspondent from Egypt is so chauvinistic about the pyramids, etc., when the current population of Egypt is Arab, and not descended from the ancient Egyptians.",Stargate

This is definitely one of my favorite movies. I absolutely adore James Spader in this movie as well as Kurt Russell. This movie has so many wonderful elements to it and it will always be a historic movie in the world of science fiction. This movie is funny and also so entertaining that you want to watch it again right after seeing it. This is such a wonderful movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi or adventure movies.
.......
Roland Emmerich's ""Stargate"" is a film that is both too long and too short for what it may want to be. As action-oriented science fiction adventure, the film is too quiet and lacks the tension needed to propel its thrills. As a science fiction epic, the film is too undeveloped; it offers interesting suggestions of world building and of answers to deep questions, but it never fully answers them. Caught between these two poles, ""Stargate"" still manages to entertain and is mostly appealing. It is an engaging, if frustrating, piece of work.Beginning with the discovery of a hieroglyphic-adorned ring, ""Stargate"" revolves around the subsequent revelation that that ring is a gateway to another planet where Egyptian-like humanoids toil under false Egyptian-like gods. When a team of scientists and military types breach the gate, a battle of wills and arms erupts.The science fiction framework of ""Stargate"" is quite compelling. Positing that the pyramids of Egypt and its hierarchy of deities have something to do with forces that are not necessarily human is endlessly interesting, but the film does not do enough with this idea to satisfy. The narrative is more concerned with us vs. them action beats played out by a series of well-cast but undeveloped and ultimately uninteresting characters.Emmerich's production is sturdily executed. His expansive landscapes are handsome, the special effects are competent, and his cast is capable.The pacing is problematic, however, and the film could have afforded to either move faster or take more time establishing itself. Leads, James Spader and Kurt Russell, are not given enough to do beyond fulfilling the beats specific to their character types. They are both either dull or dour where each actor is typically able to provide much more spirit.By its climax, ""Stargate"" provides enough science fiction and adventure entertainment to make it a worthy experience. The film is visually appealing and offers a fair amount of high quality spectacle. It issues are deep, but the film is still able to generate some solidly imagined fun.",Stargate

47,Agent10,Interesting film,7,5 May 2002,"This was to say the least, a very inventive movie. It wasn't necessarily groundbreaking or visionary, but it was unique, and that typically helps any film in need of establishing its own identity. Sadly, this has also turned out to be Kurt Russell's last good movie. He's most likely going to have to establish himself in some quirky independent film, to make himself known again. There are quite a few things I especially enjoyed about this film, particularly the set design. While some of the plot lines had major holes, overall, it was quite enjoyable. I mean, Dave Chappelle and French Stewart in a serious movie. Quite unusual. But one last question to ponder: What happened to James Spader and Jay Davidson?",Stargate
48,aidanratesmovies,Stargate,6,20 April 2020,"Bold, with some very unique concepts, but ultimately lacking in any depth of quality- Stargate feels like an enormous missed opportunity. The acting in the film isn't great, but for the most part it isn't bad either. They're are quite a few moments that are simply so forced and formulaic, it is hard to watch. The film starts off a bit cliche, but easily likable, and somewhat promising. Then right as it seems to meet its highest moment, it falls flat immediately, and this remains the issue for most of the film. There isn't enough to care about, enough to interest you, and anything truly original or new that the first act seemed to promise before it. The special effects are quite impressive, especially for the time, and the look of a lot of the different creatures and machines used in the film are quite interesting, and cool to look at. The film's script is a bit of a mess, not really knowing what it wants to be (an action movie, a comedy, and a sci-fi drama all at once), and its pacing can often slow to a crawl. There are many glimmers of hope throughout the film, and many interesting ideas, but in the end, Stargate proves to be an unmemorable wanna-be sci-fi flick, with no idea how to tell its own story, or what that story may even be, or consist of.

I was expecting a pretty schlocky sci-fi movie and this was actually pretty engaging. I actually got notes of Arrival... Well, I suppose it's the other way around but I saw Arrival first!

50,Spondonman,Thoughtful escapism,8,29 June 2014,"This is one of my favourite movies made in the last fifty years, packed with plot and thought, both well-oiled with heaps of corn and leaps of faith but still with an outstanding vision. It seems to be regularly on TV, and I still end up catching it every year or so. It took Star Trek's City At The Edge Of Forever classic from 1967 literally to another dimensionJames Spader is a long haired geeky professor who is enrolled into military operation to decipher mysterious ancient Egyptian artifact and help test its present cosmic potential, Kurt Russell is a square haired army colonel helping but preparing to hinder operations if necessary. The theory of ancient astronauts visiting and conquering Earth is taken to a new level – Hell, you can come away convinced it actually happened that way. Their adventures on the other desert planet all follow on logically, the only jarring note perhaps being Spader's initial performance as an ineffectual dweeb which was OK as a plot device, but at least it doesn't last too long. Thank goodness they had olde cgi cartoonery in 1994, however the story would have probably seen it through anyway. The ripply effect of passing through from world to another was just as effectively portrayed in Cocteau's Orphee in 1949It has something for everyone, good and bad, emotion and action and could have been just as exciting and entertaining an hour longer - although the ensuing franchise extended it by years. It has a beginning middle and end with no gristle and is almost Art! And for once even the Yanks managed to wade into a foreign land to assist the standard ignorant alien natives with regime change, leave with minimum casualties and leave a probable American outpost only light years away.",Stargate
51,Spleen,Amiable science fantasy,7,22 February 2000,"It's not JUST that I like all that Ancient Egyptian kitsch.  Pyramids, sand, big square rocks, dead languages ... there's also your usual Star Wars style technology, which is equally hard to dislike ... and then there's that creature.  It's cute.  You know the one I mean: that gentle, extra-large buffalo thing with big horns.  If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable.Okay.  Just so you'll know that I'm AWARE how silly `Stargate' is, there's two comments I'd like to get off my chest before I start saying nice things:(1)  I don't care how much Daniel knows about dead languages, he can't know what Egyptian speech sounded like - and in any event, it's been several THOUSAND years!  Take a Chinese scholar, give him a brief whiff of British speech from a thousand years before the Romans arrive, and then plonk him down in modern-day London.  Would he understand a single word spoken by anyone?  Of course not.(2)  Devlin and Emmerich have a strange idea of academic conferences - they must think that people go to them only to heckle.  Daniel never even got a chance to mention the whacko part of his theory; he was drowned out in a chorus of Pshaws almost before he drew his first breath.  I'm surprised the audience didn't consist of people with big white walrus moustaches, drinking port.Well, I can forgive a few things like this.  Lowering the linguistic barriers I can forgive as a plot device (that could, admittedly have been better handled), and ... well, the whole aliens-built-the-pyramids thing is absurd anyway, and Emmerich comes reasonably close to hitting the right tone to pull it off with some grace.  There's poetry in the Stargate scenario. Doggerel poetry, but poetry nonetheless.  It's a good job so much of the action takes place on another world.  Had Devlin and Emmerich stayed on Earth for too long them I'm sure that, one way or another, they would have turned `Stargate' into the kind of bloated horror that `Independence Day' was (and that `Godzilla' was as well, so I hear).  But there's nothing really wrong with the basic story and the clichés - although they ARE weakening - are all forgivable.  Besides, the mere look of the film will inspire affection.",Stargate

53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A live action version of Disneys Atlantis,7,23 July 2012,"It is amazing how similar films can be when it comes to plot, predictability, and story line. I liked the direction Roland Emmerich put into the film and screenplay but it felt like there were some areas that were not carefully scanned over thoroughly. There were several things I enjoyed during the running time of Stargate, but there were some drawbacks that should have been addressed at the same time.Stargate is the story of linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) who is on the verge of finding the truth behind the great pyramids of Egypt. Of course, no one believes him, until he is given a special offer that will allow him to prove his theory. Hmmmm....already, from there it sounds like the story of Milo James Thatch from Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). Accompanying Dr. Jackson is Colonel Jack O'Neil played by veteran actor Kurt Russell. At first O'Neil is one of those silent characters who is difficult to communicate with but he opens up later on. Thankfully, Russell doesn't play stone-faced the whole time like Todd from Soldier (1998).Along with these two actors, the rest of the acting is presentable. The special effects are average. Nothings amazing nor does it seem really cheap looking so there's nothing to critique there. Looking back on them, they were standard for their time. As the plot continues, Jackson's' group of followers run into distant humans in a far away galaxy. It is there that Spader's character falls in love with the leader's daughter, Sha'uri (Mili Avital), who I will say, looks great. I did like the love story but it left me wanting to see more that it showed.Again this specific plot device runs practically parallel to that of Disney's Atlantis. The difference is that Disney's was more entertaining and with characters that had more personality to them. Sure, Spader played a great nerd and Russell was good as depressed individual (at first), but having a boatload of characters with different accents is much more fun to listen and watch on screen. I also liked the themes that were played in David Arnold's soundtrack. It may not have had sci- fi feel to it, but it did have a memorable tune. In some ways, it bordered on the edge of John Williams but obviously not as epic sounding.Stargate is the film that pushed director Roland Emmerich to the pinnacle of success but the characters within the story lack heart.

The franchise also spawned a hard video game as well as a long running TV show not to mention countless ripoffs and spinoffs.

55,PredragReviews,A Portal Into Another World Like No Other,9,8 May 2016,"As a film, I see it primarily as a romance. In the end, a man out of place in one world, finds his place in another, and one man finds meaning in his own world after a very traumatic event. The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece. Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels.The movie is careful to stay away from many of the clichés of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are too simple. Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality. The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers and not pissing off their Gods. The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real. From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, ""Stargate"" is a very entertaining film. Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a God. The only disappointment is the last twenty-or-so minutes where the action is definitely progressing at a breakneck speed, but in all honesty, we never do care about the otherworldly extras enough to get lost in the suspense of saving their planet.

57,MartianOctocretr5,Creative sci-fi,6,17 August 2009,"It's odd that this movie slipped into obscurity so quickly, while spawning a series that has enjoyed years of success.It's a better watch than the TV show version. The cast, especially Kurt Russell, are stronger than their TV counterparts, and take their roles more seriously. The unfolding plot is organized in superior fashion to that cornball comedy/soap-opera theme its TV progeny fell into. The focus is the mystery, and the wonder of what the strange device is.Research and thought are the key here. An odd arc-shaped object is found in the Egyptian desert. It's readily apparent this object is nothing of modern terrestial origin, so what is it? Where did it come from? What (if anything) does it do, and can it be operated? Scientists look for clues to a key to these questions, and this marks the creativity of the story line.The second chapter of the plot has Kurt Russell leading a platoon of soldiers on an exploratory mission that journeys through the portal. What they find is good fodder, although the second chapter is not as strong in presentation as the first chapter. The intrigue and mystery are soon lost and traded for raw military explosions, making the movie lose some steam. To their credit, the actors support the action well enough to maintain your interest.Average yarn, decent entertainment.",Stargate

Well, having seen the SPECIAL EDITION of STARGATE, I must admit I was wrong. The theatrical version was NINE-TENTHS of an epic.  What a shame, for the addition of just 9 minutes of footage makes all the difference.  The butchering of STARGATE to accommodate less than one additional showing per screen per day is the worst travesty since the butchering of THE ABYSS.  Worse, when one considers how little running time makes such a difference.  In any version STARGATE might not have generated the kind of awe given STAR WARS.  However, the film MOST CERTAINLY would have generated at least one sequel and have given the syndicated series an even greater lease on life.By placing an earlier focus on RA (Jaye Davidson), the SPECIAL EDITION gives the character a great deal more weight, and the story advances with much greater suspense and excitement.  Later scenes inside the Pyramid, and RA's spacecraft, which I found hopelessly confusing in the theatrical release, now make perfect sense.Home Theater has never been more affordable.  I purchased mine for about what I spend in two years of going to the movies .  Couple this fact with the recent bankruptcy of most, if not all of the major theater chains, and it may not be long before `Special Editions' are the norm.  At that point, we may witness a director's original vision, not a hack job by a studio caving to the National Association of Theater Owners.

63,stamper,Emmerich sure as hell knows his Indy and his Star Wars,9,28 October 2001,"There is a lot that can be said about Emmerich's films. The Patriot was well done, but sometimes a bit too much'; Godzilla had some good effects but it also had bad ones, plus a thin script and lousy actors; Independence Day had a lot of action, explosions and brainless entertainment which are all as well good and bad points. Although they were all not great, Independence Day and The Patriot both had some quality in them. They were both well made and had decent scripts. The Patriot on one hand had emotion and worked out characters, where Independence Day had action and entertainment (kind of a theme park ride). This film combines the good parts of both those films, without having in it the bad parts and is therefore easily Emmerich's best (with UniSols a good second) although Box Office Statistics might suggest otherwise. This film just say, hell it screams QUALITY. Everything is great here, costumes, sets, actors, music, effects, the scripts, photography, direction and etceteras, etceteras, etceteras. I think this film should have at least gotten a couple of Oscar Nominations for costumes and music, but hey, WHO AM I???
To me it seems, that when Emmerich wrote this one together with Devlin, he really payed attention to what makes movies great. I would take a bet that he watched the Indiana Jones Trilogy and maybe even the Star Wars Trilogy prior to writing this. I mean even if he didn't he sure as hell remembered what made those movies as great as they are (even today).
Just as in Indy, the background for this film is formed, by a mysterious ancient culture and a finding in the early twenties of the 20th century. It just promises: ADVENTURE. An adventure that is packed (as was Indy) with a bunch of jokes; action and epic / feel-good music.
The Star Wars factor I spoke of earlier which might have been of influence is, that Emmerich created (as Lucas did in Star Wars) a world of it's own. But now only that. He also succeeded in giving the characters depth and emotion and by doing that, he was able to let the viewer (us) be dragged into this spectacle. Emmerich has done something with the genre of Sci-fi adventure, which I have missed since the original Star Wars trilogy and something that will not easily repeated. 
I must really praise some actors here I feel, but it might not be those, everyone expects me to. Of course, James Spader and Kurt Russell did what they were supposed to, but I feel they only did their job good. There were however people in this movie which did their jobs great and by that exceeded Spader and Russell. I'm talking about Jaye Davidson (Ra), Alexis Cruz (Skaara) and Mili Avital (Sha'uri). Those three kids' are excellent in this film and they really stand out above Spader and Russell.

64,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"A bit standard, but a very decent concept to a great movie",8,21 November 2012,"Well, I just want to say that I had never heard of this film before... until the past summer when I was at summer camp when I watched it on a VHS copy. I also heard that this was made the same year I was born and this was made by the same guy who directed Independence Day, Godzilla, and the later film 2012. I watched it because I wanted to see if it would keep me very interested. It did after my first viewing and I personally like it as much as those who gave it a positive feedback. Sure, some of the characters may be unengaging and the story, despite it's decent concept, does have some plot holes and I would've like to see more of the romance between the two characters. Those flaws didn't really bother me at all and I think that this is Roland Emmerich's best film next to Independence Day and The Patriot.The acting on the whole is pretty good especially Kurt Russell and James Spader who had great chemistry together throughout the film. The directing from Roland Emmerich is pretty good and focused, the pacing moves along very nicely, but would've been fifteen minutes longer at the end of the film. The strongest aspects, however, goes to it's compelling visuals and it's epic music score from David Arnold. The look of the Egyptian world along with some nice costume designs is fabulous. David Arnold's music score doesn't have a sci-fi tone to it, but it does have a memorable tune which gives the movie an epic sweep to it. It also has some good dialog especially it's nice moments with the main character and the villain who is quite menacing.Stargate does have a hokey concept, but I don't understand why some people hated it because I think that this is an interesting film and I simply understood that it got a cult following over the years. It isn't perfect, but it's completely watchable to those who haven't seen it yet. So, in my opinion, this deserves a 4/5.",Stargate
65,Libretio,"Good premise, wasted opportunity",4,22 February 2005,"STARGATE Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Stereo / DTSUsing an ancient portal recovered from an Egyptian burial site, a group of US soldiers is transported to a distant planet where they uncover a primitive civilization similar to Earth at the time of Pharaoh, ruled by a malevolent alien creature who plots to destroy mankind.Though successful in its day, Roland Emmerich's empty-headed blockbuster wastes a fascinating premise by locating its principal action within a bland alien civilization ruled by an androgynous boy (THE CRYING GAME's Jaye Davidson), a civilization which crumbles to dust within hours of the arrival of Kurt Russell's gung-ho military team, alongside 'dweeb' scientist James Spader (giving the film's best performance as a social outcast who's redeemed by his experiences amongst the stars). Ambitious in scope and execution, the movie is a production/costume designer's dream, overflowing with hybrid Egyptian/alien sets and artefacts, and Emmerich pulls off a number of memorable 'reveals' (the first glimpse of the eponymous Stargate; the moment when Russell and Spader realize they've actually landed on an alien planet; Davidson's entrance from an ornate sarcophagus, etc.), filling the screen with eye-catching sets and thousands of extras. It's grandiose and watchable, but also hollow and disappointing, and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Also starring Viveca Lindfors, Alexis Cruz and Djimon Hounsou. An expanded director's cut was released in 1996 (the same year Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin hit paydirt with the mega-successful - and equally hollow - INDEPENDENCE DAY), followed by the long-running TV series ""Stargate SG-1"".",Stargate

The idea of the stargate is such a smart and entertaining thought, that leaves no limits to where the story could take you. This origin movie was nicely put together, the graphics, costumes and landscape in the film were well done for it's time.

In terms of the premise I suppose it is a bit original, but even if you haven't seen this exact movie before you've probably seen others of the same breed. Not to mention that the movie's plot is ridiculous and boring and with each step it only seems to get worse.The one aspect to this picture that is unexpected is it takes someone who could have been one character and splits it between James Spader and Kurt Russell and gives Spader the lead part over the latter. However, even James Spader manages to shine next to some of the other actors in the picture like the horrendous 'villain'.Maybe Roland Emerich thought he was creating the next great fantasy franchise-considering the amount of money poured it-but Stargate is just another miserable attempt at entertainment that is swallowed by the rest into oblivion.",Stargate
68,Darkside-Reviewer,Science Fiction storytelling at it's best,7,24 January 2020,I had never seen Stargate before 2020 the TV show or this movie but as a bit of a science fiction nerd I thought it was time I gave it a watch and I honestly wasn't disappointed with it the movie is quite unique and has a storyline that kept my interest and was pretty original for it's time.Stargate takes place in 1994 when linguist and Egyptian professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is payed a visit by an archaeologist who in 1928 when she was just a young girl was there when an ancient Egyptian artifact thought to be a device of some kind and stone tablets inscribed with an ancient Egyptian language were discovered during a dig by the Egyptian pyramids she invites him to study the artifact in a top secret base in the hopes he is able to decipher the inscriptions and find out how to use the device he successfully powers the device up which they find out is actually a portal to another point in space a planet similar to earth across a distant galaxy so he and Army Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) along with some soldiers cross the portal to discover what lies on the other side there they find a primitive civilization who speak a long dead Egyptian language and worship the sun god RA who created the Stargate between the two planets and established a mining colony between both worlds using humans as slaves on both worlds until an uprising on earth dethroned him and branded him a false god tearing down the Stargate between the two worlds Jackson soon discovers RA is actually an alien who traveled across space to find a way to cheat death RA discovered earth and humankind and using a human body as a host he can live forever as the god RA by regenerating the host body so he never age's and dies but Jackson and O'Neil reveal to the slaves that there god is flesh and blood and they can overthrow him starting a rebellion against him that ends in his ultimate defeat Jackson stays behind with the humans on the strange planet with his love interest to create a new civilisation free of slavery while O'Neil and the remaining soldiers travel back to earth via the Stargate and destroy it on there side to protect earth from any possible other Stargates out there.The story is well written and the movie takes it's time building up the anticipation of what's on the other side of the Stargate then takes it time exploring the other side and it's environment rather than just doing what most science fiction movie's do and rush into the action it's a nice change of pace then when the movie's action scenes do start up it feels well placed and part of the story not just shoved in to spice the movie up a bit.I recommend this movie to any science fiction movie fan it's the story and visuals that are the main theme in this movie a lot like Star Trek it focuses on the intellectual side of science fiction and not just the action very enjoyable to watch if your a science fiction nerd like myself.Just a side note I purchased the Directors Cut Special Edition on Blu Ray released in 2008 and it has no language options or subtitle options not a huge deal for most but is an issue if you suffer from deafness or are hard of hearing.,Stargate
69,Bogmeister,A Gate to the Stars and a Desert,6,11 September 2005,"The movie Stargate, which introduced (sort of) the concept of instantaneous interstellar travel via a gate made more famous by the subsequent TV series, is most interesting in the first half-hour, when the prospect of uncovering the secrets of the device tantalize the viewer. James Spader conveys this curiosity and channels his quest to discover the gate's secrets to the audience. Lindfors is also very good as an elder scientist who feels Spader is the answer to all the questions. Kurt Russell's range as a military officer is limited here; he's introduced as suicidal due to his son's recent death, but is quite stoic and just grim throughout. He's obviously a 'can do' soldier and leader, but also anticipates his later robotic fighter in ""Soldier"" 4 years later. After the action moves off Earth to what's on the other side of the gate, our anticipation to find out what's there is rewarded by little more than a variation on ""Dune""(84) done in more formulaic style.A formula is what partners Emmerich and Devlin present, as is always the case in their movies - successful formulas, to be sure, but nothing to get surprised over. Even if you know nothing about one of their films beforehand, about 20 minutes in you may have it all figured out. Here, the expedition finds a 'desert' world and are soon expected to help the natives against an alien tyrant (Jaye Davidson, his unusual persona taken advantage of). Are we all surprised by such a plot? Of course not. The special FX are pretty impressive, especially the shots of the huge flying pyramid and some of the landscapes. They also have some impressive crowd shots which add to an epic scale of storytelling. But, there's very little emotional attachment to the unfolding struggle - it's all by the numbers and even Spader can't inject much feeling into any of it. The next project, ""Independence Day"" was probably more successful because our own cities were being destroyed, not some far-off planet we care very little about.",Stargate

It looks like a USA propaganda piece, convincing us to send our army to yet another foreign country; because the fill in the blank people yearn to be free.

73,Aylmer,some great ideas but the movie gets stupider and stupider as it goes along,6,21 January 2020,"This was one of the few movies I remember seeing multiple times in the theater as a teenager. Not only did it offer up a lot of fresh ideas and a lot of action, but felt pretty smart as far as big budget sci fi action movies go. Looking at it now, the film holds up fairly well through its first half, but gradually falls apart when we leave the sense of mystery it sets up at the start and into an overly familiar feeling action plot.There's a lot I like about the film, like how instead of a big imposing and monstrous villain, they cast an actor known only for his demure femininity and gave him glowing eyes here and and a harem of children. To add even further to the creepiness, the children all seemed to honestly love their master and jumped to protect him at the slightest sign of danger, putting our heroes into possibly moral conundrums. Also it was one of the first movies to really try and make sense of ancient aliens visiting earth and their impact on ancient Egyptian culture, giving the art director here the chance to develop a truly unique alien aesthetic. We'd also barely seen the use of wormholes for space travel at the time outside of something like DUNE so it was need to see that theory given a fairly real-world application.What doesn't work with this film? Well for one, it barely lives up to its potential by presenting us with a very half-baked alien world. Even the moons in the sky just look like superimposed images of our own moon, only with one flipped upside down. We only get to see one alien creature and the ecosystem of the planet similarly low-key as another boring desert planet. Most to the film's detriment, it just goes too fast for its own good and glazes over a lot to force in its contrived climax against enemies who make far too many idiotic decisions late in the film to generate any real tension.Overall, STARGATE works as a window into the simpler time of the early 90's when big scifi films like this were full of wonder, spectacle, and the odd CGI effect here and there was still a novelty. Even though it was made by a different studio, the film shares a lot with WATERWORLD in that it's big, it's dumb, and it sets up a lot early on only to disappoint you by gradually descending from semi-believably sci fi into a bland action film.",Stargate

Very imaginative settings and alien technology. Beautiful photography. Nicely paced scenario. Interesting story with a solid background.The actors. Kurt Russell is right in his element, and didn't need to show the limits of his short acting range. James Spader is the most interesting character, and plays it well.

80,peefyn,"Deeply flawed, yet often fun, and visually good",5,13 April 2016,"First of all: I love how this movie manages to make a scenario where a linguist somehow is the heroic explorer, much like Indiana Jones put archeology in the spotlight. In fact, a comparison with Indiana Jones is apt, because it's obvious that this movie is heavily inspired by that franchise - although it goes in a completely different direction.I have barely seen the TV-show, so I went into this knowing only somewhat what the stargate is. I love the premise of it, and how it manages to explore both mythology and sci-fi concepts. I can really understand that they decided to make a TV-show out of this.A last note on positives, before I go into the flaws: There's some really neat visuals in this as well, especially concerning the pyramids, and some of the villain henchmen's costumes.The flaws, though, are many and quite bad. For one, all characters are basically idiots that somehow seem intent on making the worst possible decisions. This is a really cheap trick for inducing conflict, it is also really annoying, and condescending to the audience. Most of it could be avoided by better writing. Just as serious is how this movie seems to parallel some big problems with colonialism without really noticing. There is literally a scene where one explorer is sick, sneezes, and then his handkerchief is taken by ""indigenous""-like people that has obviously never been exposed to his germs (though the movie does not comment upon this at all). There's also scenes where the explorers give the indigenous weapons and cigarettes. Was it to build up a more direct colonial plot for a possibly sequel? For some reason, it does not feel like it. It seems more like dumb writing.There's also some scenes that have become a bit more uncomfortable due to modern conflicts. There are scenes set in areas resembling the middle east, where kids are handed automatic weapons to fight against what is basically drones.Despite all of these flaws, the concept (and the visuals) makes it worth a watch, perhaps to ponder what could have been?",Stargate

82,HelenMary,"amazing 90s Sci-Fi cult classic that spawned SG1, Atlantis and Universe",7,28 January 2013,"Love this film. It's aged well, and is the opener for a massive TV series franchise. Basically, Dr Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is called into a military research station to decipher hieroglyphs and other symbols on a large artifact found at Giza in 1928, which is of course the first Stargate and was built by the alien civilisation that created the Ancient Egyptian way of life here on Earth, which have since gone on another planet, where our intrepid explorers go and find a similar civilisation to what the Egyptians might have been two thousand plus years ago on Earth. Their language is similar enough to what Dr Jackson, an archaeological linguist, can reasonably and not-improbably understand, after a few false starts.The film is of epic proportions set against sweeping sand dune vistas and huge sets, reminiscent of the big studio classics, with hundreds of extras who are real people not painted in later. It has an iconic soundtrack that is almost operatic in places, and the costumes, ancient Egyptian similarities and the special effects are just brilliant even nearly twenty years on, and without the prolific CGI we have today! It is visually very impressive, and original. The script isn't great and is really the only thing that lets the film down a point. It's all a bit rushed and staccato at the beginning - the bit on Earth is the least convincing actually. The film manages some humour as well as having you on the edge of your seat for a climactic finale, which is also a little emotive. James Spader is always a good bet, known most prominently for rather seedy, smutty, awkward or fast talking characters (Oh! How I love Boston Legal), he is superb as the academic PhD here; his calm, measured and quiet delivery are perfect against Kurt Russell's buzz-cut macho all-guns-blazing military man on a mission. Jaye Davidson gives a rather scary performance as Ra (""the Sun god"") with control and an almost sexual element and effeminacy but also a violence and temper that are only partially helped by special effects. I really loved the acting - possibly the stand out character - of Alexis Cruz as the smart and brave village boy Skaara who makes first contact and is the plucky comic relief! Erick Avari, the village leader Kasuf, is a familiar face now (but perhaps wasn't so much back in the early 90s as this was his first major film role) as is French Stewart, one of the soldiers (3rd Rock from the Sun) and also Djimon Hounsou in an early in his acting career small though perfectly formed role as Horus. A brilliant film, well worth watching for sci-fi, Egyptian, alien, anthropology, archaeology, action adventure interests. It is worth noting that the beginning of the film is in German with subtitles and your DVD language and subtitle options aren't playing up (I stupidly forgot that last time I watched as it had been such a long time since I'd seen it), and also there are subtitles for the plot-important Egyptian dialect conversations too.",Stargate
83,Cinema_Fan,The Stargate that is open to new ideas.,6,17 January 2007,"Science fiction meets mythological history meets action and adventure. This is the better movie to come from Roland Emmerich's directional heritage, with the Lazarus theme running through Universal Soldier (1992), and the portly extravagance of Independence Day (1996), to the average sized Godzilla (1998), and to the sublime 2004 movie that centres on Earth's final days The Day After Tomorrow.Where The Day After Tomorrow concentrates on the Earths future demise, Stargate on the other hand goes further back, some 10,000 years back, into Egyptian myth and legend, and their cover-up of an alien being that once came to this planet to take its inhabitants for slaves, not by means of ships, but by the use of teleportation. The method of travelling to the ends of the universe, instantly, a quantum leap, from one space to another, as simply walking from one room into another, this is the evil purpose of the Stargate, a tool to transport humans across the galaxy, toward a life of slavery and death.Now, in the present day, and for eons past, the Stargate has been hidden, forgotten, and buried, as time has progressed and histories have come and gone throughout the ages; the Stargate has once more been unearthed. In the hands of the military, this portal, this unique tool, this mysterious device shall once more regenerate and transport those to new and wondrous worlds, those who now share its secret. Led by Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), he, his team and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spade), scientist and Egyptologist, have crossed the boundaries of time and space. These modern-day voyagers' have naively stumbled across the Kingdom of the ancient god Ra. An intelligent, cunning and malevolent aging creature that for centuries has explored the universe, exploiting all he grasps, using the bodies of his people, his slaves, his humans, to regenerate himself over and over to receive eternal life. And so the conflict between Man and the deadly demigod Ra begins, the Stargate is where it began, and with the Stargate, it shall end.Stargate is an interesting flavour of visual delight. Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematography and visual effects of the vast deserts and tribal communities that populate this three-mooned planet has us in a sweat quicker than a turkey at Thanksgiving. With a hint of arousal, a touch of depth, and a little pinch of tone and meaningful tenderness, Stargate, at the hands of Walter Lindenlaub has this movie cooked at exactly the correct temperament and texture that many first class cinemas would care to serve. While Stargate wins outright in the visual sense, what lets it down, a little, is its somewhat two-dimensional characters, they seem more reinvented parodies of this sci-fi genre than newcomers to this new world of adventure, the all American war hero, with his cool and impenetrable demeanour, even down to the most ridiculous haircut ever seen. The inexcusable government scientists that insist on wearing wool sweaters that even a charity shop would have trouble selling. Plus their seemingly inept competence at solving simple equations over a three-year period, that has Dr. Daniel Jackson solving within three weeks of his arrival, just a tiny clichéd, but not that important, and not too distracting either, to the narrative.English composer David Arnold, whose work on Casino Royale (2006), Hot Fuzz (2007), the ""Little Britain"" British television comedy series and the ""Stargate SG-1"" American T.V. series to name a few, does bring Stargate out of the dark and with it a shining example in what can be an uplifting, exciting and rewarding companion to Walter Lindenlaub vision. Any wonder then that these two professionals, including Stargate's director, have also worked on numerous projects together beforehand.Stargate, the 1994 original movie, has in perspective, been a huge success, not just because of its thrill ride at the worlds cinemas. Here, we have many T.V. spin-off's Stargate SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods, Stargate Atlantis: Rising etc, etc, some T.V. shows even producing spin-off's themselves. This is classic Saturday morning T.V. sci-fi fodder, as in the styles of nineteen fifties sci-fi, such as Captain Video and His Video Rangers, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. To bring it further up the evolutional ladder, the nineteen sixties gave us Doctor Who and Star Trek. Now, as we enter the new millennium, Stargate and its offspring are entertaining us in front of our television sets. An easygoing default movie that really does contain great visuals and a real sense of adventure that even the children of nineteen fifties and sixties television would not disagree.Sci-Fi is universal as it transcends across the barriers of time for each new generation, that is why Stargate will, and has, lead the way for the next generation.",Stargate

The ones that stroke me the most was the obsession of Ra in exterminating the entire human race when the only danger to him were the humans present in his own planet, and the way the character of James Spader finds the seventh symbol to activate the gate on the other side. Anyway, the movie has its moments, specially the ones that refer to the alternate version of egiptian history. The character of James Spader is enjoyable and is a much needed source of scientific explaining. Kurt Russel is straight-faced as ever, and Jaye Davidson is limited to act as a feline type, which seems obsessed in its own evilness. Some of it is really innovative, therefore it is disappointing to see it succumb to such a common and clichéd third act.",Stargate
86,flingebunt,Many people's favourite movie,6,18 May 2005,"No one really expected this small budget, simple concept science movie to be much of a success when it was first released.The story is fairly simple and much like the plot of a TV show episode in it's simplicity. Some archaeologists find a strange buried device. The American military play around with it, but can't get it to work, so they call in an egyptologist and next thing you know they have opened up a gate in space to a distant planet.It turns out the Egyptian gods were really space travels who used their god like powers to rule humans. They were kicked off Earth, but on this other planet they still rule.Some army guys and the egyptologist go to this planet, fight the space travelers. Oh my God, does good triumph over evil, you will have to watch this movie to find out.While there is some action, it is really the Science Fiction idea that makes this story work. I think this is why so many people like it.Of course it was perfect material for a spin off series, which in itself was good, but it never really managed to capture of the feel of the original movie.",Stargate
87,nammage,From the Theatrical to the Director's Cut,8,16 November 2003,"The quality of the movie, in the Theatrical version and in the Director's Cut, are both good. Tho, I must say that the Theatrical version is better viewed picture wise. When they re-intergrade the scenes that were not in the Theatrical version, sometimes they had 'dust' and sometimes they looked a bit 'old', like on film in which they didn't clean. Specks as well, in variants.The sound is great, I've always thought so. The sound by words to lips in some scenes is off just a tad, but, only noticeable to those who are either looking for such quirks or are looking at their lips for some reason.There is much positive aspects in this film. The story-line and the acting are both entwined very well. As tho both aren't seen yet they are.James Spader does an excellent job as Daniel Jackson, his counterpart on the tv show Stargate SG-1 Michael Shanks does a great job as Daniel Jackson as well, if I was to be asked which I would rather have be on the show or in a continuing sequel of the movie, I would be tongue-tied and un-able to answer for it would almost be a tie between the two.Kurt Russell plays depressed and angry very well, as he does in most of his other films, tho I feel that Richard Dean Anderson does a better job at playing Colonel Jack O'Neil. But, that is in my opinion.The rest of the cast were as well great, especially French Stewart who usually plays comedic roles, tho he did have a few quirks of sarcasm in this movie, I thought his 'dramatic' scenes were justifiable and that he should consider in the future to be in more, I feel they would suit him well. Tho, if he stays in the comedic roles that is good, too.I have only seen Mili Avatal in two movies, this one of course and in Kissing A Fool. She was lovely in that movie, but, I think she is excellent in this one. She has passion and grace, that she puts to the role of Sha'uri.Tho I know of other movies with Djimon Hounsou, I feel his part in this film was too small to make a vivid comment on.Jaye Davidson plays Ra (rah) very well. He is un-recognized barely in his other films.As I mentioned in the sound department, those quirks and also in the picture, but, only on the Directorial version and not the Theatrical.
On the Director's Cut some of the scenes re-added in are a bit dirty and the sound is off at times, I feel that put a low mark on the film for me.Tho, the Theatrical version is excellent and clean.
Overall, I feel that this movie in the Theatrical release is an 8 out of 10 the Director's Cut a rank lower at 7 out of 10.But, overall an 8.",Stargate
88,Silverzero,"Messy, complicated and rather un-enjoyable sci-fi adventures.",3,10 May 2003,"The film that spun off the much more successful TV series, `Stargate' is a surprising disappointment. World famous cynic, Leslie Halliwell described it as being a `gung-ho space opera', I couldn't put it better myself. There's more plot-holes than your average Swiss cheese here, along with a dreadfully boring narrative. The actors have very little to do with their roles and do little to impress.Making a break from the sadomasochistic kinky sex genre, James Spader portrays a very boring character (unintentionally of course). After a string of big hits, Kurt Russell gives an OK performance as the man's man of the group but could do with better material than this. That dude from `The Crying Game' (whoops, better not reveal the ending) is over effeminate in a role that should have been conceived so flamboyantly. Nothing seems to fit perfectly to make this a complete puzzle. The dialogue is `techno talk' which no one can understand. The special effects are fairly shoddy, giving how good they could have been.So `Stargate' is an inferior sci-fi adventure that could have been done a lot better. It easily watchable, but also equally missable to say the least. My IMDb rating: 4.7/10.",Stargate

Overall it's not a bad action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi movie. How they use the dramatic music at times to try and build suspense is laughable. Good acting and special effects with an ok plot about teamwork, standing up for what is right and fighting for freedom.CONTENT ADVISORY: A scene near the beginning shows the grief for an accidental suicide with a firearm that happened sometime in the past. Fighting includes automatic firearms, handguns, extensive hand-to-hand combat, alien staff weapons that shoot explosive blasts and a bomb. Many people and aliens killed in battles, dead bodies with some blood quickly shown on screen. The most gory part is near the end, an alien is decapitated and the bottom of the head and neck is shown after the fact.

Our intrepid military, accompanied by the mandatory nerdy scholar, go through to check it out, and to cut it off. Pretty standard stuff for sci-fi. But that is where the similarities end.The pacing and performances carry us clear of the doldrums of the usual endless sci-fi techno-babble explanations (which it wisely avoids) and takes us through the story with great visuals and elaborate production values without missing a beat. One is transported to this far away world and its struggle in quick time, enjoying every step of the way. No doubt we could find loads of symbolism and analogy in the story and its telling. But, who cares? We are just enjoying the ride.Kurt Russell and James Spader are perfect and polar foils for each other, without hitting us over the head with their differences or back-stories. Viveca Lindfors excellently underplays her role as a connection to the original discovery. Jaye Davidson is delicately menacing as, essentially, the Ming the Merciless character. One only regrets he is not on screen more.A thoroughly enjoyable sojourn in escapist entertainment, incredibly, with not one boring part! See it.",Stargate

The acting is B A D--which means the directing was B A D also. And there is nothing about the scenery or action worth remembering either. So what's the catch? There is none. I simply liked the film. Go ahead, call me a hypocrite, I won't care because as bad as this film is, I loved every cheesy minute of it.James Spader's character is a likeable dork. And Kurt Russel's character is a totally contemptible ass. (The rest of the cast don't matter!) Kurt does his best impression of Snake Pliskin in this film, but it just didn't work well. He should have tried a more subtle approach à la Jack Burton, but Stargate was not intended to be a comedy. A farce, perhaps, but not a comedy. The scenes of the military guys walking with their weapons alone are enough to make you laugh your ass off, or vomit. I chose the former.Bottom Line: Stargate is just one of those films that you either love or hate. So don't read any of the reviews between 3 and 8 because the reviewers probably didn't see the film.

This is one of my all time favorite films. Everything in this film makes me appreciate it. From the great acting ensemble. To the amazing CGI that still holds it ground in today's cinema, to the incredible story. With a lot of people saying that it has similarities with Star Trak is just nonsense. While Star Trak is set in space, and deals more of racial sub topics and is more of a political drama based show/ movies. Stargate deals with other planets and Earth, not much in space. and it focus on ancient religion and believes of help from other beings.The story of the rings being used as gate way travel to distant worlds is pretty Awesome, and the film is also very smart on how they achieve communication between all the different species by having them all have some ancient language in common as they all have ancient gods who they fear or believe in.This is an incredibly awesome film, with some really cool action scenes, very well written dialogue and really great acting from Kurt Russell and James Spader",Stargate
95,joshi_3592,"A gravely underrated movie, that spawned a great franchise",9,14 August 2009,"Even if you're not a fan of the Stargate series, this is an exiting Sci-Fi film, with a never tried before idea. Unlike most Science fiction were the characters have to travel around in spacecrafts, in this film they simply step through a wormhole, and saves us the time often spent in other films on space-travel and brings us straight to the action.Another intriguing part of the film is that it is based on the ""aliens built the pyramids"" idea, which to my knowledge has never been done before. it also takes place in the present day (well 1994) and the main characters consist mostly by military officers from the US Airforce.Personally I'm a fan of the TV series Stargate SG-1 and I prefer Anderson and Shanks in the main roles, but I can't deny that Kurt Russel and James Spader gave us a strong performance and set the basis for the characters of Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson.Another great thing is that the film has spawned three spin off series: Stargate SG-1 with the same characters (not same actors, except Skara and Kasuf) Stargate Atlantis and the newest edition Stargate Universe. The Stargate franchise has already started to reach the same size and popularity as even Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.So for all of you who have just seen this film and liked it, I advice you to take a look into the TV series. Start with Stargate SG-1 the children of the gods, I can assure you'll love it and will want to see more.",Stargate

The FX is awful, that acting even worse--Kurt Russell gives the most dominant, WOODEN performance of his career and James Spader makes me want to get an insulin injection--He's so sugary little boy cute when I wanted a solid plot, or one plot twist and---Oh I forgot what I else wanted other than I wanted the film to end and I had such high hopes walking in!

98,CinefanR,"Atmospheric, visually stunning sci-fi adventure",10,12 June 2012,"I liked it then and I still like it now. ""Stargate"" is far better, in my opinion, than most of the top sci-fi movies, including the Star Wars. What makes it a great experience is mainly its atmosphere. The visuals are outstanding and special effects are used intelligently for once, which is one of the reasons why ""Stargate"" remains timeless. The set design, costumes and soundtrack (obviously an homage to ""Lawrence of Arabia""), the vast alien landscapes so similar to Earth yet clearly different, make it a classic sci-fi epic with a genuine ""otherworldly"" feel. There is a fascination and a sinister vibe throughout that will keep you curious as to what's coming next, even if by midway you'll probably know where things are going. There are no weird, stupid-looking extraterrestrials and techno/futuristic babble, which is always a good thing. Roland Emmerich's movies are a guilty pleasure, but this one is special. There's no time like the 80's and the 90's, and maybe that's one of the reasons too. The actors, particularly James Spader, but also Jaye Davidson in a bizarre, delightfully over-the-top appearance, are very good in their roles, and these performances are great fun. This is not a film to be over analyzed; you just enjoy it for what it is: sheer escapism of the best kind, Hollywood-style. There is pure entertainment in its simplicity, and also a certain innocence. It never gets old, and to those who were kids when they saw it in 1994, ""Stargate"" comes with great memories.",Stargate
99,ElessarAndurilS,Best movie I've avoided for 20 years,8,16 June 2014,"Being a Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis TV series fan you would think I would have watched this movie long ago. For some reason I didn't think the movie was tightly coupled with the series and I avoided watching it based on a bad preview seen many years ago. I finally forced myself to give it a chance after all this time and was pleasantly surprised to find one of the best Sci-Fi movies I had never seen. The movie is the foundation for the SG-1 show (duh) and ties directly into the first season of the show. The big screen special affects made for a thrilling ride and for once the SG team when combined with the indigenous people represented a sufficient force for an uprising against a foe with more advanced technology. Nice to not have a mother ship carrying 40 times the number of fighters than possible to making the fight a winnable one. So as it came down to the end when the people rise up against RA and they clear the way for the team to beam the bomb onto the ship and blow it to pieces it may have been a familiar story, but with many important differences. RA's forces were not overwhelming so that their being free to get to the bomb/stargate was believable. RA was a kid with the arrogance of 1000's of years experience kicking mankind's rear so it seamed feasible that he would see no threat in the small team. Also nice that being a techno thief of more advanced technologies he would understand what a nuclear weapon was. Overall a good story laying a good foundation for the series. Nice to see the dork version of Dr. Jackson fumbling around with how to speak a dead language instead of just walking up and being fluent in ancient Egyptian making for a more realistic backdrop to the whole story. There were gaps in the story as a movie, but with it being the basis for a TV Series those gaps were perfect so the series had questions to answer and a reason for SG-1 to need to start up and follow up on what happened 10 years earlier given the chance. Quite simply a very pleasant surprise of a movie that after watching 10 seasons of SG-1 and 5 of Atlantis filled in some blanks with the force of a big screen movie that stands on it's own as good entertainment.",Stargate

All of this would have made a decent comedy if the whole film was not so self-infatuated and pompous!At least this film has this quality: it's so ridiculous that if you feel a bit down, just look at it and you'll see how marvelous, clever and precious you are.",Stargate

103,feyipuk,Sci-Fi that's more human,9,22 February 2014,"The big thing about this film is that the ""Stargate"" is both central to the story, but - compared to Iron Mans suit or Captain Kirks ship - it's actually a relatively minor device in the film, enabling the characters to get to where they're going, without being bogged down in the technical details of traveling to or being on an alien planet. As a result, they can spend their time developing the characters, in particular Kurt Russells Colonel O'Neill, and James Spader as Daniel Jackson. Russell is a grumpy, retired Colonel, with a hair cut that you could sharpen scissors on and sorrowful back story. James Spader is a bespectacled archaeologist and linguist, whose theories on ancient civilizations are laughed at by the rest of the archaeological community. It's not hard to guage that Kurt will beat up any opposition he comes in contact with, while James will want to find out all he can about it, which makes them a good match. Add in to the mix the gorgeous, and not over done, special effects. The sound track that adds to the tension and atmosphere. And a relatively small supporting cast (such that they get a decent amount of screen time), this film has a good mix of science fiction for aficionados and human interest story for those that don't. It seems to be very under appreciated given the dynasty it spawned.",Stargate
104,dwr246,Amazing how such a good series can come from such a BAD movie,3,4 April 2006,"I'm a big fan of both Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis, which is probably because I was exposed to both of those series BEFORE seeing this unfortunate mess of a movie.The story told here is that the stargate was discovered in the 40's but it took over 50 years for someone to come along who could figure out how to use it. The person who does so is an archaeologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader), who discover that the symbols on the gate can be used to call up the ""address"" of a planet. Scientist Catherine Langford, (Viveca Lindfors) discovers that the gate sets up a ""wormhole"" through which people can travel great distances in almost no time at all. The military takes a keen interest in the gate, and sends Jackson through with a military unit commanded by Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Unfortunately, once they arrive on the planet at the other end of the gate, Jackson is not certain if he can figure out how to send them home, causing the rest of the unit to become understandably, but unsympathetically, annoyed with him. Jackson also discovers that the planet is populated with humans who speak something very close to ancient Egyptian. He is able to communicate with them, and they befriend the Terrans. When their God, Ra (Jaye Davidson) returns, he is less than thrilled with the Terrans, and punishes both them, and the natives for helping them. However, both the Terrans and the natives have more than a few tricks up their sleeve for dealing with Ra.While the story is as well written as any plot for the series has been, that's about where the similarity ends. The acting in this film is simply atrocious. Russell is a talented man, but his O'Neil is so bitter that I could feel no sympathy for him. Spader as Jackson was just annoyingly dorky. Things were not helped by the ever annoying French Stewart in a mercifully small part. Most offensive, however, was Jaye Davidson as Ra. Prancing around like a spoiled adolescent girl, Davidson's Ra was more ridiculous than menacing. Oddly, the only really good acting in the movie came from those playing the natives of the planet visited. Erick Avari, Alexis Cruz, and Mili Avital all turn in fine performances.While the concepts of the film were interesting, the execution was unforgivably poor, which is only further highlighted by how well the television series has been done.

105,RestlessRust,This movie gets worse the more I think about it.,5,17 January 2001,"*** Possible spoilers ahead ***   I saw this movie on DVD years after it's theatrical release, but I still remembered the previews I had seen.  Those previews instilled in my mind a vision of a great civilization, highly reminiscent of ancient Egypt, on which the Egyptians had based their society.  This movie was nothing like that, and what it was did not make up for my disappointment.  Stargate is a generic Sci-Fi flick, pure and simple: Meet the bad alien who was banished from one world only to make slaves of the people on another planet.  He's more powerful than the good guys, but maybe, if they all band together, they can use his own advanced technology against him.   On other notes, I find it hard to believe that in the period of 4000 years or so that these people didn't manage to rebel against Ra.  I mean, 4000 years is a long time.  That really bothered me while watching this movie.  That, and the fact that, despite Ra's cruelty, none of his slaves even seem to consider a revolt.  At least, not until the smarter (though not necessarily intellectually superior) humans convince them there is a better way.   Then, of course, there's the stereotypical town leader who can't fathom doing anything differently than what has been done for the last few millennia.  And what a surprise!  When people try to tell him he's wrong, he throws a fit and says they'll be sorry.  And wouldn't you know it, he gets a chance to say, ""I told you so,"" but nobody listens to him because he's still wrong.  Gee, I wonder if he'll have a change of heart in the end.   And I wonder how long those no-name soldiers will last.  And I wonder what the loner scientist who falls in love will decide to do in the end.  I wonder if that high-tech elevator will come in handy.  Do you think the good guys will make it back home?  Couldn't they put even an ounce of suspense in this movie?  Oh, and it's a good thing such a highly advanced civilization as Ra's still uses buttons and switches.  Otherwise his primitive slaves (and those puny humans) might be at his mercy.

The story is a bit rushed, but is still very satisfying, the actors are perfect for there roles and the special effects are very good. Also, this movie takes the time to create an interesting sci-fi universe. It never is as good as movies like Star Wars or Blade Runner, but it should not be compared to those classics. It's also much better than another recent Egypt-inspired movie: the horrible Indiana Jones  rip-off The Mummy.

Kurt Russell isn't going to get an Oscar any time soon, but he will always get work, a good, solid actor in this genre. As usual, pacing is critical. I'm surprised that few reviews mention this, especially for action films. Editing is crucial, as is a good script in which the actors don't stand around explaining things to the audience. True, sometimes shot length falls to below 2 seconds, and that gets a little jumpy. Here, the average seems to be about 3.5 to 4 seconds (I couldn't find the info), and that works, just enough time to see the reaction on the actors' faces, not enough to see that they are not communicating a whole range of emotion. Also, the segues and fades are deftly handled. The mark of a good movie, for me, is that I don't get tired of seeing it again, and sometimes again and again. This is one of those movies.",Stargate

Tension built up well – until the technologically advanced 'Ra' aliens were revealed, then the story became predictable. Good special effects throughout, although the digital morphing effects (retracting Egyptian death mask helmets and the close-up of the stargate vortex) could have been slightly better. I liked the space warp effects seen after passing through the stargate. Production design was very good. Good pyramid spaceship and sand storm effects. Very good creature effects. Interesting feeling of power and massive invincibility, conveyed by the 'hi-tec' Egyptian sets. Good use of humorous situations throughout. Although the film was non violent, there was a feeling of terrible violence 'just around the corner'. Apart from the main 'matter transportation to another star system' plot, other themes involved slavery, regeneration of body after death, a love story, a nuclear bomb (arming and disarming) and ancient 'gods' having vast technological powers.There seemed a lack of surround effects (due to the small cinema I was in?), and there was a lot of predictability in the second-half of the story. The film was not over hyped on release, but I had built it up in my mind to expect a better film.The subsequent TV series (especially from season two onwards) was really excellent.",Stargate

114,jtwcosmos,Stargate (1994),7,1 June 2011,"""Colonel O'Neil, why are you here?""""I am here in case you succeed.""This is the story of the most important discovery man has ever made: the gateway to heaven (and back, hopefully).The movie starts with the introduction of the main characters - obviously enough - and of the main plot. It is the most absolutely fantastic introduction, and the opening credits are captivating, featuring some of the most stunning and iconic art work and musical scores ever created. The story moves fast, there is almost no time wasted, the scenery is great, the premise is intriguing and all the elements for a great movie are there.Alas, as the story progresses past the Stargate itself, the story turns from great to... well... not so great and it loses some of it's appeal but that is OK, because it is obvious that the story was targeted at a younger audience and when I first saw the movie, it was just mind blowing.The actors do a good job, mostly. Kurt Russel is the tough military guy with the ridiculous haircut, James Spader is the cute, brilliant but clueless geek, and the rest are either boring, cliché or not important (Mili Avital is cute, though). There are also some unfortunate choices, which spoil and ruin the feel of the movie, a little.The image is great, the sets are fantastic (well... except for the village of the damned which is... less than fantastic). The music is brilliant, the fight scenes are dumb and... that's it! Oh, wait, there are special effects too, and they are great, really great.Stargate.

I didn't like the ones I was supposed to like or dislike the ones I was supposed to dislike, I simply did not care about their situation at all.There's nothing overtly bad about it, it's just a non-entity. I found myself doing the ironing during this movie - that's how boring it is.The only vaguely interesting facet of this movie is David Arnold's score, which rips off/alludes to (test of your cynicism here) John Williams' Star Wars scores more times than I could count. I always thought he only ripped off/alluded to John Barry - which he does infinitely better.Oh, and Kurt Russell's haircuts are hilarious. At the start he has this sort of pseudo-surfer mop going, but later sports a classic military short-back-and-sides look with a an upright flat top.

117,anifanmc,The beginning of a fantastic voyage,9,21 February 2008,"Being a longtime fan of the Stargate franchise, I will admit that I am slightly biased. However, this movie introduced me to the rest of the franchise and spurred me to watch the show, something that I was not inclined to do beforehand.Due to its relatively low reviews initially, I didn't intend to see the film at the time of its release. I was a kid, and I had just seen Star Wars, i wanted space battles and stuff blowing up and lasers. The movie Stargate is nothing like that, although the show has progressed slightly in that direction. It's about an epic journey which starts with the struggles of an archaeologist whose controversial (and often ridiculed) viewpoints turn out not only to be true, but the foundation of his work sets the tone for the future of the human race. The twist here is that he studies something so old - Ancient Egypt - without the understanding that his work is actually setting the foundation for something far, far more grand.So enters Daniel Jackson, the true protagonist of the film. He is recruited by the US Air Force into deciphering the hieroglyphics upon an eponymous structure known as the Stargate. He discovers that the symbols are six star addresses formed by different constellations which pinpoint locations in space, with a seventh point of origin. Using this knowledge, a team led by Colonel Jack O'Neill (O'Neil in the movie, but for the sake of continuity, leave it as such) along with Jackson ventures through the Stargate and finds a new threat - the ancient Egyptian God Ra is actually an alien lifeform who enslaved the human race in its infancy and transported many to this new world (later known in the show as Abydos).The most defining feature of the show is that, while old and somewhat archaic, sometimes clichéd, it has touching moments which many other sci fi films fail to include. The scene where Jackson and Shau'ri interact, trying to speak to each other without a common language, speaks more than dialogue. His interaction with Colonel O'Neill fairly significantly foreshadows their relationship throughout the rest of the series.All in all, a good movie that has been severely underrated by people trying to judge a film on the standards of hefty CGI, high-flying action, and impatience. It's not perfect, but it is one hell of a ride.",Stargate

Were they built by the Egyptians years ago, or did they come from some other place? Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (Spader) believes otherwise. He has some different ideas as to where the pyramids came from, or at least as to when they were built. He is mocked by his colleagues for his research, and generally thought to be a complete loony.He is eventually contacted by an elderly woman named Katherine who has a special assignment for him, translating ancient Egyptian. Since he has nowhere to go and nothing left to lose and no job, he takes her up on the offer and begins doing some research on a variety of ancient artifacts that Katherine has found. In two weeks he finally finds the key and informs everyone of his findings, that the symbols he's been trying to translate are actually star constellations that plot a course to another point in the galaxy. At this point he is informed about another artifact that was found with the tablets he has been studying for two weeks. Something known as the stargate. It's a giant ring that they have erected on a stand with symbols all along the track inside of it. The symbols are used to dial another stargate, and with the coordinates given to them by Dr. Jackson, they plan to do a little reconnaissance through the stargate.Leading the team is Colonel Jack O'Neil (Russell), a soldier with nothing to lose. A man who gets the job accomplished by any means possible. The plan is to go through the stargate, dial home and go back, but the coordinates for the return trip can't be found. They begin looking for other means of civilization in an attempt to find a way back home while some of the marines establish a camp by the stargate that they came through. Eventually they do find other signs of civilization and make contact.But then something shows up back at the base camp. Something that they weren't expecting. A spaceship docks on top of the pyramid, and strange beings take the marines that were left behind as prisoners. Eventually we learn that these creatures are actually the masters of the people on this world, and that they are in slavery. Since Americans are noble heroes, they help the people on a quest for freedom from their slave life. Plus they have nothing else to do, since they can't figure out a way to get back home.Out of the three movies I've seen by Roland Emerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and Stargate), I think I like this one the best.

A fine story ( believe it or not ), a fine cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack that stacks into your mind. Roland Emmerich is perhaps one of the best directors and the casting is superb.The visual design, artifacts and architecture are well studied. Though the story could be more mysterious and could leave some imagination to the viewer, it is well told.One of my best science fictions ever. Just watch it, you won't regret it.

And perhaps even the John Carter books too.It takes awhile for it to build up, but the set-up is enthralling, a neat spin on the Chariots of the Gods stuff about ancient astronauts and the like.Once Kurt and James are on 'Planet X', they and the team eventually discover humans living a nomadic existence, kept subservient by the sun-god Ra - who turns out to be a powerful despotic alien, but no God. Ra's henchmen too are simply big strong men, who happen to be kitted out with high-tech weapons and equipment.Things take a turn for the worse when Ra shows up, alerted to the activation of the Stargate, and Spader, Kurt and his men eventually find themselves leading a revolt, while at the same time racing against time from stopping Ra sending an explosive present through the Stargate to Earth.Not perfect, a little plodding at times, but fun undemanding entertainment.",Stargate

It's a great story that starts out in Giza in 1928 unearthing the alien device known as the Stargate, ending up with an airforce team going through the Stargate and meeting a primitive culture who still believe in the old Egyptian gods. It all seems to be going good thanks to a little pendant given to Daniel Jackson, then the pyramid where the second Stargate is begins to glow a little. There's a low hum, a spaceship lands on the pyramid, and we meet Ra, an alien who rules the planet as a tyrant.Anyone who enjoys sci-fi movies will like this one. great action, funny moments, interesting effects and great music.

125,epsilon3,Great Sci-Fi Action,7,21 March 2002,"I watched the director's cut of this movie on DVD recently and was quietly impressed. Make no mistake, it follows an action adventure format that we all know - American heroes save the world from nasty aliens. I know what you're thinking - sounds a bit lame right?In a way it is - it depends on what kind of films you like. If you enjoy exciting but implausible action, great stunts and effects, magnificent sets and a dash of humour - Stargate fits the bill. It's no classic and isn't the best movie of the action genre (True Lies, T2 or Aliens anyone?) but it achieves what it sets out to do, and that's the mark of a decent film in any genre. It's certainly better than more recent efforts including 'The Mummy' and the steaming pile of camel excrement that is 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.'Don't expect to be blown away completely, as some parts of the movie drag a little and there's the usual sentimentality (hero falls in love, good guys win against the odds etc.) Despite this, if you don't overly analyse it, you'll most likely enjoy it.

I also have to say that I am a huge fan of the TV series, which I think was handled much better than the movie. However, for what this movie is, and the actors they chose, this movie works amazingly well.  Spader is excellent, though Russell could have been replaced by almost any other action actor.  The representation of the language was done very well, something I wish they'd kept for the television series, and the history of the Stargate and the aliens is nicely thought out, and well-grounded in science fiction.

Rather, I give it a 6 cause it feels too short (apparently, I just heard of a 3 hour extended cut is in existence and would really help remedy this).In truth, Stargate is a lot of fun and worth watching. In fact, I watched it twice (again for the commentary).Love 'em or hate 'em, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have helped make some of the most entertaining disaster & monster flicks for this generation to enjoy. Pure fun is what I look for in a film every so often when I wanna stray away from the art-house and just watch something fun, and this is something Dean and Emmerich are generally very good at doing.Emmerich's original baby, which soon also became Devlin's, was the original smash hit that took audiences by storm. A mysterious gate found in the 1920s opens up a pathway to another world, but only one man can open it. And when he does, along with a crew of military personal (with their leader shrouded in a shady past), that's where the excitement begins.The special effects, which were state of the art then, are still relatively nice to look at now. Not all have passed the test of time, like the Anubus head changing guards, but for the most part are watchable. The visual quality of the film is reminiscent of films like Jurassic Park, glowy and lighthearted...yet at its core, dark and sinister.Besides the length, another thing that disappointed me was lack of character development for a few of the characters (which technically can be attributed to the length). I felt like the characters were very engaging and had some great moments here and there, but in the end I didn't think they had sufficient time to full develop into really likable characters. Had they gotten the time to do it (or released this supposed cut), I would've shot the rating up to an 8 automatically.The action itself is nothing REALLY special, it's typical Hollywood.

While your disbelief definitely needs to be suspended to cover some inconsistencies, the atmosphere and action of the movie make it worth your while.  Not only does Stargate combine science fiction with history, but it weaves them together in a way that remains exciting the entire film, despite major changes of environment.  Upon hearing some major elements of the film, one might think that aliens, ancient Egypt, and atomic bombs could only come together in some kind of bizarre montage.  However, this film is strongly plot-driven, and while this does make it typical in some respects, the plot itself is remarkable.  Hardly artsy, the score is in many places Hollywood-ish, presenting emotion in a straightforward manner, yet it too is enjoyable.  None of the acting is spectacular, but this is made up for by the characters' wholesome qualities and ability to change (however slightly) over the course of the movie.  To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure.

Afterall, outside of movies like The Mummy you don't see much about Egyptian culture on the big screen, and this being a sci-fi movie I had high expectations that we'd see some new ideas. Unfortunately it appears its just the Mummy with a slightly different skin...The first time I saw this in theater, back when it first released. I was young and naive but even then I saw through some of its clichéd plot devices. Still, it was hard not to like some of the effects and action sequences, even if they seem completely out of place for this kind of setting. I remember being blown away by the stargate sequence itself, but seeing this several years later I could probably whip the whole sequence up on my home PC in less than a day. Some props for the pretty cool masks that partly explain all the animal headed Gods worshipped by the Egyptian people.Too bad the writers felt the need to disregard any research (would it have been too much effort to hire an Egyptologist to look at actual writings and myths within the culture itself?). Had the Stargate shown us a time when the Egyptians were in full bloom it would've made for a much more enjoyable film than veering into alien territory. Lets take a look at the legend of Osiris and Isis for instance, now there's an area that could bear fruit.On the surface it may appear a great film to show an aspiring Egyptologist (in early teens), and maybe thats OK.

Jonathan O'Neil, who discovers there's still life after loss. Jaye Davidson in the role of Ra, is also memorable.Generally, the movie makes a brisk pace throughout, and there's a good mix of action, suspense and drama, none of it particularly exciting however, and the outcome is, as with most Hollywood Vs Aliens movies, entirely unsurprising.There are, as usual, one or two moments which, even considering the nature of the subject matter, stretch the imagination somewhat; for instance where the brilliant Dr Daniel Jackson, after being headhunted by the most eminent Egyptologists in the World to decipher the mysterious and apparently undecipherable hieroglyphics, casts a cursory eye across the runes and declares ""There you go."" to the utter amazement of all in attendance. Another being when Dr Daniel Jackson figures out that the last hieroglyph in the sequence used to switch the Stargate on just happens to be ""that one there"" (something which, apparently, couldn't have been discovered by a simple process of elimination in the 80 years since its discovery).Still, perhaps that kind of pickiness isn't in everybody.Overall, if you're looking for a piece of entertainment which doesn't require too much effort, I'd recommend it.",Stargate

It was a box office hit and even has a spin-off TVseries, so it is evident that this movie captured the imagination  of moviegoers worldwide. Special effects were fantastic as were the costumes of Ra's Guards.  Stargate wasn't a success on it's effects alone, the castingwas excellent, the acting above what one comes to expectfrom a sci-fi movie, plus it was just a damn good story.

150,PhilipJames1980,"Stargate, second-rate, not the first movie you'd want to see tonight.",6,14 January 2005,"Although it's hardly a good movie, Stargate is yet another one of those movies that I can't completely dislike because I was the appropriate age when I first saw it. With its elaborate special effects and action sequences, ridiculous yet imaginative plot and cheerfully broad characters, this is a movie that speaks to the fourteen-year-old inside all of us. And yes, I was fourteen when I first saw it on the big screen.First of all, this movie is basically a nerd's dream come true, with James Spader playing Daniel Jackson as the quintessential nerd who gets a chance to prove his theories about ancient Egypt when a woman working with the US government enlists his help translating some writing found on a mysterious artifact. Right down to the fact that he leaves his coffee mug perched on a metal pipe as he hurries into a meeting, Spader's performance is pitch-perfect.The whole first act is so good, as we watch Spader at work and the suspense builds toward the opening of the Stargate, that it's almost a shame the movie didn't make better use of the Stargate and give it a bigger payoff. A more profound film might have put the journey into the Stargate at the climax of the story, and the result could have been something like the mind-blowing trip at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the walk into the spaceship at the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.But this movie has other ideas, so Spader joins Russell and his presumably crack team of soldiers (we never really learn much about them) on a reconnaissance mission through the Stargate to explore whatever lies on the other side.SPOILERS AHEAD! My favorite shot of the movie comes when Spader and Russell walk a distance out into the desert that they find on the other side of the Stargate, then turn around and see that they've just walked out of a pyramid with three alien moons above it. It's the sort of simple yet striking visual that distinguishes the best science-fiction: it's done in the style of a pulp magazine cover, but it's intriguing and leaves a lot to the imagination.Unfortunately, the movie hits a snag at about the same time Spader does: finding a strange animal, he stands in the exact spot that allows him to be caught in the animal's harness and dragged, seemingly for miles, to the next location required by the script. This is a stupid plot device: I have no trouble believing in the Stargate, but I can't believe that Spader would suffer no serious injury from being dragged through miles of hot sand.A similarly tacky moment occurs when Spader befriends the chief with a Fifth Avenue bar, an obvious parallel to E.T. (not to mention an obvious bit of product placement). Indeed, the more this movie progresses, the more its patchwork quilt of ideas becomes apparent.When the bad guys finally appear, they come with a bewildering array of hardware that, impressive as it is, seems designed not to evoke ancient Egypt but to facilitate the sale of action figures and plastic play-sets to kids. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence, but even so there's something so irresistibly toy-like about this movie that it's impossible not to think that older children were part of the target audience.For the most part, the special effects and action sequences in this movie are still impressive even after ten years, but what's sorely lacking is a strong human element. This movie ""loses its way dramatically,"" according to Leonard Maltin, but it doesn't so much lose its way as it does lack a dramatic hook even from the very beginning.Characterization is a big problem: with the exceptions of Spader, Russell, and to a lesser extent French Stewart's sardonic soldier, none of the good guys in this movie have any real personality. Motivation, or rather its absence, is another problem: we never understand whether the soldiers volunteered for this mission or whether they were assigned to it, or how they feel about their situation in any case.My favorite scene is the one in which Spader questions Russell about why he came on the mission, and Russell simply says that his son died and he no longer thinks he has any reason to live. I had thought before I watched the scene again recently that Russell went into greater detail about how his son died, but my point is that we at least know how he thinks. Far too many science-fiction movies don't even attempt to explain their characters' motivations: just once I'd like to see a movie of this genre that explains why everyone's willing to do what they do.Anyway, like most other Roland Emmerich movies (notably Independence Day) Stargate has a great first act, a progressively conventional second act and a third act that goes overboard on action and special-effects spectacle. Basically the final reel of this movie turns into Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Stargate, with lots of shooting, blasting, exploding, punching and even a little attempted brain-frying thrown in for good measure.Despite its flaws, I actually like this movie better than most Emmerich efforts. It's a B movie like Independence Day, but not nearly as overblown. It's more energetic and imaginative than either Universal Soldier or Godzilla, and it's not nearly as pretentious as The Patriot.I haven't bothered seeing The Day After Tomorrow yet, because at 24 I'm feeling a little too old for the Roland Emmerich world of entertainment. But there are days, particularly when I'm thinking about Stargate, and how much I enjoyed it at age 14, that I wish I wasn't.Rating: 6 (I like it, but I can't quite recommend it.)",Stargate
151,michaeldavies335,A Great Movie...,9,27 December 2007,"This has to be one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Yes, like all movies it has its negative points, but, its up there with the best.A great cast, James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson is especially good in this filmk, Jae Davidson who plays Ra plays a 100% evil and realistic character.The whole storyline of an Alien coming to earth and creating the Egyptian culture by becoming a God, is in my opinion a realistic storyline. Personally as a believer in UFO's etc the film really does form a strong argument of how it could of happened.I have personally given it a 9/10 score, the graphics are still realistic since it was made 11 years ago.I am a minor fan of the spin-off show SG-1 but would of loved to have seen a sequel to this on the big screen!

152,Odysseus-5,"""What a ride!""",7,9 September 1998,"That quote from the film just about sums it up.  When I first saw this film, the let-down after the promising beginning almost made me give this film a thumbs down, but I find that it grows upon me.  What you really should have, though, is two stories.  The tale on Abbados (sp?) is very engaging and has quite a good deal of action that actually seems to hang together pretty good!  Unfortunately, how we got from the beginning to the main story nearly broke it for me with plot assumptions that you could drive a chevvy through.  Still, if you're willing to put aside that 15 or so minutes that just don't make sense when they first crank up the stargate, then you'll enjoy this one.  :-)",Stargate
153,pronoun36,Stargate review by Hogan Coad,3,5 April 2019,"Stargate is a 1994 science fiction action film starring Kurt Russell and James Spader as they venture through a newly uncovered portal known as a star gate.This device transports them to the other side of the galaxy. In order to get back to earth, they must overthrow an alien overlord and save an enslaved civilization. What underwhelmed me the most about Stargate was its severe lack of creativity. Take the film's setting for example- When I heard that the characters would be transported to the other side of the galaxy, I was excited to see what this world would look like. After all, it's the other side of the galaxy. Well, it turns out the other side of the galaxy is a giant sandbox as the rest of the film takes place in a barren, uninteresting desert. After this letdown, I thought to myself that perhaps the lifeforms the characters come across will look creative, since they are in fact an ancient alien civilization. I suppose this movie has never seen a a human wearing a robe since these are the character designs of the supposed aliens. I normally wouldn't single out these personal disappointments if there was enough story or character to keep me invested. Unfortunately, the chemistry between these characters is non existent. I felt no camaraderie between Russell or Spader and I felt no romance between Spader and the woman he later falls in love with on the planet. The villain is also incredibly boring and speaks in the same monotone voice throughout the whole film. There's also a lot of pointless story elements thrown in that add nothing to the overall picture. For example, Kurt Russell's character had a son who tragically killed himself while playing with a firearm. Aside from one admittedly well done scene with Russell and one of the young aliens, there is no reason to include this depressing backstory. It's never referenced again for the rest of the movie. There is yet another character we're introduced to at the very beginning of the movie who's built up as a very important character when she recruits Spader, gives him a necklace from when she was a child, and motivates Spader to walk into the star gate. I guess she wasn't that important after all because she vanishes from the story entirely. All these pointless inclusions are designed just to fool the audience into thinking they're watching something important and epic, when in reality the film just wants to show off its production and soundtrack. I kid you not, at least sixty percent of the film consist of long shots of structures or landscapes made for us to sit and marvel at for two hours. For me, that's not an ideal movie experience. I see a movie to become invested in a story that allows me to connect with the main characters. Stargate just feels like a cinematic hot pocket. It presents itself in a way that makes you want to consume it, but once you take a bite, you get explosive diarrhea.",Stargate
154,vrkolak666,A real classic!,9,2 November 2009,"I liked this movie from the first time I saw it, as a child. It fired up my imagination, to say the least :) There is ring that transports people to another planet, a scary alien with even scarier guards that pretends he is a god, and lives in a pyramid, and bunch of people brought from earth to be his slaves. And a lot of action, explosions, and drama...That's how i saw this as a kid. I simply loved it, but I never caught it on TV again, and Internet wasn't around then. Then i managed to find it on DVD, and said, I want to see it with grown up eyes, if it really was that good....And, re-watching I found out that it was even better. Now i saw that the acting was great, especially from Spader and Kurt. The directing, well, it's Roland Emmerich, that's enough said....The ideas in the movie are brilliant. First, about the stargate itself, the device that as it turned out, opened a new, fresh way of telling stories in sci-fi. Then, the god being an alien, pyramids being landing sites...Well, i cannot really say more than it's already said about it; the movie is a cult classic, it spawned 3 TV shows, and 2 direct to DVD movies as of today. I regret that Emmerich didn't make it a trilogy, maybe it would be more fitting (I didn't like the SG-1 series much), but I'm happy that we have this nonetheless :) I recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi, and even to those who don't, because I think it's hard not to find it interesting..",Stargate
155,cheesustoast,Implausible but fun sci fi - good intro to series,7,20 September 2014,"I think this is quite a fun movie but there are some very silly aspects to it. If it is not taken too seriously then it is not so bad.In 1994 the population of USA was over 260 million. Are we seriously supposed to believe that in an unprecedented event (like sending people to another galaxy) the US forces would send a bunch of red neck meat- heads from out of that massive population? These people are a representation of possibly the most stupid, trigger happy people on the entire planet... and these are the ones they send through a stargate! Is this supposed to give hope to high-school drop- outs? The only real exceptions are Dr Daniel Jackson and one of the soldiers (Brown). Even the Colonel seems like a complete meat head; he seems more like a guy who would never get past Sergeant let alone become an officer.Other than that it is quite an entertaining light hearted comedy sci-fi. The length of the entire series that follows this film (we are talking several hundred episodes) is evidence that this was a worthwhile premise. It is a good introduction to a great series. It will be noticed that all the series (even including SGU surprisingly) have a much higher rating than the film.",Stargate

Cast is really solid, Spader does a good job back when he played a lot of characters like this. Kurt Russell isn't given much to do but he is solid in his role. Supporting cast is very solid. Jaye Davidson still is an odd choice as RA, but it kind of works. Today they would have cast the Rock or someone for that role. Direction is solid, nothing spectacular. Musical score sounds like the Indiana Jones movies. Special effects are somewhat dated, but not terrible, still better than most of the CGI garbage that you see now.",Stargate

But once we have the characters going through the Stargate, all mystery and the promising plot goes lost. It's not that I don't like the plot itself it's more about the execution. The world seems interesting at first but then it doesn't feel as an alien planet as it should be. The same goes with the inhabitants and the enemy they find. It all just feels so flat when the movie ends. Had they gone even more hostile - strange planet with more great visual effects i think it would have worked better. Instead we get something we already know - a Egypt kind of place with mostly humans.

At first I thought the movie was about time travel since they go to a place that is like Ancient Egypt, which didn't really interest me at all. Then I caught an episode of the T.V. show and got curious. When I saw the movie I was blown away. The special effects were ones I had never really seen before (such as opening the Stargate for the first time). I was getting tired of seeing sci-fi movies where every alien race spoke perfect English and I thought I would experience that until the team met with the villagers which I thought was better. It's always cool to see Kurt Russel kicking ass in films. It was also different to see James Spader play the semi-nerdy guy instead of the asshole he mainly plays. I was also amazed when Roland Emmerich chose one of the simplest villains for a movie, an ancient Egyptian god. I watch this movie every week and I never get tired of it.",Stargate

Then again my love for the superb TV Series based loosely on the movie might be making me biased.Similar Movie: It's similar to any 90s action movie with a sci-fi twist. Which isn't saying much.

I thought the cast and the acting were great. Kurt Russell was excellent and James Spader is always great. Sadly the series is just ridiculous. I have a real problem seeing new actors trying to replace the ones in the movie. I thought the story was great and really can't see how anyone wouldn't like it. It is even pretty plausible. I tend to think though that this is one of those movies that is meant to stand on it's own and not have any sequels made unless they use the same actors. I also definitely think the series is pretty bad compared to this great movie.Keith,Stargate

IMO Richard Dean Anderson played Jack O'Neil much better than Kurt Russell and Michael Shanks a better Daniel Jackson than James Spader.

165,markjayaweera2003,A mid 1990s scifi classic,9,13 January 2021,"Where to begin. The main premise of Stargate is the raising of the interesting question. Did humanity's origins happen organically or was there some significant influence from an advanced extra terrestrial technological civilization from beyond the stars. The directors say yes and that they were far from benevolent and used humanity as a slave race.This would already get most scifi buffs excited and in the mid 1990s they went and saw this movie at the theaters in droves as well as Star Trek Generations which came out around the same time. Both scifi movies were extremely well-made and filmed in the vast movie sound stages in Los Angeles, California and the abundant desert landscapes that are within a few hours' drive in the neighboring states of Nevada and Arizona where the desert sun beats down hot and bright exactly as it would in Northern Africa or the Middle East, where giant sets recreating Ancient Egypt were built.James Spader found the plot of the movie so ridiculous he said he only did it because he needed the money. I wish I could have acted in a movie like that just for the money based in sunny southern California in 1994. If I should be so lucky. Sounds like the dream job to me. James Spader complaining who knew, clearly he was not a scifi fan. His partner the gorgeous Mili Avital who was even luckier landing the lead role in a major movie only after a year after arriving in New York from Israel to enrol in an acting course and discovered while being a waiter in New York. They both had the best roles and the best acting performances of the movie. Veteran Kurt Russel's role was disappointing, but he held his own. Together with Director Roland Emmerich they managed to craft a wonderful scifi movie that 25 years later looking back feels like a true movie classic. It had a great soundtrack as well from British composer David Arnold.The sets were great, the acting good. The story good and believable and there is a happy triumphant ending. Where the human slaves revolt and overthrow their Alien overlord. James Spader and Mili Avital decide that the more primitive simple lifestyle on the other side of the universe is more to their liking and decide to spend their lives together on that planet and probably got married and lived happily ever after. The movie launched Mili Avital's career and David Arnold's career. When this movie came out around late 1994, the golden age of scifi/fantasy movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s was long gone. During this time the 1990s scifi movies were not popular and truth to be told most were awful in the 1990s but Stargate was an exception as well as Star Trek Generations which relaunched the popularity of scifi movies no co incidence after this we saw a raft of big budget scifi movies getting released until the end of the decade which were box office successes and maybe convinced George Lucas to begin work on making those Star Wars sequels which he did at the end of the decade.
In conclusion Stargate is a wonderful movie and the love story between James Spader and Mili Avital is very believable and will no doubt have brought non-scifi fans in as well.

And why?The main characters: From the start I loved James Spader's and Kurt Russell's characters. Though different as they might be, it's very easy to get to like both of them. Not to mention the acting qualities of both the actors.The ambient: Ancient Egypt, Anubis soldiers, sand and pyramids, aliens, the people in the village, strange animals, all mixed with modern- day soldiers who are entering in this ancient and fascinating world with doubts and in disbelief unawares and wary of what might be expecting them.The story: There are no plot holes, everything is explained to an observing viewer. Not to mention the creators made a movie to an interesting theory.The villains: They could not have chosen a better actor than Jaye Davidson to portray the main villain. A pity Jaye had chosen to leave his acting career, because as many already have said, he could have made a great deal of another great movies with his talent.The costumes: exquisite ones, especially those of the ancient Egypt gods as Anubis and Horus and the main villain.To conclude, it's a movie definitely worth watching, with character development,intriguing plot, lovable characters and great ambient to put the story/theory in.

Th effects might not live up to today's standard but much better than other 90s movie and the concept and this whole idea behind the Stargate is interested and explored more deeply in the shows.The villain Ra (Jaye Davidson) also show a lot of promise early in the movie but unfortunately he can't live up to promise and was kind of an lackluster villain in the end. The villain is of course not the center piece in this movie, that is of course the Stargate and their journey to Abydos. On Abydos they meet Skaara, Sha'uri and Kasuf, these character has to band together and fight against both time and Ra. The movie isn't fantastic by no means but it's a great starting point for the three series that continue after the movie.Roland Emmerich is not a great director but somehow he didn't screw this one up, sure the first Independence Day is also fine but his other movies have been mediocre at best. David Arnold's score in this movie is very well done and really should be appreciated. It's not the typical sci-fi, action movie you have grown to expect over the year, but Stargate actually has a few layers to it.

Non military personnel or advisers typically carry an honorary Officers rank, and get that respect from everyone... quite clear the writers have no idea what they are doing... ruined the movie for me, all the high tech does not hide that fact. Funny thing is as far out as this seemed, there is a core of truth in the lost tech of ancient civilizations. Something main stream science and the feds would rather not have as common knowledge. All around us in this world there are amazing unexplained artifacts and yet we just believe we are the center of the universe...us and our god.... so naive it's laughable",Stargate
177,shuvcat-1,Better than the series,8,11 September 2005,"I saw this in the theatre in '94, it was awesome then and 11 years later I must be one of few who prefer the original movie over the spin off television series. Sorry, but I felt having stargates on every other planet kind of cheapened the idea. Not a huge fan of MacGuyver either. In my opinion the movie is far more impressive, possibly due to the superior special effects or the ""mystery"" of the Earthlings figuring out the gate for the first time.I'm the first to admit there are flaws-- the alien planet has not one but *three* moons which look EXACTLY LIKE OURS; a sloppy FX shortcut in a movie full of otherwise sparkling effects-- but they're forgivable in the face of a truly smart script connecting ancient Egypt and alien life-- only way they might have improved it was maybe to include something about Stonehenge. I'm a sucker for anything about ancient Eypgt so I was a perfect target for this movie. Also, it might be considered a premonition, as far as having the androgynous black/white sequined ""king"" surrounding himself with young boys... a whole year or so before Michael Jackson started really getting in trouble with the law. Yikes.In short, a great film. Beautiful sets, and fine acting from everyone involved. It's fun to see ""Harry Solomon"" from 3rd Rock From The Sun (French Stewart) in his first film role too.",Stargate
178,Hicks-10,INCREDIBLE!,9,4 August 1999,"A good sci-fi movie needs more than a bunch of action shots, it needs plot, thought and delivery.

A great rent for a rainy day.",Stargate
179,labcoatman,"Great premise, slightly flawed execution",7,26 September 1999,"Stargate's central idea isn't entirely original - aliens interfering with human culture in the past being mistaken for gods - but it is handled with finesse. Spader's Daniel Jackson is quite endearing, if a little too ""movie smart,"" while Russell's O'Neil is an interesting, if cliched and slight, attempt to put a spin on the dedicated old soldier standard. Ra, when we finally meet him, is a sight to behold; never has such a feminine young man been so imposing.The sets, costumes and effects perfectly capture the feel of the film; Abydos (the planet at the other end of the Stargate) might look like Egypt, but there's something about it that makes it much more distant than another continent.The only thing which really mars the film are its occasional descents into kitsch, including one of the death scenes later in the film, reduced to silliness by careless use of extreme cliche. While these moments are, thankfully, fairly well spaced, some of the dialogue also contributes, as do a couple of plot holes.But still, Stargate is good solid fun with a bit more thought behind it than usual, and it's a great foundation for the television series that followed - and improved - on the film.",Stargate

The actors were great including Alexis Cruz whom plays Skaara. (Cruz also plays Skaara in Stargate SG-1) I recommend seeing the Director's Cut because it follows more of the book and goes a little more in to detail about the characters.

182,Fred-146,"Great Premise, Poor Execution--*1/2 out of ****.",3,11 March 1999,"Let's imagine you walk through a giant ring that is filled with glowing lights swirling around. The next thing you know, you are being warped through a wormhole to the other side of the known universe. And after all that, you arrive to your destination, and what do you say? ""What a rush!""? That's line in ""Stargate"" that gives the perfect example of what is wrong with the movie. The filmmakers had an enormous opportunity to create a whole universe, but end up rehashing old action movie cliches and one-liners, instead of exploring the possibilities. Certainly, in a more intelligent film, the reaction of travelling across the universe would be much greater, and far more profound. All can give thanks to the Emmerich and Devlin team, who obviously believe that if you have lots of special effects, who needs a plot? ""Stargate"" had the potential to be a film like ""Contact"", a film filled with wonder that explored discoveries that would affect people all over the world. But no.Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an expert of Egyptian archaeology and hieroglyphics who is hired by the military to decode the writings on a mysterious artifact in the form of a stone ring known as the Stargate. I guess the military already read the script since they were ready to enter the Stargate before Dr. Jackson arrived to decode it, and there was no way for them to discover its purpose by themselves. What is also remarkable is how fast Jackson decodes the writings, and an expedition is under way--all in just a few minutes. The preparations for such an extensive and unexplored travel are handled on the same level as any of the adventures found at Disneyland. One of the crew members is Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a curious case, since the first time we see him, he is sitting in his dead son's room with a gun in hand as if he's going to kill himself. At that same time he is admitted, surprisingly, back in the military.After arriving on the ""other side"", they discover an Egyptian civilization that is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson), the Sun God.  Dr. Jackson, is able to communicate with them, although I'm sure their language should have changed drastically from the Egyptian language 4000 years ago. Not much goes on here, except the usual boring scenes in which the military guys try to blend in the new culture, the scientist falls in love the beauty, and everyone plots rebellion against their evil masters. We also learn that Col O'Neil's mission was to blow up the Stargate along with himself. What about his wife we saw earlier in the film? Does he care how his wife is going to feel, especially after they lost their son not long before? Does the military really send suicidal people on secret missions, even for the purpose of killing themselves along with destroying a prized possession?Let's go down the list of a few cliches in this movie: (1) the ""loser"" scientist who's hired for a special mission (Notice how when everyone walks out of his lecture, the one person who is interested hides and waits in the car outside, mysteriously, instead of just walking right up to him?), (2) a suicidal soldier in need of redemption, (3) a group of scientists talking a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about writings that they obviously know nothing about, (4) the love story between two unlikely people, who can barely communicate with each other, (5) a piece of jewelry with sentimental value, (6) a bomb with a read digital readout, (7) the action climax where all the good guys beat up the bad guys,  and (8) the old line ""Tastes like chicken"".The filmmakers obviously wanted (and have pretty much stated so) this film to be confused with great classics like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", simply because of the desert setting, I guess. If this film wanted to be an action film, why did it need to drag us all the way across the universe, only to end up in a fight with the bad guys? If it wanted to be a grand epic, why didn't it explore how the discovery of a Stargate could change the world? If a Stargate was actually discovered, do you think the military would be so casual in destroying it? Not a chance! It would be highly protected, and I'm sure many people would think of exercising the possibility of using it for colonization on other planets. What a difference the Stargate could make for humanity! The film, however, doesn't seem to even see this.
The acting in this film is mediocre. This film is perfect for Kurt Russell. He's used to playing such shallow roles. But I haven't a clue as to why Jaye Davidson, after ""The Crying Game"", would want to take part in this lame story. James Spader is also capable of much better roles. This film was just a huge waste of great potential. Indeed, its story is so cheesy and bizarre that I'm sure we'll be seeing it on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 in the next 20 years. This is a story that Edward D. Wood Jr., the worst filmmaker of all time, would have loved to film, and possibly could have written himself.",Stargate
183,twentyfour_fps,A sci-fi classic of the highest order,9,21 December 2008,"If ever there was a perfect sci-fi plot, Stargate has it. And a good script is the most important ingredient in a great film. Stargate has excellent direction, pacing, special effects and musical score. The only knock against it, in my opinion, is the unrealistic direction of photography in the lighting department. Some of the scenes are lit almost like TV sets, and a better job could have been done with creating more convincing realism throughout the film. But this movie makes no claims to be art. It is sheer grade-A escapist entertainment, and will stand the test of time along with other classics like Star Wars and Star Trek.",Stargate

Not that it was a terrible movie, it was decent, but the plot alone is almost enough to give it a 10/10 rating. It's a real intelligent thriller. You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or an Egyptologist) to enjoy it, but if you are, you will certainly find value in the quality story told here. It's so good, it's almost a waste of a story to make into a movie. This should have been a novel, or a series of novels, as there is almost no way to tell a story of this epic proportion in a 2 hour film, let alone a trilogy of films. Do not confuse this with Stargate SG-1 (though one of my favorite shows), it is not 'corny' at all like the TV series spin-off. I can't say much more, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. It's just one of those movies that you have to just 'experience' the first time, with no bias or prior knowledge of the plot. Seen the TV series? Doesn't help, but it won't ruin it for you either.

So here I am today, bored, searching for a movie to stream, and decided to watch it once again, with a clean slate and an open mind, hoping that maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea at the time, but now hopefully I'll find it entertaining (after all, it does have a decent rating on here).NOPE!This was even worse than what I remembered. Seriously! I couldn't wait for it to end and for some dumb reason I was hoping something was going to happen in its final act that was going to make it palatable, and somehow worth the time, but unfortunately, I was duped. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.I can see why Spader admitted to only doing this garbage for the money.",Stargate

We didn't really know the plot and I didn't even know Kurt Russel was in it until I saw him on-screen, so the whole movie was a total, and pleasant, surprise.The main premise of the movie, about alien races and Egyptians, is very interesting... but not totally fool-proof.  It holds up fine in this movie for me since it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a ""for entertainment purposes only"" kind of flick.

They must fight and outwit him to free the enslaved inhabitants to be able to return home.The film is action packed and features a great script. The special effects, while slightly dated, still hold up to this very day. The Stargate and portal effect itself is quite beautiful.

195,Randy-55,Why didn't they just show the first 20 minutes.,1,3 March 1999,"The first twenty minutes of this movie were extremely promising. Then the whole thing fell apart and seemed like a 'prequel' to 'Independence Day'. I would like to thank our Swedish contributor. I don't speak Swedish and thought that the language used was another 'made up' language that is used in 'alien' films. It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp, short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language, just make it up or find a language which is less-known. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film. They just disappeared. I would have much rather seen a movie about Lindfors life from the first discovery of the Stargate. I wonder if she was the Swedish coach? The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99% of the time, it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad. When a problem can't be solved, the Americans 'get out the guns'. Guns solve everything. (I am an American.) Jaye Davidson was very good in 'The Crying Game', but his character in 'Stargate' was as weak as the plot and gave no sense of the immense power he was supposed to wield. James Spader was, in my opinion, playing the 'cliche' genius, with a lot of little 'absent-minded' mannerisms which were supposed to make him 'cute'. I didn't mind his hair. Kurt Russell was another cliche. The way to bring him back from a deep and suicidal depression was to send him out on a mission.Then he gets to kill a lot of people, which makes him feel much better. Something that the army would never risk.   In the process,he finds a surrogate son in the Bedouin boy.  Give us a break!",Stargate

The US gov't is in possession of 'the stargate' (found decades earlier but a complete mystery until now) and may be able to activate it. What will we find on the other side? There aren't really any missteps in the movie: no over-the-top effects, exaggerated performances, bad lines, drawn out back-story, etc etc. The movie moves from point A to point B with confidence, without wasting any time or rushing ahead either. It's an even-handed movie where you're always interested in what's happening right now. Characters are believable and multi-dimensional but established quickly. This is not a character-driven movie; instead, your attention is held because you want to know what will happen with the stargate itself.There aren't any mind-blowing scenes or twists either. It's always good but never great. It comes down to this: the idea behind Stargate is an extremely entertaining one, and they never screw it up. What's not to like?",Stargate

They go into the Stargate and find an ancient civilization and then the poop hits the fan(i can't really give away any more story without it being a spoiler).

199,fahnenjoker,"Epic, but naïve sci-fi adventure, that is fun, but could have been so much more.",7,18 February 2018,"Stargate breathes this lighthearted and naïve 90s blockbuster feeling, an innocent a bit childish attitude you just can't be angry with. It is an original story before everything was a franchise and/or a comic adaption (even though it has kickstarted its own TV-franchise). It felt fresh and original at the time and still does. The visuals, practical and special effects and the cinematography look awesome, convey a monumental scale and have aged quite well. The soundtrack feels epic and unique, perfectly combining an Egyptian vibe with a sci-fi note, a mix of wonder and curiosity with the possible perils that lurk and might find you when you leave for uncharted waters. (Ok, I admit I have a weakness for good soundtracks. They really can, to a certain degree, save a movie for me.)James Spader and Kurt Russel fit perfectly in their roles as nerdy unworldly linguist and traumatized Colonel. They are mostly clichés, but relatable and even go through small developments throughout the mission. The rest of the expedition group is sadly wasted with the usual mostly nameless soldier stereotypes. Viveca Lindfors is intriguing as scientific leader of the project but sadly only appears in the first third of the movie. Jaye Davidson, finally, gives Ra the androgynous and godlike aura the antagonist needs.The first 30 or so minutes until we travel through the stargate and arrive on the other side are the best part of the movie. There is suspense around the stargate mystery and curiosity for the unknown it might lead to. In the middle part, however, the plot is treading water a bit and the resolution involves too much of generic action and the old good vs. evil. It feels like the story just doesn't live up to its full potential here. The setup of a gate to the other end of the universe (or who knows where else) promises more wonders and discoveries, than the movie can deliver in the end. That is my biggest issue with the story (I was expecting something more like the video game Outcast, that told a richer story with a similar premise, but was quite obviously inspired by this movie). If you can put that aside, however, then you're in for an enjoyable and simply fun ride, if a little pulpy and trashy.This is by no means a masterpiece, but a simple, epic sci-fi adventure with an old-school feel to have fun with. It had the potential to be more, but it's difficult not to enjoy it if you don't overthink it too much.",Stargate

The second thing that bothered me is really a little thing, but it is a pet peeve of mine. You know how when armed men move in on their target, how they always cock their guns? A lot of noise effects from that very threatening click-clack of metal on metal? Not that anyone would ever do that in real life, and it's only a movie, I know, and I can take some cocking of guns at inappropriate moments, if that's what's needed to convey an imminent fire fight. But I have never heard so much cocking of guns in any movie before. I felt embarrassed for the actors. It just went on and on. It even interfered with the dialog. OK, here is this soldier moving in on a target with great stealth until he catches his foe unaware, but still quiet though. Then right before he shoots, he shatters the silence by cocking his gun. I mean, gimme a break.",Stargate
208,sigs,Action packed...great sci-fi fun,9,16 January 1999,"Stargate is a very action-packed, adventurous, and fun movie to watch. The story line is very original and compelling. I found this movie to be very exciting. I was drawn into the world Roland Emmerich created and was astonished by the special effects and details of the far off Egypt-like planet. Stargate is an all around good movie, with almost everything a true sci-fi fan could ever want.",Stargate
209,silver_sparks2000,Good Plot,9,27 April 2002,"Stargate: The Movie was definitely not as good as the TV show that followed, but still watchable. James Spader makes the perfect (next to Michael Shanks) confused archaeologist in a military world. The plot advances and expands in the best way, and the ending is a good one - probable and possible, not far-fetched and unbelievable. It's definitely a good start, carried on through the many new ideas that Stargate SG-1 brings along in the next six years. Looking for ward to Stargate SG-1: The Movie, the general sequel to this one!",Stargate
210,revelation_11,the movie that never should have been a show,8,28 September 2008,Stargate for it's time even for now was an awesome piece of sci-fi Kurt Russel was a much better o'Neil than Anderson. Anderson added far to much comedy to the show he was to much of a Mcgyver rather than somebody who belonged in the military. The presence of the Ra was awesome it gives you something to think about especially with spader's presence and theory's in the beginning of film about pyramids and all. One thing I have to admit is that i wasn't really expecting a whole lot from this movie as i just saw it recently and was expecting it to be so much like the television show i thank god it wasn't. If you are a true sci-fi fan or even just an action fan this is o0ne that I would recommend in a heartbeat. Enjoy Russel and Spader as they make an awesome team in this action packed movie,Stargate
211,shanaboxer,The Best film I have seen,10,13 June 2009,I first saw this film when I was 17 years old. It had such an impact on me that it inspired me to want to become a scientist. Which I am now. Seriously this film is incredible a true masterpiece of its time. And gets no where near the credit it deserves. This film has it all 1)Really likable good guys 2)really evil bad guys 3)fantastic story which is original and creative 4)fantastic costumes and scenery 5)fantastic acting. Seriously If you want to watch a film that will let you escape into another world for 2 hours then watch this. I just wish they could have made a sequel with the original cast. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me. and I would recommend anyone to watch it for themself.,Stargate

He is supposed to be a Lt. but he is wearing the rank insignia(silver oak leaves) of a Lt. Colonel. I'm really surprised that nobody ever caught this, they must not have had a military adviser for this film. You would never address an officer by subordinate rank like addressing a Lt. Colonel as Lt. It is common military customs and courtesy to address an officer by the superior rank like addressing a Lt. Colonel as Colonel. You would never address a Lt. Colonel as Lt. so it is an obvious gaff that no one picked up on the mismatch between insignia and the rank of the character.",Stargate

214,Feather_of_Ma-at,Highly enjoyable overall,9,27 February 2003,"First of all, let me say that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies and popcorn flicks, and I also have a fascination with Ancient Egypt. Stargate incorporates all three of those, and I think that's partially why I like it so much. In my opinion, it's great entertainment. Sure, it may not be a deep, highly philosophical movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a fantastic movie to just sit back, relax, and be transported to another world for a few hours. Just a few quick highlights: Overall, I thought the acting was good. Not mindblowingly fantastic, but definitely good. I especially thought James Spader did a fine job as the geeky scientist Jackson, and Jaye Davidson was excellent as Ra. I also liked Alexis Cruz' performance as Skaara--especially the cigarette-smoking scene. I got a big chuckle out of that one.The score was a big highlight of the movie for me. David Arnold did a spectacular job here.I loved the creature effects! An earlier reviewer said, ""If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing {the Mastadge} would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable."" I totally agree with this comment. I'm all for computer animation (for example, Gollum in ""LOTR: TTT"" was superb) but I think there are some cases when it's just better to have ""the real thing,"" so to speak. This is definitely one of those cases.Overall, I think ""Stargate"" has just the right combination of fluff, special effects, ancient Egypt, and humor to be highly enjoyable. I give it a rating of three and a half out of four.By the way, if you like ""Stargate,"" I recommend buying the Ultimate Edition DVD that just came out. There aren't very many extra features, but the quality is excellent and definitely makes it worth the price.",Stargate
215,SashaWrites,"Culturally insensitive militaristic god-killers save the day, sort of",1,26 September 2011,"There is little point to going into depth on the obvious fairy-tale absurdities of individual scenes or actions. Rather, it's better to focus on what this film tells us about its audience's primal conceits: that we have the right, the duty, to inflict our cultural understandings on every other being in the universe.This movie is almost plagiaristically like an episode of the old ""Star Trek,"" in which Kirk and company discover a planetary garden of Eden. In that episode, the inhabitants are simple, have everything they need, know nothing of war or that sex might be evil, and pray to their God, Vaal. On occasion they go to the cave of Vaal and drop off some food obeisance. This seems to make Vaal happy enough to keep these folk in a state of bliss and harmony. Kirk and company don't like this situation, though, because the simple people are clearly ""slaves."" So, in their wisdom and benevolence, they shoot the Enterprise's phaser banks at the cave of Vaal and wipe it out. Kirk gives the dwellers a little lecture on how they will now learn to make their own decisions and be the happier for it.You can just see the delayed reactions of these former Eden-dwellers once they realized just what their ""liberation"" meant: toil, conflict, jealousy, eventually undoubtedly crime, poverty, environmental rape. ""Oh, thanks a lot, you guys! Yeah, we were simple but we had a preeeeeeetty good life, and all we had to do was drop off a little fruit. But I guess that a couple of pineapples was too much for you guys! All of a sudden we were 'slaves,' and you had to come along and 'liberate' us. Gee whiz you were only on our planet for three days; did that qualify you as experts in our culture? Did it ever occur to you that maybe we don't want to be like you? But, noooooooooo: you knew what was best for us; you couldn't have us bribing the gods to make things nice for us because this meant we had no 'free will.' You guys are JERKS."" Oh, but we have come a long way. Just about any child who's received an iota of cultural awareness education could probably tell you that what Kirk and company did was not particularly sensitive and was more than a bit ethnocentric. This Star Trek episode, after all, came to us forty years ago.So what is Stargate's excuse?Toward the end of the movie, the primitive people themselves decide that they can no longer be slaves, and must rise up against their god. As a linguist, I have to wonder where they got this word ""slave"" from. This is surely a word that would not exist in their language, since all of them, every one, was a ""slave"" in terms of working for Ra's benefit. The word ""slave"" would have been synonymous with the word ""human."" Can you imagine someone on our planet deciding that we had to rise up against ""God"" and take control of our own lives?Ra is portrayed as evil in a very human sense: despotic, sadistic, with an angry stare and a nasty temper. This is a being who has lived for thousands of years, traveled through every part of space, is so technologically superior to us that it can bend the laws of physics and accomplish nearly-instant intergalactic travel, and besides all that, started earth's culture. One would think the earthlings might be grateful, or at least curious. It might even seem reasonable that this being would be remarkably wise, well read, and not simply a petty dictator of some primitive desert-dwellers. The very idea that a being such as this would be trying to ""cheat death"" only to live in a barren castle with almost nothing to do for thousands of years, is a bit strange. But more hackle-raising is that this movie applauds when a mentally disturbed human military colonel in his mid-forties takes it upon himself to kill this ancient, super-intelligent, culture-creating being.The reasons for Ra's behavior are never questioned, though they may be godly and mysterious. Even the scientist assumes that what Ra is doing must be wrong, but does not say the obvious, ""You are thousands of years old, created my civilization, have been to many galaxies. I have so much to learn from you, and certainly have no right to judge your decisions. What's up?""The cultural arrogance of this movie is not a matter of political correctness. It is a matter of seeing we still believe that everyone should have the same social structure and political beliefs that we have, that we have the right to judge - quickly - and then inflict our will upon creatures who are different from us.In the most optimistic way, I might suggest that this movie is showing us not general human thinking, but general military thinking. In Stargate, the scientific and cultural discoveries are hidden from the masses by a clearly arrogant military structure, acting on its own without any sort of outside perspective or accountability. The first group sent through the gate was a half dozen grunt soldiers who were clearly incapable, by their training, of an interplanetary/intercultural mission. The colonel's preposterous mission was, ""If you see anything that scares you, nuke everything."" If the film had been a lampoon of this kind of decision-making, if it had taken a moment's perspective for someone to ask if maybe Ra was smarter than the colonel and if maybe the peasants would be happier mining the mineral for Ra, than in possessing guns and the free will to use them, then the whole precept would have been worth it. Sadly, though, the script does not diverge for one single moment away from its applause of the military actions taken, from the heroism of the humans for destroying the social fabric they entered, from the righteousness of killing the god.",Stargate
216,joeycopsantarossa,Dinner Time,10,5 January 2014,"Stargate is a great sci fi series. Most sci fi shows in the last couple decades have all been rehashes of stuff that has already come around or just remakes and reboots like all the different Star Trek spinoffs and ripoffs. Stargate was a new idea with a fabulous new way to travel between worlds or maybe even time, it is not clear until the end of the story exactly what was happening and that is a great thing about it, it is not predictable at all. Russell and Spader are great in this movie. It of course spawned spin off series SG-1 and Atlantis and the latest series in the universe which unfortunately ended on a cliffhanger. Hopefully they will revisit this world and story some more with future projects.",Stargate

218,Kimmel34,"If You've Got the Patience, Give This One a Shot",9,17 June 2001,"Read the script for Stargate, and you can see why someone would have liked to have made this movie.  It is simply a well written film about rebellion in a futuristic place(a bit like Star Wars?)  Yet, upon watching the film, one's opinion of the story may begin to suffer, if only slightly. Although the acting leaves little to be desired, the special effects at times appear too amateur-like, as if this was a made-for-television film.  At times it moves a bit slowly as well, and it seems as though they tried to fit too many ideas into one film.  Perhaps Stargate would have been better suited for a trilogy. It was easy to shrug off my small complaints however, as the film drew to a close in what I consider a spectacular ending sequence.  Science Fiction fans (especially Star Wars fans, such as myself) should give this one a shot, but the movie is not for everyone.  Many of the people I spoke to did not speak as highly of this film as I do, saying that it drags on too long and the story is not developed enough.

The initial premise was weak (why didn't they just keep turning the wheel until it worked?) and the ending was predictable. But the major problem was the trip between the start and the end was so dull.And why, whenever marines appear in a movie, is there always one called Kowalski??On the plus side, the graphics are very good. The flushing-down-the-U-bend travel scenes are effective, and the watery toilet bowl that they climb into is effective. Also I love the guards helmets that fold up very nicely indeed.I haven't read the other comments yet, but I suspect there will be a lot of positive ones because the special effects are quite good. But please, trust me on this, IT'S A BAD FILM. If you are going down to the video store, consider reaching for something else like Independence Day (made by the same people, full of flaws, but a roller coaster ride and lots of fun), Contact (similar space travel scenes to Stargate, but much more intelligently carried out) or even The Mummy, which is about as inaccurate on Ancient Egypt (why do they have pyramids in Thebes...???) but it has more laughs and action on the way.",Stargate

An unusual role for James Spader, who plays a somewhat nerd-ish linguist Daniel Jackson and becomes involved in a government plan (faulted as it is) to attempt to contact another world through the ancient teleportation device Stargate.Also a notable performance for Kurt Russel, who portrays a venerable military colonel who is 'reactivated' after losing his only son to a freak gunshot incident.  A contradictionto some of his other 'shoot-em-up' roles, his character O'Neil has some depth and is certainly worth a watch.Overall, a good casting job as well as some creative cinematography and historical foundation make this a jewel in the sand of teen horror movies and their sequals.",Stargate

Not because his previous role in that outstanding riveting drama thriller ""The Crying Game"", but of all this bullshit subject about alien possessed a human body and turn him into sexy creature then left a gate that could transfer things into the universe, he is the only one who seemed visible and made the movie is worth watching. Even that great pyramid flying saucer couldn't compete with his many sexy angles.Wonder if the director or the scriptwriter were surprised at that moment by the sight of that sexy character and found him more beautiful than Cleopatra. So they got confused and totally forgot their previous plans or what(?)...and brought this movie into disaster! See today science fictions or thrillers that more or less were influenced by that sexy character with their beautiful black women (or they thought beautiful), that were curved, mold and formed into roles that were quite similar with that sexy character.With only one cattle picked from novel 'Alien vs Predator' (1989), then shared the rest of the elements in the novel with another science fiction movies. Sigh.... What a pity.But really cool, though. That role must be intended for that sexy character, and that works for me, with led me to wander that this movie actually was made for him.

Why pyramids exists or why they're shaped the way they are.Another perspective pictured in this movie is how mankind has been ruled by a demagogue, typically given the properties of a god from the observers perspective. This usually resolves in revolt as people are suppressed, much like our history.Great atmosphere and artistic filming. I especially like the introduction, mid- and ending scenes. The ending feels very much altruistic for the main characters. This movie has same caliber as Star Wars IMO.Some scenes could have been given more time to evolve and not been so cropped as they where.

I found the soundtrack to the movie to be quite impressive, and I do think that the composition does not receive as much credit as it is due. The acting was decent for the film and the set production to be very impressive. I did find that there was something to be desired with the character Jack O'neil, who in the TV series gets developed further; however, in this movie he seems to be a very flat character that had the potential for more.

Present day (1994) a down and out of luck archaeologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is offered a job with the Airforce; deciphering the hieroglyphs on cover stones that were found on top of the artefact. His task is made difficult by the introduction of Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) whose strict and by the book attitude clashes with Dr Jacksons nerdy personality. Together these two discover the wonder of the artefact named 'Stargate' and where they discover unexpected friendships and find themselves in the process. The story is one of adventure on the surface but when you look closer; it's actually a story of relationships, of becoming the best possible version of yourself, of fighting to become that person. Every scene has importance to the whole story whether you notice it or not. The start of the film shows us a necklace that is discovered with the 'Stargate'. The relevance of this insignificant object becomes more important as the story develops. The interesting aspect of the film is how relatable the story is; it's set in reality and has the additional references to ancient Egyptian culture and the Pyramids. The story also shows us the fear that is created by the unknown.""Track down any signs of possible danger; if found any blow up the Stargate""The importance of the relationship between the characters is shown throughout. The developed respect that grows between Dr Jackson (James Spader) and Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that is intertwine between the friendships that are created between Dr Jackson and Sha'uri (Mili Avital) and Jack O'Neil and Skaara (Alexis Cruz). Both these relationships help them overcome past perceptions and experiences. All the actors are perfect for their roles, with little limitations in their performances, each characters are lovable in their own particular way.

""I don't want to die, it's a shame you're in such a hurry to""For a Sci-fi film there is limited amounts of use of special effects but when used the effects are appropriate for their scenes; in particular the horizon and wormhole effects from the 'Stargate'. With the addition of the craft of the music that fits to perfection to every scene; where the opening credits are a relatively slow start the music builds suspense and intrigues the audience. The composer for the music makes every scene perfect; whether it is gentle, fast, rough, soft the tempo is perfect throughout the film. The director knows the story and has the foresight to know exactly how to produce the scenes to their imagination; an advantage of being one of the writers as well.

I have seen it multiple times, and each time I get something new from it. It is a beautiful work of art (The Director's Cut is also a must-see, because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points) Now, I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable, exciting, riveting, and thought-provoking film.First of all, David Arnold has to be recognized for his masterful soundtrack. He should have won some kind of award, like Hans Zimmer won for Gladiator. David Arnold combines themes of romance, adventure, and wonder the likes of which I have never heard. (And believe me, I am an avid fan of movie music, especially Sci-Fi) I am even brave enough to say that his music in Stargate rivals classic, celebrated soundtracks such as Star Wars (John Williams) Next time you see the movie, pay as much attention to David Arnold's music as you pay to the plot. The opening titles themselves are reason enough to rush to the store immediately and buy the soundtrack. My favorite sequence of the soundtrack, by the way, is (#21 Myth, Faith, and Belief) In the movie, this is the scene where Daniel (James Spader) talks to Ra (Jaye Davidson) It is the scene right before the one where Daniel is *almost* forced to kill the soldiers, including Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) that he arrived with.Second of all, this is a VERY believable science fiction film. Most films (like Star Wars, Star Trek, and more) don't have very many ways in which they can actually tie-in with reality. Stargate is in itself a theory. It asks: Where did the pyramids come from? How did the Egyptians develop their gods, and how were they influenced? The answer given by the film to these questions is entirely feasible. Even though the gate itself isn't easy to accept, the underlying theme to the movie is. (pay very very close attention to Daniel and the ""seminar"" he gives about 10 minutes into the movie in front of other scientists)Third, and last, I would like to tip the hat to Jaye Davidson's performance. His portrayal of Ra is chilling.(although some people don't seem to agree) Just hearing him speak and seeing his eyes glow sends shivers up my spine. He makes a perfect villain, and it is truly a shame that he hasn't been in many other movies.This movie receives from me an easy 9 out of 10. It would have gotten a 10 if it were not for the horrible lack of character development. Jack O'Neill is especially bland, although he does seem to brighten up a little bit in the last scene.
See the movie! Buy the soundtrack! And I hope you liked my comments!",Stargate

The first time I saw it I was amazed of how well done this movie was. And now when I have become a Stargate SG-1 lover, I can't help but to love this movie even more! Too sad it's probably going to end after the sixth season, but there is a rumor that it will come another movie to end the whole Stargate...let's hope so! But till then! This is one of the best movies ever made!",Stargate
246,nebski,"A Simple, yet very Entertaining Piece",10,9 November 2002,"The mix of antiquities and sci-fi, which are two good marketing elements of a marketable movie, is where Stargate got the moviegoers' attention. Simple the plot may be, the premise (though quite questionable to the archaeologic community) is plausible enough to mystify the audience. The effects are good, if not exceptional at the time the movie was made. And the elements used for the movie are enough for the audiences to relate. While personally not being a bonafide critic, I rate a movie on how much it has entertained the moviegoers at the time it was released, or even when it's released in video for the latter generation to watch. And this movie is indubitably an entertaining one.",Stargate
247,jamnog-1,actually,6,23 April 2008,"yeah not a great film but certainly worth watching if you like action sci-fi. On that note the soundtrack, similarity with chronicles of Riddick for me I would try swapping them over. 6 out of ten is not as bad as it sounds not every film is Casablanca but I love watching films. This one takes stereotypical Hollywood sci-fi, a good dose of nice cinematic 5, eye candy, some theological life lessons about equality and showers them in feel good death, sex and violence (of the tame dissuasion). thee pints of beer and your in for a nice after pub flick.(it annoys me that I cant use the plural of cinematic thus I have included the number five to represent the letter s).",Stargate
248,Sihaya_Barton,Typical Example of Orientalism,5,8 October 2002,"I became very uneasy watching this movie, because it is a typical example of orientalism. U.S. Army portrayed as a savior for primitive world. Non-white, ""primitive"" people bow down upon their knees to white, ""civilized"" guys and worship them as gods. At the first scene of Sha'uri, I almost laughed aloud, saying ""Here comes Madame Butterfly!"" I don't expect much to Hollywood blockbusters, but this movie had gone too far. It reminded me ""Independence Day"".. A god-awful stupid movie I've ever seen... No wonder both were directed by same person.",Stargate

If you are tired of movies today that linger on the set ups and spend too much time on the back stories of all the characters you'll appreciate the economy of action here. This movie gets right to the point. It's not fussy. And it doesn't over indulge. It gets right to the story telling, and there's a lot to tell. It's a great adventure. The casting is really good. You've seen all these actors before but they really inhabit the movie well. This movie's production value is really good. The sets and locations are great. I had to keep reminding myself that this was produced in 1994 and not 2004. The special effects are used carefully. They're not over used, which was smart because it's probably one of the reasons that this movie has remained timeless.",Stargate

This is not a film about the origins of the human race being from outer space - the people on t'other planet were transported there by Ra, from earth... The premise of the alien using the human race as a fuel supply is another twist on a myth of ancient gods. My only question here is, why just the poor old Egyptians? Why didn't they grab people from all over?And I reckon it works great. Brilliant visuals, fantastic sound (partic on the Director's Cut DVD), and how many movies quote from it?

The movie is from 1994 but you'll see good transformations from for example the guards ho can let their helmets disappear in view seconds by pushing a button. The story is about a gate from the past, refound and rebuild. Standing by the military. They discover how it works an can go through the stargate to a world that is on the very end of our wellknown galaxy. There are other people with a (what they think) evil god Ra.",Stargate

I must say, it's great, but watch the movie before the show it birthed! I've been watching Stargate-SG1 for about a year now, and It is above excellent, the best sci-fi out there, but it and the movie have major, MAJOR differences. The second time I watched the movie, all I could think of is all the differences. Watch Stargate, If you liked it watch SG1, but please, watch them in that order! I have to credit the show, though, rather than get hung up on the differences, it mocks them for humor. That's another difference that turned me off to the movie the second time through. Stargate is cold, somber, and serious, but good. Sg1 can be hillerious beyond your wildest dreams. So... movie first, or you'll regret it, trust me.",Stargate

255,Soccergirlkiev,"Even though travelling through a wormhole created by a snake-like alien who pretended to be Ra is out there, this movie is not.",9,27 February 2006,"I am a huge Stargate fan. Love the movie, love the show, love the spin off, and it would not have been possible without this movie. In a genre that can so easily be cheesy or over the top, Stargate tip toes this end but stays shy of it in a good hearted, action packed manor. It's refreshing that the aliens DON'T (for once) speak English. It's only through trial and (many) errors that they can finally communicate and its only the linguist that actually ends up being able to communicate. The interaction between O'Neill, Skaara and the other boys brings a bit of 'real life' into the far depths of the universe. Having (spoiler) lost his son by accidental shooting, its refreshing to see that Jack would not be comfortable with these boys fighting the good fight until it is absolutely necessary. Daniel Jackson, a character I love dearly, brings to the movie an air that yes the filmmakers know they are making a sci-fi movie and that it is dangerous but they will poke fun at it. For example, how Daniel's allergies flair up when he travels, including through the Stargate.All in all, I highly recommend this and the series to any Sci-fi loving fun.",Stargate
256,Koen-Verschooren,Great movie,8,22 September 2004,"Being a fan of the series, I particularly enjoyed this movie because of the striking resemblance to the series Stargate SG-1. The recurrent characters of Skaara and Sha'uri were also very appreciable. The special effects, given the date (1994) of production, were quite enjoyable as well. However, this is more of a movie which is suitable for sequels, although this was compensated by the production of Stargate SG-1. Altogether it's not an overstatement to say that this is a movie well worth a 8/10, which, in contrast to the 6.3/10 it receives at this moment, is a score more fitting a movie of this quality. One of the reasons I'm especially drawn to the movie and series, is the originality of it all, you can't argue that this is one of the most well-thought-of concepts in recent history.",Stargate
257,vshirokov,Great Movie,9,25 September 2004,"The movie Stargate is a very good must-see combination of adventure, action and science-fiction.

The plot is a very interesting non-cliché story, that will keep you in your chair through the entire movie.PS:All those who didn't like the movie lack either sense of adventure and taste or simply the brains to understand the story.Another thing is, that it's a shame there is a rip-off, cheap**** series made, presumably as a follow-up on the movie. The series are crap, don't wast your time on them, they'll only spoil the pleasure you got from the movie. (No wonder non of the original cast wanted to participate in them.)",Stargate
258,carolynn-k,good but....,8,18 November 2004,I thought it was a good movie for it's time. The only thing wrong with it is that half the movie is in a foreign language and it leaves you guessing as to what they are saying. There are entire scenes of like 10 minutes where there was no English at all. Although they did really well with the body language so a lot of the time it wasn't too hard to figure out what they were saying. Still i think the movie would have been better with some subtitles. Overall I thought that the movie was imaginative and fun. I watched it twice in one day. The effects were innovative and the cast was well chosen. Happy viewing.

259,tralinaos-hilleratos,One of the best scifi movies ever.,9,15 May 2014,"Stargate is since firs time i saw it, one of my favorite movies. It is really a unique gem, nor can i really think of an comparable movie. What also is very special about it is it good balance of effects, realism, acting, story, adventure and action. It just looks so much more realistic then all the other scifi movies these days with all their overloaded special effects. Also i think that this is one of James Spaders best acting performances, at least i liked him in this role most compared to his other performances i saw of him. I really miss scifi movies with such kind of quality, yeah it really makes me sad and this is why this movie is really a masterpiece for its own. I really love it.",Stargate

Then the t.v. series came along,which without even seeing an episode,i hated.However,after seeing some of the first and second seasons,it eventually grew on me and now i never miss an episode.BUT,i still think a sequel could be made with the original cast members and director Roland Emmerich at the helm.It may seem pointless since the t.v. series has covered many stories that could have been the basis for a sequel,but i think it would be interesting to have a new movie pick up where the original left off and start again as if there were no t.v. series,almost like an alternate reality from one of the later first season episodes.Does anyone else out there want a sequel or is it just wishful thinking on my part?",Stargate
262,Paulo_751,Very original plot!!!,10,7 July 2005,"Many things can be said about this movie,good or bad I found it original and simply refreshing. I have watched the movie several times and enjoy it every time. The plot is the main attraction being the stagnate one of the best sci-fi devices I have ever seen or thought about for that much. James Spader is an excellent actor, I like the fact that he prefers to accept roles on low-budget movies, its simply evidence of his great character. Kurt Russell what can I say, you have got to love the man, he knows how to get things going. The rest of the cast does a good job and RA is a great villain. We have action, we have a love story, we have all the ingredients for a movie that will keep us glued to the screen. Roland Emmerich great plot, original and a sci-fi nº1, I especially loved the whole idea of interplanetary travel in mere seconds and the Ancient Egyptian secrets explained. Well done!!!!!!!!

263,memmory2,Worth seeing more than once,10,11 September 2005,"The title alone is enough to fascinate those who love believable sci-fi. This movie is not as far reaching as some would have us think. It links fiction with fact, as we know the military have underground sites. Following in the footsteps of ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"", Stargate is a great follow-up, bringing it into the 21st century. In the previous movie the beings are consistent with what many believe aliens might look like, and what many think has been happening for years. In Stargate, we see new possible beginnings. This is just one good version with enough special effects and great acting to hope someday this is feasible. It is worth watching, over and over, each time seeing something that was previously missed. Thoroughly enjoyable.",Stargate

265,nuno-cunha-lisboa,The best space opera adventure since Star Wars!,10,11 April 2006,"I find it difficult to understand why Stargate is often forgotten from every list of best sci-fi movies. Any book showing sci-fi history talks about Independence Day or Armageddon or even Attack of the Killing Tomatoes, but they don't even leave a line for this picture.I think Stargate is the best sci-fi adventure or space opera since Star Wars, because it's overwhelming, all it's elements are extremely creative, each new discovery of the characters in the world they find is astonishing, the characters have personal dramas to overcome. It's an alternate history story which combines archaeological Egypt with science fiction in a doubtful, but very much compelling theory. It's not that it could be true... but then again? Could the stone from 2001 A Space Odyssey be true? It's an epic where my favorite items, ancient history, particularly from ancient Egypt, and science, particularly space science, are combined with a major story of emancipation by the people against dictatorship and God, where the people question the existence of God and decide to make a revolution.Despite all the horrors Roland Emmerich has done like ID4, Godzilla or The Patriot, Stargate remains an amazing picture, with a classical direction, all the elements well accomplished, extremely serious developments and without stupid jokes or comedy. Often taken as pure entertainment and not to be seen again, for me, Stargate, which I've seen more than three dozen times, has become a cult movie, but unlike other cult movies I love, such as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Brazil or Gattaca, this film produced by Mario Kassar and created by the minds of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin is different because almost no one likes it and no one talks about it.
