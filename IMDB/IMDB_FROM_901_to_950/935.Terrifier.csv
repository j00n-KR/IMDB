0,TheLittleSongbird,One will be terrified of this clown,6,17 April 2018,"'Terrifier's' cover looked very cool and eerie. Furthermore, the concept was really intriguing and one of the best for any film personally seen recently. There are some halfway decent killer clown films out there and have an appreciation for horror. So yes 'Terrifier' was watched with some anticipation and want to like it, as well as some apprehension with so many wastes of potential on recent film viewings. While it is an uneven film, where the first half is better than the second half, 'Terrifier' turned out to be much better than expected. Considering the budget and there are also a fair share of killer clown films that are not good ('Clowntergeist' was a significant recent example in this regard), it could easily have been a bad film if executed in a way that wasted its promise. Luckily, 'Terrifier' didn't fully live up to its promise but it doesn't waste it either.Quite a lot to like here. 'Terrifier' starts off really well, great even. Despite the slightness of the story that doesn't really do anything new, the first half was tightly paced and genuinely scary and suspenseful with well-timed shocks. The killings are gory, without being gratuitously so while not holding back, nail-biting and inventive. Enjoyed the 80s throwback feel to the atmosphere.Visually, 'Terrifier' looks pretty impressive for a film made on a high-budget. It's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and atmospherically lit. The make-up and effects were surprisingly and refreshingly good, seeing as there have been so many recent film viewings where the make up and effects looked terrible that was a real pleasure to see. The killer clown Art is truly freaky and is up there with Pennywise actually as the stuff of nightmares.Acting from the main cast is better than average, with a likeable lead actress and a fiendishly good David Howard Thornton. It's all competently directed and there is a real eeriness too to the music score. However, 'Terrifier' sadly has a second half that is not up to the same level. Although there is creepiness, suspense and a few of the killings are inventive, the thinness of the story affects the momentum and things become dull, silly and repetitive, there is a pattern here and one that repeats itself so often that it becomes very predictable quickly. The ending felt rushed and incomplete, leaving the viewer in dumbfounded confusion. Not that 'Terrifier' was perfect already, it wasn't, but the flaws are more apparent and more problematic in the second half than the first. Not enough of the characters are rootable or interesting enough, with the most likeable characters disappearing too early and any development is sketchy and cliched. The lead character and oddly enough Art are the most interesting characters here. Although the main cast are fine, the side characters are very annoying in how they are written and portrayed. There are also too many annoying and illogical actions and decision-making which made parts hard to swallow and ridiculous. Too much of the script is limp, ridden with clichés and too often underdeveloped and silly. Overall, pretty decent with a lot of good merits although with significant problems. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Terrifier
1,Leofwine_draca,Sleazy junk,2,4 March 2020,"TERRIFIER is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called ALL HALLOWS' EVE. One of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for an hour and a half. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by morons for morons. A mute clown wanders around, indestructible as usual, and kills everyone else in the film off. Plenty of effort has gone into elaborate and nasty gore effects, but there's no discernable characterisation, wit, plot, atmosphere, suspense or viewer involvement. In addition, the scene of the naked girl being dismembered goes way beyond the boundaries of good taste. Not for me.",Terrifier
2,claudio_carvalho,"Promising Beginning, Terrible Collection of Stupidities and Clichés",4,7 April 2018,"The overrated ""Terrifier"" is a horror film with a promising and funny beginning, with the alcoholic Dawn acting like a stupid and the clown accepting the silliness. Until the moment Tara and Dawn are abducted, the film works reasonably well. However, when Victoria drives to give a ride to her sister and Dawn, she hears that there is a serial killer in the area. But even being aware of the dangerous situation, she begins to take a series of very stupid e clichés attitudes culminating in the awful conclusion. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Terrifier
3,nogodnomasters,Halloween never disappoints,4,21 June 2018,"A mute clown kills people on Halloween. No real back story is given. Related to the film ""All Hollow's Eve"" although that film was so long ago, they really needed some kind of recap to let us know. The woman cut in half jiggled like rubber and I am not sure you can cut that much bone with a hacksaw blade. It would have been good if the clown had a pantomime act. Tara (Jenna Kanell) comes across as the final girl. Without a back story the film was rather plot-less. Blood, clown, disfigured face. Guide: F-word. Nudity (Catherine Corcoran, Pooya Mohseni or body fakes)",Terrifier
4,BA_Harrison,Move over Pennywise.,9,12 April 2018,"Expanded from director Damien Leone's 2011 short of the same name, Terrifier stars David Howard Thornton as silent psycho killer Art the Clown, who turns Halloween into a nightmare for several unfortunate victims, including friends Tara and Dawn (Jenna Kanell and Catherine Corcoran), and Dawn's big sister Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi).Although you might reasonably think that we need another scary clown movie like we need a pie in the face, Terrifier actually takes the clown horror sub-genre to a whole new level with a grease-painted maniac who makes Pennywise look like Krusty Krustofsky.Not only is Art one of the creepiest looking clowns in horror, but he's also one of the most violent, making a real mess of his victims. While the plot of Terrifier is about as original as a water-squirt flower, and features characters who make dubious decisions that inevitably put them in further peril (including that old favourite, not finishing off the villain when given the chance), it is the gore that maketh the movie, Art making good use of a variety of tools.The gruesome highlight sees an almost naked victim (I won't say who) suspended upside-down and sawn vertically in half, starting at the crotch (nasty), but there are plenty of other incredibly splattery moments, including bullets to the face and a very bloody decapitation. The prosthetic effects (no CGI here folks!) are excellent and guaranteed to please avid gorehounds.The film ends on a predictable note, with Art returning from the dead Jason Vorhees style, but if that allows for a sequel, then that's fine by me.8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Terrifier
5,BandSAboutMovies,This one goes all the way!,7,3 September 2018,"What does it take to have my wife, who has been watching horror movies since she was 9, to get up and walk out on a movie? Well, Terrifier holds your answer.If you are afraid of clowns, stay away from this movie.If you are squeamish about gore, don't even start watching it.Basically, just know that this one goes all the way. And then some. It's like someone told the filmmakers that they were in Italy in 1980 and had bought stock in latex, food coloring and corn syrup.Al the Clown first showed up in the anthology film All Hallow's Eve. Now, he's back, as the film opens on a talk show hostess interviewing the only survivor of a massacre where she was the only survivor. As the host asks if the woman saw her attacker die, we pull back to reveal Al the Clown destroying a TV set.Following the interview, we hear the talk show host make fun of the mutilated victim, who soon shows up to gouge out her eyes.If you've made it this far, you haven't seen anything yet.After a night of partying, Tara and Dawn are walking down the street and encounter Al carrying a bag of weapons. Dawn yells at him as Tara tells her to settle down. They decide to sober up at a pizza shop when the clown shows up again, leading to Dawn taking selfies with him. Al gets up and gives Tara a toy ring before the owner kicks him out.The girls return to their car to find their tires slashed and have to call Tara's sister for a ride. They're going better than the pizza shop employees, who are quickly butchered and decimated by the sinister clown. Soon, Tara and Dawn are captured by Al and Tara is forced to watch Dawn get...well, I don't want to ruin it. But I will say that this was the exact moment that Becca got upset and shut off the blu ray. It's that unexpected and intense.Needless to say, this is the slasher for those of you who have been waiting for a modern version that can live up to movies like The Prowler. My disclaimer above is no joke: this is one brutal movie filled with gallons upon gallons of teh red stuff.David Howard Thornton, who plays Art, is amazing. He imbues the character with sheer menace and you can see that his mime training really pays off. He's creepy just sitting there or walking on by. Once he gets on a tricycle or starts killing everyone in his path, he gets downright terrifying. Hey - the title makes sense. Director Damien Leone also directed All Hallow's Eve and Frankenstein vs. The Mummy and is someone to watch. Unlike so many modern horror movies, there's definitely attention paid to mood, pacing, color and lighting.",Terrifier
6,Coventry,"Alright, I'll admit it, the clown is terrifying!",8,22 June 2021,"Next to zombies, killer/evil clowns are the most dreadfully overused type of villains in horror cinema. So overused, I daresay, that we even reached a point where - like zombies - the clown has become a lame caricature that isn't the least bit menacing or scary anymore.Enter Art the Clown from ""Terrifier"". What superficially appears to be another unoriginal and clichéd piece of clown-horror quickly turns out to be, err..., another unoriginal and clichéd piece of clown-horror, BUT with a uniquely petrifying anti-hero and tons of sensationally graphic and old-fashioned gore.What makes the difference? Writer/director Damien Leone at least knows and understands that a silent, unemotional and motiveless villain is the most menacing kind of villain. Art the Clown doesn't speak a word, doesn't show any mercy, and we don't have the slightest idea why he butchers. Besides, Art is not just a clown but also a mime-player... And we all hate mimes, do we not? His silence, grimaces, nonchalance and Pierrot-outfit make Art (at least as far as I'm concerned) the creepiest clown in cinematic history. Much creepier than Pennywise, Captain Spaulding, Heath Ledger as The Joker, the doll from ""Poltergeist"", or the zombie clown from ""Zombieland"".Finally, as a life-long horror obsessive, I simply must emphasize how phenomenal the gore is. There's jaw-dropping explicit stuff as well as nerve-cringing suggestive horror. There's no need for me to list the highlights, you'll instantly recognize them. ""Terrifier"" is a must-see for every horror fan.",Terrifier
7,michaelRokeefe,Art the Clown will more than ruin your Halloween!,9,29 January 2019,"Writer/director Damien Leone gives you something you will never unsee. Double dog dare you to ""toothpick"" your eyes open then rinse with Tabasco. You'll need a shovel to scoop the gore. Extreme is not a limit. Tara (Jenna Kanell) and Dawn (Catherine Cocoran) are a couple young women wrapping up a night of celebrating Halloween drinking and partying hard and stop at an all night diner on the way home. They will soon be joined by a mute and brutal Art the Clown. The rest of the evening is ruthless, bloody carnage filled with disturbing, horrifying mutilation. Violence for violence sake. Not for the faint of heart. David Howard Thornton plays Art the Clown.",Terrifier
8,grantss,Initially intriguing but quickly falls back on the usual slasher-horror clichés,3,8 September 2018,"It is Halloween night. A sinister, deranged clown stalks and attacks two women, killing anyone who gets in his way or annoys him.Was intriguing, initially. The identity of the clown and how the scenes in the main part of the movie link to the opening scene made for some interesting conjecture.However, the movie quickly degenerates into your usual slasher-horror plot, complete with standard clichés and nonsense. Plot is replaced by scenes that are there just to gross the audience out.Avoid.",Terrifier
9,Wizard-8,"Please, no sequel!",2,2 September 2018,"The only reason I am not giving this terrible slasher movie a mere one star rating is that I will admit that the killings in this movie are very enthusiastic, with a lot of blood and gore. But that material only takes about a few minutes of the total running time, and if you take that away, what you have is a completely worthless movie. Other IMDb comments that the movie is plotless and thin with its characters are correct; this is just one person after another being slaughtered, with no new angles, and no story. It gets really boring very quickly. It's even more painful than it sounds, one big reason that the movie has some of the ugliest cinematography that has ever been presented in a movie. I hope the filmmakers don't clown around on a future film project.",Terrifier
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and decent if slightly flawed effort,8,30 October 2018,"After a night out on the town, a group of friends come across a demented, maniacal figure dressed in a clown costume and begins to torment them as he seeks to impose his own psychologically deranged brand of torture on them and anyone else that stands in his way as he chases them in the city.This one wasn't all that bad and had a lot to offer. A lot of what makes this one work so well is based around the central clown who is one of the more impressive figures in the genre. The concept of the silent, emotionless style of clown make-up as well as the design of the creature itself is quite terrifying by itself, but to add it together to the mime-like antics and sinister looks he continually gives off while stalking really helps to make for quite a creepy persona. That is added onto the other scenes here where he simply spots them out on the streets or toys with them in the various buildings around the warehouse which are exceptionally creepy and chilling. That there's plenty of fun, brutal kills that pop up as a result of his demented attitude provides the main part of the fun here, featuring the stalking to get these scenes set up from the initial encounter with the clown at the restaurant that goes back to show him slaughtering the staff later on, the first encounters at the abandoned building where it all takes place with the stalking in the basement or the various floors of the building taking out the random interlopers that appear along the way and leading into the two major centerpieces that show up. The scene of the character hanging upside down and the eventual outcome is unquestionably the highlight of the film, and along with the final battle in the underground with it there's plenty to like about this which is all about the inadvertent luring of the other sister and then detailing their wholesale struggle to get away knowing full-well what's happening around them. From meeting up with the skinned yet still alive victim, getting beaten down continuously by the deranged clown and then seeing the final resolution that really holds up nicely as well, there's some fun to be had with the big finish to this one and really helps to hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main factor here is the fact that there's not much in the story at all here, going from person to person as they randomly happen upon the killer through sheer circumstance that the film really doesn't have any real point at all throughout here. The swerve in the different characters surviving doesn't even give this a plot as to where this one centers simply on showcasing one big gore-gag after a while which is where the film really stumbles. That just ends up making the film feel pointless and repetitive, rendering a lot of the killer's appearances into a bland series of scenes that's simply there to kill someone graphically and leaves this one on the whole rather redundant. This might not be as big a flaw as it really is since that might put off others more than some really do, and is the biggest factor to hold this back.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.",Terrifier
11,trashgang,old school slasher but with a lack of suspense but worth seeing for the gore,7,30 April 2019,"Pro's and contra's on my side for this flick. If you watch this being a teen you will turn it off for so many reasons. If you are an old school geek like me then this offers a lot.Starting this ultra gore one you will notice the color grading, a pure throwback to the heydays of the slashers. And once the opening credits are shown you will get it, this is going to be an ode to the slashers and seventies horrors.Let that be the reason why teens will turn it off. Not used to see straight in your face horrors full of on-camera effects without the use of CGI. Is it all good, sadly it isn't. Some scene's are too long and there isn't really any suspense. Once the clown comes in you know what is coming, gore. Some reactions are strange or victims doing really stupid things that's what lowers my rating.For lovers of seventies, eighties horror pick it up. Gorehounds can pick it up too, it's full of red stuff and torture that some will be disgusted.Nice try this flick, and it was really a time ago that I've seen a horror with gore and effects like this.",Terrifier
12,thesar-2,No Better Title,8,9 September 2018,"Nice to know: Evil never dies...as in the Evil Slasher.Just when I still think the horror market is too heavily aimed at the specific subgenre: Ghost/Haunted House stories - heck, the ghost story, The Nun, opens this weekend, I applaud filmmakers who step out of the box to make films for real diehard horror fans. In this case, my favorite horror subgenre: the Slasher.The absolute only thing that Terrifier changes from the Slasher subgenre is the stereotypical woodsy setting. It is on-point perfection with handling this once great horror dominator. So, if you love the Slasher like I do, you MUST see this film.Not much to say for the synopsis, it starts with a twist and then dives into the hunter stalking its prey. For what's unoriginal in the script, it makes up for it tenfold with extremely effective gore FX and the twist.Frankly, one of the two twists is easy to see but the second one did get me. Also love to see non-CGI, practical effects and this looked like straight up heart from filmmakers...despite the budget.And talk about a mask. Slasher films have constantly tried to reinvent the killer's mask. Of course we have the big three: Michael Myers' William Shatner, Jason Voorhees' Hockey Mask and Leatherface's, well, Leatherface and a fourth could be granted to Scream. But, since then, they haven't been all that impressive. In fact, one of my favorite modern Slashers, The Final Girls, had an obnoxiously bad mask to mock the previous and failed attempts. Most recently, Happy Death Day's was also fairly bad.But, DAMN... Terrifier's is one of the best. Sure, it's part American Horror Story: Freak Show, but Terrifier totally took it to the edge and went over. Recently, I attended Arizona's Mad Monster horror convention and the actor playing Terrifier, or ""Art the Clown,"" David Howard Thornton was there. I got pictures, but sadly, didn't introduce myself. Also, regrettably, I hadn't seen the movie at the time. I probably definitely would've spoken with him and praise his performance as the mute, funny and absolutely terrifying clown. Not much more to say other than this is HIGHLY recommended for real horror fans.***Final thoughts: Funny how the mouth of Terrifier COMPLETELY works on me and the similarly looking mouth on The Nun just cracks me up. Perhaps it's the lame CGI on The Nun or the fact that story couldn't happen. But, damn, not even comparatively speaking, Thornton deserves an Oscar for his facial expressions alone and the Nun should just brush her computer generated teeth.",Terrifier
13,851222,"Creepy, disturbing and not bad horror flick",7,17 August 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Terrifier"" (2017) has to be one of the most cruelest and disturbing horror i've seen in many moons. Its not particularity good, but it does its job in keeping you in an pleasant viewing as well as showing some very disturbing stuff - this movie is not for children, that is for sure.Overall, ""Terrifier"" is not bad horror movie overall. Its very disturbing, but its not a gore fest (i hate those). Nice horror flick for those who love this genre, for all others - you better stay far away from this movie.",Terrifier
14,Platypuschow,Terrifier: Brutal but generic,5,18 May 2019,"Art the Clown started back in 2011 with a short movie by the same name, truth be told I didn't like it. The creator Damien Leone would keep Art around in his feature film All Hallows' Eve (2013) but as a small role.Now here we are and Art has his own movie, but is it any good? Honestly, not really but it's better than his last solo outing.It follows the standard slasher formula and sees a couple of girls on Halloween night come under attack from a psychotic clown.So again this is generic stuff, it embraces all the usual tropes and though not predictable certainly has no surprises. It's also pretty ugly and oddly paced throughout.What Terrifier does have however is sheer unadulterated brutality. This is gory nasty no holds barred merciless stuff, I was quite shocked actually. Considering the budget they make all of it look really good, so kudos to the sfx department.I love clowns as antagonists but Art doesn't seem to tick enough boxes for me. He's less of a clown and more of a mime and doesn't seem to be an interesting enough character to carry his own film.Passable stuff but by this time next week I'll have forgotten it.The Good:Impressively grisly visualsJenna KanellUnpredictableThe Bad:Doesn't exactly flowPoor cinematography",Terrifier
15,ops-52535,goooore,4,1 September 2018,"Well, darkness,shady clown,drunk young women....a good recipee for a slasher,bloody gore movie. its a killer clown thats for sure,but the story is like taken from a silent slasher movie from the earlyb 1920's,nothing new at the horror front,but for the extreme bestiallity in the slashing and decapitation and dismembering of the victims,which are at a level i havent seen for a while.

No flickering lights, no shaky cam n no fast cut editing.There is a kill in this movie which is way too brutal than the Sean Bean's one from Black Death.The only thing i wanted to kno more is the background story of the killer, his motives n the some clarity bah the supernatural ending.Aft liking this, i wanna check out the director's previous films.",Terrifier

22,jtindahouse,It will take you to places you didn't know you wanted to go,10,3 April 2018,"I saw the trailer for 'Terrfier' about a fortnight ago and thought it looked good, but had been burned by low-budget horror movies with promising trailers that turn out to be rubbish too many time before. So I decided to give it a miss until last night when I heard it getting some positive buzz. I was surprised anyone else had even heard about it, let alone enjoyed it. So I decided that was enough for me and put it on to watch. What I ended up witnessing was one of the most unique and brilliant horror films I've ever seen.It should be known that very little ever bothers me any longer in the way of horror movies. I want them to effect me, they just don't. I feel like I've seen it all and have become numb to anything the movie-making industry can throw at me. So when I say that 'Terrifier' had me on the edge of my seat, make no mistake, that is a glowing endorsement. The film was creepy as hell. 'Art The Clown' is one of the best created horror movie characters I can ever remember. The film clearly has a low-budget, but I think that helps it in a lot of ways. An unknown cast and a creepy abandoned warehouse setting are ideal for a horror movie because it leaves the audience with no comfort to fall back on. When you think you're getting scared in a movie and then Nicole Kidman enters the frame and reminds you of how much you liked her in 'Just Go With It' it can completely take you out of the film. There is certainly none of that here. The other thing I liked is that absolutely no character feels safe. Too often with horror movies people are dying left, right and centre, yet there are the characters that you know are untouchable, and thus every scene with them in danger loses its edge. You have to watch the film to appreciate how far from the case that is here. Let me guarantee you though by saying - more so than any film I've ever seen before no one is safe. Writer/director Damien Leone clearly knows horror and what makes people tick. He's put on a masterful display here and I can't wait to check out his previous film (also featuring 'Art The Clown') 'All Hallows' Eve'. 'Terrifier' has some of the most unique, brilliant, disturbing and somehow thoughtful scenes you will ever see in a movie (let alone a horror movie). It is a must-see.",Terrifier

Two college age girls stop at a pizza parlor to sober up after a night of drinking. At the place, they encounter a silly looking man in a clown outfit. The owner throws him out after he fouls the bathroom and it was a serious mistake. Buckets of blood ensue, with many innocent victims. They all wind up in a warehouse where more mayhem ensues. A woman is hung upside down and cut in half with a hacksaw, so if you are looking for a fun film, this ain't it.

Wow! I only just read an interview with the films director Damien Leone today and managed to stream it online and boy was I impressed! It's obviously low budget but this is proof that in the right hands it doesn't matter. This is a relentless and very gory killer clown slasher flick that makes good use of it's filming location and also packs in plenty of tension. It also makes IT look incredibly tame.",Terrifier

This is a slasher movie fans dream and one of the better slasher films I've ever seen (obviously after the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and Halloween but would definitely make my top 10). The gore is so well done and while there are lots of predictable scenes there is also a great blend of unexpected sequences. The gore is also very well done and the movie is so awkward and eerie. I strongly strongly strongly recommend this if you can stomach the content.",Terrifier

27,TdSmth5,Gory fun,7,4 February 2019,"A survivor of some massacre is interviewed on TV, her face is completely destroyed. When the interview is over, someone attacks the interviewer.Then two girls leave a Halloween party, go for some pizza. At the pizza joint they meet Art the clown. He's just sitting there giving everyone a hard time. Eventually the boss kicks him out. After the girls leave we learn that Art killed the boss and his employee gruesomely. One of the girls needs a restroom so she asks some guy she sees in front of a building to let her in. He agrees. He's about to fumigate the building. There's some crazy lady in the building...and Art. Soon the girl runs into her friend as Art is cutting her apart, literally. At some point the girl called her sister to pick them up, she eventually also ends up in the building being chased by Art. When the cops arrive, there's a surprise turn of events, and a not so surprising surprise at the morgue. There's a final revelatory scene.Terrifier is a lower budget horror movie where all the money went into the brutal gore and there's plenty of gore, more than in any recent horror movie. Art (and Leone) sure has something against faces as he loves destroying them. Usually I don't care for clowns, in horror or elsewhere, but Art is a genuinely creepy and disturbing looking clown, much more effective than the downright stupid looking clown in the new It. The dialogue, the little there is, is pretty good and natural. And overall the story is pretty good and shows some effort. I could have done though without a near-naked Art.Unfortunately there's a lot that is necessarily formulaic in Terrifier. The whole thing takes place at night of course. The location is awful. It's supposed to be an empty building with an abandoned auto repair shop or some such thing and most of the action takes place in the basement. Once the action starts, dialogue stops. There are few sound and no music. Art is also silent, even when he's being attacked and getting hurt. When you have no dialogue things also get boring quickly, and even though this movie is shorter it does feel longer, even more so since Art isn't exactly a quick-moving fellow.I sure look forward to a sequel. One can only imagine what Leone could do with a bigger budget. Overall, Terrifier is a recommended horror flick.",Terrifier

29,vengeance20,Plotless!,3,20 April 2018,"Didn't even know about this film until randomly finding it in a supermarket one day. So knowing it was apart of the All Hallows Eve Franchise, & to also know it was a spin off from that said series, I bought it. So to start, I found the first All Hallows Eve to be pretty boring & repetitive. The ending to it was also pretty crap too. But however, the sequel, All Hallows Eve 2, The Reaping in our country, the UK, was amazing & like VHS on steroids! Then comes along this boneless spin off & an all to bad of an excuse to have that clown, Art back again!The film is about Art the clown. But is a typical cat & mouse film with no plot or even a point other than the sake of Art himself. Pointless. Now I'm not usually the one to complain about films having points or reason but this film took the pi$$ so much, I felt adding a review & saying that was justified!The film had the gore, the bloody violence, the sexy babes, the viciousness & the epic kills! The works! The only hing or 2 things it lacked, were the plot & of course the damn POINT!!Withe exception of the gory violence, kills & fear, not to mention, Catherine Corcrocan! (Hottie!!) This film failed to justified its existence! Sadly! It was like a human body with bone! Even as I watched the film I was expecting the 2 babes at the start to die & then a the main story to break in. But it didn't! The film dragged & dragged! Even with the gory horror action violence, it simply didn't cut it!3/10 is generous enough given the content! But it sadly lacked the point & plot to justify it!",Terrifier

33,gedikreverdi,It's absolutely terrifying!,8,19 December 2020,It's Halloween. Dawn the blonde and Tara are going back home after a night out drinking. Before that they stopped by a pizzeria and saw the terrifier. They left and the clown killed the two man and one of the guys head was on the counter burning like a big candle. Then they noticed the cars tire had been slashed and Tara called her sister Vicky to come over to pick them up. They waited in the car in front of a creepy old warehouse. Tara needed to go to the bathroom and asked the guy smoking in front of the building. She saw a lady with a doll thinking she's her daughter. The guy was an exterminator and there for the rat infested warehouse. The clown was back and she ran into the basement. She was bound to a chair with duct tape and dawn was there upside down. It tore dawn in half with a saw from the crotch to head and Tara managed to run away. It knocked the exterminator guy out and the doll lady found it with the doll in its hands. She seemed to convince it of giving the doll back but it ripped her hair and breasts off and they were both naked when And then he stabbed the second exterminator guy coming in the head. And then shot Tara in the head multiple times. Vicky arrived and the clown replied her messages saying come around from the back. She entered the building and saw the bodies. and then Vicky found them. It acted like a woman when Tara hid in a closet. It looked extremely creepy with the woman's hair and breasts. The rats were all around and it was disgusting. Finally she found Tara sitting in a chair dead and almost got killed before the exterminator hit it in the head. They called the police but didn't wait and moved on. It crushed his face and Vicky managed to run but it hit her with a truck and ate her face while policemen arrived. And it shot itself in the head before getting arrested. It was sth supernatural because in the morgue it also killed the coroner it was alive! And one year later Vicky was discharged from the hospital with her disfigured face. In the opening scene they showed us Vicky was on tv and she killed the woman because she mocked her appearance behind cameras on the phone. I would watch tens of sequels of this. It was a whole lot better than I expected it to be.,Terrifier

35,one9eighty,"Not that Terrifying... just a bit, misunderstood",5,2 September 2020,"Directed and written by Damien Leone, this 2016 film runs at 82 minutes and is classed as a Horror/ Thriller film. It primarily stars David Howard Thornton as Art, the killer clown. For the purpose of the film though, we follow Jenna Kanell as Tara Heyes, and then Samantha Scaffidi as her sister, Victoria. Catherine Corcoran plays Tara's best friend Dawn, while Pooya Mohseni and Matt McAllister also play substantial parts too.It's Halloween; Tara and Dawn are on their way back from their night out. While at their car they see a clown, but they think nothing of it and debate who is the least drunk so that they can drive. They decide to stop at a pizza place to get some food to absorb the booze; it is here they meet the clown again. When they return to the car they find that a tire has been slashed, while they wait for help from Tara's sister, Tara herself goes into a nearby building to use a toilet. By this time, Art's bloody rampage has already begun. Will the girls be able to survive the killer clown?The premise of this film is simple; it's a hide-and-seek style slasher film that's in one building; people can get into the building, but can't get out. There is a lot of blood and gore throughout. There is mild use of bad language, and one scene of partial nudity. This film never really tires to be anything other than what it is - a slasher film. There are moments that it appears dumber than it needs to be and some things seem hard to believe. Characters who seem to be crippled or killed are suddenly able to run around again at times. It's hard to work out if there is some supernatural element to the film due to the wounding Art takes and then comes right back to the fight as if nothing happened. He also displays lots of strength at times too, especially in hoisting up CorCoran's Dawn character. The inclusion of some characters made no sense, other than presumably to add to the kill count. Also, the wrap-around which stars and ends the film seems pointless and not needed.The acting is average without ever being stand-out, sometimes it's wooden and un-emotive and sometimes it's over acted and cheesy. David Howard Thornton does well as Art the clown; I'd suggest that his background of mime and playing other clowns has helped here. The pace of the film is mostly good, but when it slows down it trudges rather than flows. There is no character development, no back story, no reasoning. There was a lot of potential in the film, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the promise. This felt like a bad slasher movie from the 80's where events just happen and nothing is really explained. It's better than some of the bad horror movies from the same year with similar budgets, but it's still only ever going to be an average film when it feels like it was aiming to become a cult film, which it is not. Decent cheap film for late night cable channels, but I really can't see this lasting the test of time. 5 out of 10.",Terrifier
36,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Terrifier""",9,3 September 2018,"""Terrifier"" is an atmospheric, all out gorefest. The film is a total tribute to 80's horror, but it is so much more. Where most throwbacks mimic, or recreate the 80's vibe, ""Terrifier"" redefines what a successful throwback should do. Damien Leone has taken the style of early giallo, filled with gritty, low-fi concepts, and mixed in an almost grindhouse level of brutality and gore. And he does so while making it look natural and original instead of ""copycat"".The acting is sustainsble beyond the typical low-budget affair. Limited in dialog, what is utilized is the classic, slightly camp appeal of traditional characters. The cast know their parts and play them well. Void of the heavy, often times cumbersome, back story, or info-rich dialog, ""Terrifier"" gives the right amount of character study to set them up as affectational victims. Art is the centerpiece and his psych-centric stylings are enough to mesmerize and disgust. Kudos to Thornton for taking what could have been a death nail character, and creating a truly skin crawling, terrifying clown killer.The special effects areaeesome, minus a couple CGI blood splatter moments, ""Terrifier"" keeps with quality, practical effects. And Leone gives it to us in full frontal, gory gratuity. Not shy or intimidated by lack of effectiveness, the camera keeps focus on the carnage as it happens. It is 100% a top-notch gorehound celebration in visceral, bloody fun. This movie has American giallo eyes with a slasher smile. A definite watch for horror fans who think a stomach turning moment is a plus.",Terrifier
37,phanthinga,Art the Clown is not the new face of slasher cinema but he still improve,6,24 October 2018,"For people that only watch a slasher flick for the gory kills and to shut their brain off after a hard day at work Terrifier will get the job done and maybe the movie can earn a spot in their new must watch movie during Halloween list.While that being said,as much as I love Art the Clown as a slasher villain and the grindhouse feel of Terrifier to death the movie still got the biggest problem that the slasher genre always have that is logic of the characters.In the end the movie let me know that Art can't never be killed in a normal way so it make sense that no one can't put him down for good but it really frustrating for me to see each one get killed off just because they too dumb to overkill Art when they got the chance",Terrifier

39,apryla-58795,Aptly named,3,15 January 2019,I didn't want to watch this one so I just ignored it every time I did a search of horror films. I have been trying to find a truly terrifying horror film for a long time now and haven't had much luck. Finally I decided to give this one a go as I was getting desperate for something to watch. I'm not gonna laugh this one off and say it was stupid etc...like I usually do after I see a horror film that is rumored to be truly horrifying. For me truly terrifying movies are ones that deal in some type of reality. Most of the horror films out there deal with ghosts and supernatural stuff I don't believe in and the likelihood of those things happening are slim to none. What makes me truly scared is stuff like this. Granted this was torture porn BUT this kind of stuff has happened and does happen. There are sick people out there who torture and kill people. The fact that those people walk among us is what keeps me up at night. I am one step away from never leaving my house in general due to all of my fears and neuroses (irrational or not) so to see something like this just confirms some of my deepest fears.The Terrifier is an actual person (well until the end when they make it supernatural) not a ghost or anything like that and is killing for no other reason than because they are mentally disturbed. I think the most terrifying scene was the one with him and the fake baby. You see this moment where he seems to be softening only to see him wearing the skin of the woman the baby belonged to in the next scene. He has no feelings and no remorse. When someone is truly unstable like that it is really scary because there is no appealing to them or their human side.The pizza scene was truly horrifying as well. If someone came into an establishment I was eating in and sat there and looked at me like that clown did to Tara I would get the heck out of there so fast I wouldn't even bother paying for my food. I'd call 911 and deal with the restaurant later.The scene where the clown is naked except for the skin of that one homeless woman was disturbing as well. The creepiness of his movements was just something you can't unsee.I know most of the reviews state that this is dumb and blah blah and I do agree that this was stupid and the acting was atrocious BUT the overall idea is truly terrifying because realistically it could happen. The movie shows a scenario that seems unlikely and most likely probably is BUT it is not out of the realm for it to be realistic if the clown were to kidnap one person and torture them to death.I do not think that movies like this should exist. I don't really know what purpose they serve. I think that if someone is already a little mentally unstable and sees this type of movie it might give them ideas. The world is already a scary violent place. I don't think we need to go searching for more things to add to that in our free time. I DO like scary movies BUT this is just unnecessary. I really don't know what the point is.I do give credit to the actor who played Art the Clown. He was super creepy and made this terrifying but I can't say I would recommend that anyone watch this. Once you see things like this you can't unsee them and they stay with you. I think it's better to focus on things that won't keep you up at night or more afraid to leave your house.,Terrifier

If you are into gore, you'll have a real ball, but if you appreciate at least some background or characterization you will be disappointed. The first say twenty minutes were promising enough, the way the clown was teasing both women was very inventive: funny and extremely creepy at the same time. And surely: this must be one of the nastiest, scariest looking horror-clowns ever, I grant them that! But when the cat-and-mouse game turns into a killing-spree, it's a fast down-hill ride: characters are not important anymore, there are no dialogues whatsoever apart from the screaming, and the feeling of repetition prevails. It's hard to judge any acting abilities: although both girls do an adequate job in the introduction, they are soon reduced to crawling and screaming victims. But the clown is great in his own weird and scary way, his mimics are top of the notch. So just for him and the special effects I still rank it 4 out of 10.",Terrifier

I will say this: this clown not only looks scary, but is one sick, twisted individual! He is out to do harm to anybody that gets in his way. It seems once he lays eyes on you, there is no escape. This movie also does not skimp on the gore. There are two kills that are as graphic as anything I've ever seen. In fact, it went a little overboard for my tastes. I'm sure the gore hounds will love it, though. To each his own, I suppose. Unrated but this is not a movie for children, so parents be WARNED.

45,backup-50362,Hilarious!,8,27 July 2019,"That clown has some character! He's really refreshing from all the other evil clown movie villains.It's also cool that the movie cuts right to the chase. You know what you're in for and you're getting it. Classic slasher movie stuff. The suspense and the bar scene in the beginning of the film are the highlight of the whole movie for me.
Most of the acting was good too, which you wouldn't expect from a clearly low-budget horror movie. Both the clown and the main girl were really expressive and awesome.The pacing and writing weren't great though. You'd like the thing you're watching to make some sense but it doesn't. Does the clown have random supernatural abilities? Can we get some consistency? Better, more intriguing writing? I'd love to see that in Terrifier 2. Some character development that explains the clown's motives to kill would be nice. Nothing dragged on, just a bit of story. Because he's visually fantastic, but his reasoning, actions, abilities - hella underdeveloped. And at one point he used a gun which was ridiculously out of place.Overall it's definitely worth watching for slasher film fans as the actor who plays the clown is fantastic, giving that character an even better feel than high-budget clown murderers like IT, etc.Again, most of all I'd like to praise the man two actors. Brunette girl was fantastic and believable more so than protagonists in other slasher films and Art the Clown - deserves sequels up the butt.",Terrifier

47,zac-04879,Audiences Scared of this Dumb Slasher Just don't Understand Real Horror,5,16 July 2021,"Terrifier is another dumb, predictable and average killer-clown horror film relying on explicit blood and gore to scare you. To be blunt, this film sucks and it's truly dreadful that majority of today's horror creators believe that extreme is all horror fans want. Director and writer Damien Leone's flat storyline for Terrifier is all over the place. And what will infuriate audiences the most is how the film relies on violence for scares. It's dull, lame, dumb and everyone who leaves petrified by this movie doesn't understand real horror.The only good thing about this movie is the extreme slashings that are very gory and promise you that you'll remember Terrifier as the most gory movie you've ever seen. These effects are awesome, but another likeable element of the film is the ugly clown make up. Obviously a lot of people will find the clown creepy and terrifying, but the clown, story and gore doesn't at all live up to the title.Despite the Art the clown's freaky appearance and David Howard Thornton's performance, just a simple image or a voice effect of Pennywise makes Art look all crusty. Terrifier belongs right down where all the un-scary and dull horror characters belong. How does Leone think he can scare us with violence.

We all can picture an evil clown in our head, and this one is no exception, in simple black and white paint and a satanic grin, and carrying around a black garbage bag, and instantly Art and the women click. Dawn, falling into the dumb blonde role doesn't sense the danger, while Tara the brunette stays away, will that help her. And once they leave Art follows, and as luck would have it, their car broke down and they have to walk, and you'd never guess what happens next. Total campy movie, with laughs and over the top gore.

50,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Art the Clown needs a better movie,5,1 October 2018,"I'm giving this a 5 purely because I think Art the Clown is legitimately creepy. He's a great character and I even have to give props to the actor who played him. There was great physicality with him. He's got an iconic look and Im sure the character will gain some kind of cult status in the horror fanbase. If he was in a different movie with a different director, I could see this being a mainstream success. First of all, the writing is cliched. The characters are one dimensional and for the most part not likable. They make stupid decisions. And to top it off they didnt hire very good actors. I also feel there was loose threads that never got tied up. Early on (in a flash forward if you will) one of the characters says that he's dead and ""she made sure of it"". But that never pays off or comes to fruition. I dont know if they planned something else and maybe due to budget/time or studio interference that got changed. And while I dont think every killer needs some huge backstory explaining why they are what they are, it seemed like they were setting up in the beginning that he was human and then by the end, its seems they wanted to suggest that maybe he's supernatural of some kind. I wish that had maybe more explanation or felt more coherent. Production wise, it comes across as a cheaply made movie...which hey....it probably was. I think the kills were pretty decent in terms of the make-up effects. Can't say they were always at 100% ( a couple times its obvious a dummy is there) but overall decent for the kind of budget this film had. And if you like brutal kills in horror movies, this film definitely has it. Definitely does not shy away from the gore. It's not a great film in any stretch of the imagination. But I think if you're just looking for a crazy film to watch come Halloween and you dont want to think too hard....this might be up your alley.",Terrifier

However, there's one scene in this movie that makes me so damn uncomfortable I kind of wish I had never watched it in the first place.

53,scb_coldsteel,Gory fun,7,1 October 2018,"So I watched the new horror film Terrifier on Netflix. I wasn't really expecting much, but I must say I really enjoyed it for what it was. The plot of the movie is incredibly simple. A killer clown is on the loose to murder people in a vicious and gory spectacle of blood and guts. That's pretty much the entire movie. It's not exactly the most complex of films, but it still makes for an entertaining blood-soaked slasher. I will say that there were a couple overused horror cliches peppered throughout the movie though. Of course it's rare to find originality in the horror genre nowadays.The central antagonist is a creepy clown that does nothing but grin and murder. His murderous antics all around made him a memorable villain. I could easily see this film spawning a few sequels. If you are looking for a complex backstory or character motivation look elsewhere. The villain is a killer clown who murders people because he's a killer clown. What can I say, clowns are creepy.For any gore fan out there this movie certainly delivers. The violence is over-the-top and in your face. Every new character introduced is an excuse for the clown to murder them in some creepy manner. The movie wasn't exactly working with A-list actors, but I didn't find any actor to be distracting.While I did enjoy the creep factor of the antagonist and the level of gore, the movie didn't provide much suspense. I would have preferred more genuinely scary moments then the shock and all spectacle the movie provided.All around Terrifier was a surprisingly well made low budget slasher. It wasn't the smartest movie in the world and could definitely use some polishing, but it provided a creep factor and lots of blood and guts. Recommended viewing for this Halloween. A 7 out of 10.",Terrifier

From the opening credits until the credits end and roll this film 
does the trick of keeping you terrified. Albeit the title ""Terrifier"" but it doesn't stop there the movies antagonist we'll call him terrifying clown is not only a psychopath but the mystery behind why? his look, his walk how he moves on screen keeps your horrified meter on atleast 8 all the way through. This feeling will continue to grow more and more as the movie progresses. 
Now there are little things as far as the ending seemed rushed and forgettable and thats something writers and directors battle with in post production but hey for a movie to come out of left field and smack me by surprise i was highly entertained AND SO therefore that makes this A GOOD MOVIE RATING.

Nice little blood-filled, creepy clown flick.",7,21 February 2019,"There are plenty of synopses about this film, so there is no need to rehash storyline here other than to mention that it was far better and more enjoyable than expected. Not only was Terrifier well written but the overall production was a pleasant surprise, from the decent (though not exceptional) acting, to the special fx, editing, and cinematography. Nothing is what would be considered top notch or award winning, but everything was at the very least average, and in some cases good. In the case of David Howard Thornton (who plays the clown), he was darn near superb. Overall the film is an enjoyable watch, brining some new twists to an overused concept. Having some decent (though not excessive) blood and gore was a treat as well, since so many killer clown movies stop short of actual carnage and terror.Having read through all the reviews, I am surprised at the low ratings from a handful of reviewers. Though, upon watching the film and rereading these reviews it is evident that the reviewers had one or more of the following issues:
went in to the film with different expectations for what they would view, most notably from reading reviews that claim it is too gory or not gory enough. People tend to forget that these are very subjective terms, and what one person finds exceptionally gory might be tame to another,made some false comparisons to other films; doing so is always a mistake unless there are connected elements between the films. Most notably, there are a few reviews that specifically mention 'It' or 'Clown,' and while some critics' reviews made these comparisons, viewers were obviously not able to view Terrifier without carrying in the preconceived ideas of what it should/would be,lots of complaints that the story offered nothing new and followed similar formulas to other killer clown movies.With regards to the first two, it's always a bummer when a decent, enjoyable movie is panned because of a viewer's preconceived notions and already-established expectations. There is some truth to the story being a bit formulaic, but that shouldn't mean it can't be enjoyable. The plot & story are different enough that it hasn't been told a million times over, even if it's a bit formulaic. Viewers watching this for the first time can be aware of this, but for crying out loud...don't judge Terrifier on the merits or content of other films. Watch it for what it is, and enjoy it.",Terrifier
59,80sHorror,classic slasher throwback!,10,4 November 2018,"I went to the Premiere of Terrifier last night. I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a roller coaster of fright and thrills. It had the retro feel of horror films from the 70's and 80's. It was a great night of fright and I'll definitely see the film again.
On the edge of my seat from beginning to end. If you're a horror fan it's a must watch.",Terrifier
60,glenmatisse,Sort of Gross,4,11 July 2020,"How much you enjoy Terrifier depends on how compelling you find the design of the main villain, because he's the star of the show here. This is one of the film's main faults, because what's truly terrifying in short glimpses becomes almost comical when you keep seeing it in garish light.None of the other characters make much of an impact and they're unfortunately not immune to making typical dumb horror movie character mistakes and lapses in logic. There's also a far too long scene of the villain splitting a totally nude woman in half that felt utterly disgusting (and not in a good way). I'm not usually one to call out slasher flicks for misogyny, but there was something particularly ugly about that scene.",Terrifier
61,hotwheelerd,Crazy Clown,8,11 September 2018,"I was Bored so I came across this FILM. It didn't look That good but I was Bored how much more BORED can I be LOL. 
So i Watched it I give it a 8 out of 10 WHY?
Much better than I thought. It was Fast past, Very Creepy Clown, Very KIND of ridicule 80s KIND of Surprised and Camera Work on Cross Effects on MOVIE Fans we Love. The man that Played the Clown was only in like 5 MOVIES. But PLAYED the Creepy, Killing, Weirdo, Not Talking, Ugly, Slim, Clown. He didn't have to say anything but just the site of him was enough. So in my option that was GREAT in the FILM. It KIND of took you back a bit to the 70s and 80s FILM'S AGAIN. You didn't know what to expect.
Another reason why I give this FILM a 8 out of 10. Is because Low Budget and the Chicks and Staff still PRETTY HOT. But Fairy NEW and PRETTY AVERAGE. 
I also liked the scenes like old times. When your watching the Movie and you know what's going to happen. EXAMPLE ""OK DUMMY ONE CHICK WAS KILLED, RUN THE OTHER WAY, DON'T WALK MORE INTO THE BUILDING STUPID""
I love STUPID senses like that. It KIND of makes you giggle a bit. Then when the DUMMY gets KILLED. You KIND of feel BAD Lol. Like saying to yourself ""OH MAN SHE IS SO HOT""

64,punisherversion1,An awesome villain but not much story,6,8 September 2018,"Terrifier:
Written and directed by Damien LeoneI was drawn in by the hypnotic grin of Art the Clown. Those angular features, that little hat perched to one side on top of his head, his wicked smile. Art the Clown is an incredibly well designed villain. He grabs your attention almost immediately from appearance alone. That is the main reason I decided to give this horror flick a whirl. This movie is gross. It features over the top and intense gore scenes. The gore is so excessive that things become rather comical. I'm not entirely certain it was meant to be comical but I think it might have been. Art is the hero in this film. They open the movie on him donning his costume and loading up his weapons like the beginning of a superhero film. So much was put into this character and so much was put into the gore effects that there wasn't much left for the rest of the movie.The story falls flat completely. The acting is abyssmal all around. The lines they're given to say hurts your brain. Now this is not necessarily a deal breaker in horror movies. It doesn't ruin this movie. What ruins what good will the character design and effects gives you is the utter stupidity of the main characters. They do things that will make you second guess your thought process if you're thinking even a little bit. Art gets to them way too easily so any suspense the movie seems to be trying for fails miserably. We're just stuck sitting there waiting to see what horrible death Art has planned for them. That's not much of a story and even the one that's there is filled with a whole lot of hot air. I really do like the design of Art the Clown. I think he's an interesting, creepy character and I truly believe this has the potential to be finessed into a workable horror franchise. The actor playing Art is so expressive in just his body language. I'm torn about this one. The hazy camera work that showed its ugly head in the middle of the movie onwards til the end bothered me because the beginning didn't have that problem. The victims are dumb as a headless chicken taking an oratory class. There's no story and no real tension but the effects and kills were superb and the villain is really cool looking. I'll give this one a C.",Terrifier

70,urthpainter,Special effects wizardry...,6,3 April 2018,"...does not make this move anything more than a detailed exhibition in depravity. This is an ugly film, full on sinister content. I'm not saying this is necessarily bad - Terrifier has a kind of directness and purity that I'm sure many slasher/horror fans appreciate. I just need a bit more than violence for it's own sake. I like a villain with a bit of a back story - any story - any story at all? No questions are answered - who, what, when, where, why? Again, I'm sure that someone could tell me why none of this matters with regarding this particular movie, and what Terrifier actually does. Which is?Horrific violence done with incredible, practical effects. These effects must be seen to be understood. They are effects that make you feel emotion, horror and true discomfort. Can't remember the media reference: book, movie, TV show - but the villain talked about the space between when someone is alive, and when they become an inanimate thing. This can happen in infinite ways, and the writer director of this movie prefers intense physical trauma. His ability to first introduce an actor, then show a brutal death with gory effects, then show the corpse being mutilated? This movie is at the top of that list! No small feat to be sure. I can't even imagine the work that goes into these scenes, and how to make it work in the editing room after the fact. These scenes are the work of a master in this specific area - practical fangora style effects. This guy needs more jobs in Big Budget films!But that is my opinion, and what I feel Terrifier brings to the table in terms of merit. But also, in my opinion, get this guy a script please! His direction isn't bad! I thought the actors had a kind of believable nature with their dialog and actions. His effect work is jaw dropping (maybe jaw removing?). But this movie has very little content, and almost zero point or depth of meaning. For some, this approach may be admirable, even ideal - but I want a more rounded film with something to actually say.great effects/shallow content: 6 out of 10",Terrifier

But the victims ultimately committed the sin of making me not care if they lived or died. They weren't bad concepts, just poorly executed (no pun intended). The film harkens back to some traditional slashers in the mystery of who the killer and his motivation, so that doesn't bother me at all for a slasher film, but the characters' dumb choices are awful no matter the kind of film.",Terrifier

A lot of talk about Art the clown being a new horror icon. Not for me. This guy doesnt come anywhere close to Freddy, Jason or Michael and never will IMO. This is basically 90 mins of mindless violence which maybe 20 years ago id have been lapping up but they could have at least attempted a story here.

Instead, the poor pacing, lack of tension and suspense made for a kind of dull film experience. Yes, Art is a crazy, vicious clown killer. If that's all you want, then you'll see it here as he wounds, kills and dismembers people. The problem is, he will injure someone--a woman's ankle is almost torn out--and the next scene, she's running. People have their heads bashed in...and later, are able to get up and function. It really doesn't make a lot of sense and since Art seems to pop up in more places than possible, he's never really a surprise--he's overused. Clearly the director knew the story was thin, so every few minutes, Art pops up to attack someone. It really is disappointing since the short films showed some potential but when a whole film is given to Art, he's boring and predictable.

89,LBarlane24,The only people praising it are low IQ gorehounds,3,26 October 2020,"Directed by Damien Leone, Terrifier is a B-slasher film based off of a segment in the 2013 anthology film, All Hallow's Eve. Let me start off by saying that my expectations for this were slightly high to say the least. That being said, I gave it a watch, and I honestly found myself quite intrigued; at least, during the first fifteen minutes. But after the second act, I virtually stopped giving a damn.From what I've heard, there was quite a lot of hype surrounding this flick. But after having watched the whole thing, I really can't see how that's possible. All it is is an hour-long splatter-fest. Don't get me wrong though, I didn't hate it ... at first, and that had to do with the two central girls, Tara and Dawn. Now I will agree with everyone on the platform that Dawn was pretty annoying, and I knew the moment she appeared onscreen that she was going to get axed off. Tara on the other hand was the one who stood out the most for me. I was in fact rooting for her every time she appeared onscreen. But as soon as she herself got put to rest, I (like many others) felt completely cheated.So right after Tara gets axed off, the rest of the film focuses on her sister, Vicky, whom (believe it or not) we no jack about. She of course survives at the end as the only thing she contributes to is being the hideously disfigured young woman shown in the very beginning.And last but certainly not least is David H. Thornton as Art the Clown. All I can say is that this man clearly gave it his all in this role, especially during the restaurant scene. That being said though, as menacing as Art was, he isn't interesting ... at all. I will go so far as to compare him to the titular clown from Stitches. As boring and dumb as that movie was, said character at least had some funny one-liners and used his special CLOWN POWERS to murder all of his victims. This is more than I can say for Art as all he does is walk and sit around with that stupid creepy smile and uses the generic serial-killer tools to chop up and slice his victims; he also uses a gun at one point which is apparently more significant than I make it out to be.All that being said, do yourself a favor and avoid this one, unless you're an edgy teen or adult who just wants to see a bunch of pointless dimwits get sliced and diced. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is literally a gorno. After all, I've seen a whole bunch of reviewers praise it simply for it's bloody effects and sadistic killer and nothing else.I've also seen comments arguing that ""It's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek"" and ""It's a throwback to the 70s-80s slasher films."" Again, do yourself a favor and watch Scream instead. When I watch a slasher film, I'm not watching it just to see helpless people get stabbed to death. I want to see depth, I want someone to root for. And if you seriously say that you were rooting for Art the clown the whole time, I seriously question your mentality.All in all, the people calling this the ""best slasher and/or scariest movie to date"" just for its GRUESOME CONTENT (and/or simply because of its antagonist) really need to learn the difference between horror and SHOCK VALUE. With that said, I rate it 3.5/10.",Terrifier

95,fewald139,Copious gore and dark humor make this grindhouse B-movie worth the watch,7,16 April 2020,"To pull off many scenes in Terrifier, most of the people involved in its making have to fall on the sadist spectrum--which is great news for us gorehounds. Filmed with a budget of just $100,000, Terrifier is surprisingly impressive and entertaining.There isn't a complicated story here. Terrifier doesn't need one. The film basically follows a day-in-the-life of the homicidal mischief-maker, Art the Clown, as he causes shenanigans that end in a laudable kill count. If you like splatter films, you'll love this. As expected on a budget like this, sometimes things fall short; the acting, while competent and better than most films of this caliber, leaves much to be desired when people are screaming (I never believed these people were actually in danger or pain). Sometimes you can tell the practical effects are special effects, if only because bony body parts ""squish"" a little too much or open cavities have an absence of chunky viscera. The film never scared me, and the gore never felt overly realistic, but it's amazing that Terrifier has better kills than the vast majority of modern horror films with a fraction of their budgets. The third on-screen kill of the movie is quite possibly the most gruesome and dementedly creative I've ever seen put to film. Kudos!Terrifier's shining star is Art the Clown, played by David Howard Thornton, an ex-mime in real life who is having so much fun in the role. I need more of this character! Art combines his sadistically brutal murder methods with dark humor by mocking victims with dances, creepy-cheesy grins, and child-like little waves that had me grinning and chuckling out loud quite a few times. He is quite the little stinker, and I found myself rooting for him just to see more.I hope to see Art the Clown return in future films. Until then, Terrifier entertained me with its unique mix of copious gore and dark humor more than other B-movies of its type have, and I recommend it to anyone with the stomach for splatter and gorno films. Special shout-out must go to James A. Janisse from the Dead Meat YouTube channel, whose video on Terrifier talking about its kills got me to put this on my watchlist.",Terrifier

I agree with most that the Terrifier is indeed terrifying with his odd makeup and general creepiness. Be warned, the kills go a little overboard on the gore/blood, so wouldn't recommend watching this at dinner time. Not a BAD movie, but not great either.

100,amazing_sincodek,Masterpiece of brutal visual horror,9,8 November 2018,"But, N.B., nothing more than that.""Terrifier"" is a nonsensical film where a nameless guy in a truly spooky clown costume commits a variety of atrocities. The atrocities, as well as the spookiness of the clown himself, are the purpose of the film. Two faces get wrecked in the first half hour alone. The film embraces the ethos of exploitation, specifically as developed in low budget horror films in the 1970s - 1980s, and exceeds any reasonable expectations you can have from that perspective.Incidentally, though the real draw is the frequent and copious gore, there's a bit of subtlety as well. When re-watching a couple of key sequences, I was surprised to notice how rich the sequences were beyond the immediate dismemberment. For example, in an early face-mangling sequence, there are quick cuts away to beauty products, emphasizing that this isn't just a physical injury, but also a sentimental injury for a victim who takes great pride in her physical beauty.Anyway, it's bloody and spooky and worth your time if you've watched classic gore movie and wonder why they don't make them like that anymore.",Terrifier

Thankfully, the feature film version abandons the ridiculous, appearing-suddently-out-of-nowhere, Droopy Dog shtick and significantly dials down the grainy, flickering, old-vhs effect that distracted and irritated me in its prototypethere's not much in the way of story here. Audiences aren't provided with any backstory for the slasher or his victims; if you have any questions, they won't be answered. Just sit back and enjoy the character design, make-up, gore and splatter for what it is. Art the Clown lives up to his name through performance art that leaves his victims terrified before he hacks, slashes and sculpts their bodies into twisted works of art for your sadistic viewing pleasure",Terrifier

It really doesn't need one. The point is to horrify and it is absolutely terrifying. The actor that plays the clown is an actual mime, and he is so very good at being the creepiest thing you can imagine. His facial expressions, his walk, his body movements. Like, what the hell? Taps into that sort of fear. Ya know? Creepy smiles and no speaking? Standing still with an evil grin and then randomly moving fast as hell. No, ma'am.

You don't need a big budget to make a good horror film. Unfortunately, the bad acting and lack of a storyline puts you in a state of mind in which you don't care about the victims at all so you don't care when they die some horrific death. The one redeeming quality of this movie is the absolutely terrifying and creepy Art the Clown. He's more disturbing than any horror villain I can think of, even iconic ones like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger, hence the mixed feelings about this flick. I'm glad I watched this movie and I'll never forget Art the Clown, but I probably won't ever watch it again because everything else about it is completely forgettable",Terrifier

While the acting isn't that bad, and the story is pretty basic, it's relatively decent. Art the Clown is a sadistic mute clown. He has no background story as to why he is the way he is... which makes him more scary. He's one of the scariest clowns I've come across in movies. The music is pretty good. This gets extremely gruesome pretty fast, so beware of that, and don't eat anything while watching this. I find this to be rewatchable and a great movie for Halloween-time.

108,LasKeepsItReal,The Terrifier is The Tormentor!,7,28 October 2017,I watched the horror film Terrifier tonight and here is my review for the movie that shall contain some minor spoilers throughout.The movie is based around Art the black and white clown who is even more deadly than he is serious.During a Halloween night out two friends Dawn and Tara decide to go for something to eat and whilst doing so see a strange and creepy looking clown along the way.The situation changes when Tara needs help from her sister Victoria and then things rapidly go from fun to chaotic and it is then that people are going to be affected in a selection of different scenarios and many vicious and even crude ways! I did like that there was an evolution in many ways of Art the clown coming from the short film Terrifier in 2011. This feature length film delivers in many departments for horror fans from extreme violence and blood to comedy and atmospheric music.Terrifier does attempt to be like many other post modern horror films with certain references however it does add some things that make it stand out from other more recent films whilst still managing to keep you engaged and entertained.I would rate the Terrifier 7 out of 10!,Terrifier
109,lord-of-the-lez,"Good, but not fun",5,17 March 2019,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think it's a good horror movie but it's not a movie that I can say I enjoyed. Or one that I would watch again. It's a slasher with gory scenes that will shock, disturb, and possibly even traumatize you. I consider myself to have a strong stomach when it comes to gore and among the many horror flicks I've seen, there's not much gore that bothers me. This movie had a scene that was so bad I had to look away...also, you can never relax while watching this movie. The killer clown is so mad and unpredictable that it will make you tense up in anticipation of what new messed up thing he will pull next.One thing I did enjoy about this movie was the dark humor. The killer clown is messed up, but there are some things he does that are just so bizarre that you can't help but laugh. The guy that played the role does an excellent job at striking the right balance between creepy and funny.Overall, it's not my favorite kind of horror. I didn't exactly like the movie because it disturbed me in all the wrong ways (unlike, say, Sinister or The Descent). But if you like gory splatter-fests and want to traumatize yourself, then go for it.",Terrifier

When he just stares at people he's creepy as hell and then that smile so repulsive and wicked, he kills his victims smirking away like a demented demon you so want the victims to get away and that clown face gets his comeuppance but no of course not. By the end of the film I feel is his face his real face as it seems to look so real how can it be just makeup and a false nose with his bloody teeth.

Its hard for you to look at ANY clown horror movie and actually want to watch it. I would say The Terrifier definitely has terrible acting, tons of plot holes, and little to no character development. But you have to ask yourself, is it really necessary? Do you really have to expect some deep back story about why the clown does what he does? Without giving too much away. I am an avid horror film guy. The gore is a 7/10 for me. The clown is a 7/10. The acting, story, and characters get a 1/10. Overall it was creepy. I would describe it as the movie ""It"" meets ""Texas Chainsaw"" with a little bit of Ed Gein (inspiration for Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs as well as Leather face).

121,badscene,Embarassing for all involved,1,13 February 2019,"Watching Terrifier, after all of the hype, was an embarassing experience. Horror fans really need to have higher standards if this is what's hitting their spot; like a nice well intentioned girl you see in a relationship with an abusive sadistic scumbag with an IQ akin to that of pencil shavings.Terrifier is not a film. There is no plot and you could find a better cast in a summer camp production of Grease. The lines of dialogue from its generic characters are delivered with no effort making the whole film feel like a lazy aimless excuse to watch people tortured by a clown.From what I've gathered, this director has been trying to make this Art the Clown happen for years, through various shorts and anthology films. Well some words of advice: if as a filmmaker all you have in your deck is a mute clown with scary face paint and a twisted smile who butchers up one dimensional non-actors, (really, they might as well be mannequins), you should stop making films. This director clearly has no inspiration, and is trying to carve a career for himself off of one half baked idea, poorly executed. Maybe he should be a costume or makeup FX designer, but if this is the future of horror, I hope Art the Clown hammers a knife through my skull ASAP.",Terrifier

* The killer clown is the creepiest and scariest i have ever seen.
* Considering its budget, the cinematography, gore, effects and make up are outstanding.
* The killings are amazingly enjoyable. In this part the movie does not hold back!
* It starts out very promising.Now for the bad stuff:
* They kill the main actress at the half of the movie. So.... there is no one really to care about.
* The killer clown could have EASILY been killed AT LEAST 5 times during the movie. Once you realize the pattern as a viewer (the clown hurts the victim, victim fights back, knocks off the clown, runs away, the clown re-hunts the victim), it becomes extremely boring and predictable.
* They put supernatural stuff crap at the end of the movie, so the clown can be resurrected at any time, hoping the producers to have an easy sequel excuse. The worst thing of the movie is the ""pattern"" as i mentioned. I ruins a movie that had the potential of becoming a cult classic.",Terrifier
126,CoffinVideo1983,Art the Clown isn't just the Slasher we NEED... He's the Slasher we DESERVE!!!!,10,16 October 2019,"Get ready to fall in love all over again...If you're anything like me and grew up in the late 80's and 90's... A time where horror movies consisted of unstoppable Slashers, full frontal shower scenes, and that creepy guy that always seemed to warn you that everyone was going to die if you proceeded onward... Then you're probably also in the same boat of missing those types of horror bobbydazzlers.Well, ladies and gentlemen... I present you with Art the Clown. Art is a demented, fecal smearing, tiny top hat wearing, horn honking, murderous clown that always seems to get the most enjoyment and pleasure from murdering his victims. He's raw, extremely violent, and has a wonderful taste for gore covered in more gore.As a slasher style horror movie villain, Art gives audiences everything they're looking for in a horror movie icon, but with a new, modern take on the role.
First of all, we have absolutely no idea where Art is from, how he got here, or even what he is for that matter... and not knowing just makes him all the more intriguing. And if that's not creepy enough for you... he's also a completely silent character. Yep, no talking from this guy; however, with his subtle movements and sinister grins he somehow embodies all the charisma of a young Freddy Kruger.
This is in a large part due to the amazing acting of David Howard Thornton as Art the Clown. Thornton is a huge fan of, not only the horror icon greats, but the like of such silent film stars as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Rudolph Valentino. His classic comedic acting style, alongside his creepy mannerisms, gives Art an identity like no other.So grab some popcorn, gummy bears, and that extra large cherry coke... then try to keep it all down as you watch Art stab, shoot, strip, skin, murder, maim, and massacre his way into the hearts of horror fans everywhere.***Side Note: Art Originally appears in the short film ""The Ninth Circle"" and the later short film ""Terrifier"" which are also must see films. If you can't find them on YouTube or floating around the net somewhere... You can catch both of them in their entirety in the horror anthology film ""All Hallows Eve.""I give Terrifier, and Art himself, a very loving 10 out of 10!!!!",Terrifier

However Art the clown is wearing a full wig. Much more hair than the scalping would allow. Other than that the movie is great scary fun.

Just pure gore, no fillers or preservatives. Don't worry about anything else. Hatchet and its sequels have done a nice job bringing gore back into the mainstream horror genre. Or somewhat mainstream. The use of real bodies and no CGI is a great thing to enhance the idea of the gore. The characters are mainly bozos running around with empty heads searching for their brains but not remembering that they have phones in their hands and could call 911 at any time. Like Tara's sister. She sees Tara's friend sawed in half. She then proceeds to spend the next few minutes running around with a cellphone in her hand. Hmm. Cops maybe. I know, then it would be more realistic. I know. If this college student couldn't think to call 911 after seeing a girl sawed in half, then better off for the viewer. It is funny how frigging dumb people really are in horror movies.

Horrible writing, bad directing, and amateur acting. The cinematography was also very amateur, I could've gotten past it if everything else was in order, but unfortunately it wasn't. It's ultimately just another cliche horror movie with characters that make dumb choices and scenes that lack logic. There are other insanely stupid factors in this movie but you will see what I mean when you watch it (If you still even want too).Personally I think the only upside was the clown. I found the clown to be rather original as far as appearance. I feel like the creators behind the clown (the actor, writer(s), and director(s)) also hit the mark with the clowns personality. I found it to be the perfect mix of comedic, psychotic, and straight up creepy which in my opinion is the perfect combo for a horror clowns personality. Too bad that he wasn't used in the proper movie though, because if so, I feel he could've been an iconic movie character. Who knows, maybe he'll inspire future horror movie clowns and contribute to a great movie to come.",Terrifier

The acting was fine, so too were the effects and styling of shots focused around the clown, but the ""plot"" (for what it's worth) could have used some work. What I didn't enjoy was the brutality for the sake of brutality; a good horror movie doesn't have to leave you feeling disgusted afterwards. Leaving some things up to the audience's imagination is how a good horror movie should be shot. The antagonist was menacing, although he was practically in every scene. Again, this doesn't leave much for the audience to wonder where he is or where he's going next. The movie kind of ended for me when the ""main"" girl died. It was so anticlimactic. I half expected she would have got away somehow, and like multiple characters in the movie, she had several opportunities to kill the clown but seemed persistent on hitting him once and running away. There wasn't an excessive amount of cliches (there's definitely a few), but the ones I did notice were really unforgiving *cough cough that ending*.Should you see this movie? I certainly wouldn't recommend it, but, there are even worse ones out there. It's good and bad, but really mostly bad.",Terrifier
137,MsGoreXale3723,Excellent slasher,9,27 October 2018,"I don't understand people saying it's pointless, no plot, cliched. It's a horror movie! People go into horror movies expecting a script with possibility of being an Oscar contender. Those people really need to watch a different genre...I don't even bother listening to their reviews because they obviously don't understand that slashers aren't supposed to be watched for their script; they are meant for blood, gore, kills; you get the gist.
Now, as for my review, I loved this movie. You get all the above with pure brutality. Most horror movies lately dumb down the violence, blood, and gore to appeal to all audiences. If I watch a horror/slasher movie, I want to see that in all its glory and this delivered! It was refreshing seeing a filmmaker go back to the roots of 70's and 80's horror films.
I'm one who loves practical effects in horror films and an excellent job was done in that department. The acting was good, better than some slashers. We're bad decisions made by the characters as others have claimed? Of course, but what kind of horror movie would it be if the characters made smart choices?! You can't go into a movie like this and pick it apart. The movie would only be 15 minutes if the characters made decisions like they were in the real world! Critiquing a horror movie based on character decisions is taking a movie like this way too seriously. Maybe these people need to watch a different type of film.
I would like to give extra credit to David Howard Thorton who played Art the Clown. His portrayal of a sadistic clown was amazing. Seriously, he was really creepy. I don't give spoilers, but I'll hint at one particular scene when a character was hiding in a metal cabinet. When you see it, you'll understand. All I'll say is he must be a fan of Buffalo Bill. This says a little, but you can't fully understand the creepiness of it until you see it. Mr. Thorton deserves most of the credit for making this movie stand out. But as I said before the acting was good for this type of movie.
I highly recommend that fans of slasher films watch this movie. Please don't go into this movie to pick apart every flaw like it's supposed to be an award winning film. Unless, of course, it's a contender for a Fangoria Chainsaw award. Watch it for what it is; a superb, hold back nothing, horror film. One of the goriest movies I've seen in a long time. Sure, I've seen gorier, but this is definately up there with the goriest films. Definately a must-see for fans of the genre.

This film released in 2017 was picked up by Netflix a year later to hoping to traumatise its audience like the film ""IT"". However this clown film surprisingly had me running.....for the toilet. I have seen many gore films but this one tops my list, literally. You don't get as much gore in a regular movie due to MPAA concerns but this film goes way beyond. Avoid this movie if you have a very uneasy stomach.Anyways the film Terrifier takes the story of an evil and very creepy looking clown named Art who then sees some new victims and begins terrorising and torturing the poor souls. By torturing I don't mean stretching or dunking or tickling a persons feet in the stocks, I mean literal bloody torture. What I thought about this film was that it just all over the place. There were too many scenes which I thought were pointless and did not really have me paying attention to the whole plot line. Even though there were some scares and tricks up their sleeve I just think that it was not as good as the director hoped. Terrifier is truly a one of a kind film that is perfect for the people that love a good ol clown horror film and especially for those with strong stomachs and their love to see a bunch of blood and guts coming out of a person. But if the film was more properly taken seriously and given it a better story line then this film would have been perhaps one of the greatest clown films every made. Unfortunately it does not live up to those expectations.",Terrifier

I hate clown movies, not because they''re scary, but because they're crap. This isn't. From the opening 30 seconds, you know you are in for something special and genuinely creative. All the actors are solid, the script is actually reasonable, the stock used is the same like in the Aviator, and it really works with non-stop hyper-realistic blood and gore, the clown is actually scary and a strangely interesting character despite being mute, the deaths are creative and ""Uggh"" initiating throughout, the score is suitably atmospheric, lighting and direction are perfect and the pace is high throughout the movie. I don't know what else you want me to say - it really is one of the best slasher movies ever, best clown movies ever and best horror flicks for a ****ing age - there are literally no bits where anything has been skimped on. I don't have anything to do with the production, I know I seem to be brown nosing a lot - but anyone with a slight inclination towards horror in general has to be impressed. This is not hyperbole.

Across from them sits our hero, Art the Clown. He gives them a lovely smile and makes some cute funny faces. And yes his look is horrifying but there's something loveable about him. One of the girls takes a selfie with him and he gives the other one a ring out of a candy machine in the corner. Not long after this the mean owner kicks him out, and the girl throws away the ring, and Art sets out for revenge. Or is there no motive, no rhyme or reason to his madness? What follows is 90 minutes of sheer terror and pure black comedy, as the characters wind up in an abandoned apartment building with only an exterminator and a mentally ill woman, and Art stalking them all. David Allen Thornton is absolutely brilliant as Art. He's unpredictable. Unhinged. Completely silent even when injured. Truly frightening. A surprisingly great clown performer. He has a bag of toys and he'll use anything at his disposal to dispatch his victims. Shocking gore and twists abound. My jaw dropped many times and I laughed out loud at so many of his awesome mannerisms. The lighting, cinematography and editing are all on point too and the whole thing has a very grindhouse feel. There's so much personality. The practical gore effects are excellent and the film doesn't shy away from showing you anything. And the moments of tension in between are palpable.

I did watch ""All Hallows Eve"" and it wasn't terrible but it wasn't the best. It was lacking in some parts for example the costumes. Seeing the trailer for this movie though made me want to see this. Clowns do not scare me, I find nothing scary about them at all however this villain; Art the clown makes me rethink that thought. This clown was brilliant. He does not speak; he only moves in a comedic yet creepy way. He is like the Michael Myers of killer clowns. The actions are all you get; no silly lines or catch phrases. So bravo to this new movie villain! The acting was pretty good, the special effects were awesome (no CGI that I despise) and overall a great story. A basic story idea that is something out of the 80s slasher universe but maybe thats something us horror fans have been waiting for? This is a breath of fresh air from all the garbage remakes and unoriginal horror films out there now. This movie will make any horror fan scream for joy as it is original, weird at times and never boring.

156,eeluksw,Stay For Art,3,21 November 2018,"Falling victim to just about every hokey horror cliche to pad its run time, it's really only worth watching for every frame that Art The Clown appears, who himself is the most well thought out of anything here. His appearance lends itself to a few pretty frightening images, and his total silence extends to movement; it's unsettling to hear not even the creak of his bones or a rustling of fabric.It's also horrifically violent, heavy on facial mutilation, and I liked how the movie didn't restrict Art to any one tool, it gave him a trash bag to lug around just about anything with a sharp edge or blunt force.However these small decisions regarding Art are exceptionally lacking in the film's other aspects, which include bland actors, cheap lighting, and no grounds on its sense of place. The bulk of the movie happens in some gross, nondescript apartment/warehouse hybrid, and it just looks like total poopy.

160,papadeltazulu,Has its flaws but still one of the creepiest killer clown movies out there,9,29 March 2018,"This obviously low budget killer clown flick had me in two minds. Finding out it was a re-imagining of the horror short or the same name, that eventually found its way into the horror anthology film ""All hallows eve"" kind of put me off. I saw that film a while ago and although Art the clown was a terrifying clown to look at, the film itself did nothing for me. Then after reading all the reviews on here, most of them completely glowing I was even more sceptical. Most low budget films on here are riddled with 10 star reviews from the crew and cast members so it's hard to trust reviews from people who have written ONE glowing review on a new movie.However, this film deserves all the plaudits it is getting if you are looking for a gruesome, un-nerving and downright bonkers horror film. Makes Pennywise look like Krusty was one of the comments I read, yeah right, then I watched it and was like, ok, so it actually makes Pennywise look like one of the Grumbleweeds, nevermind Krusty.Art the clown is freakin terrifying in this, I don't know who the guy playing him is, I've never heard of him before but he deserves so much credit for bringing this evil beast to life. He is so creepy and brutal, it's difficult to watch at times and the death scenes in this film make Saw and Hostel look tame.Yes it's not perfect by any means, the acting from some of the side characters could have been better (the main cast are fine) and one of the female victims in the second half of the film does some really stupid things that got on my nerves a bit and it is one of those films where (this always annoys me with horror movies) several victims have the villain at their mercy, lying on the ground while they are standing up holding a weapon, and what do they do? They run away and leave the villain to get back up again, really? You've just seen this clown brutally murder your friend and has attempted to murder you, you have him lying on the ground, completely at your mercy and what do you do? Finish him off and then make your escape? Nope, you leave him breathing, discard your weapon and run away, it's cliché and tired.However, people who watch films like this generally come for the atmosphere, the scares and the gore and in that department, Terrifier delivers in spades. everything reeks of the 80's despite it being set in modern times from the way its filmed, the music, the camera work etc but it really does have to be one of the most brutal, unforgiving and absolutely relentless horror films I've ever watched.Art the clown is great and is easily one of the most memorable movie monsters I've seen, despite the fact he never speaks or makes a noise, his screen presence is immense.
There is no CGI in this film and all the special effects are done practical and they look great, it shy's away from nothing and the effects look as realistic as they could have done. The effects team put a lot of effort in here.If you're one of those people who watch movies and pick holes in them, then you might not enjoy this as there are holes to pick at and if you don't enjoy torture porn like Saw and Hostel, again, avoid, but if like me, you like good slasher films, brutality in all its glory and a film that makes you squirm in your seat, then chances are, you're gonna love this.Low budget, lovingly made for its target audience, brutal, creepy and an absolute blast of a horror film.8/12 10",Terrifier
161,joyomi,The creepiest clown in movies.,6,19 April 2018,"I must say, Art the clown is far creepier than any other clowns in horror movies. Pennywise from the 2017 IT can not compare to Art. The design and the way Art mimes and taunts his victims are extremely well down and unsettling. But, the movie on whole is just above average, it starts out great, with the clown stalking to girls late Halloween night. The first part is way better than the second half, although the kills are extremely violent, it's so cartoony and over the top it's almost laughable. The atmosphere is alright, it takes place is some type of abandoned warehouse. Like I said, the second part of the movie somewhat drags and their are many cliches and dumb character decisions that are typical in horror movies.
So, I would probably recommend this movie, but mostly just to see how creepy the main clown antagonist is. I really think this is by far the scariest clown I have seen, and I am not one of the many scared by them.",Terrifier

It's packed full of gory, violent deaths and has a mute killer clown at the centre of it all. The fact that Art the clown doesn't speak at all in the film, and is extremely creepy adds to the overall scariness of the film. Tension is built very well, and the eerie music leaves you awaiting nervously the next scare. The death scenes and the gore are spot on and perfectly executed, it's just the character building which slightly lacks.

Yes, the clown is amazing, but the gore effects are phenomenal (and graphic).

However, where the filmmakers really screwed up is by (SPOILER ALERT!). killing off the best character in the movie by far, Tara, the dark haired girl. I thought that the actress was very good and sympathetic and by killing her off in the first half it just wrecked it. We had no one else to care about.. After that all you have is super clown killing everybody. Some of the reviews make you think that you're seeing another great horror classic but I don't think so.

The practical gore effects are SUPERB, but sadly there's not much else going on outside of that. None of the characters are grounded with any kind of back story, or even, well, story. The clown exists solely to be a brutal killer, and the victims are just cookie cutter slasher victims with no grounding to make you care about them outside of simply being basic human beings.It not particularly scary or shocking, although there are scenes that are clearly intended to be so.Its a decent shocker flick with some amazing practical gore effects, but it really didn't do anything with it's characters, and so nothing makes any sense narratively, and there's no impact to the kill scenes.",Terrifier

It is basically a B movie without looking really cheap like a lot of them do. It owes a lot to Herschell Gordon Lewis with a lot of over-the-top blood and guts and not bothering with any explanation why Art the Clown goes around and simply kills everyone. It also borrows quite a few bits from the early Halloween films, especially the last scenes.There aren't really any edge-of-the-seat scenes and scenes that make you jump as right from the start it's clear that no one is safe but especially the latter makes it interesting: as soon as you think you know who the heroine/hero of the film is, she/he is usually slaughtered. This makes it difficult to identify and hope with any of the characters which is usually a staple of horror films, but that's also quite refreshing.As it is not that original, I wouldn't give it really high marks, but among all the disappointments that modern horror films usually are these days, this one is definitely entertaining.",Terrifier

There are seldom low-budget films that actually deliver, and this is my current favorite. Art the Clown is far superior as a horror villain because he has more style and personality (albeit silent) than the other offerings that are currently available (I'm looking at you, Victor Crowley). The masterful use of practical effects also elevates this film from the current IT incarnation. Murderous clowns have been done many times, but Art is the real deal; just when you think he may have some humanity he proves otherwise: ""Oh, he's not so bad...wait...WHAT?...holy crap, he's pure evil and loving it!"". I know the end somewhat set this up for a sequel, but I kinda hope it's left as a great ""one and done"". There's a lot of crappy horror movies out there, and this is destined to be a cult favorite.

Honestly, the acting was decent; the kills were awesome; and the level of creepy was on point. This movie featured some of the best kills I've seen in a long while in film, and I give them kudos for being inventive.The reason I personally am not scoring the movie higher is based on a few things that were flawed. I felt that sometimes the body props that were used during scenes were not proportionate, taking away from the realism. I also think they could have had the people who were the prey be smarter, making the chase more unique. It was a bit cliche in that sense.Overall I would actually suggest this movie to any horror fan; especially if you enjoy gore. It felt like a blend of the movies Wizard if Gore, IT and the Saw series combined. Give it a watch.**If your a horror person you probably won't jump at all. Just watch in enjoyment.

Tara (The dark haired main character) has plenty of opportunities to kill the clown over and over. Also killing off the main two characters basically in the first half of the movie was a horrible idea, different yes, still horrible though.

I cant begin to tell you how horrible some of these lines are in the movie.... humor me and picture this. woman's face has been shot repeatedly her bereaved sister collapses at her side. insert crying...wake up....no....then they hit you with the Oscar winning line.....""look at me"" LOOK AT ME! SHE DOESN'T HAVE A FACE ANYMORE!! Who wrote this! Its like asking a blind man to walk across the freeway its not gonna happen...
Art the clown is definitely a creepy character and I will say there is one great scene with him that involves wearing someone else body parts but other than that...imagine a clown running around killing people and you have the entire movie congrats.
If you want to have a good laugh at a corny slasher this is the movie for you. If your trying to sleep with the lights on....look else where.",Terrifier

I know it's not a high budget horror flick and I kept this in mind while watching. However much of what happens in this movie is just too unbelievable and far fetched. I found myself forced to suspend disbelief way too many times during this film. The acting also goes way downhill as the film progresses. The scene near the end has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Also, be prepared to suspend disbelief because the location, near the end, isn't believable either (you can't put a flower in a room that looks like it's been left untouched since the early 1900s and expect people to buy that it's somehow a newer place that only needs a bit of construction). The acting in the beginning was okay for a B-horror movie and the clown was scary (he/she/it also stayed in character even if the rest of the movie sucked). If you want a good horror movie that's low budget then watch Splinter (2008).",Terrifier

Usually when it comes to horror there's a story a plot and narrative. But with this thing there's none of that. Just tons of body horror without any real story to speak of. And nudity and grotesque violence that's all there is. The film goes into some very dark and perverted and frankly sick Things. That when I witnessed some of these things.

For the most part, Art the Clown is a breath of fresh air in a genre that is rife with lack of originality and iconocism. Art is a new breed of slasher -- one that movie goers will quickly fall in love with like they have Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees. I dare say that Art the Clown is the new face of horror!The effects and the kills in this movie are brutal, disgusting, and soothe the appetite of horror fans who can't get enough blood. Art the Clown proves just how menacing and evil he truly is.""Terrifier"" is a movie for the horror fan who loves (or hates) clowns, and should be approached as a film and story that will entertain as well as disgust.

Being Halloween, you don't even see kids on the street trick or treating, no parties, no Halloween festivities. I would have liked to know who the clown was, what his/her background was leading up to what they did in the movie. The ending also left much to be desired.

202,ethanmitchell-76313,What Horror Should Be,7,2 April 2018,"This is the way horror should be, creepy, unnerving, gory, and most of all a great time! Terrifier is something I have been waiting for since my first time watching Damien Leone's All Hallows Eve, from the very beginning of that movie I was obsessed with this Art the Clown character, and I truly couldn't get enough of him. Now finally Art has arrived in his own feature length film, and after watching Terrifier I am still wanting more of the most terrifying clown ever put to film.
The plot is not unlike that of other slasher films, we follow two girls the lead played by Jenna Kanell, who come across a menacing clown named Art, after their car tires are slashed the night turns into a nightmare as the evil clown will stop at nothing to torture and torment his victims.We will start by talking about the cast and acting. For the most part the acting is solid, or at least as solid as a campy 80's, low budget, slasher movies acting should be. The main characters throughout do a good job of seeming either dunk, scared, or just plain stupid. Of course some of the supporting casts acting wasn't quite up to par, but it never hurts the film, a movie of this breed should have a certain cheesiness to it, it can't be taken too seriously the entire time. Art the Clown is played by David Howard Thornton and not enough can be said about how amazing he is with the role. He perfectly captures the creepiness that Art has, his facial expressions at times make it hard to even look at him, especially if you suffer from coulrophobia, more about the clown later though.The gore in this movie is so much fun, it's not ultra-realistic, but it is just a fun time to watch, it's the cheesy type of gore that cult horror movies of the 80's were known for, squirting blood, decapitations, etc. If you are into these types of movies than you will love it, if you are overly critical and unrealistic than you won't enjoy these effects. In the age of CGI I love seeing these practical special effects, it really does flash me back to the glory days of Tom Savini and Rob Bottin. I don't know what the budget on this movie was but I'm sure it wasn't high, so personally I think the special effects crew did an amazing job of bringing the gore to life. With all that about the effects being said I will mention that the kill scenes in Terrifier are absolutely awesome, they aren't anything we haven't heard or seen before, but watching Art carry out these depraved, disgusting deaths is pretty astounding. There are a few kills that aren't only done well from a technical point of view but are honestly pretty brutal and not for the squeamish, it's nice to see an independent film maker in the U.S. bringing his form of extreme to the viewers, it's something you see a lot of in other countries, but in the States not so much.The score of the film is good and really helps build the suspense, the editing is great, the only mark down I have for Terrifier is the writing. It's nothing big and I don't mind it but I just noticed that the final half hour or so seemed a little choppy in terms of plot and storyline, but it's the closing sequences we get some of our best kills and most intense scenes with our antagonist Art. Having those exciting moments with at the end help the writing and think if we see more Terrifier films from Damien Leone the flow of the conclusion will be better.Now finally to the one thing that I wanted to talk about the most. Art the Clown. The name of the film captures what Art is, terrifying. Every moment he is on the screen he is captivating, one thing that I think works for him is that you truly don't know what he is going to do next, Art is the most unpredictable movie slasher that the horror community has ever seen. If you have seen All Hallows Eve or this movie than you will know that Art is much more than just a man in a costume, I won't dip into any spoilers in Terrifier but even in All Hallows Eve, Art defies logic constantly by showing up in places that he couldn't possibly be. It's like all the things that we criticize other slashers for like always catching their victims but only walking, being invincible, being resurrected, are all things that Art gets a pass on and the reason for that is simple, Art is cloaked in mystery. We have no clue who (or what) he is, where he comes from, how old he is, nothing, we literally know absolutely nothing about this character. That lack of back story is what makes him so compelling and scary. I hope for Art's sake we never learn anything about him because whatever explanation Damien Leone could give us wouldn't be enough to satisfy the fans. That's my advice, keep the mystery! Art for me is the scariest clown I've ever seen, he beats the likes of both 1990, and 2017 Pennywise, this is high praise and he deserves is. I hope that Art will eventually become a mainstream horror icon to the likes of Freddy and Jason, I think he could be the revival of the 80's horror sequel craze, I would love to see 3 or 4 more movies with Art as our focal point.Terrifier is an extremely fun, gory, 80's throwback. It's the perfect example of the direction that I want to see horror go, the idea of a killer clown isn't original by any means, but if you take your own spin on it, and execute it with your own style it could be done a million times and never get old! All the independent horror film makers need to watch Terrifier, take notes, and follow in the footsteps of Mr. Leone and the crew of Terrifier. It's not easy to make a movie and get it seen by viewers but the marketing and the select theater approach of Terrifier seems to have worked quite well, also the cover art is awesome and looks fantastic in any collectors collection. I would recommend this movie to both horror and non-horror fans alike, I think it has aspects that need to be seen in today's word especially by younger horror fans, so that they know what true horror is all about. Final score 9/10.",Terrifier

It does not try to be anything it isn't, and maintains the ability of being both humorous and disturbing at the same time, which makes the gore endurable. The performance of the clown-murderer is obviously the best part of the film, amusing the viewer with creepy glares and hilarious body language.

But that´s all, I can't even tell if there was a story or what´s the background story, motivation of the clown. Also there are some plot holes in the story, that it is at least sometimes hard to follow.
So if you are into the usual jump scares and some slauther of people, which one can see in x different movies in a better quality, go for it.

But I digress...Movie was better than I expected! I have a thing for Halloween where I watch nothing but horrors. I decided to give it a try.Think 80's horror flick. There's no CGI. It's all heavy duty special effects. The people that do them in this movie should be awarded. This is one of the most gruesome horror movies i've seen to date. The deaths are absolutely brutal.The antagonist of the movie, The Clown aka Terrifier, lives up to it's name. The actor who plays him plays him very well. It's almost method acting as if he studied a mad man and clown to incorporate it all together resulting in this Terrifier character. Some of the things he does in this movie is downright hilarious in a creepy kind of way.Do yourself a favor. Watch this movie. You will not regret it. Like an 80's horror flick, it's a great time.

208,T850,"Throwback to old Slashers, But infuriating to watch",2,24 April 2019,"I'm a fan of the old schlocky B grade horror films, The video nasties come to mind. And this one looked promising to say the least. However it suffers from one of the most common pitfalls of modern movie making, infuriating the audience.There's no plot to the film, that's ok really for this kind of movie. It's the kind of guilty pleasure we get at the cheesy low budget slasher that exploits with the gore. That part it gets rather right. Where it goes horribly wrong is where too much is demanded of the audience for the indulgences of Damien Leone [the director of the film.Basically the flow of events are incredibly trite with every cliche of slash movie characters displaying mind numbing stupidity all for the advantage of the killer clown. The characters actions invite frustration rather than sympathy. This brings a horrible predictability to the film and were just waiting for the end credits to roll.David Howard Thornton does an excellent job as the demented clown. He brings a surreal quality to his roll, and it's easy to see why he was cast as the Joker before. His entire performance is dumbshow as he doesn't have a single line of dialogue. Still, with no fault to Thornton, his menace was wasted as his cat and mouse stalking followed by his kills were a tedious slog rather than tension. With the forced stupidity of his victims, we end up being angrier at the victims rather than the clown himself.Everything is just so pointless in the film. I ended up rolling my eyes in frustration than feel any fear or fun... It could have been a fun old grindhouse type slasher, But instead we get a tedious slog to go through.",Terrifier

About 30 minutes later, her sister is in the warehouse and Tara has been scalped and had her torso sliced off, but she's alive telling Victoria to run??

212,CertainlySocrates,Mostly Successful,5,22 September 2018,"This was a low budget (but pretty good looking) throwback to 80's horror. (If there was any doubt, look for 3 special dedications in the credits.) More so than myself, horror fans seem to forgive a lot of things in these movies and really just care about whether or not the damned thing is actually scary -- and I have to say that, despite all its flaws, it made me uneasy when I went to bed after the viewing.You can't start reviewing this without talking about the clown. He's exceptionally uncomfortable and disconcerting. The costume design is killer, and mostly I thought the actor was doing a fine job. At times I thought his performance was lacking something, but I can't really put my finger on what it was -- sometimes it didn't feel clown-y enough to me, but I didn't hear that complaint from my movie partner. Maybe I'm being too harsh!Speaking of the acting, it was mostly on point, although there are two actors who can't really hold it together. The first is the Cat Lady who just didn't convince me and was kind of superfluous anyway; the second is the older sister upon whose shoulders rests the latter act(s). She was a convincing older sister: a cool, self-assured attitude and guardianship. But she was not great at playing a young woman who was scared for her life. Clearly she's not a bad actor but this didn't really play to her strengths.Final thoughts: The movie runs a little long and could have benefited from more discipline in writing and editing. The gore effects ranged from really fun to stomach churning. It didn't really play with the formula of the genre at all.",Terrifier
213,savannahlynnhill,Twisted fun,7,1 April 2018,"This was a creepy one, but not on a deep level. It was macabre in a fun sense. While certain parts of the movie were very unique, the chase scenes and fight scenes were predictable. The characters were a step above the usual drunk girls and jock guys we see in these types of movies. Two drunk girls in costumes are ready to go home after a night out on Halloween. One is quieter and the other is more annoying, funny in an obnoxious way. I enjoyed both of them as well as the other secondary characters. Overall, I don't really find Art the Clown terrifying, more just entertaining to watch. I didn't feel that deep sense of dread that comes from deeper character development, which we didn't get enough of here. But the characters are refreshing at times with their dialogue, and the acting is great. Unfortunately, they're all a little too helpless and that is frustrating. It also caused me to lose interest during times when they were in peril. The violence was over the top, but it wasn't cheap. It was gritty, bloody, and quite inventive. I wish the story had more heart. I could have really gotten on board with a smart heroine who was an actual adversary for such a demented villain.

You're not watching Nolan here. The thing that makes this movie great is the mime/clown/whatever he is. It's no exaggeration that he's one of if not the most terrifying killer clowns in film history. He makes you laugh with his extreme creepiness.The other reason to watch this (kind of messed up, but some people love it) is the gore. Practical special effects were used for all of the numerous shots of some truly messed up stuff. Easily some of the most vomit-inducing gore effects I've ever seen. The saw scene? Holy mother of god, there's a limit they surpassed that I've rarely seen before. I was cackling uncontrollably for most of the gore scenes in both disbelief of what I was seeing, and absolute disgust. The cliches and some other sub-par qualities add some good fodder for a bit of riffing, one of my favourite things about watching horror movies.

Until these two were captured and subsequently killed off, things were moving along quite nicely and eerily. I feared what was to come for these two, and they developed a level of likeability where I didn't want to any harm come to them.Focus then shifts to Samantha Scaffidi's Victoria, who COULD HAVE been a great surprise final girl. Yet, when it came down to it, the character continued to make completely stupid decisions to the point of frustration. This I will never understand about these movies. Sure, some have themselves an incredibly creepy, capable antagonist (and, make no mistake, the scenes with Art the Clown were GREAT), but the characters we are supposed to root for are created with little to no regard. My opinion is that behind every boogeyman, there should be a resourceful final girl to pull for to balance the forces of good and evil. All the good slashers have that component, but many lately seem to be going for shock instead and fall into obscurity as a result.For that reason, I say bin this one and hope that the next one will be better. 5 out of 10.",Terrifier

This movie knows what it is and doesnt take its self to seriously, which is why it works. I think if the would have actually had good actors I wouldn't have anything to complain about.

They did a great job with his look and mannerisms, so much so that as I scrolled through Netflix I did a double-take as I passed by Terrifier like I was a teenage boy admiring a pair of double D's.

By no means was this film ground breaking or ""new"" in regards to the genre, but something about it just worked. A pretty standard storyline, victims that lack all notions of common sense, and a monstrous villian in the form of a clown comprise the setting of the film. As I said, nothing new, but well done for what it is. Some of the visuals in this movie really bring it together with some excellent shots of violence and haunting creepiness that will stuck with most viewers after the credits roll. Had this been made in the 80s, it may have become quite the icon. I'd say that most devoted horror nerds can find something to appreciate in Terrifier.",Terrifier
247,mjpemboss,That is one FREAKY clown!,4,7 October 2018,"This movie has some true horror filled moments with some of the most gruesome murders I've sent. The special effects are really good and (mostly) believable. It seems gore movie makers are always trying to raise the bar higher. 
I think this movie would be great for teenagers that want to be scared. The director has done a great job at building tension in a lot of moments. And Art the clown, played by David Howard Thornton is fantastic. His prior experience with mime has really given the psycho clown a freaky, unsettling edge. There are a few moments that are disturbing to watch but I think there are a few people out there that would enjoy the movie for that reason. 
There are a few reasons that this movie didn't do it for me.
Spoilers below:
What is the logistical possibility of sawing a girl in half longways with a rusty old hacksaw. The scene in question took about 30 secs but really, I think it would've taken someone a lot longer. Regardless of how strong a person is, or how sharp the saw is, there are a lot of bones and tendons to try to get through. Maybe I'm being picky, but when these thoughts are going through my head, it reflects on the movie's ability to keep you engaged. 
I don't know about most people but I like my horror movies to have some kind of story. This movie does not. There were a bunch of contrivances that allowed more people to come into the scope of the film, and then get killed. The body count for the film is almost total. I think that when you watch the credits, there are more dead cast members than survivors. I watched this movie without watching the Terrifier (2011) short, or All Hallow's Eve 2013 so I'm not sure if there is any back story for the clown. I didn't understand why he was killing everyone, other than being mentally unbalanced. 
I liked the main girl, Tara played by Jenna Kanell. Well I thought she was the main girl. I felt a bit cheated that she died half way through the film. I'm sure the director was trying to keep you guessing, but when you get your audience to develop a relationship with your actors and then you kill said actor without a suitable replacement, they lose interest in the film. Once Tara died, I didn't really feel like watching the rest because I didn't really care about the other characters. Jenna Kanell did a great job and I feel like her acting was the stand out of the film. 
I am a horror movie fan and generally I like actors in movies to act according to the motivations of their characters. What I mean by this is that if a girl is running for her life, the actor needs to be able to show this in the film. You need to be able to believe that that actor actually fears for their life. When an actor is believable and act like we all feel we would act in that situation, we keep engaged in the movie. We don't question whether it's real or not. Some of the characters had a trouble convincing me that they weren't acting. Or I just didn't understand why they did the things they did. I don't understand why the clown decided to kill people; I don't understand why the various victims didn't take the opportunity to hit / slash / stab / club the clown when he was on the ground; I don't understand why the sight of a body cut in half didn't cause Vicky to run for help at the end instead of investigating further, to name a few.
Also the ending was kind of dumb. There was no supernatural inkling until the end of the movie when the clown comes back from the dead. That moment has cause me to drop my rating by a few stars. Also the tie in to the beginning with the deformed girl killing the pretty talk show host was pointless and contributed nothing to the movie. 
Overall the movie was horrifying in places and plenty of scenes that will stay in my mind. Quite visually disturbing, but in a good way.",Terrifier
248,kingalbayrak13,Waste of potential,4,20 September 2018,"The beginning was nice but then it got boring.The directorial was actually pretty nice but a very poor writing, in fact no writing at all.

249,Internetghost,This movie made me want to punch my own Television.,1,8 November 2018,"Where do I start? I guess I'll get straight to the point, this film is a steaming pile, it's a seriously strong contender for one of the worst horror films I've ever seen in my entire life. I stand by my statement when I say that nearly all of the positive reviews on this site are the cast and crew trying to promote this abortion.I watched this so you don't have to (please for the love of god don't), but I watched this for free and I still want my money and time back. The film opens with this extremely awkward attack scene where Vicky, the sole survivor of the Halloween massacre, attacks and mauls the newscaster interviewing her to death for mocking her disfigured face, and that's it, it has no relevance to the plot and it's just an excuse to throw in some more gore, and the gore effects aren't even good, this has to be some of the fakest looking blood and guts I've ever seen in a slasher, and all of the kills are accompanied by this really bad electronic music that adds no mood or atmosphere to any scenes, it's seriously one of the worst music scores I've ever heard in a horror movie.Next is the acting and characters, oh boy. I'm sure these actors are nice people in real life, and they look like they're having fun, but they really need to ask for a refund from whatever acting school they graduated from because this is some really amateurish and flat acting, not once did I ever believe that they became their characters and they even suck at looking scared. Their characters aren't any better, this is one of the worst scripts I've ever encountered for any movie, period.These stupid characters have hundreds of opportunities to kill this deranged clown but they knock him down once and they just run off, giving him plenty of time to get back up and try again, and this clown, contrary to even negative reviews praising him, is not scary in the slightest. There's only so many times you can see a deranged and bloody clown with a toothy smile to the point where you're desensitized and it's not frightening anymore.Last but not least are the production values, there's not a single set and everything appears to have been filmed on location, which is okay I guess but everything else is an inexcusable fault. The lighting is incredibly over saturated to the point where some scenes looked too bright or the actor's faces looked like they were smeared in Vaseline, it's really that bad, and that's not even mentioning the extremely bland and basic cinematography. Every single shot is flat and uninteresting, there's no memorable scenes or shots to remain in your nightmares.So yeah, this film is painful to endure and absolutely clueless on how to create horror. It can't even be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure because the gore is so cheap and fake looking (newsflash: buckets of fake Walmart blood doesn't constitute as horror) and it's not bad enough to be good. I give it an F.",Terrifier

Just a gross mess of stupidity.",Terrifier
251,vapingchillies,Something Wicked-er's overview of Terrifier 2017,8,13 January 2019,"Since the day I saw Terrifier's antagonist the Creepy Sadistic Art the Clown in his previous outing the Anthology 'All Hallows Eve' 6 years ago, being the scariest Horror Movie Clown I had ever witnessed, I knew he would be perfect for a full length outing so when I heard that's what director Damien Leone had planned for us I was one very excited Gore-Geek and knew Art would find his rightful place amongst the greatest of Horror icons and I've never been so right. Art played expertly with passion and relish by new comer David Howard Thornton is as hardcore and unstoppable as Haddenfield ghoul Michael Myers and has a wicked sense of humour that would make Freddy take notes, he's a mysterious entity with Supernatural abilities hinted at but wisely left for the inevitable sequels to fully explore. Art never says one word for the features duration which is a factor that definitely benefits the character relying on demented expressions, twisted body language and his signature silent mocking laugh. He is unnerving unpredictable vicious and remorseless with his trusty dustbin bag proudly swung over his shoulder full to the brim with a versatile set of both conventional weapons and hand crafted torture devises that could cause John Kramer to turn green with envy and with these and any item he grabs along the way he creates some of the most elaborate and gruesomely depraved murder set pieces seen since Ryan Nicholson's 'Gutterballs'. The effects are all practical and look absolutely fantastic and are as realistic as the highest budgeted torture porn outing that you could imagine. Terrifier has a tone all of its own but in some ways has a dark feel and look similar to scummy 80's city slashers such as 'Maniac' and 'Driller Killer'. The 80's Slasher Throwback appeal is most definitely rife in this Flick but it doesn't feel or look dated in the slightest infact the picture is extremely crisp and beautiful to behold with a very suitable cool ambient Synthwave sound track that feels exciting while giving a real sense of dread as well as some very bizarre non sync jazz horn music which Art seems to enjoy immensely as he does literally slicing people apart and boy we get to see a lot of that! As Mike the exterminator (the closest we get to a hero) played by Matt McAllister states he is ""A total Fu*king Maniac"" and even that's an understatement! The camera never shys away from the most disturbing of deaths and there is one without a doubt that would have been declared a notorious banned video nasty probably never to be decriminalised had it been released back in the day, I won't ruin it for you but you'll know instantly what I mean when you witness it! Guaranteed you won't forget it for a long long time to come - yes it is that extreme, take the nastiest scene in 'Bone Tomahawk' and multiple it by 10 and you might be somewhere close! The tagline from Tobe Hopper's notorious 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' springs to mind considering this movie ""Who Will Survive & What Will Be Left of Them"" but rather than the marketing ploy that was, you can take those words literally with 'Terrifier' as absolutely every protagonist is fair game and everybody loses body parts along the way. This is a fully accomplished Horror film that balances the scary creep factor and unbelievable hardcore gore perfectly, bravo to all involved.",Terrifier

This film does not make a person have a passion for struggling because any hard struggle seems to be in vain before that devil clown that is not even explained from where it came from.This kind of film is not educational nor entertaining at all.

286,nomad-54,Disappointing attempt at the genre,3,4 January 2021,"First off, I have to say that the opening title is pure genius. A poster quality image that reminded me of the 1979 classic 'The Zombie Flesh Eaters' for some reason. It really gave some idea of just how gritty and surreal a journey you were about to embark on. Unfortunately, that promise is the best the film had to offer me.Personally, I didn't find Art the Clown terrifying. I thought he looked silly. I started questioning why it was even called Terrifier. I don't know, It just felt like the whole movie was trying too hard to be best in class, and it failed for me. I wasn't feeling the insane killer clown, more just your common garden variety insane person, who writes on walls with faeces, wearing a clown outfit. I found his movements to be too contrived and done purely for effect. I didn't find the gore to be realistic. I could see flaws in the gore make-up. It had the gritty look and atmosphere, but again, it felt contrived. I guess this was a homage to earlier movies, so I'll leave it there.I give it 3 stars for the opening movie title (which truly is a classic image put up on screen) and the promise of what this movie could have been.",Terrifier
287,aharrouch,Watchable at best...,4,15 September 2018,"Stumbled upon this one on Netflix because the image of that clown was pretty creepy. I was able to sit through it without ever really wanting to turn it off, because being a fan of the slasher genre, your expectations need to be lo pretty much 95% of the time... The weakest aspects with TERRIFER are for sure the incredibly formulaic, unoriginal script with bland characters who make dumb decisions the entire time. The lead actors somewhat pull off the mediocre dialogue they're given to work with, but aren't strong enough to pull off the higher stake, emotional scenes. Based on the acting alone, it could have been a high budget student film for all I knew. On the bright side, Art the Clown is pretty unforgettable. The costume, the make-up, the whole vision of that villain makes the movie. He really does make you forget about Pennywise altogether. This is a truly sick, twisted, unsettling character to watch and it works because the actor (who I truly hope to never meet in real life) commits full heartedly to it. He really nailed the movements and facial expressions. Without mentioning any spoilers, there is a scene of him purely making faces at the lead girl, that is perhaps the scariest part of the entire movie. Yes, it's also got a retro 80's thing going on which also helps elevate the product a bit - I just wish they'd gone a bit more ""House of the Devil"" on it and focussed much more on building tension and creating a dark atmosphere than relying on cheap gore and mediocre effects. So if you want to see it, definitely don't expect to be emotionally invested with anything or anyone - but appreciate the birth of a (most likely) new horror icon in Art the clown.",Terrifier

289,a-boddam,"Cliche, the Movie.",3,20 August 2020,"This movie is a slog to get through after the first 10 minutes.
It tries so hard to be an old school slasher flick, but misses all the charm that those movies had. I ended up watching it over the course of two days, because after 45 minutes it had felt like I had been sitting there for 90. When Netflix told me there was still another 45 or so to go I just NOPED and shut it off. (I did finish it the following day).It is very rough, with the only writing being cliches to the point you can literally count down to ""and this is going to happen in three... two... one..."" and be correct. The acting for the most part is dreadful, leaving really no one to root for by the end.
Characters make dumb decisions, and die painfully. Some of the kills are quite original, and the gore is really well done for the indie budget film this is.The only upside to the flick is David Howard Thornton's portrayal of Art the Clown- who will terrify with his facial expressions, movements and presence. However even that does save the movie.",Terrifier
290,jmasci-31-114152,Who needs a plot?,9,10 August 2019,"So there's not much of a plot. Hmm. This is a slasher flick, folks. The plot is this: it's Halloween night, and there's a maniac killer dressed like a clown on the loose. People get killed, there's lots of blood and guts, including a really nice money shot of a naked girl getting sliced in half. And there are hot girls too. What were you expecting, ""War and Peace""?It was edgy and done quite nicely with the dark, gritty 80s slasher flick effect. I also appreciated the tiny bit of comic relief when Art The Clown crapped all over bathroom in the pizzeria and the guy who handles food had to clean it up.",Terrifier
291,jefftconant,Stop asking for a plot. This is a SLASHER HORROR,8,23 October 2018,"I've never understood why people demand a thorough plot to be executed in a slasher horror film. The point of the movie is not to introduce and establish characters and personalities beyond a superficial level. To do so would mean to sacrifice the terror and tension itself which usually eats up the latter 2/3 of a movie... OR else you'd be watching a three hour+ movie which is not most peoples cup of tea. Also, when a maniac killer crosses the paths of his victims, he does it suddenly and without warning. He doesn't stop to elaborate on the why he is doing it. He just does it. There is no story or explanation why. This is what makes a horror realistic, grisly and what makes a horror movie acceptable. This is one of the few slasher movies I've ever seen where I actually liked one or two of the protagonists. They don't act like cliche idiots. Most of the time after turning on a slasher film, the first words out of my mouth are ""well I personally wouldn't care if they get killed anyways"" because the main characters are a mockery of any reasonably intelligent person. You can already tell they're going to get themselves killed ASAP. To be fair, there WERE some royal blunders made by the main characters later in the movie but by that point you've already decided whether you like them or not. I'm giving it an 8 for using main characters that were reasonably likeable and not simple fodder for a serial maniac killer.",Terrifier

Besides that it'll just make you scream ""OH COME ON!!"" These victims literally do everything they SHOULDN'T do in these situations. 
They knock the clown out several times but no one makes sure hes actually dead. Everyone goes through the doors they clearly shouldn't, they go right towards the danger & they are almost too obliviousbto even remotely care about.

Although the profession is important and is what can help progress us as a society, Terrifier is a perfect example of what movie industries sometimes need to strive for. Instead of creating big blockbuster movies with fifty-million dollar budgets, Terrifier transcends that with a cast of nobodies and has fun with a small budget.

The acting is subpar and at times the attacks were not even convincing with bad editing and lazy movements, 2 *'s instead of 1* the only redeemable features are the clown having a unique style that could of worked in another film that had a good story, some of the shots are semi-decent and I appreciate the use of real gore effects over CGI.

301,kregmcm,"Gore galore, but hard to sit through",5,13 December 2018,"I admit going in to this film with a trying to like it mindset, I have to say I believe some of the films downside is to be blamed on budgetary restrictions, which is why I am rating this a bit higher than I would a larger studio production churning this grade of cinema out, not to mention some of the people behind this film are pretty stellar individuals, but that said, this isn't a film I would recommend to audiences look to feel scared.But let's start with the obvious, Art the clown itself, is terrifying, creepy and grotesque, he is truly a well crafted killing icon, who unfortunately just does not receive the calibre of film he truly deserves with this one.The plot is quite simple, which is not a flaw for this genre of film, deranged clown on a psychotic and gruesome killing spree, on Halloween night, which means people in costumes, and a whole lot of capability to get away with, murder, literally. The film has an interesting start that I did not expect, unfortunately it is upon pressing play immediately that you have to decide if you're willing to stick with the film as its budget shows immediately, and the actress in the opening scene, needs more time to hone her chops before taking on another opening kill type of role.Now for the male horror fans, there is some decent nudity if that is what draws you to the film, albeit with a sinister sensibility, and the gore for the most part is top notch, well done especially for its lower budget, but unfortunately it is the acting which truly drags the film itself down, with the exception of the actress playing Tara, the presumed lead of the filmDawn does good during the films most truly horrific sequence which I did find hard to sit through, which I give them props for, very ballsy scene, impressive. The film makes its biggest backstep when it attempts to throw a plot twist at us and kills off the only character with enough acting prowess to cause us to care for her wellbeing, Tara, to refocus the rest of the story on meaningless muder and the sister who is not wholly bad in her role, just isn't strong enough to have us worry for her, and in this kind of film that's quasi problematic.The film itself has decent audio, score and there were a few moments of tension through out, however it does not leave you in the edge of your seat but after killing off Tara, any of those kind of sequences are thrown to the wind, simply because we truly don't care about what happens after that, at least not nearly as much as we tried to care before it.I watched this film two times to see if maybe it was just my mood the first viewing, or if maybe it was just the plot itself. I was in a good mood the second viewing, so you do the math. I must say I really really wanted to love this film, I pushed myself to enjoy it but at the end of it all, it was just subpar, which again I must admit I think has a hell of a lot to do with its budget.A higher budget could have afforded higher calibre cast and crew as well as possibly someone to say hey, we don't have a strong enough second lead to kill off the first one, let's maybe not do that.I rated this a five despite the negatives because to me it was different, not a remake and an indie feature which I think all horror fans should try to be more supportive of otherwise all we will ever see are remakes and sequels to the same tired franchises which ultimately disappoint us.Most of the movies I've reviewed have been below five, so this does not fall into the worst films I've seen this year category, but even with me understanding it's budget, and sympathizing with that, it is nowhere near the top films either and falls slightly to the middle, forgettable unless gore is the only thing you need to entertain you, because then you may love this film, because it does its gore well, and has plenty of it.Please do not hate me.

I don't mind the bad acting, actually adds to the charm of the movie (EXCEPT for the clown...damn David Howard Thornton is good!), or the low budget set (also serves the flick well), and the gore was brave...going where a lot of flicks don't have the guts to. (Literally and figuratively ;0). But not introducing the supernatural aspect 'til the second to last scene in the morgue, was too much too late. (Lights flickering post mortem) The film shows him in the beginning applying his makeup as if he's just some sick mental, ""regular"" human serial killer. Perhaps I need to watch the 2011 prequel to understand this. Also, I was left confused as if the survivor was the same lady in the first interview or if history was repeating itself. The interviewer recalls it was the ""Miles County Massacre"" but I have no idea if the story was about that particular death toll or his motivation for his next Halloween killer rampage.

But for Hardcore Horror fans, it's what you've been waiting Decades for. Not only is it the Goriest of the Gory homages to classic Slashers of the late-70's, early 80's, it will likely enjoy a following all its own...and Soon. I don't want to give too much away, but Art the Clown is quite simply The Last Killer on Earth you would ever want to run into...and this includes Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, and yes, BOTH Pennywise's. He has no regard and could care less what you think of his various violent methods of dismemberment. This is the first horror film in 15 or more years that actually, genuinely scared me. 
So much so, that I strongly suggest it be watched it in a Large group of people; not only for the Event of it, but for basic, human companionship. Trust me, you'll need it.And I don't go around giving many movies a 10 out of 10; in fact I frown upon it. But you could look for years (literal DECADES), and not find a bigger achievement for a single genre. I really believe that it will solidify itself as a Modern-Day Horror Classic. And we haven't had one of those since Scream in the 90's. And Ghostface? Please! He wouldn't stand a chance. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND SPREAD THE WORD to other serious horror fans.

Surprisingly all the characters who have opportunities to kill the clown, act the same and run away instead of killing him like they all have the same personalities , which obviously represent the lack of characterizations.

323,pezman-18970,Not seeing how this movie rates an 8!! *SPOILERS*,5,6 May 2018,"I grudgingly give this film a 5 for it's opening 1/2 hour or so and some fairly creepy moments, but it all goes downhill from there in my opinion as most films of this kind do. Ok yes, the clown is pretty creepy and yes there are some downright gruesome scenes. At first, him being a mime lends to the creepiness, but as the movie goes on it tends to take away from the creepiness in my opinion as he just makes funny faces and bloody teeth smiles, not to mention giving the finger to one of his attackers!! But the movie contains many if not most of the tired cliche's we are used to in these kinds of slasher films. 
 This includes the OFT repeated phrase ""Hello, is there anybody here?"".....great for letting the killer know your whereabouts of course. Having the killer dead to rights flat on his face, stabbing him once in the back, and then stabbing him 20 more times till dead...right???....NOOO how about running off!! And of the course the ""indestructible villain"", who continues to live after being stabbed multiple times in different parts of his body and bashed in the head HARD numerous times with 2x4's and several other different objects. Isn't this just a guy in a clown outfit?? AND OF COURSE coming back to life at the morgue after blowing his brains out in the previous scene. I don't think any of this lends to the films feel or creepiness, which at times does work and makes one squirm. 
 The acting is passable, especially in the first 1/2 hour or so...fairly engaging and believable. But some characters who appear later just don't make much sense and the acting regresses to B-movie fare. Those working and living in the what is seemingly an abandoned or shut-down warehous include a seemingly homeless woman who caresses and carries around a doll acting as if it is her real child?? Ummm, why?? An exterminator who happens to be working in the wee hours on halloween exterminating rats in said warehouse?? He is pretty much only there to allow access to the warehouse bathroom (and the domain of the killer clown) for our main female character to relieve herself after a hard night of partying with her flirtatious and fairly mindless companion. A companion who oddly seems to take a shine to the creepy clown (shooting selfies with him in the restaurant towards the start of the film), as opposed to being repulsed by his leering and creepy ways. How about a cliche' scene where said exterminator is wearing ear-buds listening to music as our protagonist SCREAMS LOUDLY for help as she is being whisked away by Art the Clown?? Convenient noise cancelling on those headphones...lol!!
 To me, the film really goes downhill once the action turns to the warehouse. The killer clown who finds his victims no matter how far they run from him or how well they hide, the nonsensical addition of the crazy homeless woman, the bumbling exterminator's boss who comes to try and rescue him after getting a distress call on his cellphone, and the sister of our main character who sets out to come to their rescue when the car they are driving receives the obligatory flat tire. She obviously gets roped into the creepiness at the warehouse after the clown himself texts for her ""to come around the back, your sister is sick"". She lives to tell the tale even though her scalp and breasts are skinned and worn by the clown in one of his more creepy scenes. She then is revealed as the horribly disfigured girl shown in the opening scene, who is being interviewed by a female journalist and being labelled the ""only survivor of the massacre"".
 Very good first half- hour to 45 minutes give the film a real chance, but the director seems to fall into the same old horror tropes and types no matter how gruesome the blood and gore gets. Watchable, but don't expect any ground-breaking ideas or outcome!!",Terrifier

I loved how he didn't make a sound either. Regarding Art's back story that people complain not knowing about, I don't mind. I enjoy mystery, especially with villains. It makes them more interesting. I really enjoyed the scene where Art has a empathetic moment with the homeless woman. He shows some vulnerability which I thought made him even more charming. The script had some cheesy parts and the homeless woman was too pretty to be homeless but not everything can be perfect so overall I thought the movie was awesome.I think if the director had a little more time to pay more attention to little details, like script and homeless woman for example, it would have enhanced the movie more.

The movie focused on two drunk women leaving a Halloween party or club. Too drunk to drive, they go to a pizza parlor for food... enjoy from there...The movie overall had a poor script that lacked character development which kind of takes away the viewer from connecting before seeing their fateful end. The villain has no character development; he's just creepy. The overall gore torture, and violence in the film covered up the weak story line; the stupid protagonist decision making, etc. It prevented the film from being another bad movie you watch with friends and laugh. It has some really twisted moments. I mean really twisted moments. But I feel like the director was torn between making this a psychological film, and 80's slasher. His direction seemed to be lost and/or shifted in the middle of making this. Plus the so called twist at the end was not needed. It caused a ""Huh?"" moment.. it didn't make sense.",Terrifier

He's sadistic, there's no telling how far he will go because there's no limits to his evilness. Art grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. This is why there's a phobia of clowns. If you looked up upcoulrophobia in the dictionary his picture should be right beside it. He's unnerving to say the least. One look at him fills you with dread and dispair.

Very rarely do you see a truly original kill scene such as in this and it will either turn your stomach or make you cheer on the brutality. It isn't terribly predictable in the sense that there isn't a known protagonist which is such a staple in slasher films. It bends some of the rules, changes things up. The villain, Art the Clown, is scary in his own way - mainly he's truly a maniac, lacking humanity and emotion, only finding enjoyment in torturing his victims psychologically and physically.

A Slasher that is absolutely terrifying and psychotic. This movie did that so well. Everyone rates this film and says there's ""no story"" or its ""pointless killing"", UM ITS A DAMN SLASHER WHO CARES. A killer doesn't need a backstory or a reason that's what makes Michael and Jason so terrifying, they just do it, to do it! This film had some of the best kills I ever seen in any slasher film and was so incredibly creative. It took every opportunity to be scary and nailed it. This film makeup and special effects are definitely up to par with Hollywood big budgets standards. Stop trying to be a damn hipster and enjoy this incredible movie that has done something we have been missing since our original favorite slashers.

It's not often anymore that you see a film not gushing with an overuse of digital effects, and this one certainly excelled in that respect. Great, believable effects that had some real substance to them.The rest of the movie? Misses every mark possible to make it an enjoyable experience...Let's start with story: there is none. Not bad, not poorly written....NONE. Now for characters...honestly there was one good character (the only one with even a shred of depth) and they killed her off at the halfway marker in the movie. From that point on they just kept ""introducing"" new ""characters"" to be mindlessly slaughtered in a very formulaic way. But at this point the killings were useless. You didn't know any of these characters so you couldn't possibly care if they died or not, thus removing all tension from the rest of the film. I literally didn't care at all what happened in the movie after the main character died, because she was the only one I knew. Some severe continuity issues...there were many but the biggest one was when the elder sister is trying to escape the clutches of the clown. She drops a pipe that she used to bust open a lock, and grabs on to the clown's hands in an attempt to stop him from choking her. In this scene you can clearly see her hands are empty (and no camera shot showing her picking anything else up), then it cuts to her throwing an empty fist backwards and towards the clown's face, and then it cuts to him being stabbed in the face??? Even framed through it....somehow made less sense that way. And finally..the ending....wow. First off, at no point did the script even hint at the realm of the supernatural. Then all of sudden, right at the end of the movie, the clown comes back to life?? It was a cheap ploy to ""setup"" a sequel, and as an audience member it just made me feel betrayed. Oh, and the older sister turns out to be the one who kills the reporter in the beginning of the movie??? Where's the motivation?If you want to strictly see some great practical effects and love gore then definitely check this movie out, but DO NOT watch it if you're looking for an enjoyable film experience.",Terrifier

The plot was a clown trying to kill everyone in his way because he lives to kill. It's a horror movie and it excels in being a horror movie because it creeped me out nearly the entire way through. The clown is the same clown from the movie All Hallows Eve and his name is Art. Art makes Pennywise look like a children's birthday performer. Terrifier has a great feel to it. It feels like an 80's slasher flick with a modern twist. Almost the entire movie has a dark feel to it with dark sets such as the old rundown apartment building. This movie is excellent in my opinion. I hardly ever get scared or creeped out by a movie but this movie achieved what many other horror movies didn't: it creeped me out. The facial expressions of Art are one of the things that makes him so scary and he doesn't have to say a word. I really hope that a Terrifier 2 comes out in the future.

This is no psychological thriller. A silent killer stalks his victims and picks them off in various ways. The gore is present but not over the top (for horror) and the cinematography surprises you by setting up cliche shots only to surprise you with the unexpected. The actor playing the killer does a great job at being creepy, terrifying, and even humorous at times.

There's more blood and guts than you could ask for. There were parts of it that were suspenseful and creepy although overall it had this somewhat comical, gory 80s horror movie atmosphere.I really enjoyed the main character's look and his mannerisms. He's a really interesting looking fellow and I think they did a great job with his look. Aside from the killer clown, there are other main characters who happen to be attractive ladies and there's some nudity.Some parts of the movie were predictable although it does kind of have some surprises. Also there's almost borderline too much stupidity on the main female characters' parts, although I just assumed they purposely made it satirical.Another thing that was enjoyable about this movie is the fact that it starts off gross right from the beginning.

It was entertaining in that aspect, because there was lots of gore, and Art the clown was extremely creepy. However, every single thing that the actors did was the opposite of what normal people would have done.
This entire thing could have been avoided if they just called the freaking cops after seeing the clown for the second time. I mean, that's when I would've called the cops. ESPECIALLY once they realized their tires were slashed to bits. I would've called 911 SOOOOO quick, let me tell you. Even if they thought that would be embarrassing, better safe and stupid-looking than sorry. It's just frustrating to think that the entirety of this movie was based around one really dumb, small decision made by a couple of dumb girls. Sure, they were, ""drunk"" (poor acting too, btw), but people JUST DON'T act like this.

Don't get me wrong, I was terrified. I was terrified to realize that someone had actually sat down and made this movie. Please, everyone, don't let this become a cult classic. It's not even worthy of that title! No character is memorable besides the clown. Every horror movie stereotype is shoved into this film with nauseating fervor. One character's name is even credited as ""Cat Lady"". The directing is college entry level and the acting is high school level. Never ask a noob to act drunk. You might as well actually get them drunk or you're in for some horrific fake drunk acting. The filming is boring and the editing is choppy and makes it difficult for us to know where we are. On a brighter note, the costumes are not completely awful and Art's clown makeup is genuinely eerie. The music does not stand out as bad and they have fun with a little circus music here and there. People comment that the gore is great, but that's misleading. There is a lot of gore. That does not mean it is great gore. This movie definitely went for quantity over quality. Did I mention the script is painfully terrible? Well, it is! There is no character development, characters make stereotypical, idiotic choices, and there is so much padding that if you fell off a fifty story building and landed on this film, you'd feel like you just landed on a big fluffy cloud with a million cute bunnies cuddle up next to you. I personally feel that this movie deserves one star. Yet, these people have made a movie. I have not. And, there are some good moments in this movie. If you do watch it, watch it to laugh like I did, but don't come back here and lie to everyone saying that it's a good movie. It's just not a good movie.

365,spanglerjl,Disturbingly misogynistic,3,18 August 2019,"First, the good points: Art the Clown is truly creepy. The mime aspect of the character add another level of creepiness beyond your typical murderous clown. The scene where Art stares at the girls in the pizza parlor is satisfyingly unsettling. The music, lighting, and cinematography are all good as well. It doesn't look or sound like a low-budget movie.Now the downsides. I found the violence in this movie to have a disturbingly misogynistic theme. The ways that women are dismembered and killed in this movie are very gender-specific, often involving female parts of the anatomy. On the other hand, the ways that Art kills and dismembers his male victims are very generic.Because we learn nothing about Art's motivations or back-story in the film, it's hard to see the gender-specfiic violence against women as an intentional plot point (I use the word ""plot"" very loosely with this movie). Rather, it seems more likely that the particularly brutal violence against women comes from conscious or unconscious misogyny on the part of Damien Leone, the film's writer and director.There is one particularly brutal female killing (you'll know it when you see it) that seems to highlight the identity of women as sexual objects. It's hard to imagine a director having a male victim killed in an equally sexualized manner.Even the film's opening scene reduces one of the film's strongest and most important female characters to a one-note caricature who is primarily concerned with the loss of her facial attractiveness. The pointless woman-on-woman violence is set up as a ""twist"" but in fact completely flattens the character who had the most potential for any bit of complexity. Did she really survive a brutal attack only to throw away her future by committing an impulsive attack on a woman she barely knows who insulted her appearance?In summary, come for the clown, and stay for the righteous feminist anger you'll feel at the treatment of the film's female characters.",Terrifier

Art the Clown definitely a silent killer which made me enjoy him more as most horrors like West Cravens Scream and The nightmare on elm street they have speaking killers so i do find some occasions the body-language is terrible. The acting in this movie isn't the best but suits the low-budget vibe as most big-budget horrors are over the top acting and gore.I highly commend the cast and crew for creating this timeless classic of the 21st century.

370,SlasherMediaYT,Terrifier A Low Budget Horror That Is Great,8,21 January 2021,"Terrifier is a low budget Horror movie that came out in 2016 in the USA and it came out in the UK in 2018. The movie is about these two girls who are hunted and stalked and then killed by a killer clown on Halloween Night the clown being named Art the Clown.
The effects of the movie are very well made for a low budget Horror movie since it is mostly practical effects like in one of the scenes one of the characters stabs Art in the leg and that was practical when it comes to Horror most fans would probably say that practical effects are the best witch I agree with.
Art the clown is a very different type of Slasher Killer he does not have much of a back story or anything like that he does not talk but is creepier with the facial expressions he uses his smile is very unnerving he does not just look out for his victims he finds people who are out at night and stops at nothing to kill them using any weapons he could find or weapons that that he takes with him.
The tow characters that Art goes after mainly are more there to just be his victims then survivors as we learn nothing about them just that they are friends and are out on this Halloween night but end up being stalked by Art the clown and then they are attacked by him both being murdered. One of the girls has a sister who comes to find her who in turn is chased by Art and attacked but she does survive but is very disfigured. At the biggening of the movie we see this girl's sister kill a news reporter as she was making fun of the way she looked.
In conclusion the movie is very well made for its low budget it just goes to show that you do not need a very high budget to make a good horror movie. The effects the story the characters are great, but Art is the centre piece of the movie as he is shown as this very unstoppable force within this world and if you did not know there is a sequel in the works so I for one can does not wait for that as a horror fan and to review it on my YouTube channel.",Terrifier
371,pomegranateslife,INSANELY Gory Love Letter to 80s Slashers,7,22 March 2021,"Terrifier is one of the scariest movies in the modern era of horror movies. In a time where cinema has toned down horror movies and made way to ghosts and demons, Terrifier is an insanely brutal and bloody throwback to the good old days. Speaking of blood and gore, this film has TONS of it. Again, I'd call it one of the bloodiest films in history. Everything is done practically and it looks amazing (Especially that one scene. If you know, you know)! Another highlight is the film's antagonist Art the Clown, AKA a horror movie icon in the making. He is played with perfection by David Howard Thornton, adding just the right amount of twisted black comedy to such a nightmarish character. However, the movie is not flawless. Aside from the gore effects and Art, everything else is mediocre. There is some plot holes (but they just may be unexplained and will be in future films), and at times the acting is awkward, and even a bit cringe worthy. But that almost adds to the campy 80s charm. And those elements are easily blown away by the good things. Terrifier is a brutal 80s slasher throwback, with a horrifying antagonist. Just don't watch if you have a weak stomach!",Terrifier

373,datboinfiredkim,Wish there was more... And less,1,21 November 2020,"Terrifier is the MOST disgusting movie I've ever seen for the following reasons: He ate a girl's face, he sawed a girl in half as her friend was watching, and he dressed up in girl skin.
Also, there is no plot whatsoever, there's no backstory to Art the Clown and there's no decent ending. Cool, he got ""arrested"" but he came back to life? What is that? Is he Michael Myers but Pennywise at the same time? I don't get it. It'd be nice to have at least a backstory, same with the Cat Lady! Why is she homeless? Why does she carry a doll? Is the doll a baby she lost? Why does she want to be a mom so badly? She deserves her own movie.

377,brandonperez77,Terrifier relies too heavy on shock factor not using the potential it had.,4,12 August 2021,"I will first start off by saying that while yes, Art the clown is incredibly horrifying, that is not enough to to save this movie, one of it's biggest flaw is that it's built around shock factor. With a movie this gory and bloody I was shocked to find myself actually bored of the movie. It began to get repetitive, clown toys with his victims, clown does something brutal, clown gloats about the torture, then kills. The gore in this movie is over the top. Many horror fans heart would stop if they heard a phrase as wild as ""too much gore"" but this film over does it, making it almost cartoonish gruesome. In the opening scene the news anchor gets her eyes gouged in and rather then blood spurting from the eyes her face looks as if she's had it bashed in, the scenes where Art is actually disturbing go on for far too long ruining it. For example, in the scene where he cuts the woman from her...area, it goes on for far too long, cuts of Art cutting, the girl screaming, her friend screaming as well, or the scene where he skins the homeless woman and wears her skin, the whole scene of him mimicking a seductive walk in the skin goes on for two long, it just rubs how disturbing it is in your face. To someone who thinks blood and guts= horror masterpiece this movie is the Shawshank redemption of horror, and it seems as if it would be a good film to watch to just see some gore, and perhaps to some it is, but it came off as quite boring to me, hopefully the sequel will not try as hard to be shocking and will focus more on the fear that Art gets out of people.",Terrifier

Personally, I enjoy a horror film with a little camp (Fright Night, Evil Dead, etc.), and Terrifier definitely fits the bill on this one. I hadn't heard of Terrifier until stumbling across the movie on Fandango. Deciding to give the movie a chance, I expected bad acting and a non-nonsensical plot but was pleasantly surprised by both the acting and storyline. Art the clown was especially well acted, considering he doesn't speak the entire film. The actor's gestures and mannerisms made the character for me (especially in the restaurant scene), and I found him both gruesome and funny. While the plot wanes a bit the second half, there are standout moments - the scene where Art wears another person's skin a la Buffalo Bill, for example. While I enjoyed the film and the acting, I would have liked to have seen more character development for the sister and cat lady. Phenomenal acting by Pooya Mohseni (the cat lady) - she really brought depth to an underdeveloped character, and her desperation to care for ""Emily"" (a doll she thinks is her child) is palpable on screen. If Damien Leone makes a sequel, have the cat lady come back and give her a lead role. :)",Terrifier

Some of the worst acting I've ever seen, incredibly dumb protagonists, even terrible special effects with the violence. You'd thing that a movie made in 2016 would have better blood effects than a film from the 70's or 80's but no. It's right on par with movies made 40 or 50 years with its special effects. Maybe this is why the director found it necessary to over-saturate the entire film. Red's, blue's, yellow's. All of them way too sharp. Makes it look like a movie made by gore crazed teenagers.

It really shows that you don't have to be a big name director with millions of dollars in Hollywood to make something amazing and impressive. This film is very reminiscent of 80s slasher flicks, and there are references throughout the film. The soundtrack even says it. I loved the music in this movie. It really makes me wanna buy the soundtrack for myself. I have like two grips, and they aren't as big. One, the beginning to me was king of weird and doesn't make as much sense (not talking about the intro into the film. I loved the intro. A little after the intro). And two, one of the characters were weird to me, and kind of felt a little out of place. Like, this character feels a little underdeveloped. Besides all of this, I loved this movie.

Those are total immersion breaking shots. They ruin any ideas you could come up with about the origin of this killer. It cheapens, an already cheap plot twist. All the money and time spent on special effects and they couldn't either makeup his skin that showed, or stopped it from showing. Just an aweful movie.

Where Terrifier falls apart for me is when the film transitions into the dilapidated building for the rest of the film. I feel it drags in a lot of areas and I could do without some of the cliches. I would like more variety in settings, more victims, and better acting, but considering the budget of the film, I can forgive a lot of its shortcomings. I also don't get the ending. It goes from realistic to supernatural? I'm not sure if I like that direction.

418,lipworthjess,A missed opportunity,2,3 December 2018,"One of the taglines on the cover art for Terrifier reads ""Makes Pennywise look like Krusty the Clown."" While Terrifier certainly offers more blood and gore than both the 1990 and 2017 adaptations of Stephen King's IT, there is very little ""Terror"" to be experienced. Pennywise is a full-bodied character, psychologically torturing children before he devours them. Art the Clown has no back story, no depth and no motive to kill other than the apparent benefit of the audience. One of the biggest problems with Terrifier, regardless of the creepy aesthetic of Art the Clown, is that it's plot less. The various killings are used as mechanisms to stitch a film together and while the deaths themselves are nasty in concept they leave much to be desired in execution...excuse the pun. The blood and gore is overdone and executed with hokey glee. This would be fine if Terrifier was meant to be a horror comedy or spoof (see Brain Dead, Housebound) but it isn't. The acting leaves a lot to be desired for the most part and one barely has a chance to connect with any characters before they are offed. Add to all of this pointless would-be horror a silly final sequence and you have Terrifier, a missed opportunity that could have been truly disturbing and vicious if developed properly.",Terrifier

Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) can easily be the next Freddy or Michael Myers, with a very twisted pleasure in extreme torture. It's next level psychotic and just what this era of horror needs.
 We follow two girls, Tara (Jenna Kanell) and Dawn (Catherine Corcoran), on a late Halloween night. After a night out, they stop at a diner where they are faced with the psychotic clown who, little do they know, will show them what it means to be terrified.
We don't get the opportunity to learn about the clown in the film but from the end credits we learn his name is Art the Clown. His name isn't important in the movie at any point, but it definitely adds to the question, 'what is this clown's problem?'
If you've never seen Director Damien Leone's previous films, Terrifier (short film, 2011) or All Hallows' Eve (2013), I highly recommend them to be watched first. I didn't personally, but I went back full circle, and after watching all three films, I understood some more of Damian Leone's process in making Terrifier. He pulled a lot of the best scenes from the short film and adapted them in the full length film. The full length creates a more terrifying gorier version than the short, not because of the time differences, but the story that's told as well. Even if this 2016 film is the better version, I still recommend watching the short film for the fun in comparison.
For those of you who can't stand the sight of blood, or clowns for that matter, this film isn't for you. But if you crave all the sinister mayhem like myself, Terrifier is one you'll be sure to love.",Terrifier

Later on we find the location that is the main focus of the film, a seemingly abandoned building that is being seen to by pest control as what has to be past midnight? (But I'm not going to get into that). Along with the many confusing plot holes, you never feel any real connection to any of the characters and they are killed off before you get the chance to. The main character you should be rooting for is killed off in the first half of the film leaving you with nothing but more gory murders. The reason only reason I've given the film 4/10 is because the visual effects are done extremely well and Art the Clown has an amazing screen presence that pulls you in.

430,reminiscing_dejavu,Best Horror Movie I've seen in awhile,10,4 September 2018,I've been obsessed with horror movies since I was a little girl. I'm actually shocked at some of these reviews. For me I think the scariest movies are the ones that could happen. A psychopath in a clown costume tormenting people.. Oh hell no. I love that he doesn't speak. Makes him scarier. I'd love some more background info on Art. Definitely hope for more Art sequels.,Terrifier
431,pat_wolf,80's horror throwback,8,4 September 2018,"Art the clown will be part of the killer legends!! 
It's not for the faint of heart!! Gory at is best, dirty, gritty, 80's style..low budget, but practical effects are amazing and old school, simple story, simple background, but it works for that movie!! I love it. The performance by David Howard thorton as art was incredible!!",Terrifier
432,madiepascal,Art the clown is awesome,7,16 September 2018,"Honestly I understand all of you horror movie lovers rejecting and hating on this film. There isn't a plot blah blah blah. But art the clown is terrifying and he doesn't say a word! He is a creative killer and will leave you speechless with chills throughout the whole movie. Give the movie a chance, good horror/gore films are hard to come across now a days but terrifier is a great watch!",Terrifier
433,shedsofwilkesboro,Amazing Gore Sequences,9,7 September 2018,"I don't know why this movie is getting so much hate. This little piece of horror heaven is extremely well executed. Basic slasher concept...but you can tell there is so much more going on. They broke a mold with this one. Fantastic Gore, great villain, relatively smart and likable victims. I will probably watch it again before or on Halloween.",Terrifier
434,softballcrusher,This movie is terrible.,1,14 September 2018,"I don't know why I watched this. Complete waste of time. The storyline is the worst I've seen. The acting is far worse then the writing. I can't believe that someone ok'd this to be made. That person should be fired and if it was the owner of a company that ok'd this, makes me wonder how they got rich. So if you read this, please don't waste your time on this movie. Maybe you have a wall in your home that you can stare at for an hour and a half.",Terrifier
435,deathnasty,Nothing original,1,19 September 2018,Was I the only one not scared by this cheesy ass excuse for a horror movie ? You can't have the clown feel pain and then decide to being him back to life after blowing his brains out. The editor should have said something but clearly just wanted a paycheck.,Terrifier
436,cvdinapoli-69443,I ACTUALLY LIKED IT!,7,22 September 2018,"The setting has a very Halloween feel to it. Costumes, night time, blood and gore. Okay so this is obviously a low budget film, bad acting although the clown was hysterical. but the kind of movie you wanna watch on a cold fall night. yeah....I actually liked it! Seven",Terrifier
437,latoyaeason,Creepy,10,2 October 2018,This is one of the most creepiest movies I've ever seen. I LOVED IT!!,Terrifier
438,hesherfick,Watch SAW series instead,1,3 October 2018,"The beginning of this movie was good and had me excited, but it soon became predictable and is honestly the worst movie I have seen. If you want to see a good gory movie, please watch the SAW series. This is probably the most disturbing movie I have watched. No backstory what so ever. I am yet again disappointed in these types of movies on Netflix.",Terrifier
439,TrashPanda_,"The only ""Terrifying"" thing here is the film",1,10 October 2018,"I read about this movie on a horror forum. I'd already seen ""All Hallows Eve"" and wasn't particularly impressed, to be honest. So, needless to say upon seeing nothing but ""glowing"" reviews for the film I was a bit perplexed (as the previous entry was, in my opinion, mediocre at best). However, my morbid curiosity already piqued, I wanted to see what ""all the fuss was about"". (And I didn't have to pay to see it, as it's just been added to Netflix)To say it was a disappointment would imply that I actually had expectations to begin with...I think that torture porn is an adequate description. Being that this terminology has been thrown around loosely for years. This film does no favors for a dying genre. I fail to see where any deeper meaning is being inferred or implied here. Saying that the plot line is shallow is putting it lightly, as the plot is non-existent here. Garish effects, not even B movie grade acting, and yet some how, simultaneously dull throughout. It doesn't even scratch the surface ""so bad it's good"".",Terrifier
440,trevor_young,"The best ""Slasher Film"" ever made.",9,21 October 2018,"I was completely blown away by this movie, and I'm glad to see it's been getting some love since it showed up on Netflix. There's a lot of hate being thrown it's way as well, and honestly a lot of the negative reviews I've read have either completely misunderstood the film, or just can't stand so-called ""torture porn"" movies to begin with and we're never going to like it.Firstly, ""torture porn"" isn't the correct way to categorize this film. Just because a film has loads of gore and brutal kills does not warrent completely boxing it into vanilla movie watchers precon",Terrifier
441,dineshsrikantha,Pretty terrible cheap movie,1,31 October 2018,A cheaply created movie with no creativity. Has been done within the same premise to save money. The plot has no any creativity associated with it.,Terrifier
442,lashleyhenderson,Most artistic film I've seen,10,1 November 2018,"Each scene includes a shot that could be framed as art. Most beautiful combination of lighting, emotions, and creativity I've seen yet. Happy Halloween. 🎃👻❤☺😊",Terrifier
443,lyndondupras,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,1 November 2018,"Good horror films are rare, modern horror even moreso. When watching this movie with that realisation, I felt refreshed. Here's a horror films that delivers. Terrifier has flaws as a film. However, what horror flick doesn't? I will withhold the details, but this is a perfect fit for an audience that enjoys gut churning and bone chilling terror, followed with a nice dose of hopelessness for our beloved protagonists. Enjoy.",Terrifier
444,mda-19473,"Gory, funny, campy, B movie",6,10 November 2018,"Look, it's not going to win an Academy Award but if you watch this movie with out having any idea what it is well it's really your fault. So... It gory, It's over the top, Its creepy, but it's also fresh. The killer certainly raises the bar for evil but he also puts on quite the theatrical show. So pop some corn, turn off the lights, and try not to look behind you....",Terrifier
445,ChristopherHilt,"If you're looking for blood, guts, gore, and overall creepiness, this is the movie for you!",10,8 July 2020,"Cannot wait until part 2 comes out. Trust me, there is a good amount of gore, and the movie also serves as a tribute to classic slasher movies as well! The FX are A-List also!",Terrifier
446,kylestyle-29720,Terrifier is terrifying,10,1 July 2019,"For a slasher/serial killer movie this is by far the most brutal of a movie by far, it feels like it belongs in the 80's other that the gore but The movie does sometimes go over the top with the carnage candy gore. but isn't that what people (like me) want go out to see. It delivers everything you want from a slasher movie, but if you don't like over the top gore, this isn't the movie for you.",Terrifier
447,ladyrainbow-37359,A fantastic homage to the slasher genre,9,15 January 2019,"It seems every bad review, and even a few good ones, is looking at this movie without context. What I got out of it was an incredibly passionate love letter to the Slasher flicks of old. Like those films, it lacks in plot, logical characters, honestly the villain makes stupid decisions as well. And I can definitely see why people would be frustrated watching the characters run about like aimless turkeys with absolutely no common sense. However, when you put it into the context of being a tribute (as I am entirely certain it was meant to be), you get a brilliant movie that really does justice to the genre. It's campy and fun with plenty of gore. It's self-aware and still manages to be creative and pretty darn scary at times.I would say, go into this expecting an entertaining gore-fest, but if you're looking for something with intelligent characters and plot, there are plenty of other things being made that would be more to your liking right now.",Terrifier
