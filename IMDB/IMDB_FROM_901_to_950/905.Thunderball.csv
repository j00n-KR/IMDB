0,MartinHafer,"Great to watch, but a definite step down for the franchise",7,23 March 2008,"THUNDERBALL was the fourth film in the James Bond series and unfortunately, it was a step down from the previous three--probably due to an overuse of gadgets and some poor supporting performances (particularly from the rather wooden ""Bond girls"").The first third of the film was actually the most interesting to me but certainly was low on action. Bond was at a sanitarium recovering from his last mission. I thought this was a great touch--seeing him covered in scars so that you could see he wasn't superman! Here, he accidentally stumbles onto a horrible plot--one of the more exciting ideas from the Bond films. It seems that Number 2 (a BAD choice of names, I know) is hatching a plan to steal atomic weapons so he can blackmail the world!! Once Bond leaves for the Caribbean, the film becomes a little less interesting, though I must admit the entire sequence involving the airplane landing there was pretty high on the cool factor. What wasn't cool were the silly women he met--one malevolent lady who, as usual, Bond beds and a sweet one who, as usual, Bond beds! Both had very little personality and frankly were dull in almost every way (you can probably guess how they weren't).Not a bad film at all, but certainly not among the best Bond movies.By the way, due to a strange little copyright problem, this film was remade by an entirely different film company about two decades later and the film, once again, starred Sean Connery. It was very aptly named, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN--and frankly, it's a lousy knock-off of THUNDERBALL and is inferior in most every way.",Thunderball
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Bloated with a pedestrian pace, but worth seeing for the special effects and underwater sequences",7,18 August 2010,"I'm afraid I don't consider this among the best of the Bonds, but I certainly don't it one of the worst. If anything it is a solid if rather middling instalment. My main problems come with the bloated plot which tries to squeeze too many plot twists and high-tech software, pedestrian pacing and while Claudine Auger has a good presence and is sexy for me Domino is one of the least memorable Bond girls. However, it looks great, has a great score and theme song, the script has its suave moments, the direction is decent, the special effects are amazing as are the clever underwater sequences. Sean Connery is more the man the action here than he is in his other outings where he's more suave and charismatic but he is still great, while Adolfo Celi is a worthy opponent. In conclusion, good if not great. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Thunderball
2,bkoganbing,Sending In Their Best,7,9 May 2009,"After saving Fort Knox from an atomic explosion in Goldfinger, James Bond has not one, but two atomic bombs to deal with in Thunderball. Sean Connery also gets to spend a good deal of time in the beautiful waters of the Bahamas where arch SPECTRE villain Adolfo Celi has made off with one of them to use on Miami Beach.If this sounds familiar the story was done again and by Sean Connery as James Bond in his last Bond film, Never Say Never Again. Only there the story was shifted to the Mediterranean. Who knows if current James Bond, Daniel Craig will do this one yet again.Celi who is the current number 2 in SPECTRE the infamous third echelon has hijacked a British Vulcan bomber and stolen the two nukes on board. He's issued a demand for payment from the NATO countries to be paid in uncut diamonds or he'll use them on a couple of American or British targets with large populations. Of course the governments of both are ready to shell out to save casualties in the potential millions, but not without sending in their best to stop SPECTRE which means 007.Two women became Bond girls in Thunderball, good girl Claudine Auger and bad girl Luciana Paluzzi. Paluzzi is one of Celi's assassins as good at her job as Connery is in his. The sexual tension between the two of them crackles even as she's trying to kill him.Thunderball has some great underwater cinematography as the forces of SPECTRE battle the US Coast Guard and James Bond on the ocean floor as SPECTRE tries to take the bomb into Miami Beach harbor. In fact all the Bond films are noted for that, even the disastrous first Casino Royale.You couldn't deny that James Bond was keeping Sean Connery's name in front of the movie going public. He wanted so badly to make a reputation for himself in non-Bond roles. Eventually he did, but it was a struggle.Made comfortable by the money and box office drawing power that films like Thunderball were giving him.",Thunderball
3,Leofwine_draca,A sunny Bond classic,7,14 November 2016,"When I first watched THUNDERBALL, I found it a big comedown after the excellent GOLDFINGER. I didn't care for the underwater sequences and found it overlong. This is, however, a strong Bond film for the female characters, with no less than three important women popping up during the film's course. The first is sexy assassin Luciana Paluzzi, the second the pneumatic femme fatale Claudine Auger whose red-headed fieriness is one of the film's highlights. The third female is the beautiful Martine Beswick, only a couple of years away from her Hammer debut and looking fine as usual. Adolfo Celi is a passable villain who feeds the odd enemy to his pet sharks (!); the rest of the cast is packed with familiar and welcome faces, so there's no fault there.Of course, it's as well made as usual, with good effects, gorgeous scenery in the Caribbean setting, cool music and fine acting from Connery and co. On my second viewing, I realised that the stylish underwater sequences (shot by Ricou Browning, no less) actually make THUNDERBALL stand out from the crowd by offering something new. The ending manages to feel fresh and exciting and with an increased level of violence, with all manner of bloody stabbings and impalings that wouldn't be allowed were the action taking place above ground. Sure, the sped-up action is a little cheesy, but then that's all part of the fun.",Thunderball
4,SnoopyStyle,Underwater scenes slow down action,7,12 December 2013,"This is the fourth Bond film, and it's a bit of a step back. SPECTRE has stolen two nuclear weapons from a NATO aircraft, and is blackmailing the west for £100M. Bond must investigate leading him to Bahamas.Adolfo Celi is playing the bad guy Largo. He's not as scary. The most interesting thing about him is an eye patch. The pace is a lot slower this time around. It's mostly due to the massive amount of underwater work. It's a big technical challenge, but it doesn't maintain the tension. The action is slower underwater, and the people can be obscured by the action. I guess the underwater work was cool back then, but it doesn't make it great viewing today. As far as gadgets, the Bond franchise keeps it coming with a rocket pack. There isn't an evil henchman like Oddjob. There isn't an iconic Bond girls in this one although they are very beautiful. It's a small step backwards for the franchise.",Thunderball
5,Hitchcoc,The Underwater One,7,7 December 2016,"I stole my title from another reviewer. I braved a harsh winter night in downtown Minneapolis to see this movie. We were all Bond fans in those days. We had seen the previous three movies and were thrilled that a fourth was on its way. Unfortunately, after Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger, we wanted something that would top all of them. It doesn't work. There is something missing here, a kind of spark that even the great Sean Connery can't provide. This all takes place in underwater settings and I have found that this creates a weakness. Of course, there is a Bond girl and a serious villain, but that's where it all stops.",Thunderball
6,Horst_In_Translation,"Good, but not among the best",6,21 June 2015,"""Thunderball"" is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and in 1965 Sean Connery was already pretty experienced with his role as the first James Bond. Connery returned for more movies, but for director Terence Young it was his third and final installment. And he went out on a high note as ""Thunderball"" won the only Visual Effects Oscar of the whole franchise. So far. All in all, there is a total of four wins. The most recent entry ""Skyfall"" actually managed half of these. And the very first went to ""Goldfinger"" for a different area of technical masterclass. This one here actually followed directly after ""Goldfinger"" and there was a break of only fifteen months or so between the two releases. Compare that to how long it takes nowadays for new 007 films being released. As for the writing staff, so many credits here. Ian Fleming is the man behind it all and he deserves an extra mention here because he died briefly before this film got released. As for those credited with the screenplay, Maibaum was really the epitome of a Bond writer as he has been there since the beginning with ""Dr. No"" and stayed for decades afterwards even. Whittingham not really and Hopkins the exact opposite, even if this is probably still his most known credit. Needless to say basically, but this is still from the Connery era and actually this is the one and only movie that they remade and that he starred in later on during his second comeback, first and only comeback away from Broccoli and the official franchise. I guess the reason why they went for this one may be that it was not as iconic as most of the other films It may be the overall quality that is the reason for this not being among Connery's most known and that it never was. Maybe a minor reason is also that this one does not really take you into exotic areas of the planet. Or at least does not stay there for long. Except beaches and oceans of course.""Thunderball"" is a worthy addition to the series. However, I have to say it is not really outstanding in any regard. Largo I personally found one of the more forgettable villains of the series and his henchmen are not too memorable either. Rosa Klebb, Goldfinger, Oddjob or Dr. No from previous films were all somewhat more special in my opinion and made their films really worth watching. In terms of the story, it's also nothing that hasn't been done before or after and better. This time it is more about a terrorist attack than about Cold War. Bond and the MI6 know by now that it's not the Russians doing bad things to the western world, but that it is actually SPECTRE. Our hero has to recover two stolen atomic warheads this time before Largo can detonate them on Miami or a major British city. Oh yeah, but Claudine Auger is as attractive as it gets, easily among the hottest Bond girls in history. No clue why I keep forgetting about her when thinking about who my favorite Bond girls are. I really shouldn't. Luciana Paluzzi is also a bit on the underrated side. Stunning ginger who goes too much under the radar too, mostly because of Auger's Domino I suppose and she is one of really not too many cast members still alive today. And then there are the usual suspects: Q, M, Moneypenny and Leiter (who is hit by Bond so he shuts up and does not give away an important detail, but also for us in the audience to not forget who the real alpha male here is), but none of them with much impact or screen time in this one. They still add a bit of entertaining material the way they almost always do. There are some pretty common formulas from Bond films that are also used on many other occasions. The best example would be Bond getting constantly romantically involved with the villain's girls. Talk about loyalty. Or lack thereof. Even at the very start, there is a fairly attractive woman next to him although she may not be linked to the first villain. Thinking of it, Colonel Bouvar could have made for a great central villain as well. Shame he never got his own movie and did not get the key role here. Speaking of the actual main antagonist again, I already mentioned him/the actor, but let me add to that and ask the question if there is anything interesting at all about Largo except his eye patch? Having a hard time coming up with something honestly and I don't think it's just me who's struggling there. This also made it more difficult for me to believe and find it realistic that he is basically physically superior to Bond in the final fight. And that Bond is saved by his (future) girlfriend this time. Or maybe just an affair although Domino is too good for that. But yeah, it was not too surprising if we take a look at Domino's anger directed at Largo early on that she would be the one to take him out basically. To get revenge for her brother. Bond got his revenge early on already with the widow guy, so let her have it this time. Fittingly with a harpoon given all the sea and water background in here, which also results in Bond almost never wearing any long pants, even when he is inside. You see more of 007's legs than in any other Bond movie I think. But back to what I actually wanted to elaborate on a little further: You could say there was a bit of foreshadowing when Bond takes out Vargas (the henchman who does not drink, smoke or have sex, shame we do not find out more about him, but apparently straight edge already existed in the mid60s) and this is right before Domino says pity it was not Largo himself when they are at the beach and this beach sequence by the way is to me much more memorable than the far more famous beach sequence from Connery's first Bond movie, probably because Auger is way more desirable than Andress to me. All subjective of course and I will not lie I even had one moment here from the beach sequence when I felt Connery's line delivery and what he says was a bit on the cringeworthy side. The only time I remember I ever had something like this from a Bond movie. By the way, water is an element that is used in many Bond films. Also in ""Dr. No"" for example if we take a look at where he had his headquarter. They probably thought enough time had passed to focus this much on water once again for this movie here. But I am drifting away now. Let me mention two other aspects here that you find frequently in Bond movies and here they have been included for one of the first times ever, if not the first time. The first of these two would be casino gambling, even if the scene is fairly short. No comparison to Craig's first film and Largo also should not be mentioned in the same sentence like Le Chiffre. The second would be Bond having (faceless) people fight with him in this underwater sequence that is really the epitome of good vs. evil and can be seen on the color of the divers' dresses. A small army (with whatever background) supporting him is not an exception at all and frequently we only know the army's leader and why he is on Bond's side. Of course, he is never as much as a leader as Bond himself.There are several pretty good scenes, such as the scene in which Bond is almost killed on that spine stretching machine, maybe an equivalent to the laser machine from Goldfinger, the scene in which Bond quickly turns around during the dance scene before getting shot, the very early scene that shows us how Blofeld deals with traitors (pretty much a highlight), the Big Ben reference and a handful more. The Blofeld scene, he is a dark force in the background just like in ""From Russia with Love"", and also the opening that throws us right into the action as Bond takes on a deadly widow were certainly among the best the film had to offer. The inclusion of pretty specific symbols on characters' skins was interesting too. It all certainly got weaker in the second half and I feel they could have cut some of the scenes there and kept this film at two hours max, maybe even at 110 minutes. I am mostly talking about the several underwater scenes and I did not find these particularly thrilling really, even if these were maybe the ones that resulted in the Academy Award win. There were so many of them. Probably more than in any other Bond film. It felt as if one third of the movie was taking place with water to be seen on the screen and most of it was underwater. Fittingly, to prepare Bond for this, Q even gave him a super modern underwater camera. Maybe the best water moment was above the liquid again and I am talking about the very final scene. Pretty cool how Bond and his girl are pulled up. They sure found them quickly. I really love Tom Jones' theme song here (just like the man), maybe the most memorable aspect for me personally and easily in my Top3 Bond songs, if not number one. Quite a shame it was not featured that much during the film like other Bond songs. This would have made for a great Academy Award winner. All in all, I enjoyed watching these over two hours, but I feel no need to watch them anytime soon. A good watch for people who love spy movies. Recommended.",Thunderball
7,mark.waltz,"While the lightning does strike for the fourth time, the claps of thunder are miles away.",6,1 November 2017,"While I've never seen a James Bond film yet that I hated, I have to admit that some are better than others. Some are faster moving, have better plot lines, more seductive female characters and yet the better ones are those that are more outlandish in plot. The five Sean Connery films made between 1962 and 1967, it seemed like they are either extremely good or just acceptable. ""Thunderball"" falls into the acceptable mode, the first one to go over two hours, and fails to completely impress in regards to its plot line. But you can enjoy it for all it has, grabbing you instantly with that energetic theme song sung by Tom Jones.Once again, Bond deals with an extremely wealthy madman, determined to bring the world to its knees by threatening to blow up a major city either in England or the United States, and not specifying which one. As most of this takes place either on top of the ocean or beneath it, there are a lot of boat chases in addition to swimming with sharks, a major plot point established in the first scene. The action is pretty much non-stop, the women scantily clad and the love scenes hot. Connery gets in a slew of amusing wisecracks, but overall, it's still formulaic and nothing remotely special. What I'd give, though, to be able to hit the high note on the last line of the opening theme song.",Thunderball
8,classicsoncall,"""You wish to put the evil eye on me?""",7,8 December 2018,"I'll be going out on a limb here by stating that I liked this film better than ""Goldfinger"", even if that film rates higher by viewers voting on IMDb. The one on one fight scene in this picture between Bond (Sean Connery) and Count Lippe (Guy Doleman) looked more realistic than the one against Oddjob in which Connery looked clumsy by comparison. There were also some innovative elements that caught my attention, like the shark pool disposal unit. I thought that was kind of creative. Today of course, the film has a dated quality that makes global ransom seem almost old hat, but back in the mid-Sixties, stealing a couple of atomic weapons would have been a pretty big deal for any world class villain to attempt. Bond meanwhile pairs off with not one, not two, but three different women in somewhat chauvinistic fashion that he wouldn't be able to get away with today.There seems to be a minor plot hole in the story when Bond reveals to Domino (Claudine Auger) that her brother was dead, having found his ID tag in the cockpit of the downed airplane that was hijacked by SPECTRE. But the man wearing it wasn't Major Francois Derval, it was the guy impersonating him working for SPECTRE, Mr. Angelo. Not a big deal I guess, because Angelo had Derval eliminated much earlier in the picture, but still, it was a failure of closure for the Derval sister not to know what really happened.The Bond bad girl in this picture is Luciana Paluzzi, who I first saw in 1964's ""Muscle Beach Party"", making Annette Funicello jealous while getting kissed by Frankie Avalon. This was probably her premier role as an actress, which in the grand scheme of things doesn't seem to say much, but she does have a fair share of screen credits. Personally, Claudine Auger made the better impression as Domino Derval, getting the nod from the script writers to put away the one-eyed bad guy Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi). With everything wrapped up following that extended underwater fight scene between Largo's henchmen and the Coast Guard divers, I was only left with one question - how did they clean the swimming pool after the sharks disposed of a victim?",Thunderball
9,gavin6942,Connery Carries This Average Bond Film,6,5 June 2017,"James Bond (Sean Connery) heads to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme.Of all the James Bond films, this one has one of the less-notable Bond girls. After passing on Julie Christie and Raquel Welch, we end up with Claudine Auger as Dominique ""Domino"" Derval. The character of Domino is interesting, but Auger is hardly well known. (Though fans of Italian horror may recognize her for Mario Bava's ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"".) Sean Connery is the definitive Bond, and this film shows us why. He is smooth and chats up the ladies in ways that no other Bond has. Sorry, Roger Moore. But it is the case.",Thunderball
10,lee_eisenberg,Here they were starting to get gimmicky.,6,19 January 2006,"After ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" were more oriented towards their plots, ""Thunderball"" was more gimmicky and focused more on gadgetry. That's not to say that it wasn't enjoyable. Here, SPECTRE steals some nukes, and James Bond (Sean Connery) has to stop them. Of course, part of the plot is that Bond is surrounded by hot babes - many of whom he beds.Still, one gets the feeling that at this point, Sean Connery may have been feeling disenchanted with the role (he did in fact quit the role after a few more movies). Personally, I think that they should have stopped making the movies after he left; none of the other actors have equalled his quality.",Thunderball

Basically James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) kills SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) operative, ""Number 6"" agent Colonel Jacques Bouvar (Bob Simmons), following this he is sent to a clinic to improve his health. French NATO pilot François Derval (Paul Stassino) was due to board an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs for a training mission, he is murdered by SPECTRE henchman Angelo Palazzi (also Stassino) who has been surgically altered to match his appearance, the plane is sabotaged, crashing and sinking into the water near the Bahamas, the atomic bombs are stolen from the seabed, while Angelo is killed for trying to extort more money offered to him. SPECTRE are demand £100 million in white flawless uncut diamonds from NATO in exchange for the return of the bombs, or they will destroy a major city in the United Kingdom or the United States, all double-0 agents are informed of the threat, Bond recognises a photograph of Derval and is assigned to get any information from his sister, Dominique ""Domino"" (Claudine Auger), in Nassau. Bond saves the life of Domino and they have lunch together, he later goes to a party where he meets Emilio Largo, SPECTRE agent ""Number 2"" (Adolfo Celi), Domino is his mistress, and wins a gambling game against him, Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries, and play a cat-and- mouse game to gain advantage over each other. Bond meets with acquaintance, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Rik Van Nutter) and issued a collection of gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn), including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun and a Geiger counter. Bond attempts to get close to Largo's boat and investigate his estate, Bond's assistant Paula Caplan (Martine Beswick) commits suicide with cyanide before she can be questioned, Bond returns to his hotel and seduces undercover SPECTRE agent Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi), she attempts to kill him alongside henchmen, but she ends up shot dead by her own bodyguard. Bond and Leiter search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater, Bond tells Domino about Largo killing her brother, he needs her help, giving her his Geiger counter to use when she locates the bombs, but she is discovered and captured, but Bond uncovers the plan by Largo to destroy Miami Beach. Bond joins the United States Navy SEALS in an underwater battle against the man henchmen, who after a while surrender, Largo escapes with one of the bombs on his ship, the Disco Volante, Bond is aboard and fights with Largo, but he is killed with a harpoon by Domino, they jump before the ship crashes into the rocks, destroying the ship, Bond and Domino are rescued by a sky hook-equipped U.S. Navy aeroplane. Also starring Bernard Lee as M, Guy Doleman as Count Lippe, Anthony Dawson as the unseen Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Molly Peters as Patricia Fearing, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Roland Culver as Foreign Secretary and Philip Locke as Vargas. Connery still cuts it as the suave and cool super spy, he certainly gets more physical stuff to do, Celi is good as the eye- patch wearing villain, Auger is definitely the least memorable Bond girl of all, you could argue that a majority of the film is set underwater, but there are plenty of action packed scenes out the water as well, overall it is a worthwhile spy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 18 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for the title song by Sir Tom Jones, and it was number 18 on The Ultimate Film.

12,ccthemovieman-1,A Real Mixed Bag Of Good & Bad,6,28 August 2006,"A typical early James Bond movie, filled with beautiful women, a sexist and suave spy can who can do little wrong (Sean Connery as Bond), a few gadgets and a lot of action scenes. The gadgets, which are always fun, were fewer in number than usual, I am sorry to say. The action scenes, although interesting, had absolutely no credibility. Of course, that isn't anything new but they are particularly ludicrous here. Our hero eliminates almost everyone while no one hits him! Also, there are a number of scenes in which Bond escapes from impossible situations and they never show how he did them. All of a sudden, he's pictured somewhere else.In addition, with so many foreign accents, it was difficult to understand the dialog, at least on tape when I last viewed this. Perhaps the DVD has English subtitles, which would help immensely.Otherwise, the filmmakers keep this lively story moving fast most of the time and if you are a male who likes ogle pretty women, you have a lot to choose from here beginning with Claudine Auger.",Thunderball

To do this one of their agents is given plastic surgery so that he looks like a NATO officer who will fly aboard an RAF Vulcan bomber.

The only lead is his sister Domino; she is in the Bahamas so that is Bond's destination. Here he finds her living with Largo; Bond is sure that he is involved but proving it won't be easy.This Bond film is filled with all the thrills one would expect; underwater fights, explosions, a pool full of sharks, several beautiful women and some great one-liners. The numerous undersea scenes were great particularly impressive was the final confrontation between Largo's men and the US forces summoned by Bond's CIA friend Felix Lieter. Sean Connery was once again great as Bond and Adolfo Celi was good as the villain Largo and Claudine Auger did a decent job as Domino.",Thunderball
14,ma-cortes,Excellent entry in which Bond goes into action to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by Spectre,7,13 October 2013,"Over-the-top James Bond movie in which he confronts Spectra and killer hoodlums around the world . World is threatened with destruction James Bond (a magnificent , as usual, Sean Connery) then goes to Bahamas and meets Emilio Largo (Adoldo Celi , as a formidable Bond villain) , a high-ranking nasty agent and involving a beauty (Claudine Auger) in order to retrieve atomic missiles that were stolen by Spectre and its Agent nº 2 . In Bahamas James has an ally character , another agent named Felix Laiter (Rick Van Nutter) . 007 is being lured into a deadly trap , and he will need all of his force , intelligence and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the enemies that seek to destroy him . Bond is pursued by Largo and his hoodlums .This solid , slick thriller with magic mix of action-packed , dazzling stunts , gadgetry , self-deprecating humor and romance provided by sexy company as Claudine Auger ; in addition , Luciana Paluzzi as a memorably sexy villainess , after being rejected for the role of Domino . This is a very amusing installment , though when was released suffered from comparison to its two admittedly superior predecessor ¨From Russia with Love¨ and ¨Goldfinger¨ . Fourth entry Sean Connery as James Bond is very fine , he does remarkably well , he has toughness , irony, humor and sympathy, however also has coldness ,cunning , intelligence and roughness . Sean Connery said that this movie was his personal favorite out of the Bond films he did . Here Bond is an efficient , relentless agent trying to chase obstinately the criminals , traveling around the world as always , as this time is mostly set in Islas Bahamas . Bond to achieve his aims , along the way uses violent means , pulling off brutal killings against enemies who wreak all sorts of havoc . As always Bond will use ""state of the art"" and fantastic gadgets provided by ¨Q¨ interpreted , as usual , by Desmond Llewelyn , he would reprise the role of ""Q"" in 16 subsequent Bond films . In addition , there appears the usual as Lois Maxwell, ¨MoneyPenny¨ and Bernard Lee as M . Here appears four wonderful women ; Claudine Auger , Molly Peters Luciana Paluzzi and Martine Beswick who formerly played in ¨From Russia with love¨ as a gypsy at a memorable fight . This was the second James Bond movie to provide key elements for the series' success ; it was the first of Maurice Binder's opening titles sequences created in the form that they would become most famous for. It was also the first to have movie posters which had panoramic adventure-scene artwork.The picture contains Connery's stylish acting , comic-strip adventure , sensational pursuits , spectacular set pieces , great stunts , tongue-in check humor , frantic unstopped action , amazing gimmicks and stimulating images like are the spectacular chases , the overwhelming underwater scenes made by Ricou Browning , and the breathtaking fights . As is like a roller-coaster , as is fast-paced , light, excitement, funny and entertaining ; it's a winner for oo7 fans and non-fans alike . The chase and suspense formula wears strong in this entry . The action-packed includes : impressive chase scenes in his Aston Martin , underwater battles and Bond escape in a rocket-propulsion Jet Pack originally designed and invented for military use , it is also known as the Small Rocket Lift Device . Hoping for an end to the Cold War, producer Kevin McClory didn't want James Bond's main enemy to be Russian, so for the film version his nemesis is the fictitious criminal organization Spectre . Enjoyable title song and stirring musical score fitting to action by John Barry in his classic style , the score allegedly still contains riffs from Monty Norman's work on ¨Doctor No¨. In premiere , ¨Thunderball¨was panned by reviewers , ; however , time has proved it to be one of the more amusing films based on Ian Fleming novels . . It was remade eighteen years later as ¨Never say never again¨ by Irvin Kershner , with Klaus Maria Brandauer (Adolfo Celi role) , Kim Basinger (Claudine character) and Barbara Carrera (Luciana Paluzzi role) .Riveting and fancy main titles by habitual Maurice Binder , he returned to the series to design the main title sequence for this movie after being absent from the previous two Bond movies ; for the opening main title sequence, title designer Binder filmed swimmers swimming naked in black and white before adding in the color by an optical process afterward. Furthermore , eye-popping and overwhelming production design by Ken Adam . It's brimming with colorful and fascinating cinematography by cameraman Ted Moore . Evocative photography ,much of the film was shot on location, with only a bare minimum of back projection used ; something quite unusual for a film of 1965 . The motion picture was well directed by Terence Young ,author of three best James Bond films : ¨Dr No¨ , ¨From Russia with love¨ and ¨Thunderball¨ and directed to Audrey Hepburn in a good thriller titled ¨Wait until dark¨ and a failed film titled ¨Bloodline¨.",Thunderball
15,BA_Harrison,Watery Bond.,6,16 June 2012,"Based on the first four Bond films alone, I would say that Connery peaked as the nation's greatest spy in From Russia With Love, the series dropping considerably in quality thereafter. Thunderball is perhaps a minor improvement over Goldfinger, but still nowhere near as good as his sophomore adventure.The main issue I have with this film is its rather thin storyline, which displays very little in the way of imagination: SPECTRE steals a couple of nuclear bombs and holds the UK and US to ransom; Bond investigates. The fact that I have been able to sum the plot up in so few words gives some idea how pedestrian it all is.Thunderball also suffers from some incredibly ill considered moments, the 'rack' on full speed and the blatant use of back projection and speeded up footage during the car and boat scenes being particularly cringeworthy; the less said about Bond blackmailing a hot health spa nurse into having sex with him the better...The film's spectacular underwater finalé is well staged and the cinematography is good, but it lacks a sense of genuine excitement, the action seemingly moving at half speed, failing to generate the adrenaline rush one might expect from a climatic Bond battle. It all gets so tedious that the camera even occasionally wanders from the fight to explore some of the colourful underwater wildlife.On a more positive note, the opening fight scene is full of energy and sexy SPECTRE assassin Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) has a very impressive rack.",Thunderball
16,moonspinner55,"A rather turgid underwater adventure for 007...Connery looks great, but plot is lacking",5,23 July 2010,"Number #4 installment in the James Bond franchise, following on the heels of 1964's high-flying ""Goldfinger"", concerns 007's search for two NATO atomic bombs, sending him to the picturesque Bahamas where he faces off with SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo and his deep-sea army. Thinly-derived spy stuff, most of it taking place underwater. Hard to fathom now, but ""Thunderball"" was so phenomenally popular, it was (and perhaps still is) the most financially successful film in the 007 canon. One can faintly assume audiences were still coasting on the good will built up by ""Goldfinger"" when this entry arrived...the poster artwork with star Sean Connery in a wetsuit probably didn't hurt either! The movie certainly gets off to a rousing start, but does a curiously quick fade--and fails to linger in the memory.

17,dbdumonteil,A screenplay before being a novel,9,5 February 2005,"""Thunderball"" occupies a particular place in Ian Fleming's work:it was first a movie screenplay which the writer reworked as a novel.Unlike Goldfinger,some characters are not present in the novel and some are very different.For instance Fleming's Domino is Italian (Domino Vitalli,in the movie she's French)and she's far from the near romantic young lead portrayed by ex-Miss France Claudine Auger .She drinks heavily and she drives her car the way Fiona does in the movie.Although by no means a villain ,she's a cross between Domino (from the movie) and Fiona.Fiona Volpe who is completely absent in the novel ,IMHO,is the best JB girl in the whole movie:a female Bond herself ,she makes love to trap her enemies ,and unlike Pussy Galore or Tatiana,she will not hear the heavenly choirs and come back to the ""right"" way.""Thunderball"" is certainly the most underrated of all Bond movies;Sean Connery had begun not to take this part seriously and some of his lines (after his dance with Fiona notably) are hilarious.Outside Claudine Auger,there are two other beauties (Luciana Paluzzi and Martine Beswick whose part is unfortunately too short),and the final battle is Homeric.This is the last film which roughly follows Fleming's story.Afterward,the writer had asked that the films would keep his title but would use original screenplays.The first attempt ,although written by highly talented Roald Dalh was a let- down.""Thunderball"" was the only JB which was remade ,because there were two works ,the novel adapted for the screen in 1966,and the screenplay which they use for ""Never say never again"" at the beginning of the eighties and which ,like it or not ,was not that much an improvement on Terence Young's flick.Klaus Maria Brandauer,although a great thespian,did not outshine Adolfo Celi the first Largo.",Thunderball

The ending appears more like a rush act.Unlike ""Goldfinger,"" with the exception of one or two lines, Sean Connery is not given the opportunity to deliver the lines that he did so well the year before.Adolfo Celi, the villain here, lacks the sinister charisma of Gert Frobe of ""Goldfinger"" fame.",Thunderball
20,BandSAboutMovies,An important movie,7,4 April 2020,"Here's where things get messy.Thunderball would have been the first Bond film, if not for all the lawsuits.Yes - back in 1958, Ian Fleming was already planning a James Bond movie.Fleming and a young writer and director named Kevin McClory wrote a script that had many working titles - SPECTRE, James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West - but mainly concerned spying and an underwater battle. McClory's first film, The Boy and the Bridge, bombed and somewhere along the way Fleming grew disenchanted with the script and the author.Not disenchanted enough that he didn't turn said script into his next James Bond novel. By November of 1963, the case was in court. It lasted three weeks, with a pause after Fleming had a heart attack. The end result? McClory got the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming could publish the novel, as long as he stated that it was based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author. Fleming would die nine months later.The legal issues would find their way to Bond producers Broccoli and Saltzman, who were faced with the fact that McClory retained screen rights to the novel's story, plot, and characters. This could have allowed McClory to make his own series of Bond films - more on that later - and is the reason why so many of the licensed properties, like Victory Games' RPG, didn't have SPECTRE.Guy Hamilton - citing creative burnout - stepped away from the series. And Terence Young, who directed the first two films, stepped back in.Bond starts this film by punching out the widow of a SPECTRE agent at her husband's funeral. Surprise - the man was never dead and 007 chases him with his Aston-Martin and a jetpack, which was a practical effect. That said, Connery and several of the stuntmen were nearly killed by sharks while making this, just in case you're wondering why CGI works.SPECTRE isn't having any of this, so Number One Blofeld (still Anthony Dawson in disguise) and Number Two Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi, who used this movie to basically have a career in the Eurospy field; he's in OK Connery and Danger: Diabolik, two of the better films in this genre as well as tons of giallo) decide to steal some nukes and blow up the world real good unless they get paid $100 million pounds.Miss France Monde and first runner-up in the 1958 Miss World contest Claudine Auger plays Largo's mistress Domino. She - of course - ends up with Bond. Auger would later appear with two of her fellow Bond girls (Barbara Bouchet and Barbara Bach) in Black Belly of the Tarantula.There's all manner of SCUBA action in this one, some of it coordinated by Ricuo Browing. There's also a ship called the Disco Volante, an exceedingly long running time and a battle at the end that seems to go on forever.On SPECTRE's side:Assassin Fiona Volpe is played by Luciana Paluzzi (The Green Slime, Jess Franco's 99 Women, A Black Veil for Lisa)
Agent Number Four is Guy Doleman, who was also in the Michael Caine-starring Harry Palmer series; he was also the first Number Two on The Prisoner.
Vargas is Largo's main henchman; he's killed off with a spear gun.
SPECTRE Number Five, who planned the Great Train Robbery, is played by Phillip Stone, Alex's dad in A Clockwork Orange.
On Bond's side:Felix Leiter is played by a new actor in this one, Rik Van Nutter, who was once married to Anita Ekberg.
The doomed Paula Caplan is played by Martine Beswick, who was also Zora in Dr. No; she also played the titular roles in Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde and The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood.
Molly Peters plays a doctor who saves Bond's life; she's also the first woman to take her clothes off in the series.
French spy Madame La Porte is played by Maryse Guy Mitsouko, who appears in the Eurospy films Agent 077 - Mission Bloody Mary, Code Name: Jaguar, Z7 Operation Rembrandt, Furia a Marrakec and Bob Fleming: Mission Casablanca.
There's also a scene where all the 00 agents are gathered, but we don't get to see much of them. They would be 002 John Bill Fairbanks, the unnamed 003 through 005, 006 Alec Trevalyan and several others who aren't named. Of them, only Bond and 008 don't die all the time.
The theme song for this movie was originally going to be Shirley Bassey's ""Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,"" whose title was taken from the Italian nickname for 007. That track was too short, so it was re-recorded with Dionne Warwick. And then the producers worried that the name of the movie wasn't in the lyrics, so they got Tom Jones to sing the theme. Jones wanted to impress them so much that he held the last note so long that he passed out.Johnny Cash sent in a song. It wasn't used.This is the first Bond movie where the ladies are nude in the opening credits and the actual actor - Connery of course - appears in the gun barrel sequence. It's also the biggest blockbuster in Bond history, making $141 million in 1965, which would be worth $1.16 billion today.As for the legal battles, they would continue long past the release of Thunderball.In 1976, McClory planned to produce an original James Bond film - called either Warhead, Warhead 8 or James Bond of the Secret Service - but United Artists and Fleming's estate sued. McClory won two different trials and licensed the rights to Jack Schwartzman for Never Say Never Again.Speaking of that film - the script is insane. As written by Sean Connery, spy writer Len Deighton (who wrote those aforementioned Michael Caine Harry Palmer films) and McClory, it involves Blofeld, the Bermuda Triangle, sharks with nukes strapped to their heads, an underwater kingdom called Arkos and Bond only showing up for three scenes.A few decades later, McClory resurfaced with plans to make Warhead 2000 A.D. with Sony, who ended up settling with MGM/United Artists. He also worked with Sony in 1999 to try and get the rights for all past Bond films, but this suit was thrown out as it was decided that McClory had ""waited too long.""A decade or so later - and after McClory's death - MGM, Danjaq and his estate came to an amicable conclusion over nearly half a century of legal and business disputes.",Thunderball
21,Coventry,Bond  Rockefeller Bond,7,6 October 2016,"""Thunderball"" was the fourth installment in the James Bond franchise, and as the hype and popularity rose, the available budgets exponentially increased as well, as a matter of course. The budget for this movie was more than the three previous ones accumulated (and then still it's very modest in comparison with nowadays action flicks), which explains the fact that ""Thunderball"" also marks more or less the point where the franchise became more focused on the hi-tech gadgetry and extravagant set-pieces. Heck, even 007 himself begins to behave shamelessly like a millionaire, as he takes vacations in luxurious spa resorts and tropical islands, and has fancy flying devices stored in the truck of his beautiful Aston Martin! But the work of a secret agent is never finished, and still whilst luring the voluptuous nurse into bed, Bond already spots a few sinister men who are clearly up to no good. They turn out to be henchmen of SPECTRE's number two – Emilio Largo – who's punctually preparing the heist of two nuclear warheads. Once in his possession and carefully hidden underneath the bottom of the ocean, Largo threatens to blow up both Miami and London in case the world doesn't pay up 100 million dollars' worth of uncut diamonds. The government hastily summons all double-0 agents to locate the warheads in less than 14 days, but naturally James Bond is the only one making any progress in his very own typically daring and flamboyant style. After having missed out on ""Goldfinger"", Terence Young reclaims his place in the director's chair and once more serves a delicious Bond-cocktail with all the ingredients that make the series recognizable: breathtaking women (Claudine Auger, Martine Beswick and – especially – the lethally ravishing Luciana Paluzzi), charismatic villains (Adolfo Celi doesn't even need his eye patch in order to look menacing), dreamy filming locations (Paris, Bahama's ), eccentric scenery and gimmicks (luxury yachts named ""Flying Saucer"", shark-infested swimming pools) and – as top of the bill – masterfully choreographed albeit slightly overlong underwater battle sequences. My sole complaint in general with regards to ""Thunderball"", in fact, is about the length. I realize all Bond movies last around 110-140 minutes, but in this case there should have been cuts within the first half hour. The preparations for the heist of the warheads is illustrated extendedly and in every tiniest detail, including the training and plastic surgery of the pilot assigned to hijack the Avro Vulcan Bomber, and it takes an incredibly long time before the audience properly registers what one-eyed Largo's evil plans actually are. Almost every plot description of ""Thunderball"" states something like: ""SPECTRE stole two atomic bombs and holds the world at ransom"", but it effectively takes more than half an hour before we reach this point.",Thunderball

25,hitchcockthelegend,"Sir, I'd respectfully request that you change my assignment to Nassau.",7,24 April 2012,"Thunderball is directed by Terence Young and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins from a story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Adolfo Celi, Claudine Auger, Rick Van Nutter and Martine Beswick. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.The fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE's number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.It was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli & Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.As with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry's blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance. The girls, too, are delightful, particularly Auger who positively sizzles with sexuality. Bond's by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed. While for those who adore the gadgets and daring stunts? Thunderball excels with its assortment of trick vehicles, under water weaponry and aids and radioactive pills! Without doubt the near $6 million budget is all up there on the screen.Yet for other fans, and this is the category I fall into, it's a film of too many flaws to be considered one of the greats. Whilst it's undeniable that when it hits the high points it excites royally (the extended underwater battle is eye popping brilliance), but there's too much languid passages in the overlong running time. Young himself lamented that he couldn't get the pace right on account of the plot structure. The other major problem for me is Celi as Largo. Visually he's striking, with his white hair and eye patch, he well looks villainous, but physically he's wrong and someone you can't buy into as a man able to not only take on Bond, but to overcome him as well! While the finale lacks a grandness to reward those having sat for over 2 hours with the film. But what do I know? Film made a stunning $141 million at the box office! And the fanaticism that began with Goldfinger reached epic proportions here.The more is more approach worked for the makers, and it ensured that for the time being Bond was going to stay in this epic, gadget effects strewn groove. Connery wasn't happy, he had voiced his concerns about Bond becoming characterless, while he hated the mania surrounding the films and his role within them. He would return for the next instalment, You Only Live Twice, question was, would it be his last performance as Bond? 7/10",Thunderball
26,Theo Robertson,Disappointing,5,28 July 2003,"After the classic GOLDFINGER it`s somewhat disappointing to see THUNDERBALL a film that`s easily the weakest of the 60s Bond films starring Sean Connery. The problem I have with it is the same problem I have with many of the later Bond films - It`s overlong and badly paced with much of the story held up as the audience are shown how easy it is to steal a couple of atomic bombs from a NATO aircraft . It`s a ridiculous plot of course like all James Bond films but the production team seem to feel if they go into enough details this will make the threat to the world somehow more credible . Well sorry but it doesn`t .It is good in places . As always Connery is great as Bond but it`s a pity he spends so much time under water since this drowns out his physical presence , oh and spot the number of times his Edinburgh brogue comes to the fore . It`s also a very sadistic film which is something modern day Bond producers seem to have forgotten about . Please note that the reason the James Bond franchise was so ground breaking in the 1960s was because he was such a violent anti hero . Nowadays the title character seems to be based on the late Bob Hope rather than Sean Connery .Completely useless trivia fact : I share something in common with Sean Connery - We were both born in Edinburgh but neither of us have lived there for many years . I now live in Rothesay on the island of Bute . The Royal Navy frigate used in the climax of THUNDERBALL is H.M.S Rothesay . Uncanny",Thunderball
27,Scarecrow-88,Thunderball,8,8 August 2010,"After eliminating the assassin(in drag!) who killed two of his colleagues, 007(ConnerY)must stop SPECTRE once again from global terror, this time evil agent #2, Emilio Largo(Adolfo Celi, with an eye patch and super yacht called the Disco Volante)is heading an extortion threat using two commandeered atomic missiles stolen from a NATO airplane, warning of an attack on either an England or US city if not paid certain millions. As any great Bond movie has, Bond outplays Largo in a game of Bonco at a casino, steals the villain's gorgeous trophy mistress(her brother was the airplane pilot killed and replaced by a paid impostor to be disposed of once Largo gained the missiles and no longer needed his services), evades numerous attempts on his life, and has the beautiful ladies' hearts swooning. In THUNDERBALL, there plenty of gadgets such as a jet propelled one manned flying vehicle, a watch with a Geiger counter just in case there's an attempt to poison him with something radioactive, a camera which can take pictures underwater, a pocket sized breather if Bond loses his oxygen tank, and a pill which to swallow with a homing device to track him if he gets lost and needs to be found by his allies. Largo even owns his own estate called Palmyra in Nassau, complete with a pool of sharks(which get to feed off of one unlucky fellow who fails in his mission to kill Bond; Largo is not one who tolerates failure very well). Beautiful women(Claudine Auger, Luciana Paluzzi, Martine Beswick, Molly Peters), underwater fights with harpoons, exotic locations, a great Bond villain and a finale involving a speeding boat with 007 having to fend off Largo's men before it crashes into rocks..THUNDERBALL has all the required ingredients. Maybe a bit longer than it needs to be, nevertheless, THUNDERBALL still delivers for the target audience. Interesting enough, Bond must be saved by three different women, on three different occasions, particularly at the end when it seems Largo has 007 right where he wants him. Not only does THUNDERBALL have a great villain in Celi, but the voluptuous red-head Paluzzi is a fetching villainous in her own right. Probably the most funniest attempt on Bond's life would have to be in this film when a SPECTRE agent turns the speed up on a back stretching machine in a health spa where 007 was vacationing.",Thunderball

30,Bunuel1976,"THUNDERBALL (Terence Young, 1965) ***",7,20 November 2008,"To begin with, I hadn't watched this one in probably 15 years or thereabouts and, so far, I only own the first seven entries in the popular James Bond series on DVD: somehow, I hadn't gone through it or the YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967) edition back when I first purchased them, so I took the opportunity to do so now on the heels of the newest and, sadly, disappointing 007 adventure  QUORUM OF SULLENNESSerQUANTUM OF SOLACE (2008). It's still considered the most commercially successful outing in the franchise (the one where Bondmania reached its zenith)  and, while perhaps not among the very best of the lot (for reasons I'll get to later), it's highly representative of the phenomenally popular series.Sean Connery's somewhere near peak form here, the obligatory Bond girls (chief among them Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi) gorgeous  like Olga Kurylenko from QUANTUM, the former's character is given an extra edge by making the girl ultimately decide to aid Bond in order to exact revenge on her own jealous yet cold-blooded 'guardian'  and the villain (Adolfo Celi) appropriately imposing as well as sinister (sporting an eye-patch and keeping sharks in his private pool!); incidentally, it was nice to see again Celi and Paluzzi playing their signature roles after encountering the two Italians in so much native product over the years. While the narrative itself meanders somewhat throughout the hefty 130-minute duration (requiring extensive underwater footage), the plot involving SPECTRE's appropriation of atom bombs for extortion purposes is both topical (in view of the recent Cuban missile crisis and the ongoing Cold War) and suspenseful.The action  injected by the now-trademark witty repartee (including an in-joke regarding a pre-stardom Connery film, ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE [1958]) and sexual innuendoes (never more blatant, perhaps, than in the rack-gone-wild incident), which have unaccountably and regrettably gone missing from the latest incarnation of the super-agent  is big and brutal; for anyone who claims Daniel Craig's ruthless persona was a departure for the series, one need only take another look at Connery's seminal and iconic tenure in the role (especially the pre-credits fist-fight with a 'widow')! As always, Bernard Lee's belligerent ""M"" and Lois Maxwell's bemused Miss Moneypenny make an appearance  though the role of C.I.A. operative Felix Leiter is rather anonymously filled by Rik Van Nutter  as, of course, do Desmond Llewellyn's gadgets: that said, the most memorable of these (the flying kit) is actually relegated to the prologue! Ditto, for the lush/exotic backdrops: here, we don't just have the usual resort to casinoes, beaches and boats but a colorful Mardi Gras event and, as I implied earlier, a full-blown and superbly-staged underwater death match between heroes and villains (the film-makers' peerless prowess in this department was subsequently rewarded with a Best Visual Effects Oscar).Incidentally, along with ""Casino Royale"", this is the one Ian Fleming novel which was owned by other hands (or, in its case, jointly) until some time ago: the former was filmed no less than three times, while THUNDERBALL itself (overseen by co-story author Kevin McClory, with regular producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli maintaining a merely executive position) eventually resurfaced as the jokily-titled NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN (1983)  for which Connery, who had abdicated the role 'for good' 12 years earlier, would be persuaded to make a 'series' comeback!",Thunderball

Scenarists Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins brought back the worldwide criminal organization SPECTRE, the Special Executive for Counterespionage, Terror, Revenge, and Extortion, to menace Bond after his adventure against Auric Goldfinger, who had cooperated with the Red Chinese. SPECTRE was behind Dr. No in ""Dr. No,"" the villains in ""From Russia with Love"" as well as here in ""Thunderball."" Blofeld appears in close-ups with a white cat in ""FRWL"" and here at a criminal organization summit when he kills a traitor. The Bond producers let Blofeld come out into the open for the next Bond epic ""You Only Live Twice."" Like the best 007 movies, ""Thunderball"" takes advantage of actual events and the main real life event was the loss of two atomic bombs in the early 1960s. Blofeld's number two man, Emilio Largo, hatches a grand scheme to steal two A-Bombs from NATO and use them to hold the world for ransom. Bond villains come in three types: those like Blofeld who are criminals and want to make the world powers pay, but they don't want to destroy the world. Those villains, like Stromberg and Drax in later Bond movies ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker,"" who want to destroy the world and recreate civilization in their own image. Finally, there are the independent villains, like Franz Sanchez in ""License to Kill,"" Mr. Big in ""Live and Let Die,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and Max Zorin in ""A View to a Kill"" who want to corner a market, but who have no designs of world domination. There is also a mention about the real life British train robbery that occurred before ""Thunderball"" was released.The ""Thunderball"" pre-credit sequence ranks one of the top five James Bond pre-credit sequences because it contains a surprise and a gimmick. James Bond and a French agent are at a funeral and the casket bears the initials JB, but the initials stand for Jacques Bouvar. Bond knew Bouvar as an assassin who had murdered two of his colleagues. He watches a veiled widow leave and climb into a limousine. She pulls the rear door shut without help and the vehicle drives off. At a French château, the widow enters a large drawing room to find 007 awaiting her. He rises, expresses his condolences, and then decks the lady with a right cross that sends her flying across a table. ""My dear, Colonel Bouvar,"" Bond informs the man in drag, ""I don't think you should have opened that car door yourself."" A brief but potent slugfest ensues until Bond chokes Bouvar to death with a fireplace poker. Bouvar's henchmen break down the door seconds before Bond exits. He straps on Bell Aero systems Rocket belt jet-pack and flies off to his Aston-Martin where the French agent is waiting. They shove the jetpack in the trunk. Bond activates the bulletproof shield from the trunk. Never mind that the jetpack and the retractable shield could occupy the same space, then unleashes to stream of water that knocks Bouvar's gun-toting henchmen down.Bond gets himself into several tight spots in ""Thunderball."" At the Shrublands clinic, Colonel Lippe (Guy Doleman of ""The Ipcress File"") catches Bond on the exercise machine and cranks up the speed. Bond is harnessed to it and cannot stop the machine. Later, he exploits his advantage over the nurse and has sex with her to maintain his silence over the incident. Bond is trapped during a fight in a swimming pool with one of Largo's henchmen and Largo lets in the sharks while placing a shutter over the pool. Bond is nicked in the ankle during the Junkanoo parade, and later a Largo henchman almost spears him under Largo's yacht.Adolf Celi makes a superb villain with his scimitar shaped snout, the black eye patch, and his razor sharp voice. He is despicable from start to finish, especially when he threatens to apply hot and cold torture to Domino with a burning cigarette and ice cubes. He feeds one of henchmen to the sharks when the man fails to deal with 007. Later, after the RAF Vulcan lands in the Bahamas, he refuses to cut the impostor pilot Angelo Palazzi (Paul Stassino of ""Escape to Athena"") free of the cockpit straps but slashes the man's air hose so that he drowns. Earlier, after the villains killed the real RAF pilot, Palazzi demanded more money because of the plastic surgery that he had to undergo to impersonate the pilot. Clearly, Palazzi's greed motivated Largo in part to kill him, but Largo is just enough of a dastard to have done it anyway to keep from paying Palazzi period.They plan to crash land an RAF Vulcan at sea, retrieve the bombs, and camouflage the aircraft with sharks swimming around it to ward off the curious. While the landing isn't that convincing, it will do, but once the plane is on the ocean floor, it looks cool. The climactic undersea battle off the coast of Miami has been vastly underrated. At the time, this represented the biggest underwater battle in cinema history; indeed, the Bond producers would mimic it in outer space for ""Moonraker."" Despite the continuity problems in the underwater battle, Young and second unit director Peter Hunt have a blast, even the lobster trying to avoid the fighting is amusing. All the scenes with the sharks are neat. Bond's first two encounters with Largo at the casino and later on Largo's estate where they shoot skeet are first-rate. Young keeps the tone of the film rather serious and the one-liners and puns pay off beautifully. The briefing of the double-00s in London in that cavernous room with the huge wall map is very atmospheric. John Barry's music is tops.",Thunderball
33,Boba_Fett1138,One of the weaker Bond movies. Still good entertainment to watch of course!,6,18 March 2006,"I consider this movie to be one of the weaker one's out of the long series of Bond movies. Yes, sure it still has an entertainment value but it lacks some of the fundamental things that made most of the other Bond movies so good and fun to watch.Perhaps the thing that I find to be most disappointing about this movie is the action. Most of the Bond movies always have some cool fist fights and a big spectacular finale. The biggest fight sequence and finale in this movie are set underwater. I could be me, but I don't find underwater fights to be spectacular or terribly exciting to watch. Also the ending is completely ridiculous, mainly because it's so incredibly fake and ridiculous looking. Also the fact that James Bond doesn't kill the main villain in this one but another person does, just doesn't feel right and not suiting for the style of the series. The movie seriously lacks some memorable impressive sequence and therefor ""Thunderball"" is one of the more forgettable Bond movies.Another disappointing aspect are the Bond girls. Bond-girls have never been known for their acting skills but Claudine Auger really is a bad, charismatic-less actress, that just doesn't known how to make a lasting impression on the silver screen. Also Rik Van Nutter is a horrible Felix Leiter in this movie.The plot and the way it is told also isn't terribly exciting and might be a bit too confusing for the more casual viewer at times. So it could be just the story which makes this movie to be in my opinion, one of the weaker Bond movies but I think it's a combination of all those elements I mentioned before.Luckily Sean Connery still is in good form though in this movie. He is in his element as James Bond and he delivers some good one-liners. Also Bond-regulars Desmond Llewelyn, Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell are luckily present in the movie, to still give the movie that typical 'Bond-feeling'.The movie still is decent entertainment to watch but it's nothing memorable really, with the exception of the Tom Jones theme song maybe.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Thunderball

In the Bahamas.Sean Connery reprises Bond in the 4th entry in the series, which has a backstory which is probably more interesting than the plot of the film itself. Back in 1965 it was great. Now, with the 21st century more than a decade old, it looks a bit tired. The Bahamas are colourful, sunny and photogenic, but there are a number of things to find fault with.The back projection and travelling matte work is, once again, truly shoddy, but that has always been a problem with the older Bond films. Casting again includes people high up on the cast list (principal villain and principal Bond girl in this case) whose dialogue had to be dubbed - in Adolfo Celi's case, delivery of the dubbed dialogue is dreadful. The underwater battle, so exciting at the time, now seems badly executed, with a lot of repeated shots in it. Even Connery is not at his best.Fortunately, James Bond would be back.",Thunderball

Sending Bond around the world, Hosler glitters the non-action scenes with ultra-stylised wipes, refreshing the jet-set life of 007.

Throwing angry exchanges with Adolfo Celi simmering baddie Largo (who like Auger being dubbed by Nikki Van der Zyl for Eng version & fellow actress Nicole Maurey for French dub,is dubbed by Robert Rietty) Sir Sean,gives a winning performance as 007, brimming with a devanare appearance Sir Sean uses as a shell to his eagle-eyed attacks to stop the thunderball from rolling.",Thunderball

Although Bond succeeds cleverly he is still reduced to near death where other factors must save him where he cannot.

So Bond has to find the missles and put a stop to SPECTRE's plans once again.

The fist one, Dr. No, wasn't great, followed by a slightly better From Russia With Love. Goldfinger and Thunderball are just much better movies, where it looks like they finally know where they want to go with this franchise. Sean Connery is also better as James Bond, even though the behavior of his character is borderline sexual harassment, something that wouldn't pass at all in modern days. I can't see his behavior, where he imposes himself to women rather agressively, very passable for a modern day hero. That said, the movie is from 1965, when the moral standards where different then now. Thunderball has a good plot, some good scenes which might be too long for some but I thought they were entertaining. The Bond girls, just famous for their short passages in the movies, are still candy for the eye. From the first four movies Thunderball is the best made and most interesting. John Stears got an Oscar for Best Effects and Special Visual Effects, which I can understand for 1965, but he would never win with that nowadays. It's ironic they give this movie an Oscar for this as there are enough scenes where it looks all really fake, but that's from the eye of somebody that watches the movie now and not in 1965.

44,SimonJack,Bond in the Bahamas and beyond,8,7 September 2017,"This is the fourth of the James Bond, 007 action, spy and mystery series. Sean Connery continues the role, but with much more gadgetry. The character ""Q"" is now firmly established, and fans will look eagerly for his latest novelty items that will save Bond's life one way or another. Also, Bond's affiliation with a regular CIA character is being cemented, with Felix Leiter. There will be as many different actors to play Felix as there will be Bonds in the future. ""Thunderball"" was filmed in more than 40 locations in the Bahamas, France, England, and the U.S. Great scenery, glamorous settings and the playgrounds of the rich and famous are beginning to occupy most of the Bond films now. In this film, Bond has to track down a British Vulcan jet that disappeared with two A-bombs and a NATO adviser on board. The dastardly evil SPECTRE blackmails Great Britain and the U.S. for $280 million. Pay up, or lose a big city in one of the countries. It's a race against time, and our man with a nose for where the culprit hides out is on top of things soon. (No pun intended for those with such minds).Another trait is emerging in the series too – the death of one of the beautiful women who enter Bond's world. Most often it's an attractive assistant (as here with Paula, played by Martine Beswick). But sometimes it's another friend or acquaintance. Most in the audience probably don't feel too bad when one of those who die is a deadly femme fatale. That happens here as well, with SPECTRE agent Fiona, played by Luciana Paluzzi. This film has some nice action with very good underwater scenes and what are probably Navy frogmen parachuting to land in the ocean and do battle underwater. The tear-away yacht was a nice touch for some action. Of course, when Bond is through with this bunch, SPECTRE will have to find a new number 2, to replace Largo (Adolfo Celi). One thing one can say about SPECTRE – it demands total loyalty and sacrifice, but considers all of its people expendable. It literally feeds them to the sharks.

46,ShadeGrenade,"""I thought I saw a SPECTRE at your shoulder!""",10,2 May 2011,"'Thunderball' is the best of the Sean Connery Bond movies. The series began in 1962 with 'Dr.No', an earnest attempt to put Ian Fleming's suave spy on the big screen. 'From Russia With Love' took 007 into Hitchcock territory, but it was not until 'Goldfinger' that the Bond formula - lavish action set-pieces, cheeky humour, outrageous sexism, absurd gadgets - was perfected. Audiences wanted more, and the producers duly obliged. 'Thunderball' was 'the biggest Bond of all' in 1965, and, in many ways, it still is. The international crime syndicate SPECTRE ( Special Executive for Counter-Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge & Extortion ) hijacks a Vulcan bomber during a training mission. Aboard are two atomic bombs. A taped message arrives at Whitehall demanding a king's ransom or else the bombs will be detonated. Bond flies to the Bahamas where 'Domino Derval' ( Claudine Auger ) - sister of one of the Vulcan crew - lives with her millionaire lover, 'Emilio Largo' ( Adolfo Celi ), a.k.a. SPECTRE agent no.2...The story began life as a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whiitingham and Fleming, and was originally intended to be the first Bond movie. McClory's lack of a track record at the box office meant he could not get funding, and so it was abandoned. Fleming then wrote a book based on the treatment without consulting the others, and one sued. McClory won his case, got a credit on future editions ( along with Whittingham ), and the film rights were awarded to him. Not wishing to compete with Harry Saltzman and Albert R.Broccoli's series, he entered into partnership with them. Chroniclers of the Bond series tend to regard this as the point at which the series went into decline, but I disagree. 'Thunderball' was the first true Bond epic. I think the problem is that some people have seen it only on television, and it was designed for the cinema. The underwater scenes are beautiful and John Barry's music gives them a strangely sinister and poetic quality. There were numerous imitators around then, such as Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' and James Coburn's 'Derek Flint', so 'Thunderball' pulled out all the stops to keep Bond ahead of the competition. It gets off to a ( literally ) flying start with a château fight between 007 and a SPECTRE agent in drag, culminating in our hero making a getaway using a rocket-pack. The Aston Martin is on view again, and Fiona Volpe ( Luciana Paluzzi )'s rocket-firing motorcycle is a beauty ( like its owner ). The underwater finale and the yacht cum hydrofoil impresses still. Terence Young, director of the first two Bonds, combines the toughness of 'Dr.No' with the tongue-in-cheek humour of 'Goldfinger'. What a pity though he left the series after this. Tom Jones belts out the John Barry and Don Black title song as though his life depended on it. The film crushed all competition in 1965, setting a standard for box office grosses unsurpassed until 1977's 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. Connery played Bond a further three times, but those films ( particularly 'You Only Live Twice' ) were disappointments. No more was heard of McClory until the mid-'70's when he announced plans to remake 'Thunderball' as 'Warhead'. I have seen the script ( it was published online ) and it is nowhere near the quality of Maibaum and Hopkins' version. In 1983, the rogue remake 'Never Say Never Again' appeared, and, while entertaining for the most part, could not hope to - and did not - match 'Thunderball'.",Thunderball
47,JamesHitchcock,More like a Ballet than a Battle,7,29 November 2013,"""Thunderball"" was originally intended to be the first James Bond film, but in the event a legal dispute about the rights to the story led to a delay in making it. ""Dr No"" became the first film in the series, with ""Thunderball"" eventually being made as the fourth three years later. (This dispute was also the reason why Ian Fleming's novel was later filmed again as ""Never Say Never Again""). The plot is a relatively simple one. The international terrorist organisation SPECTRE have stolen two atomic bombs from a British Vulcan bomber and are using them to hold the world to ransom, demanding £100 million as their price for not destroying a major city. Bond's task is to find and recover the bombs before SPECTRE can detonate them, a search which takes him to the Bahamas. Although the film involves SPECTRE, the main villain is not that organisation's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld who was to feature in the next three Bond movies (in each case played by a different actor) but his Number Two Emilio Largo. Bond's main ally, apart from his American counterpart Felix Leiter, is Largo's mistress Dominique Derval, known as ""Domino"". Domino's motive for changing sides (apart, of course, from Bond's irresistible charm) is her discovery that her lover was responsible for the death of her brother François, a French Air Force officer, who was murdered as part of the plot to steal the bombs. Bond's ability to ""turn"" the villain's female accomplices is a common plot point in the series; he had already made use of it in the previous film, ""Goldfinger"" (although there the relationship between Goldfinger and Pussy Galore was always about business rather than sex). ""Thunderball"", however, also contains one of Bond's rare failures in this department when he tries, and fails, to convert Fiona Volpe, another glamorous Largo sidekick. In terms of Bond villains, the one-eyed Largo as played by Adolfo Celi falls somewhere between Gert Frobe's Goldfinger and Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence and Charles Gray. (Telly Savalas's interpretation was rather different). Largo lacks Goldfinger's crude thuggishness, looking quite at home wearing his tuxedo in a casino. (Goldfinger shares Largo's love of card-games, but in such a setting would stand out like a sore thumb). On the other hand he also lacks the suavity and surface polish of Blofeld, and his attempts to hide his menace beneath a veneer of icy politeness are never quite as successful. Celi spoke English with a strong Italian accent, so his lines were dubbed by an English actor. The same was done for the former Miss France Claudine Auger who plays Dominique, but this does not prevent them from making their own memorable contributions to the series. Claudine was possibly the loveliest Bond Girl of the sixties. (That's as in ""even lovelier than Ursula Andress""). She had a successful career as an actress in France and Italy, but her lack of fluency in the language meant she made few other English-language films. Martine Beswick, who had previously appeared in ""From Russia with Love"", reappears here in a minor role, making her the first Bond Girl to appear in two films in different roles. (Maud Adams was later to repeat this feat in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" and ""Octopussy""). Despite a strong villain and a beautiful leading lady, ""Thunderball"" has never really been my favourite Bond; I would not rate it as highly as its immediate predecessor ""Goldfinger"", or as its immediate successor ""You Only Live Twice"", or as ""Dr No"". Part of the reason is that Sean Connery is not really on top form here; possibly disillusionment with the role, which was to lead to him quitting it (at least temporarily) after ""You Only Live Twice"", was already starting to set in. (Oddly enough, Connery was actually better in the later film). A more important reason, however, is that the action tends to drag at times. Despite the simplicity of the plot, the film has a longer running time than any of its three predecessors. Too much time is taken up with those interminable underwater scenes, which do not make for exciting action. The final underwater showdown between the force of SPECTRE and the good guys, all trying to shoot one another with spear guns, is among the oddest finales of any Bond film, more like a ballet than a battle. ""Thunderball"" is not a bad film, but it's not first-rate Bond. 7/10",Thunderball
48,DKosty123,Solid Film- Not Quite A Goldfinger,6,13 October 2006,"Sean Connery is in good form here (in fact this was remade As NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN but would say this is the stronger entry). The opening sequence with it's quick twists & turns give you enough excitement for a while. After the credits, the film falls into a lot of plot development. The only drawback with this film is some confusion at the end of the film with the underwater sequencing.Even the remake gets a little foggy with theirs, but this one is a complete mess with what is happening underwater at a couple of points. The technology is top notch & the action sequences are very good. The script is quite sharp, & all the regulars are here for this one. The Tom Jones theme is not one of the best ones. The women are interesting though not the most beautiful in the series. The technology in this is starting to look more dated now.",Thunderball
49,Red-Barracuda,"Style, glamour, exoticism, action and sex-appeal - a great Bond film in other words",9,18 November 2017,"Thunderball is the fourth in the 'James Bond' series and the final of those directed by Terence Young. It was actually the most successful Bond of its time, yet it seems to have a mixed reputation. When I watched it as a little kid, I used to think this too, finding it less engaging than the other Bond movies of its era, however, having seen it a couple of times in recent times I now find I to be among the best of the series. In this one a member of the nefarious espionage organisation SPECTRE, the criminal mastermind Emilio Largo, concocts a plan to steal nuclear warheads from NATO and to then threaten to detonate them unless a huge ransom is received. As per usual, the plot-line is merely a means to an end, simply a way of allowing us access to all of the usual Bond ingredients we know and love.Sean Connery is very much at the height of his powers here and gives another witty performance full of sarcasm and one-liners, while fully convincing as an action hero. His nemesis here Largo is played by Italian actor Aldolfo Celi who appeared in many notable movies and he is suitably memorable here as the eye-patch sporting evil genius who even has a pool of sharks at his villa where those who displease him are forced to take a swim. Blofeld himself gets in on the act too by disposing of a traitorous associate by eliminating him via a trap door to a fiery demise, only to be replaced with a smoking chair. There is even a Bond Girl villainess in the assassin Fiona Volpe played with some gusto by Luciana Paluzzi. A more traditional Bond Girl comes in the form of the utterly gorgeous Domino, played by the very sexy Claudine Auger. She is a bikini wearing babe in the same general mould as Honey Ryder from Dr. No (1962), which quite frankly can never be a bad thing.This could be thought of as the underwater Bond film. The beautiful stylish opening credit sequence plays on this with silhouettes of slinky ladies swimming to the terrific Tom Jones title song. The setting of the Bahamas is a chance for the series to return to the same general vicinity as that used in Dr. No and which had the added advantage of being a part of the world which was both associated with the real major Cold War incident the Cuban Missile Crisis, while at the same time being sun-kissed, exotic and a place for pure escapism, i.e. a perfect location for a glamourized spy film. A few people seem to find the copious amounts of underwater action as being excessive and a bit tedious but I actually really appreciated all of it. I thought that it gave the film a flavour all of its own, while the elaborate battle was expertly executed and really showcased the high production values. What took all of this stuff up to another level was the really rather excellent soundtrack from John Barry, the incidental music here is some of his best individual Bond scoring work and really accentuated the underwater feel I thought. If I had to add one bit of criticism it would probably have to be the speeded-up boat finale does seem a little ropey nowadays. But, overall I found revisiting this one to be another very pleasant experience and it goes down as yet another out-and-out classic Bond film from the 60's era. In 1983 Connery returned to the Bond role after a long absence in the film Never Say Never Again, which was a remake of Thunderball. It was a sadly very poor film indeed and showed that the magic of great cinema is not so easy to reproduce, but what it did indicate was just how much better Thunderball was by direct comparison.",Thunderball
50,KineticSeoul,More action and even has the hottest Bond girl,7,27 January 2016,"This fourth outing by Sean Connery is still a formidable Bond film in the franchise.

The whole villain having a shark tank or swimming pool for people that crosses his path thing did stand out though. And also the scene with the electrocution chair for one of the members in SPECTRE. This film is entertaining in a lot of areas, while incorporating quite a bit of action sequences into the equation. I wouldn't be shocked if James Cameron directed this installment because the main set pieces and where most of the action and investigation takes place is under water. There is even a battle sequence at the end with bunch of harpoons that is done quite well despite the cinematography being quite choppy and all over the place. I will admit it's pretty much outdated when it comes to today's standards. I also think quite a bit of movies and video games that came after this borrowed certain elements when it comes to going on missions underwater and such. It even has the hottest and most attractive Bond girl in the franchise, Domino played by Claudine Auger.7.4/10",Thunderball
51,OllieSuave-007,"Bond, James Bond!",9,4 March 2014,"After a Nata Vulcan Bomber carrying two atomic bombs crashes in the Caribbean, SPECTRE informs the British Government that it had hijacked the plane's cargo and made a ransom of 100 million pounds, or else, a major England city or the U.S. would be made barren. MI6 turns to James Bond (Sean Connery) for help, and he heads to The Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi).Armed with secret and bizarre gadgets and an armor of deadpan humor, one-liners and wits, Connery shines once again as the suave but reckoned Agent 007, battling villain after villain in the Disco Volante, the floating fortress. Mixed in with the chaotic fun is the villainous Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) and the seductive Domino Derval (Claudine Auger).The action, thrills and splendid special effects of the 007 films continue with this movie, and the exciting and entertaining factor of this film really signaled that the Bond franchise continues to sore to new heights.Grade A",Thunderball
52,thesar-2,Without Thunder or Balls,5,3 March 2013,"They must've known there would be another two dozen Bond movies because by Part IV, or Thunderball, they're taking their sweet time.While better than the first two, Dr. No and From Russia with Love, but nowhere near the exciting adventure of Goldfinger, this chapter was simply, just there. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Although it's the longest of the so-far Bond features, the script felt like just one chapter of a novel and it would be one you'd want to get through quickly.Thunderball, or the codename operation to reclaim two nukes, has the least complex plot to date (of 1965) and yet it's stretched out amongst too many minutes and females. The eeevil SPECTRE's back with the cat-petting, no face #1, and quite straightforwardly, they want more money. For today's standards, the enormously easy theft of two nukes would be a joke, but I'm guessing back in the mid-1960s, kids still hid under tables to avoid the aftershock of a nuclear blast.Enter in what has to be the most inept spy since Inspector Clouseau – I mean, what spy drops his gun and alerts the baddies of his whereaboutsreally? – Bond, kinda, sorta figures out what's going on with the nukes. But, this was just to lead us to an overlong underwater fight segment where Bond uses a 4-minute air supply Q-gadget for roughly 15-minutes.This really is a throw-away chapter and, again, not terrible – I didn't find myself bored as in Bond's first two ""adventures,"" but I didn't relish in any great scene and only laughed at one of his lines (after the dance) and one of his scenes: think shoes and a bathtub. That, I admit, was good.Too bad the rest of the film didn't equate that amount of fun. Well, here's to You Only Live Twice(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",Thunderball
53,StrictlyConfidential,Certainly Not What I Was Expecting From James Bond,4,6 April 2020,"""Thunderball"" is now 55-very-painfully-obvious-years-old - And, as I patiently sat and watched it, I repeatedly kept asking myself - Was this film's preposterous story really supposed to be taken with a straight face? Were its screenwriters actually laughing behind the backs of their audience when they wrote the script?'Cause (from where I was sitting) I viewed ""Thunderball"" strictly as being a ""secret agent"" movie spoof. Yep. Its story-line, to me, was so fraudulently laughable in nature that (for it to work for me) it would have to be taken as a parody of the genre. It's true.",Thunderball
54,gridoon,The quintessential Bond movie in some aspects....but still flawed,6,26 June 2007,"In some ways, ""Thunderball"" is one of the best Bond films ever made: the title song, the entire music score and the photography are first-rate, the dialogue has a lot of wit (""Don't worry, I'll call the chef!""), Connery gives perhaps his most confident and charismatic performance as 007, the good girl Claudine Auger is, like the other French Bond girls Carole Bouquet and Sophie Marceau, gorgeous, and the evil girl Luciana Paluzzi is delicious (""But I may not be in the mood later"", a man tells her. ""You wanna bet?"", she replies). On the other hand, Adolfo Celi is not one of the most memorable Bond villains - he can be cruel and he can be suave, but that's about it. His henchmen are no Oddjobs either (in fact, Luciana is the most interesting villainous presence in the movie, along with Blofeld, whose voice we hear but whose face we do not see). But the biggest problem with ""Thunderball"" are its long, tedious and chaotic underwater scenes. The film on the whole lacks the tight, economic structure of ""Goldfinger"" - it was the first Bond movie to run over 2 hours, beginning a trend that was followed by almost all of the series entries that came after it, usually not to their benefit. (**1/2)",Thunderball
55,Robert_duder,Bond goes under cover...under the cover of water...a different spin,7,21 April 2008,"In my continuing new found fascination with James Bond I watched Thunderball. I don't think it quite has the legendary status as some of other Connery's Bond films like Goldfinger and it wasn't quite up to par with some of the others I have seen either like the aforementioned Goldfinger or Dr. No BUT it definitely has some distinguishable qualities to it. First of all so much of this film involves underwater stunts and scenes underwater and not a lot of films do that when the entire idea of the film is not under water. It takes action to a new level below the sea and that is a very cool idea. The story is decent and understandable and easy to follow, we find out some more details about the organization Bond works for (like that there are other double 0 agents working), it has a memorable villain in Largo with his dastardly eye patch, and some really great action sequences. In fact Thunderball might have the most action thus far in the Bond films before it. However I still didn't think it had quite the same flare or feel than the previous films. Bond wasn't quite the ladies man that he usually is but he did seem a little tougher around the edges as well during his fight scenes. Thunderball also marks itself as being the most violent in the series thus far as well.Sean Connery returns to the role of none other than James Bond. Connery is still my favorite Bond so far. He just completely embodies the role and I will be sad to move on to another Bond when I get past his films. Connery is legendary in the role and I think he set the bar for all future Bonds. Claudine Auger is the latest Bond girl and she perhaps has the most significant role out of any of the Bond girls and yet I found her almost boring in the role. Her and Connery had zero chemistry and she was so dull in the role sadly. Adolfo Celi plays the latest Bond Villain and number 2 in the SPECTRE organization. He is a memorable villain although doesn't match Dr. No or Goldfinger in my mind. And he doesn't really have any notable henchman per se. Still he is a good adversary and does a good job at being bad. Bernard Lee returns as no nonsense ""M"" and Lois Maxwell returns briefly as Miss Moneypenny. The role of casual Bond partner, CIA Agent Felix Leiter is played decently by Rik Van Nutter. I wish they had one actor stick to the role because he changes a lot.If there is one solid reason to watch Thunderball it is the final battle at the end of the film in the last fifteen minutes. This scene might be first of all the best end battle of any film ever, and it is one of the coolest movie scene in history. The bad guys decked out in black (of course) including the head guy Largo are all under water in full scuba gear. They are ambushed by good guys who parachute from the sky into the sea in full Scuba gear and bright Orange and a battle...a war between them breaks out using harpoon guns, knives and fists. Bond gets in the mix and the result is the coolest under water fight I have ever seen that continues on for a good ten, fifteen minutes. A guy gets a rod in the eye, people are getting harpooned everywhere, people are drowning, bodies everywhere...it's just wicked cool. Everything builds up to this scene and it's really quite astounding. Terence Young directs the film returning after the less than stellar outing of From Russia With Love but he redeems himself with this decent Bond installment. I know that sometimes the Bond films move into a little bit of the cheesy dialog and action and some cheesy special effects from time to time but part of the problem with Thunderball is some of the action and scenes seemed especially cheesy. But then there is plenty of action and explosions, a little light on the story but it definitely is worthy of the Bond name. 7.5/10",Thunderball
56,Lejink,Th(under-water) ball,7,4 November 2010,"The IMDb average of 7 out of 10 seems just about right for this mid-60's Bond feature, being not quite in the top echelon of classic Bond, but better than most. Great title for a start, even if the title song's a bit limp - John Barry was to up his game on this score with the succeeding title song to ""You Only Live Twice"" and the great chase music to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".The film entertains more than it pulsates and is probably too long by 20 minutes or so. Connery however was by now spot-on with his characterisation and even with the toupee, looks as good as he could physically in the part. He gets ample opportunity to womanise, deliver tart one-liners and utilise Q's new paraphernalia (amazing how every item that gets introduced somehow finds a way to get used later in the plot!).Claudine Auger is fine as this movie's Bond girl, although she seems markedly younger than earlier prototypes (think Ursula Andress or Honor Blackman) while Adolfe Celi makes a good villain, Largo, who even though he makes ample use of his failed confederates as shark food, yet just seems to lack that little bit of extra sadism or devil that Goldfinger or Blofeld demonstrated so memorably.The direction is slick and pretty, although the film does get bogged down with its preponderance of underwater fights - very hard to make their natural sluggishness seem action-filled, although there is compensation in some defter touches elsewhere - I particularly liked the underwater signifying of the tryst between Bond and Auger's Domino, their passion demonstrated with a froth of bubbles escaping above them to the surface. Perhaps lacking the memorable set-pieces of say ""Goldfinger"" or ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""Thunderball"" is still good quality Bond and rarely show its age.",Thunderball
57,bowmanblue,Bond takes his first stumble,6,12 September 2014,"Okay, I'll admit it... as much of a die-hard Bond fan that I am, I have never liked Thunderball. Dr No was an amazing start, From Russia With Love improved on it and Goldfinger was possibly the best Bond of the Connery era. Then came Thunderball which, in my opinion, is the worst (yes, even behind Diamonds are Forever).It's just too slow and too long. Although, when I check the running time, it's not that much longer than other Bond movies (past and present). It just feels much longer. Some of the 'action' scenes are painfully slow - largely because 'underwater' features heavily in the film's plot (about Spectra trying to blackmail the world governments using nuclear weapons). What you get is 'action' scenes set underwater, therefore they're - by definition - slow moving and it's hard to tell who's who with all the scuba gear. They just go on forever and should have been cut (in my humble opinion).I would leave it there by saying that Thunderball is my least favourite Connery Bond film, however, upon reading the other reviews, I find that I'm actually in the minority. Most people seem to love it. Maybe I'm missing something, so, if you're a Bond fan, I guess you have to watch it for yourself and see. Personally, I'm skipping this one and going straight to Never Say Never Again.",Thunderball
58,ThomasDrufke,Water-logged,5,1 October 2015,"Most of the James Bond films follow the same format but with a slightly different villain and love interests for 007 to go after. Thunderball is a vastly different film than any film in the entire franchise. This is perhaps one of the more controversial of the series because to me and other people, this really isn't a Bond movie at all. Sure, he's going after yet another henchmen or 'number' from Spectre, but the feel and aesthetic that Bond movies have, is not here at all.To begin with, 007 rarely ever shoots his own gun in the film. In fact, it isn't until nearly an hour and a half into the film that he uses his gun. But even that was as a distraction for the villains. A trademark of the franchise is the action sequences and in the tension and intensity they bring to the screen. The underwater sequences look cool, but I wasn't all that nervous for any of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the visuals and cinematography is borderline breath-taking and very deserving of an Oscar for visual effects. I just don't like the idea of a James Bond film 75 percent underwater.I will say I don't think the music has ever been better than Thunderball. The opening credits song was fine, but the score is slightly different this time around and it was incredibly effective. Other than that, Thunderball has a clichéd villain (he even has an eye patch), boring action sequences, forgettable Bond girls, and an unrealistic climax. I give the people behind the camera credit for trying something different, being the 4th of the franchise, but it just fell flat to me.+Score+Breath-taking visuals underwater-But why is Bond underwater so much in the first place?-Bland villain-Tired of Spectre henchmen5.8/10",Thunderball
59,cricketbat,Bond wants to show off his budget,7,22 January 2020,"Thunderball had a bigger budget than the three previous Bond movies combined, and it shows. However, while the larger budget allowed for on-location shooting in the Bahamas and innovative underwater sequences, it also feels like the filmmakers wanted to show off a bit and let the scenes and the story run a little long. This is an entertaining spy flick, but it could have used a little trimming.",Thunderball
60,secondtake,"See it as just a movie and it is flawed, or as a Bond film and it is, well, James Bond",6,9 April 2011,"Thunderball (1965)Well, I've never been a James Bond ""fan"" so maybe take that into account when I say this is a fairly routine movie, awkwardly paced and oddly written. I will say I have read all of the Ian Fleming books as a kid, however, so maybe I was once rather a fan indeed, though an adolescent one. And I've seen all the early movies over time for various reasons. If you like the franchise, the brand known as Bond, James Bond, you might enjoy even the least interesting adaptation, because there are all the familiar trademarks in this fair to pretty good Bond film: the suave spy man of action, the sex-object women (very 1965 style, heads up on that), the quasi-futuristic plots and devices, the impossibility of the situation, and the exotic locales.There is also a lot of underwater footage that is well done--clear, dramatic, and eventually (for the final scenes) almost comic in the reference to a police raid, with guys raising their hands to be arrested while wearing scuba gear. There are a couple atom bombs in the plot, and so ""Thunderball"" falls into that amazing one or two years of obsession by Hollywood (and the real world) with nuclear annihilation. In fact, one of the things the movie has going for it is it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the people who think a Bond movie is a Jason Bourne movie who get off on the wrong track.Sean Connery is no small talent, and if his career has been hobbled by being 007, it has been lifted by it as well. And he in turn lifted it, the James Bond aura, permanently, so even the lesser Bonds over the years (I hear the debate among you) have something going for them because of these first versions, all featuring Connery.Frankly, I shouldn't have expected much and been happily surprised by what worked. Instead I expected a cheesy, glossy, seductive, and clever entertainment and it didn't quite rise to those modest goals. It's not a horrible film except in feminist terms (and it really is horrible in its depiction of women, no doubt about it). But it's not a great movie, and not quite the best of the Bond movies, either. I think ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love"" are clearly better, or more archetypal, and even ""Dr. No"" has its benefit as the first.",Thunderball
61,CuriosityKilledShawn,Not much going on here,6,30 March 2006,"Thunderball may have nice locations and pretty seaside scenery but there's a shocking lack in set pieces or excitement.The evil SPECTRE organisation nicks a warplane and lands it in the ocean. Within minutes they've spirited away the nuclear warheads and are demanding a ransom or they'll blow up a major city. Sounds like Broken Arrow huh? Well the British Government are none too happy about this so they send 007 after them. Bond has been 'relaxing' at some sort of health farm where the culprits just so happened to be doing evil deeds so he's already way ahead of the game.Off he goes to the Bahamas (how come super-villains never have lairs in Liverpool or Coventry?) to track the missing plane down and, with any luck, get the warheads back. But not before he scuba dives about a zillion times, goes to the casino and shags loads of women. Isn't he on a time limit here?His gadgets are not THAT fancy, the action not THAT impressive but maybe I'm guilty of double standards here. I've always thought that the latest Bond movies were guilty of being nothing but spectacle and loads of SFX. They don't feel real and are increasingly being pushed into sci-fi rather than super-spy. So if you've had enough of the xXx style Die Another Day, something Thunderball will balance it out.But there are better Bonds than this, though it does have some nice widescreen photography and the constant sunny seaside locations will make you want to go on holiday immediately.",Thunderball

63,callanvass,The only thing this has going for it is the strong acting & beautiful cinematography. The rest is an overlong bore in my opinion,5,14 September 2013,"It's ironic. Never Say Never Again is essentially a remake of this film, and people hail it as one of the worst Bond films (Technically. It's not an official film of the Bond series. It's a standalone film.) The irony is that they are right. It is one of the worst Bond films, but it's actually BETTER than Thunderball. Thunderball does have some exciting action, but it's undermined by some painfully boring underwater sequences which really tested my patience. The cinematography is beautiful to look at, but even that gets boring when the underwater sequences are so dull with scuba scenes that failed to maintain my interest. The pacing is very leisurely at times, and the film suffers for it. Sean Connery is great as per usual, but not even he can perk up my interest in this. Claudine Auger is a classy Bond girl, no doubt about it. Adolfo Celi is one of the film's main strengths. I felt he was very cool as the villain. Final Thoughts: It is worth a watch, but the underwater sequences are very hard to get through, at least they were for me.

The construction is very clumsy, with a number of loose ends and little sense of coherence to the action. The film is too long; many of the early scenes could easily have been trimmed to improve flow. There are also numerous underwater scenes that, while advanced for its time, become tedious due to poor editing, especially the muddled, climactic battle scene that seems to go on forever, sapping all excitement. Connery is smooth and there's the usually bevy of beautiful women, but this sloppy entry is definitely inferior to its predecessor, ""Goldfinger.""",Thunderball
65,The-Sarkologist,James Bond has Finally come of age,9,27 December 2012,"The one question that I ask when I come to these early James Bond films is whether one could actually create such a character in today's climate and get away with it. The reason I say this is that James Bond is such a womaniser. We see him eying of beautiful women as they pass, slapping them on the butt, and even tricking them into having sex with him. In fact, in this film, one of the antagonists mentions James Bond's habit of sleeping with a woman and having them switch sides (which is no doubt a reference to Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, who did just that).James Bond has seriously come of age by this film, and Sean Connery has easily fallen into his character. In fact by this time we notice that the one liner's that Connery slyly speaks seem to not only come natural, but rival even the classic one liner's of Arnold Swartzenegger. In fact I would even suggest that Arnie is simply trying to be one up on Connery but failing abysmally.SPECTRE is back and they have stolen two atomic bombs and are planning on holding the NATO powers hostage. They plan to blow up a random city is ten million pounds in diamonds are not paid at a certain time, which also means that Bond is on a race against time to find the bombs and stop the bad guys. Here we have Bond back as the detective, but he has gone further than in Doctor No because we also have the big fight between lots of people at the end (which first appeared in Goldfinger). He also has his Aston Martin at the start as well (no doubt having been fixed after he smashed it up in Switzerland in Goldfinger).Interestingly we also not only have the exotic locations but also the luxurious hotels and the expensive tastes. This apparently was something true of the actual spy world during the Cold War. In fact both Russian and American (as well as British) spies were allegedly living extravagant lifestyles all in the name of national security. In fact, I suspect a lot of them wanted the Cold War to go on forever so that they could continue living it up on tax payer money. I reckon that has got to beat living in dirty foxholes in the middle east.",Thunderball

The entire pre credits sequence is just full of holes. The movies ending (a huge underwater battle) is pretty dull. It is over two hours and at times it really feels like it. There is lot that could have easily being cut and the movie would not have missed a beat. It has some truly awful greenscreen and rear projection. Henchmen have Stormtrooper aim and Emile Largo was an incredibly dull villain.Also, some of the things in it have really not fared too well!!

Luciana Paluzzi is a great femme fatale whilst Ken Adams production design is absolutely brilliant and Connery, well he could play this role in his sleep by this point, but he is as cool and suave as ever. I also liked it was Domino who killed Largo (saving Bond from certain death) instead of Bond.John Stears won the franchises second Oscar for Best Visual Effects.Thunderball became the highest grossing Bond movie as it made $63 million on a $5 million dollar budget, to be the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1965.

70,johnnyboyz,"Water water everywhere, but barely a drop to drink; nor, indeed, is there much in the way of substance to get into.",5,17 July 2013,"Terence Young's crack at a Bond film, in Thunderball, is just having too much fun on its own to double check as to whether we're still enjoying the party. Most notably for me, this is the first Bond film to formally drop the ball – something which was being threatened with each passing minute from around the hour mark of Goldfinger and has here burst forth into a torrent of overly used second unit material; poor atmospherics; bad pacing and generally weak levels of antagonism. I suppose it had to happen eventually, but there doesn't seem to be much energy to this entry; much urgency – people are spending too much time under the Bahaman sun and it's stifling them. Where the frame should be dripping with this tension born out of an impending deadline, there is a stoic and clammy feel to things; a degree of repetition. You might say that when the stakes go higher, the interest wanes where the assumption is it should intensify. Watching Bond investigate the death of a fellow overseas operative or being caught up in a plot to do with a Soviet encoder may not have the same enigmatic 'ring' that trying to stop World War Three does, but it's a damn sight more interesting.Then there is the water. Water plays a large part in Thunderball. This is not the Bond film for the aquaphobes among us - has indeed anyone mentioned that there is a lot of water in this film? Sequence after sequence, scene after scene set beneath the waves wherein people swim; glance; investigate and, on occasion, both fight and murder those in close proximity to them. From the moment the camera is drenched with the liquid that spews forth from the rear of James Bond's automobile during his successful evasion from some baddies during the opening, we are practically inundated with our beloved Hydrogen-squared-over-Oxygen for the rest of the picture. As it was with those aforementioned crooks during the film's pre-titles sequence, the happening is, with hindsight, a sort of slap in the face for the audience all unto itself: an announcing that there will be an awful lot of this on your screen for the next two hours, so buckle up and get used to it.We begin, following the opening salvo, in Paris and with a cross dissolve involving blue and red fountains of water streams filling in with the white/grey of a Parisian street as we open in France to the French colours. Neat. There enters the frame the villain of the piece, Emile Largo (Celi), who parks his car; waltzes nonchalantly across the road and into a building occupied by people being barracked at by the French authorities over varying issues. Above such meagre matters, Largo continues on down the corridors before he reaches a board room preordained by SPECTRE, the recurrent terrorist cell charged with facilitating all the grief thus far in the franchise and seemingly providing Bond with a living.The blunt fact of the matter is that Largo is a poor villain; a podgy, one eyed thug who isn't even so much a villain as much as he is an overly-qualified henchman to the SPECTRE organisation in the first place. At this crucial time in the film, as we're introduced to whom it is Bond will be up against, it is a betrayal within SPECTRE which reminds us of their cutting, brutal efficiency where Largo can merely stand around and provide a brief lecture on an up-coming plan. Largo is, in fact, so poor that I indeed had to remind myself of whom HIS henchman was. If we're going down this route of gadgets; girls; locations; villains and their backup as a means to really get involved in a Bond film, then why is Largo himself no more than a droll rent-a-thug who possesses a nondescript back up lackey in Vargas? A better villain is Fiona Volpe (Paluzzi), a quite stunning visual specimen whose sexual appeal; aggression and involvement, epitomised when they are clay pigeon shooting and she puts him in his place with a series of lines of dialogue, has her stand out more.The plan this time involves some neat back-story revolving around a top fighter jet pilot; his kidnapped sister Domino (Auger) and the transportation of some nuclear devices, devices of which eventually fall into Largo's hands as he and SPECTRE hold the West to ransom. Fortunately, Bond has a lead on account of his time spent at a health clinic and it isn't long until he's in Nassau looking to crack the case. Unfortunately, however, is the manner in which the whole thing comes across as quite flat. There is little sense of two sides warring with one another that there was in Jamaica or Istanbul as before, while the locale of Nassau with its bikini-clad women and photogenic nature undercuts the severity of the situation just as setting a neo-noir in somewhere such as Monte Carlo or Las Vegas often undermines the harsh, unremitting atmosphere of said genre with a frothier, warmer, bouncier tone. It's easy to admire the craft of it, but the second unit material is often overwhelming - so much so that by the time the huge fight between good and evil arrives at the very end, we're so worn out by the preceding hundred minutes that it's all too much of a muchness. There's too much of an in-betweener feel about Thunderball, like it was hurried or rushed; like the producers focused too much on what made the backgrounds of the preceding films so likable without any attention paid to the fore.",Thunderball

In this film, the franchise reaches the maturity after the consecration with ""Goldfinger"". The participation of McClory seems strange but, in fact, it's the result of a legal conflict, prior to the production.In this film, the British secret agent is admitted to a nursing home when he finds out, by sheer luck, a conspiracy to rob a French jet with two nuclear bombs. Not having been able to prevent it, Bond is sent to the Bahamas in order to contact the sister of the late pilot of the missing plane and obtain more information.

Bond escapes all assassination attempts and find the missing plane, as well as the enemy's plans and his connection to the terrorist organization SPECTRE, the same that Bond had already been fighting since the previous films.In this film, Sean Connery got a perfect interpretation of his James Bond. Rude, a little hard with the opposite sex but always seductive, he marked for decades the idea of the public on how Bond should be. In addition to the idyllic scenery of the Caribbean, the film brings us some curious machines, continuing a tradition which was closely associated to the 007 imaginary. It is the case of the jet-bag used in the opening scenes, the armored-boat used by the villain in the final chase or the respiratory device used by Bond in some of the underwater scenes that made this movie famous. However, in my opinion, one of the reasons why this movie has reached excellence is the relevance of its central subject, a subject that, at that time, was very present in society: the danger of a nuclear attack. We must have in mind that the missile crisis in Cuba happened a few years before the film was released and the whole society, both in the US and in Europe, lived under the imminent danger of a missile war.James Bond and the characters M, Q and Monneypenny were embodied by the same actors from the previous films. To these artists joined Claudine Auger (in the role of bond-turned, Domino), Luciana Paluzzi (in the role of assassin Fiona Volpe) and Adolfo Celi (in the role of villain, Largo).",Thunderball
72,pmtelefon,Top shelf Bond,9,27 February 2020,"""Thunderball"" never fails to hit the spot. This movie is a lot of fun. It has a very good story, some great dialogue, a beautiful setting, great action and a very strong villain. It also has some of the best Bond girls ever. They're all stunningly beautiful. The only demerit this movie gets has to do with the fast motion moments. They don't really bother me that much but they do come off as kind of dated. Otherwise, ""Thunderball"" is a rock solid Bond movie.",Thunderball

A huge underwater fight takes place, which I admit was exciting, but the rest of the film was a drag. The fight in the runaway boat was totally contrived looking, and none of the combatants bled a drop. A lousy book turned into a lousy film.

The unappreciated forced kiss n blackmailing into having sex is downright pathetic.,4,1 December 2020,"I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs. Aft revisiting it recently, i found it to be boring with the repetitive underwater scenes. I also found the character of Bond in this film very obnoxious n habitual molester.This Bond gets the lowest rating from me.This is the fourth in the Bond series and Connery reprises his role of James Bond for the fourth time.Here Bond's mission is to find two atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE, which holds the world for ransom of £100 million under its threat to destroy major cities in the UK or the US. The mission leads Bond to the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo, SPECTRE Number 2.In this movie, Bond gets to cool off with Claudine Auger, the voluptuous Luciana Paluzzi n Molly Peters (famous for the steam room sex scene. She was the first Bond girl to appear nude - in silhouette behind frosted glass.)Here Bond faces Largo, attack from sharks n gets tortured on a motorised traction table for stretching the spine but gets unwanted thrusting movements.Mayb he deserved the punishment for being a molester. From a modern perspective, earlier Bond films potrayed Bond as a molester n habitual forceful kisser.In this movie, Bond blackmails the nurse into having sex by keeping quiet regarding the machine negligence.Bond forces an unappreciated kiss on the poor nurse.Another poor soul, the nuclear physicist Ladislav Kutze saves Domino but he is never allowed in the lifeboat and later when Bond and Domino are retrieved by a plane, Kutze is left stranded in the shark infested waters.Some info about Largo from the book, his iconic black eye patch over his left eye is nevr explained in the book too.",Thunderball

76,Movie_Muse_Reviews,'Thunderball' takes Bond to a new level in entertainment,8,21 July 2013,"It's go big or go home for Ian Fleming's James Bond in ""Thunderball,"" his fourth film adventure in as many years. Producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli (though uncredited in this film due to a lawsuit) threw incredible money into this ""Bond"" film, more than the first three combined. That doesn't make ""Thunderball"" better, but it does make it the first most lavish ""Bond"" entry and an exciting one in ways new to the franchise.The ""Thunderball"" story leaves a little to be desired, but essentially, SPECTRE is back in action with No. 2, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), leading the charge. His plan is to hijack a NATO plane armed with nuclear weapons and essentially hold the world at ransom. Bond must travel to Nassau, Bahamas in order to find the carefully hidden nukes.""Thunderball"" ups the sum of gadgets and ladies, as you might expect from a massive budget. There are three women you might count as Bond girls: his assistant Paula (Martine Beswick), the femme fatale Fiona (Luciana Paluzzi) and the endangered love interest, Domino (Claudine Auger) among others. Bond also sexually harasses them and arguably rapes one of them by today's definitions, but that's the '60s for you.Q (Desmond Llewelyn) stocks Bond up with underwater breathing devices, a jetpack an underwater jetpack and more. The script does a good job of sneaking in the times when Bond must use them, which makes the movie that much more exciting. These toys add to the entertainment value, even if at times it feels as though ""Bond"" is slipping out of the thriller genre and completely into this action-spy territory.Everything culminates in a lengthy underwater harpoon and knife battle royale between Largo's SPECTRE cronies and U.S. forces. For 1965, this must've been exhaustive to film. Truthfully, no matter how you feel about ""Thunderball"" in the grand scheme of ""Bond"" films, you have to count this scene among the most impressive sequences in franchise history.Many of the film's other parts move slowly or don't seem to add much; there are lots of characters to account for in this story. CIA agent Felix Leiter, played by yet another actor in Rik Van Nutter, serves only to get Bond out of jams. Bond jumps from woman to woman as well, which makes it hard to fall for Auger, the central Bond girl. She has her own motives in the story at least, but she's really just someone for Bond to make out with on a life raft in the end.""Thunderball"" really ups the entertainment factor for the ""Bond"" franchise, moving these films toward the next echelon of spy movie. Terence Young, who returns after directing the first two films but skipping ""Goldfinger"" (how do you blame him for not wanting to make four films in four consecutive years?) shows he can handle the bigger budget and still make Bond gritty and real in spite of the story thrusting him into larger-than-life heroics.The middle portion of the film might be an unmemorable blur, but as an action film, ""Thunderball"" is shoulders above the previous entries.~Steven CThanks for reading!

78,funkyfry,A Thunderous Bore,2,13 July 2007,"Thunderball  as if the name itself wasn't ridiculous enough, they had to go and make a movie. And although I guess it probably pleases the hardcore James Bond fanbase  after all, it's one of the ones with Connery  for me it is a near-complete bore. I'm not a fan of the films in general but I can sit through most of the Connery ones and a few of the Moore ones and have a good time. This movie just gets tired really fast. There's absolutely nothing new or original going on same type of bad guys steal a nuke and ""hold the world for ransom"", Bond can find said supervillains hanging out at a resort in some exotic place, and good looking women who will probably betray James Bond (who never seems too surprised, nor should he). As in all James Bond films, the action peaks at the appropriate time but the movie goes on for another 30 minutes to make sure the audience has seen enough exploding boats and airplanes to feel they got their money's worth.There's some very lovely ladies, of course. Martine Beswick (who I saw earlier this week in an Italian Western, incidentally) is the most fun to me because her character is sort of sneaky and unpredictable (relatively speaking). Luciana Paluzzi is really lovely but it was hard to buy her as a tough gal.Based on the huge and seemingly undiminished popularity of the franchise I guess this movie probably supplies everything necessary for a good night at the movies, but for me this one is particularly dull even compared to the average James Bond film. People rave about Ricou Browning's underwater photography but for me these long slow motion underwater fights are basically water torture. What can you say about a movie where the audience applauds because a boat split itself in half? I think I can understand why people like these movies  all the girls, action, gadgets, etc. For the ladies, there's always Connery's hairy torso, which also drew applause from the audience last night. In the best of cases these things are enough to distract and entertain the audience for a few hours. But ""Thunderball"", being a bit sub-par and a bit tired-out, really shows up the essential weaknesses in the formula for me anyway. James Bond is the most dull character in the movies  he never changes his character. Heck he never even changes what drink he likes or what clothes he wears or what card games he plays. Maybe in this ""ever changing world in which we're livin'"" that provides some comfort. But it's far from compelling for this movie fan.",Thunderball
79,Anonymous_Maxine,The best installment of the series.,9,30 July 2001,"Thunderball is definitely the best Bond film of the entire series, followed closely by the excellent Goldfinger. The influence that this movie had on Never Say Never Again is very clear in both form and content, and as good as that film is, Thunderball is far superior. You get the traditional plot of a super villain stealing atomic weapons and holding the world hostage for a tremendous ransom, but at least it was done in a creative way. While the plane crash that resulted in the hijacked nuclear weapons was not very convincingly done, the whole situation with the clone killing his co-pilots and crash landing the plane in the water, etc, was pretty damn creative.
The way that the whole operation took place underwater was good, even though the muted underwater climax of the film was not as effective as it should have been, but at least it was better than the underwater climax of Never Say Never Again. On a more general note, though, it is the fascinating andintricate story that makes Thunderball such a good installment in the Bond series, as well as excellently created tension throughout the film. Sure, there were a few weaknesses here and there, such as the fact that the hijacked nuclear weapons had the moronic phrase `Handle like eggs' stenciled on the side, as well as the below average traditional one-liners during the movie. Some of the one-liners were good, but then there were stupid ones like `I think he got the point,' and `See you later, irrigator.'
With the limited technology available in 1965, the special effects and the action were especially effective, as was the quality scene with Q introducing the newest series of Bond's new high tech toys. There is also the unusual quality (at least in a Bond film) of using a cinematic technique in order to achieve a particular response. Normally, the Bond movies are straightforward action films that require little to no film knowledge in order to understand or fully appreciate them, but in this film, there were things like the excellent use of shadows late in the film that were used to create very effective tension. Also, there was some extremely fast paced editing done several times in the film that was in the same style as during the infamous murder scene in Psycho, although not nearly at that level of skill and precision.As is almost always the case with most Bond films, the opening theme song was pretty bad, although not nearly as awful as those that bombard the ears before other movies like The Man With The Golden Gun and Goldfinger. But despite its many weaknesses, Thunderball still stands high above most other Bond films. There is a great chase scene that takes place in a parade, and it's a good thing too, because it follows an escape that is just dumb. Bond is in a car with all the bad guys, and as some guy leans into the car trying to sell a bottle of wine, Bond breaks it and uses the villain girl's lighter to ignite it, at which point it explodes into a fireball like GASOLINE. No drinkable alcohol in the world would burn like that, and of those that burn at all, they only give off the slightest flame. But luckily, the chase scenes alone can more than make up for garbage like this. Besides the parade scene I already mentioned, there is also a surprisingly believable escape from a shark infested pool, which was thankfully able to avoid the old cliché of Bond being left alone to die an unlikely death after having just been given some crucial piece of information by the villain. In this film, he's trapped under a metal pool cover not only and left to drown, but the villain also releases sharks into the pool.Thunderball not only has the best tension filled chase scenes of the entire series, but it also stars one of the best Bond girls, Claudine Auger as Domino, who ranks up there with other excellent Bond girls like Kim Basinger from Never Say Never Again and, of course, Ursula Andress as the charmingly named Honey Ryder from Dr. No. The underwater battle at the end of the film was ironically one of the best action scenes in the entire movie, although it's strange that the editing in the rest of the movie was so good, whereas here, it is badly messed up. There are countless editing flaws during this still good sequence, the most obvious of which is probably the fact that at one point, Bond gets his bright blue face mask pulled off, so he grabs a black one off of a dead enemy and puts it on (you can't do that underwater, by the way), and in the shots that follow he is wearing the black one, then the blue one, then the black one again, and then back to the blue one! This wouldn't have been so obvious if his mask hadn't been so bright blue, but luckily it didn't take much away from the scene as a whole.
(spoilers) Unfortunately, the ending of Thunderball is far inferior to the rest of the film, and not only because it has yet another ending that takes place with Bond and the Bond girl in a boat at sea. It's fine that a plane flew by a dropped an inflatable raft in the water for them, but when it flew by again and grabbed the line hooked to a balloon floating above the little raft and yanked the two of them out of the boat, all credibility was lost. There's just no way that could happen, and then they have the dilemma of landing, because Bond and the girl can't be reeled into the plane by that hook. But despite crap like this, Thunderball is about as good as Bond gets.",Thunderball

81,generationofswine,An Honest Reveiw,10,3 November 2020,"This is certainly the last of the classic 007 films. This is the last time we see 007 as the cold hearted assassin that he is. The last time we see a Bond that, the only reason he's really a good guy is because of what side he is on and not what he is.In later films they call him a blunt instrument, but in this film he actually still is. He's still the trigger man. He still has no respect for human life and is only really concerned about the mission.After this we enter the era of Silly 007, with a layover for Lazenby who walked the line and ended up more Cannery than Moore. And as where the Silly Bonds do still have their appeal (and trust me, I still love them) the franchise never seemed as lethal or as cool again.But, rest assured, this is also the 007 where Special Effects and over-the-top stunts made their introduction and would later become a much loved 007 trope.So it stands as a bridge between classic and contemporary 007, and as much as I love them both, I like the classic 007 just a little more.",Thunderball

83,ackstasis,"""I hope we didn't frighten the fish""",7,31 October 2009,"Having just started reading my first Ian Fleming novel (""Goldfinger""), I was in the mood for some 007. I decided to watch Terence Young's third and final contribution to the franchise – 'Thunderball (1965).' By now, the James Bond films had become a subgenre of their own: among the elements audiences could expect were megalomaniacal super-criminals, exotic locations, beautiful women, clever gadgets, and no shortage of sexual innuendo. Given that this is my first Bond film in a while, it got me thinking: what is the appeal? I think it's interesting that the franchise is considered the definitive spy series, when many of the films – even as early as 'Goldfinger (1964)' and 'Thunderball' – play more comfortably as satirical homages to the more straight-faced genre entries. I had thought that perhaps this was a cinematic invention, but, no, Fleming's original novels still boast characters with such ridiculous names as Pussy Galore, and instances of sexism and racism so blatant that he seems to be consciously mocking genre clichés.Like Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest (1959)' (a crucial precursor to the series), the Bond films are satirical of the thriller genre, but in a manner subtle enough not to detract emphasis from the characters and story (that is, of course, until the franchise became too breezy and self-referential for its own good). Importantly, the films arrived just as the grip of the Production Code was slackening, and Bond came to represent the heterosexual ideal – handsome, courageous until fire, and very successful with the opposite sex. Have I mentioned the beautiful women? Well, OK, write it down, and then underline it – in 'Thunderball,' they steal the show. There is an inescapable chauvinism in how Bond seduces his sexual partners. His treatment of nurse Patricia (Molly Peters), for example, goes well beyond sexual harassment. Strong, independent female characters are ground down by Bond's fiery charms, some almost bullied into sexual submissiveness. Despite his bigotry, or perhaps because of it, male viewers can't help but idolise Bond.The bulk of 'Thunderball' unfolds in the Bahamas, where 007 (Sean Connery) is sniffing out some British nuclear weapons hijacked by SMERSH's eyepatch-clad #2 man (Adolfo Celi). The film was produced on a greater budget than its predecessors, and it shows, with a good many of the action set-pieces (and even a particularly bewildering sexual encounter) unfolding entirely underwater. These sequences, no doubt, would have been extraordinarily difficult to orchestrate, but the idea itself is lacking. No amount of a skillful editing can hide the fact that underwater everything just moves so slowly. These scenes, at least, are compensated for by a virtuoso sequence in which a SMERSH operative ingeniously hijacks an armed military aircraft (in a set-up that probably inspired the prologue of Woo's 'Mission: Impossible II (2000)') and conceals it in the blackened depths of the ocean. With Sean Connery in top form, 'Thunderball' is worth a look, both as an entertaining spy adventure, and as a characteristic entry into the James Bond canon.",Thunderball

This installment leans a bit heavy on the costumes, wacky gizmos and one-line zingers, far more than any of the more-serious preceding chapters, but then, such is the franchise and it does get worse from here. Sean Connery is at the height of his powers at this point, completely enveloping the screen with his showy swagger and gruff confidence. It's a testament to his fitness for the part that he's able to deliver so many forced, corny lines and not just caress the stink off, but actually make them seem suave and witty.Thunderball's action is fair, though somewhat limited as an awful lot of it happens underwater, and dozens of colorful faces pop up on both sides of the struggle.

91,barnabyrudge,"Spectacular James Bond film, slightly too contrived to live up to the standard of its predecessors.",6,15 September 2006,"Thunderball is the fourth of the Bond films and was commercially the most successful of the Connery era. This film - not Dr. No -was originally planned as the first film to feature the British spy, with a screen story worked on by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. However, Fleming used elements of the screen story to create his novel Thunderball without giving what was felt to be due credit to his two collaborators, and the subsequent long and complicated legal dispute held back the production of this film. In spite of the tremendous public interest in the film, it is probably the weakest of the Bond films prior to Diamonds Are Forever. That's not to say Thunderball is a bad film, just that it doesn't quite hit the high standards set by the other films in the series made around that time.SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) steals two atomic bombs from a British Vulcan aircraft sabotaged in the Bahamas. The British Prime Minister soon thereafter receives a ransom note explaining that the bombs will be used to wipe out a British or an American city unless an extortionate pay-off is agreed. The Secret Service put James Bond (Sean Connery) on the assignment, sending him out to the Bahamas to find out who has the bombs and what their intended target is. Bond soon establishes that Largo is the mastermind behind the plot, but finds it much harder to actually locate the bombs. Aided by his American buddy Felix Leiter (Rik Van Nutter), Bond follows clues around the paradise islands hoping for a breakthrough in his mission. He eventually discovers that Largo has a mistress named Domino, and more interestingly finds out that her brother was murdered during the original theft of the bombs. He seduces Domino and tells her about her brother's murder, thereby getting her onto his side rather than Largo's. With her help, Bond soon learns that Miami is the intended target of the SPECTRE plot, and goes after Largo aboard his private yacht before his sinister scheme can be carried out.Thunderball has plenty of amusing action and some gorgeous locations. The women in the film are more resourceful and independent than earlier Bond girls. The film also gives us one of the better villains from the series in the shape of Emilio Largo, menacingly portrayed by Celi. Where it comes undone is that the story is terribly uninspired and the film is somewhat overlong (this was the first Bond film to go beyond the two hour mark, and was lengthier than any of its predecessors by a good quarter of an hour). To make matters worse, the reliance on gadgetry becomes more intrusive than it did in any of the earlier films. Connery is good as the hero, but the newness of the role has worn off and there isn't that same enthusiasm that could be seen in his performances in the first three. Thunderball is a slick and spectacular action film, for sure. but it just has a soulless, ""packaged"" feel to it that makes it less impressive than the other 007 films of that time.",Thunderball
92,I_Ailurophile,What absolute dreck,2,5 January 2021,"While there are more than a few quite excellent entries in the series, trying to determine which James Bond film is the worst is an exercise in masochism. There's a lot of sludge to sift through in the franchise once you get below the top/best 5-10 films. If 'Thunderball' isn't at the very bottom, then it's very close.I rewatched this after realizing that I recalled almost nothing about it from whenever my last viewing was. As it turns out, I wasn't really missing anything. And already, even as I sit to write this, most of this sorry entry in the series has already slipped from memory.What do I remember? I certainly remember the spa scene fairly early in the film, which concludes with Bond coercing a woman into having sex with him. A moment that is treated with no greater seriousness than when Bond playfully slaps Moneypenny's rump. 007 is depicted at turns throughout the movies as a womanizing ghoul or a sexist cretin to varying degrees, frequently seducing women just because he can, but this is much worse. Even if we wave off his behavior in other movies as ""Haha! Boys will be boys!"" (and we certainly shouldn't), this is appalling.True, I also remember the polite yet forceful interplay between Bond and villain Emilio Largo. This is a classic instance of both protagonist and antagonist knowing very well who the other is, and what they're playing at, yet maintaining the facade out of professional courtesy, as well as both hubris and curiosity. It's one of the highlights of the film, by far. And yet--that sort of back-and-forth is hardly exclusive to 'Thunderball,' neither among Bond movies specifically nor among thrillers generally. As a result, it's not necessarily a huge selling point in this case.And then there's the regrettably unforgettable climax, which in my mind is perhaps the most unexciting of all the Bond films. The underwater fight seems to drag on for much longer than it does, and is further hindered by the very slow pace. For my part, I don't understand the point of the fight, from a narrative standpoint: the yacht was obviously the delivery vehicle for the bombs, so why not take it out first and then clean up the henchmen in the water afterwards? I get it, you don't want atom bombs going off if you can avoid it, even at a fair distance. But air-dropping agents into an underwater fight, instead of eliminating the yacht from the start, provided a delay that the villains could have (though didn't) take advantage of, at great cost.You know what else I remember though? I remember the dog. The dog who appears squarely in the middle of a parade when Bond is eluding his adversaries, and who urinates right on camera. That dog, who has nothing to do with the plot, is one of the most interesting things about 'Thunderball.' I want to know more about him. Did he belong to someone, or was he a stray? If he was a stray, what became of him after filming wrapped?""But wait,"" you ask, ""this movie is over 2 hours long. What about the rest of it?"" Well, that's just the point, isn't it? Good, bad--'Thunderball' just isn't terribly memorable. Some ideas from this could be spliced with bits from other weak Bond films and feasibly craft 1 movie that's better than all its parts, but that doesn't really help 'Thunderball's' case.Also not helpful: That the second, commonly overlooked adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel, 'Never say never again'--a production separate and distinct from the rest of the franchise--is actually the superior version.It's hardly possible to discuss 'Thunderball' without also discussing its little regarded sibling. And make no mistake, 'Never say never again' is a clear knock-off, possessing weaker music, production values, and acting. And yet NSNA also boasts better action sequences, including the climax, and underwater scenes are thankfully deemphasized. The spa scene, that in the more celebrated film is notable mostly for illustrating just how awful a person Bond is, plays out differently and better in the second run at the story. Neither film is very good, but I do rather think 'Never say never again' bests 'Thunderball.'Now, look. Storytelling is an art, and art is very subjective. Popularity is no great measure of quality, but I understand that my opinion here represents the minority view. 'Thunderball' is regarded very well. I just don't understand why. In my perspective, those things about it that are good are either not terribly memorable, or generally indistinct from many, many other movies. As such it's very easy for the bad aspects of this movie, that are certainly more memorable, to outweigh the nearly immaterial good.Whenever I next decide to rewatch some James Bond movies, I'm quite sure that I will be passing on 'Thunderball.'",Thunderball
93,Spondonman,Funderball,8,17 December 2012,"Is Thunderfinger a better film than Goldball? That question has perplexed me and others for decades and I'm still not 100% sure which is best. They're both classic Sean Connery James Bond's, with mid-60's outlandishness, inventiveness and innocence shining through holey, nonsensical and entertaining plots, and both have stood the test of time and generations of critical carping.Bond is having a rum time at a health spa – apparently he's too healthy for the female masseur – when a chain of events unfold leading to the unlikely hijack by SPECTRE of a NATO jet plane complete with 2 nuclear bombs on board. Their safe return will be on receipt of a GBP100 million ransom, but the chase is on to find them before the West has to cough up. There's plenty of action, movement, glamour, sex, all shot through with Connery's unerring witticisms, and nobody did it better. Favourite bits: the fun and games in the spa – a nice bit of interesting knockabout comedy; Bond temporarily stuck in the shark pool with a big chum; diving down to have a look at the interior of the downed plane – that spooked me when I was young; so many half-naked woman objects (with and without marks on their left thighs) – that spooks me now I'm old!But because the ground-breaking(?) underwater battle was rather drawn out, OK, almost interminable, I think Goldfinger still is the better film overall – both excellent, and both excellent bookend companions to each other. It was the 4th of Connery's 6 Bond outings - it was all downhill after this, not only for Connery but for the Bond franchise; I never saw Never Say Never Again because I did say that after seeing Moonraker.",Thunderball
94,davidmvining,Bond...Underwater!,4,29 January 2020,"The first word that comes to mind when thinking of Sean Connery's fourth outing as James Bond is ""tedious"". The second word is ""frantic"". That's a really odd combination, but Thunderball manages to pull it off. This is what I would call the first outright failure of the Bond films.It's also the first that's explicitly built around a gimmick. That gimmick is, of course, its underwater action scenes. Looking up the posters of the film for this post, I was struck at how even those blared on about the daring new location for Bond to take the action to, but the problem is that underwater actions scenes aren't...well...they aren't terribly exciting. There are two main problems with them. The first is that we generally can't see anyone's faces (there are a handful of exceptions) so it can be hard to tell who's doing what to whom (though the film does find ways around it from time to time). This can also deaden any expected emotional impact because we're robbed of the most efficient of human communication tools, the human face. The second problem is that people really just move slower when trying to push through water instead of air. This slows the basic actions of the action scene down to a crawl.Not to say that they're unsuccessful completely but that they operate at a handicap that they never quite overcome. The final confrontation between SPECTRE operatives and Navy SEALS gets it right from time to time, but it just compounds the cannon fodder problem of action scenes by building one extra barrier between us and the people involved.So, I wasn't impressed with the underwater sequences, but there's a whole adventure to be had. Surely it's up to the Bond standards established by the previous three films. The sad fact is that Thunderball feels like it was written by someone who had no understanding of what made Goldfinger and From Russia with Love really good, but they definitely knew the hallmarks. We get Bond girls (four of 'em), SPECTRE (represented by Emilio Largo, the least interesting antagonist since Doctor No), and a plot about stolen nuclear bombs being used for blackmail (that plays out slowly, then quickly, then slowly again).The movie's overstuffed and undercooked all at once. The story doesn't even really begin until about fifty minutes in. Bond just happens to be in the same health spa in Southern England as a SPECTRE agent that is going to replace a NATO colonel in order to steal the bombs, but most of Bond's time spent in the spa isn't investigating SPECTRE but being really, really sexually aggressive with his nurse. The other bulk of this opening is the theft of the nuclear weapons told in excruciating detail. We get the NATO officer making love to his secretary, how the secretary is actually a SPECTRE agent, the double that kills the officer and replaces him, the gadget's he'll use, his trying to extort SPECTRE out of more money, the briefing he attends, the climbing into the airplane, the theft of the airplane, the setting down of the plane into the sea, the sinking of the plane to the bottom, SPECTRE arriving in a submarine, the killing of the double, the theft of the plane, and finally the hiding of the plane. There's no reason to show us all of those steps, especially when they don't directly involve Bond and barely involve the antagonist.The four Bond girls are another problem. The first is the nurse, and she should have just been cut completely. She provides nothing to the narrative. The second is a British agent in Nassau who looks a whole lot like the third Bond girl, the sister of the NATO officer. The fourth is the antagonist's henchwoman (one of several henchpeople he has hanging around him). When the British agent gets captured and murdered, I actually thought it was the sister of the NATO officer for several minutes.It's just bursting at the seams with the elements of a Bond movie, but it's so poorly assembled that it diverts itself with non-story (even non-action) elements for long stretches. The action itself is largely a letdown since it's reliant on a gimmick that undermines basic action filmmaking. Even Sean Connery doesn't seem as interested in the role as he had been. It's a slog of a film, and I find it, well, tedious.",Thunderball
95,Kingslaay,One of the best Bond films of all time,9,30 May 2017,"Thunderball has be one of the greatest Bond films of all time. Sean Connery was firmly cemented in his role as 007 and played it to perfection. A number of elements need to be in place for an excellent Bond film. Besides a great actor it should contain a great plot, a good villain to pull of this plot, excellent supporting characters and good direction to ensure the film does not go astray. Thunderball contained all these elements and follows this formula after Goldfinger. Since a lot of this film is related to the sea and being under water it was quite enjoyable to watch some good action sequences under water. Despite being made in 1965 this film has aged very well and one can almost appreciate watching it today as one would have in the 1960s. Thunderball keeps you on the edge of your seat and time really went by fast in this iconic spy film.",Thunderball
96,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Comment edited after re-watching this as part of a Bond film festival,9,20 December 2003,"SPECTRE has hijacked a plane with two two nuclear bombs on board and threaten to detonate one of the in a major world city unless a huge ransom ($100.000.000) is paid within seven days. If the ransom is not payed and the first bomb is detonated, SPECTRE will inform the media of the threat of another nuclear bomb, and demand an even larger ransom. MI6 believes that the bombs are being held somewhere in the Caribbean, and Bond, with help from Felix Leiter, is sent to find them.Good adaptation of Ian Fleming's (and Kevin McClory's and Jack Wittingham's) book, the screenplay follows the book fairly closely. I have to admit that I was not that impressed with the book the first time I read it, but after reading it again, and seeing Thunderball in a theatre during a Bond film festival recently, I've come to enjoy the book and the film version even more. It has the last really good turn from Connery as Bond, Adolpho Celi is a great villain, Rick Von Nutter is a great Felix Leiter, and the leading ladies are both attractive, even if one of them is a bit superfluous. A bit of editing could have been done during the climax, and omit the silly, gimmicky, ""happy ending"", but this is still a great Bond movie, and definitely worth seeing in a theatre if possible. ***1/2 out of ****",Thunderball
97,brando647,"THUNDERBALL is More Style than Substance and, Worst of All, Dull",5,24 August 2013,"In 1962, the world was introduced to James Bond in DR. NO and he was proved to have a lasting impact with the success of FROM Russia WITH LOVE in 1963. The series officially found its stride with 1964's GOLDFINGER and followed it up with what many people consider one of the best 007 films in 1965: THUNDERBALL. I don't share this affection for Bond's adventures in the Bahamas. Instead, I was bored out of my mind. I hate to say it because director Terence Young is had a good track record with the character until this point. My belief is that THUNDERBALL arrived at a point where 007 movies were a cultural phenomenon and came with a massive budget (for the period) and he went a little nuts with the cash, foregoing substance for style. The movie kicks off with an elongated sequence in which, for once, we watch every major phase of SPECTRE's plan in action. Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) has organized a hijacking of two NATO atomic weapons and SPECTRE declares that cities in both the United States and England will be destroyed unless a sizeable ransom is paid. James Bond (Sean Connery, returning) is dispatched to Nassau in the Bahamas to locate a woman named Domino (Claudine Auger) who might have ties to the men behind the hijacking. From there, we are subjected to more than two hours of mind-numbing investigations and an overwrought climactic final scuba battle between Largo's men and the U.S. military forces.THUNDERBALL is one of the harder 007 movies for me to comment on because, and I'm not exaggerating, this movie bores me to the point where I have a hard time paying full attention to it. So there is probably a good deal I might have overlooked that add to the quality of the movie. The first 45 minutes of the movie are pretty cool with the focus being on SPECTRE's operation. Normally, we might get a glimpse of the plan in action as the warheads are seized by enemy forces but THUNDERBALL gives us insight into a meeting of SPECTRE's top officials, the preparation stages of the heist, and even allows us to watch the full plan go into effect while we cut back and forth to Bond's recovery in a rehabilitation center where he's slowly made aware of the evil-doings going on in the next room. But by the time 007 arrives in the Bahamas, every sort of slows down. His investigation into the missing warheads and his run- ins with Largo and his minions, including the beautiful Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) and silent Vargas, are fun enough and are generally on par with the secret agent fun of the first three movies. The real problem is the entire final act of the movie where Bond and some U.S. forces engage Largo and his men in a long, drawn-out underwater battle. It's horrendously paced and essentially shot in slow motion with a single movement taking twice as long as men attack each other clumsily while trying not tangle their scuba gear.There are a handful of underwater sequences in the film, and this is where I believe Young went a little overboard. I imagine the sequences were meant to give the film an epic feel and an exotic look but all they end up doing is killing my interest. Maybe it amazed audiences in 1965 who weren't accustomed to seeing such detailed underwater choreography, but I was born almost twenty years after this movie debuted. Underwater battles don't amaze me, especially lumbering labors like the sequences in THUNDERBALL. It doesn't help that Largo isn't a villain as memorable as any that came before him. Dr. No was a seriously creepy dude, Red Grant was a stone cold killer, and Auric Goldfinger was overly extravagant and larger than life. Emilio Largo isa man with an eye-patch. Celi does well enough giving him an evil vibe but he just doesn't leave any sort of impression. Honestly, for years after first seeing the movie I couldn't even remember who the villain of the film was without looking it up. I have the same problem with Claudine Auger as the movie's Bond woman, Dominique ""Domino"" Derval. She's definitely beautiful but she doesn't bring anything special enough to the role to help her stand out from the ever-growing list of beautiful Bond girls. In the end, THUNDERBALL is just a blend of mediocre ingredients mixed together to create a stylish adventure without any stand-out performances or memorable moments that sort of lazily rode the wave of 007-mania that was hitting hard in the mid-60's.",Thunderball

(PG)Typically extravagant James Bond outing, well-settled into its formula groove, with the requisite high adventure, scenic locales, gorgeous women, and goofy gadgets. SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo (Celi) has masterminded a plot to steal two atomic bombs and hold the world ransom (usual stuff); Connery, as confident and relaxed here as he ever was in the role, travels to Nassau to stop him. Fails to reach the heights of its predecessors (notably: the chief villain is a considerable downgrade after the likes of Auric Goldfinger, Rosa Klebb, et al), but still offers an entertaining show with Oscar-winning special effects and the hair-raising danger and stylish treatment that director Young was known for--this would be his last time in the director's chair for 007. Exquisite underwater photography, though too much time is spent down there, especially during the climactic battle which starts to drag; voluptuous assassin Paluzzi makes for a memorable femme fatale. Title theme sung by Tom Jones. Later remade with an older Connery as ""Never Say Never Again"" in 1983.

Classic Bond film.",Thunderball
100,pyrocitor,Budget Bloated Bond still holds some merit,6,27 October 2007,"After the legendary success of Goldfinger , expectations were understandably astronomical for the next Bond installment, with 007 producers determined to consistently push the envelope, delivering a ""bigger and better Bond"" than ever before. Unfortunately, this determination proved to be both the strength and weakness of Thunderball, the resulting sequel. On the whole, the film is by no means a failure, but the producers' determination to cash in on elements which made Goldfinger such a success led to overkill excesses which sink Thunderball's overall quality.The plot is even more outlandish than Goldfinger's radiation of the fort Knox gold reserve, pushing the threat to a more global context with the destruction of major world cities by atomic weapons. As well as being a particularly poignant plot device at the time, in the midst of the Cold War, the gist of Thunderball may seem quite familiar to those who frequent more modern political action thrillers, such as The Sum of All Fears. Despite the larger than life premise, Thunderball remains far more grounded in reality than several later Bond exploits (including You Only Live Twice and Moonraker) which tended to drift into being overly silly and ludicrous. Thunderball still takes itself relatively seriously, with several surprisingly dark moments, which help counterbalance the slightly comical yet still thrilling sight of of seeing Connery in a jet pack, and dramatically aid the overall quality of the film. However, Thunderball's significantly larger budget is mostly misused through underwater photography sequences, which, although interesting to look at (and were likely moreso back in the 1960s, where such a sight was very seldom visible to the public eye) for the most part fail to further the plot in any way, and drag on excruciatingly long. However, the film does boast some strong cinematography (and some stunning locations), the action sequences (including a tense chase sequence through a Mardi Gras parade) are solid, and an unreasonably catchy Tom Jones title track surprisingly helps not hinders the film. Unfortunately, for however many of the film's previous strengths, the film descends into utter chaos during the film's final quarter with a painfully repetitive and indecipherable underwater battle (it is increasingly difficult to tell which underwater army is which, who is winning, or why it should even retain our interest) a boat chase flaunting special effects which have dated decidedly unfavourably, and laughably inexplicable character motivations seemingly thrown in to finally tie up the increasingly unravelling mess. It is a disappointment indeed to see what started out with such promise sink into such a banal conclusion.The character of Bond himself is surprisingly reduced to far less screen time than is usual for a 007 film, which is unfortunate, as Connery gives arguably one of his strongest performances as Bond, oozing self assurance and panache, yet an unprecedented darkness amidst the one liners (""I think he got the point"" being the most classic). This time around Bond not only gets hurt, but is not afraid to hurt, unflinchingly bestowing surprisingly vicious physical punishment against his adversariesThe supporting cast proves to be a very hit and miss affair. While former model Claudine Augere certainly looks the part of a sixties Bond girl, but unfortunately for the most part retains the static lack of emoting also associated with them. Adolfo Celi's eye-patched frown makes a visually iconic Bond villain, and is suitably menacing, but as the film progresses, he loses his threat element more and more, eventually degrading to a flimsy carbon copy of an adversary by the final act. Luciana Paluzzi steals the show from all but Connery, making one of the most chilling Bond femme fatale figures in the franchise. Paluzzi, despite the potential to coast by on her sensual looks, refuses to play the part on autopilot, and exudes laudable charisma and threat throughout. The unfortunately named Rik Van Nutter makes the most generic and forgettable CIA agent Felix Leiter of the Bond series, but Bernard Lee and Desmond Llewelyn are on top form as the ever endearing M and Q. As overlong and let down by some unfortunate overuse of budget and dated special effects as the film may be, Thunderball is nonetheless a noteworthy and suitably engaging early Bond effort. Connery himself, in one of his most charismatic renditions of the role is enough to merit watching, and the film for the most part runs along at a brisk enough pace to retain audience interest. While the film is less likely to enthrall those who are not already Bond purists, fans of the character or series should easily be able to extract moments of enjoyment from Thunderball. -6/10",Thunderball

You can't really watch it however without thinking off Austin Powers, especially as we have Number 2 with his eyepatch and the first in a long line of missing nuclear weapons. It's amiable enough stuff as it goes for a Bond film but not exactly groundbreaking. Admittedly it had a steep mountain to climb after the success of Goldfinger which is widely held to be the best of Connery's. Impressive special effects with the Vulcan bomber too, especially considering this was the mid-sixties and it's nice to see Bond actually in these elaborate places when it was quite blatantly faked in Goldfinger. We also get to meet the rest of the double-Os for the first time. The bad points? As the critics observed at the time the underwater sequences just go on and on, Ian Fleming a keen scuba diver in real life and it certainly shows here, although the final battle with the SEALs/UDT navy divers is genuinely exciting. The all too common failing of the Bond films (and espionage films in general) is the miraculous coincidence, we have it here with Bond stumbling across the plot whilst at the health farm just as he did with Goldfinger. Bond's misogyny is also to the fore here, the nurse at the health farm is actually a pretty good match for Bond and stands up to him but in the end he essentially blackmails her into having sex with him (ALMOST forcing himself upon her). Needless to say after that she's putty in his hands. Still, she's more memorable than the Bond girl whose name I can't even remember plus another very weak Felix Leiter.

103,Beta_Gallinger,"A disappointment, especially after ""Goldfinger""",6,14 June 2008,"The year after the success of ""Goldfinger"", the third effort in the now very expansive James Bond movie series, the fourth one, ""Thunderball"", came into theatres. Apparently, this follow-up was even more successful than the 1964 hit. In fact, it was apparently the most successful of all the Bond films Sean Connery starred in! I don't know about then, but right now, this one seems to be widely considered inferior to the Bond film that directly preceded it, and now that I've seen both of them, I have become part of that crowd.The evil organization, S.P.E.C.T.R.E., is once again up to no good! This time, they hijack a British Vulcan bomber and two atomic warheads! They demand one hundred million dollars from NATO, and threaten to let off the bombs on British and American land if they don't get their ransom money, which would obviously cause countless deaths of innocent people! So, Bond sets out on his next mission, to find the missing aircraft! This mission takes him to Nassau, in the Bahamas, where he meets S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent Emilio Largo, and falls in love with a scuba-diver named Domino. While in Nassau, Bond finds himself in a number of dangerous situations, as usual on his missions, but this time, some of them take place underwater! Why did I find ""Thunderball"" far inferior to ""Goldfinger""? Well, I think I should first point out that I found Tom Jones' theme song for this film rather forgettable, unlike Shirley Bassey's memorable ""Goldfinger"" theme. As with the previous film, there is a bit of humour here, which is good, but it doesn't save the film's problems. There is quite a bit of action in this movie, which makes for some exciting moments, such as Bond running through a parade from his captors as they chase him. However, I also found that a lot of the film bored me, such as certain overlong underwater scenes, or at least one of them early on. If you ask me, ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"" have some pacing problems, but this one has more of them. Also, the villains here aren't quite as memorable as the ones in the 1964 classic, none of them can match Oddjob.This installment in the early Bond franchise is longer than its three predecessors, and one may find that it really shows! Not only is ""Thunderball"" far inferior to ""Goldfinger"", it's also slightly inferior to the first two films in the franchise. This 1965 blockbuster does have some good action and humour in parts, which earns it a 6/10 in my book (more so for the action, since humour isn't a big part of the movie), but due to the shortcomings, I would be lying if I gave it a rating any higher than that. Just because this was the most successful of all the Bond movies starring Sean Connery doesn't make it the best, that's for sure, so I wouldn't assume that it's a masterpiece just because of its cinema attendance. It could have been worse, no doubt about that, but it still brought the franchise down after the 1964 classic that preceded it.",Thunderball

Slightly dated, but a lot of fun all the same.THUNDERBALL is for modern summer action blockbusters what GOLDFINGER was to the modern spy classic, which may be the reasons why it suffered in comparison to its predecessors as in FROM Russia WITH LOVE and the highly regarded GOLDFINGER. But hold the comparisons, this is still one of the very best James Bond adventures, with a premise that still holds up pretty well. After being borrowed (not to say rehash) by other modern action films as in 1996's BROKEN ARROW, the plot about the robbing of two nuclear weapons by the always insidious delegates at SPECTRE and holding the the west for ransom. Sean Connery arms himself with his Walther PPK, his tux and dry martinis as the suave secret agent 007 who is ahead of his fellow MI6 agents on the trail of SPECTRE'S #2 agent Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) and his sultry mistress Dominio (Former Miss France Claudine Auger). By the time this fourth James Bond film hit screens, it already suffered the reusing of the famous Bond formula. But this one is not without its excellent qualities, namely action and a nice batch of gee-whiz gadgetry. Besides, it's got Connery in the lead role as the ever-flawless James Bond.

He's bedding women, giving one-line quips, and has gadgets to play with. The film feels very British in it's early stages, the whole set up with the warheads being stolen from the Vulcan bomber feel like they could have been from various 60's hammer house films or sci-fi films of the day. There is a simplicity to the film despite the gadgets and the action, we even get to see Bond in peril as he's almost caught and killed by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agents, only for them to mess it all up and kill one of their own top people. Personally, I found the end a little dated and a little rushed after the build-up the film delivers, but it doesn't detract from the viewing pleasure the films gives. When I first saw this as a child the ending seemed to be a dangerous thrill ride, now as a seasoned film fan of techniques used in cinema, the speeding up of the action does look a little fake - but hey ho, it's fun still in a 60's cinema kind of way.The cast all play their roles brilliantly and nothing seems too cheesy or forced. With lovely cinematography and a great John Barry score to match this is a very entertaining and colourful film. This may not be the strongest film in Bond franchise, but it certainly is fun. I'd definitely recommend it and I can confirm that it's family friendly and a good way to spend a few hours.In terms of Bond films this is a 7 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 6 out of 10.",Thunderball
106,Stampsfightclub,excellent Bond adventure - Connery on form again,9,23 February 2007,"Sean Connery (Indiana Jones) reprises his role as the cool clever 007 as he uses his charm and skill to full effect on a mission to recover stolen bombs from evil villains.Connery has always been my favourite Bond and I personally believe this is one of his best performances as the agent. Whenever I see him on screen in this role I instantly smile as he is such a well placed actor, always suited to this particular role.Connery has always been my favourite Bond character.Connery I believe carries this film and is well juxtaposed with the Bond stereotyped women and gadgets again but that's what we expect and love from Bond films, that and tons of cool cars, action, fighting and adventure, which Thunderball delivers throughout.This gripping slightly less action based plot is always entertaining through a snappy quickly written plot with many action scenes to sustain audience interest. There are less action scenes, gun fights etc then the more recent Bond films such as Tomorrow never dies and The World is not enough but in my opinion having less is probably best as it gives a more accurate portrayal of the agency, not an idealist world which more people nowadays may hope for.However there are many action scenes which play a great part in this film, such as a shark pool, a car chase, corpses and boats. It's a thrill ride throughout, maintaining an interesting dialogue from the very beginning.The setting out at sea was great. A large proportion of the film is set out at sea with its many creatures and wonderful scenery and captures a great essence of beauty, even with what's taking place when it appears.Compared to other Bond films I think this is one of my favourite as it is mysterious, action packed, beautifully directed, has great characters (even though confused at times wondering who was who) and the narrative is consistent and energetic, one of the best Bond films.as with all other Connery Bond films, this is worth watching a few times for sheer enjoyment",Thunderball
107,wkozak221,my favorite bond.,10,23 August 2016,This is my favorite bond. The sequence were you get see members of Spectre. The sequence were bond is at the funeral and kills the colonel. The jet pack is fun also. I like this because even it has some light spots there are serious overtones. The bad guy is classic bond. You also have two of the most attractive bond girls ever. The underwater sequence is really top notch. The gadgets are held to a minimum. This film moves along well. There are no lag time.I wish the Aston Martin was in the film more. I think it is only in the opening. When I want to watch a bond this is the one I watch. I either pop popcorn or order a pizza. This film has my favorite ending of all the bonds. Where he hooks a line to his wet suit and they yanked up by the plane. I don't think it has never been topped.,Thunderball
108,DarthBill,The last good Sean Connery Bond,7,25 September 2003,"This was Sean Connery's fourth James Bond film, and it's pretty good, or maybe that's just my heart's soft spot beating louder than usual since this was the first Bond film I ever saw (it was a gift from Grandpa). Was it Sean's best? Probably not. The best one for Connery will always be a draw between ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"", but this one's better than the dry but watchable ""Dr. No"" (but what do you expect with some first feature films?) After this one there was the very poorly made ""You Only Live Twice"" after which Sean tried to abandon the role, which he didn't really succeed in doing until after the Thunderball remake ""Never Say Never Again"". To be honest with you, Sean should have bowed out after this one, or maybe this one should have been ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" which would feature the underrated but capable George Lazenby.Well, the plot is that SPECTRE is out to conquer the world and plans to do so by launching nuclear weapons from the Bahamas. The film is a bit overlong and not quite as flashy as ""Goldfinger"" but it's got some good fight scenes and some very beautiful Bond girls - my favorite from this one being blonde haired, brown eyed Molly Peters as Patricia Fearing, the nurse that Bond has his way with in the steam room while he's on holiday (she was also one of the first to bear her backside for the screen; there's a scene with Sean massaging Molly and she's wearing nothing but a towel wrapped about her derriere).On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this one a 7 and a half. Not the best but good enough. Sean Connery should have dropped out after this one. Maybe then we could have been spared the debacle that followed with ""You Only Live Twice"", ""OHMSS"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"".",Thunderball
109,stamper,"We've got ourselves a Broken-Arrow, James Bond style",7,13 December 2004,"Thunderball is the fourth entry in the ever ongoing James Bond franchise and in my opinion one of the better installments. This film features the secret services arch-enemy SPECTRE and I must say that in this episode of James Bond adventures it works better than in From Russia with Love. What I liked about this film, was that there were a lot of good one-liners from Connery, that there weren't too many goofy stunts / henchmen / gadgets and that the film was able to maintain exciting throughout. I've read quite a few comments stating that the underwater scenes dragged on too long, but I must say that I felt even that bit to be quite entertaining and thrilling. I actually have only one criticism and that regards the ending. I felt that the whole out-of-control boat thing was really stupid. I mean I understand that they tried to make it look spectacular, but in using the same technique they used to buff up the fistfights, they made it look cheesy and cheap. Luckily this is just one short moment in the film and the film is not ruined by something as a dreadful character or a bad actor. All in all this is one of the better Bond films and well worth watching if one sets out for 2 hours of pure adventurous entertainment with a standard-formula story.7 out of 10",Thunderball
110,ivo-cobra8,The best classic underwater Sean Connery's Bond film my all time favorite,5,17 November 2017,"This is the best Bond with Sean Connery his fourth film. It is my second favorite James Bond 007 Sean Connery film. This is my all time favorite Bond film. It has everything: great villains, awesome gadgets and beautiful women. It is Connery at his best. The first one will always be Goldfinger this one will be the second one. Underwater Bond seriously one of my favorite James Bond 007 film from Sean Connery I grew up watching this movie even as a kid. This movie is underwater Bond seriously a classic one of the best Sean Connery films ever. I love Goldfinger to death this movie in my opinion is a classic! It is really, really a good movie I have enjoy it every minute. It is a fun film I only wish it wouldn't have been so long.Thunderball (1965) the fourth James Bond 007 film and the fourth Sean Connery film. Seriously this movie is my second favorite Sean Connery film I had a blast with this film. It is in my top 10 James Bond films.The film follows Bond's mission to find two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE, which holds the world to ransom for £100 million in diamonds, in exchange for not destroying an unspecified major city in either the United Kingdom of Great Britain or the United States of America (later revealed to be Miami). The search leads Bond to the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo, the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by CIA agent Felix Leiter and Largo's mistress, Domino Derval, Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen.This movie is awesome it is real Bond film I have enjoy it. SPECTRE's Number Two has a house in which he has two poles. One pole is empty the second one has sharks in it. In which he push the button and kills one of his informants sharks eats him. You have in the beginning scene in which James Bond kills Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a SPECTRE operative.Bond uses for a escape a jetpack. We see a jetpack in this movie. SPECTRE's Number Two and his henchmen hijack the plane and they put it right above the sharks. Movie reminds me on Deep Blue Sea I love movie about Sharks I love them. That is why this movie is so interested. Bond goes to Nassau for searching two stolen warheads. Here he meets sexy babe girl Domino Derval (Claudine Auger) in which he later reveals to her that her brother is dead and he was ordered by Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celli) to be killed now she want's revenge and she helps Bond to recover those two stolen warheads. She later kill's Largo with a harpoon. There is another girl Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) who is a SPECTRE agent and she follows James Bond around. There is another girl Paula Caplan (Martine Beswick) Bond's CIA ally.The movie has a huge impact on me it has incredible underwater scene including climatic action packed battle between US Air Force and Largo's henchman. James Bond has much more to do then in the first two movies.Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo SPECTRE Number Two was a bad-ass he was actually really more smart then Dr. No. He was a great villain I miss movies like this. He had a two poles one with sharks and one without it. He had a yacht and the hatchet how could they all steal nuclear warheads.Claudine Auger as Domino Derval Bond's girl was a sexy hot beautiful babe I miss girl's like this. Bond had such a luck to find such a babe. She wanted revenge when she find out Largo killed her brother François (Paul Stassino). She was more French but areal classic babe.Fiona Volpe's introduction while wearing a sheer negligée in Derbal's (Paul Stassino) bedroom was definitely an early highlight of ""Thunderball."" Luciana Paluzzi is a very sexy ruthless villain Definitely one of the better female characters in the series. We also see a motorcycle launching a rocket-propelled grenade to kill Lippe and it was Fiona Volpe as masked rider driving a motorcycle.I love the sequence in which Fiona and her henchman kidnap Paula and Bond goes to SPECTRE Number Two's house to save the girl but he find's her dead. Then he flee's from his house and he battle's Largo's henchman they both fall's in to the pool in which Largo shout's the door and he let's shark's from the second pole to eat Bond and his men of course Bond kill's him and he escapes sharks.You have a great explosion in which marines destroy the yacht. Reall practicable effects. The underwater scene really never bothered me like some other people did.I love this flick to death it is my second favorite Sean Connery's Bond films. Sean Connery him self was a classic Bond he was really the best of this film. When he was in clinic and Nassau he was a bad-ass.Thunderball is a 1965 British spy film and the fourth in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions.10/10 I love this film to death even as a kid it was guilty pleasure of mine.",Thunderball
111,petra_ste,Licensed troubleshooter,7,1 October 2014,"James Bond is the quintessential male wish fulfillment fantasy: a stylish, unflappable Ubermensch who travels around the world shooting bad guys, bedding hot women, driving cool cars and playing with hi-tech gadgets. A guilty pleasure, but a meticulously planned one.The main reason of Bond's initial success was creator Ian Fleming's talent, with his vivid prose and gift as a storyteller; still, what catapulted the character into super-stardom was the casting of Sean Connery in Dr. No. Once established the template, these movies started to live and die by the strength of the following ingredients: a charismatic 007, a memorable villain, captivating Bond girls, cool set pieces.Thunderball features a still excellent Connery in the main role; a cunning villain in Adolfo Celi's eye-patched, beak-nosed Emilio Largo, who owns a swimming pool with sharks and steals an atomic bomb for SPECTRE; two of the most beautiful women in the series, brunette Claudine Auger and redhead Luciana Paluzzi; an underwater battle which has aged surprisingly well.Later remade with the ""unofficial"" (as in ""not part of the canonic movie series by Eon Productions"") Never Say Never Again, notable for a suitably odious Klaus Maria Brandauer as Largo and a borderline-geriatric 007: the age gap between Connery and Bond girl Kim Basinger was over twenty years.7/10",Thunderball
112,eminkl,"Above average across the board, it falls just shy of the franchise's upper echelons",7,22 April 2020,"007 is on the case of two stolen A-bombs in this dash of action-espionage from the Caribbean. This installment leans a bit heavy on the costumes, wacky gizmos and one-line zingers, far more than any of the more-serious preceding chapters, but then, such is the franchise and it does get worse from here. Sean Connery is at the height of his powers as Bond at this point, completely enveloping the screen with his showy swagger and gruff confidence. It's a testament to his fitness for the part that he's able to deliver so many forced, corny lines and not just caress the stink off, but actually make them seem suave and witty. Thunderball's action is fair, though somewhat limited as an awful lot of it happens underwater, and dozens of colorful faces pop up on both sides of the struggle. It's cheeky and silly in a way that only could've been spawned in the '60s, but generally knows when it's pushing things too far and relaxes accordingly.",Thunderball
113,The_Movie_Cat,Connery's Weakest Bond Vehicle,5,19 June 1999,"Where Thunderball fails as a film - and fail it does - is in it's narrative structure. The plot concerns the re-emergence of Spectre, as they hold the U.N. to ransom with two nuclear devices. Bond's first task, taking up around an hour of the film, is to find out how they smuggled the bombs in the first place. This who - or how- dunnit would be fine, except the whole bomb-smuggling sequence is shown on screen early in the film. So that, rather than Bond being one step ahead of the audience, we are one step ahead of him, and spend half it's duration waiting for 007 to catch up with what we know already. The longest Connery movie, the addition is obvious, as the sexual content is played up, which, like the impressively-staged underwater sequences, cannot help but feel gratuitous. Overly padded, these sequences frequently detract from the main plot thread, and are largely irrelevant. One way in which the film does succeed is in breaking the formula - Q and his gadgets, Moneypenny, etc. all appearing half-way through, and, in Q's case, unexpectedly. However, such scenes, and the odd nice line, cannot detract from a Bond movie which fails to sustain the attention for it's overlong duration.",Thunderball

Thunderball is likely one of the first movies people think of when they think of big and overblown Bond.

It was, for me, not the most exciting of the ""James Bonds"", however, as it moved along quite slowly and all the exciting sequences were inserted among much calmer scenes. I enjoyed most of the exciting scenes, as well as the plot of the film, the locations, the good woman and the performance of Sean Connery as Bond himself. He was once again a very good actor in ""Thunderball"" and does well with swimming (although it is highly debatable concerning the amount of underwater scenes he would have done). The only problems I had with this film was the slow pace of the scenes between fights and ""cool"" bits (as mentioned above) and the evil woman, who just irritated me. It has quite a different atmosphere compared to the previous Bond films, especially as there is so much set underwater and around the sea (there may have been ocean scenes in ""Dr. No"", but not nearly as much as this). The hiding of the submarine in ""Thunderball"" is a very interesting scene, as well as the water meeting of James Bond and the good woman.I recommend this Bond installment to people who like those films with some slow-moving scenes and very well-organized and scheming battle scenes.

125,timdalton007,Underrated Bond,10,27 April 2011,"With the success of Goldfinger, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman prepared to make their fourth James Bond film. Originally planning to film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a unique legal situation regarding the novel Thunderball led to producer Kevin McClory approaching them with the idea of a partnership to turn that novel into a film. And thus Thunderball came to be made. With original Bond director Terrance Young at the helm and a production team growing more and more confident, Thunderball became not only a box office hit but perhaps even a better film then Goldfinger.Much of Thunderball's success is down to Sean Connery. Back to the rough and tumble Bond of the first two films, Connery is perfect from the opening scenes at a funeral right up until the climatic fight sequence more then two hours later. Connery excels at the fight sequences in the film from the incredible opening fight right up until the one at the film's end. Connery also proves to be quite the charmer thanks to his excellent chemistry with all of his female co-stars/characters from nurse Patricia Fearing to Domino. Connery even excels in giving Bond a sense of vulnerability at a few instances in the film as well. Overall, Thunderball might well be Connery's best performance as 007.On the villainous side is Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo. He is everything a Bond villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable. Celi makes the role realistic by staying quiet for the most part, becoming angry only to punctuate a scene. Celi's physicality works well as does the superb dubbing of him by actor Robert Rietty. As a result, Largo is a compelling villain and a real menace throughout.Claudine Auger plays Domino in perhaps the best performance of the early Bond girls. Auger, a newcomer when Thunderball was made, nevertheless brings the somewhat complex Domino to life. Along the way, Auger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well, especially Connery with whom she has an instant chemistry. Auger as Domino disproves the notion that 1960s Bond girls were merely window dressing easily.From the excellent main cast, we go into the film's just as excellent supporting cast. Of special mention is Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona Volpe, the fem fatale of Thunderball, who is not only incredibly attractive but also very dangerous and mysterious throughout her appearances. Rik Van Nutter becomes the third Felix Leiter and indeed he comes across as an excellent choice for the role. Not forgetting of course the regular supporting cast of the series including Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn as Q who all give their usual best if not better.Thunderball's large budget (at least for the time it was made) is well used. Ken Adam once again returns as production designer and the result is some of his best work from the SPECTRE conference room to the various craft used by Largo and his henchmen during the underwater sequences. The film features excellent cinematography all around from the many underwater sequences that are splendidly, even beautiful at times, photographed by Ricou Browning and his team to the ever excellent work of Ted Moore above the waves. The Academy Award winning special effects of John Stears serves the film well from model work to explosions and the like The result is a fine looking film Thunderball is an action film and it excels at being one. The action ranges from the truly spectacular opening fight sequence that destroys every piece of furniture in the room to a chase through a parade to the climatic underwater battle and climatic fight sequence above the waves. Above the surface, the work of stunt coordinator Bob Simmons is excellent and never loses a chance to thrill the viewer. Below the waves can be a bit of a different story though as there seems to be only so much one can do in terms of underwater hand to hand combat before it becomes a bit repetitive. Thankfully the combination of Peter Hunt's editing, John Barry's music and Terrance Young's direction keep the excitement up even when that begins to happen. The result is a thrilling action film even nearly fifty years later.Composer John Barry takes his excellent work up a level for Thunderball. Barry's score does what any really good film score should do: set the mood of any given scene. The score overall is one of Barry's most suspenseful from the build-up to the opening fight through the hijacking of the Vulcan bomber and beyond. Barry's suspenseful pieces masterfully turn into action pieces in an instant. The result is one of Barry's best Bond scores and one of the best ever Bond scores.Thunderball is served by an excellent script. From action sequence to witty lines, suspenseful plotting and interesting character's the script by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins brings together everything that makes a good Bond film. The script, and the film itself, finds the right balance between the more realistic style of From Russia With Love with the gadgetry and over the top elements of Goldfinger. Thunderball unfolds quickly, though willing to take its time if need be, yet seems to be fairly realistic as it does so. In particular, the gadgets that Bond actually compliment the film rather then threaten to overwhelm it as happened in Goldfinger. The result, especially combined with the direction of Terrance Young, is excellent.Despite Goldfinger's reputation, Thunderball may well be the better film. From Connery's performance as Bond to a better villain, fine Bond girl and an excellent supporting cast it is perhaps a better acted film. Thanks to its production values, score, script and the direction of Terrance Young it has excellent production values as well. Overall Thunderball is perhaps a bit underrated and an excellent Bond film overall.",Thunderball
126,Bogmeister,BOND#4: And He Strikes...,7,28 May 2007,"MASTER PLAN: blackmail NATO for 100 million pounds after stealing two nuclear warheads. This was SPECTRE at its ultimate. No messing around anymore. It was also, in many ways, Bond at his ultimate: Bond mania had reached its peak around this time, with this film building on the amazing popularity established by ""Goldfinger,"" and, at such a pinnacle, there was nowhere to go but down. We need to realize that, adjusted for today's dollars, these Bond films (Goldfinger and Thunderball) were as financially successful as the current ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, truly the biggest films of the year back then. The teaser in this one, taking place in France, contains an energetic fight and the now-famous jet pack flier, an extension of Bond's growing preoccupation with gadgetry. Tom Jones sings over the credits, a male version of Bassey's Goldfinger song. Like in ""Goldfinger,"" Bond begins this adventure while off duty, at some health spa, but he manages to have a peripheral connection to SPECTRE's latest plot while there anyway (Bond seems to have a knack for being in the right place at the wrong time, or something). There's a particularly sensuous scene during this sequence with an on-site nurse/masseur, Bond's latest female conquest.This film retains the sense of absurdity always frittering away at the edges of a Bond story, probably to the delight of the audience. Take, for example, the early attempt to kill Bond at the spa, using one of the stretching machines to which he is tied to; now, would an exercise machine really have a lever setting which could kill the person on it, with no way for the person to free himself? I don't think there would be much sales of such a machine, except to such sadists as employed by SPECTRE. Speaking of this organization, this is where its framework was expanded to a more grand scale: Blofeld is seen once again, only from the neck down, with his cat (following ""From Russia With Love""), this time presiding over a complete group of top level dastards, numbering #2 on up (Largo, the chief villain of this story, is no.2). In a neat parallel, we later see the same set up on the side of the good guys, with Bond taking a seat among all the double-0 agents, his one-on-one meeting with M delayed due to this special group briefing. This lent a new scale to the Bond adventure; the filmmakers seem to be telling us that it's all bigger, grander - a Bond to surpass what came before and maybe what was to be. These are the better scenes, as is Bond's flirting with Moneypenny, who looks extra attractive in this one. We don't see Q until later, since he has to dispense his gadgets and commentary out in the field - a slight deviation, but it would be repeated in later films.Bond's mission takes him primarily to the Bahamas (M was going to send him to Canada, but Bond convinced him otherwise). This allows for some great, picturesque scenery and glorious photography - this may very well be the best-looking Bonder. It also entailed a lot of underwater photography which, while usually attractive, slows everything down; no one can escape the fact that any scenes taking place underwater take twice as long to get through in comparison to those on land - it's all in slow motion and there's just so much one can do with editing. I'm not referring to the climactic battle which, if at least seen in widescreen DVD or Laserdisc, on a big screen, can be exciting (the muddy TV broadcast versions are just no go). But, there are just too many underwater sequences throughout, including Bond poking around underneath a boat at night and even one in a swimming pool, with the sharks (the shark motif was recurring here, copied in later Bond films, a weirdly fantastic method of the villain). Largo can be dangerous in that crude old-style gangster manner, complete with an eye-patch to suggest modern pirates, but supreme agent Bond seems to know from the outset that he'll be dealt with in customary, simplistic-brutal fashion; there doesn't really seem to be a great threat. The henchman, Vargas, is little more than a cypher, not very imposing and with little to do. More interesting is the female villain, Volpe (a replacement for SPECTRE#3 Klebb, of ""From Russia With Love"" fame), but she doesn't have too much screen time. CIA liaison Leiter was modeled somewhat on actor Lord's version in ""Dr.No,"" but with less presence. Connery retained much of his edge in this one; if only he had greater foes to go up against. This was remade with a much older Connery as ""Never Say Never Again"" in '83; but, Bond would be back in ""You Only Live Twice.""

I think he is the best james bond ever than the other james bond actor because he was the first and i don't think someone else can beat the originals. I give this movie 10 out of 10.

129,LebowskiT1000,Fourth film and going strong!,8,15 February 2003,"I wouldn't dare say that this is the best James Bond film in the series, but there are definitely some good things to be seen in this film.  You can tell that due to the success of the previous three films, a lot more attention was given to the action, story, characters, cast, props, and just about everything.These days the idea of a criminal-super-power holding the world ransom with atomic weapons is not a very original idea, although back in the 1960's, when this was made, this was probably a rather unique and original idea.  I thought the story was very good and quite entertaining.Sean Connery returns to his role of James Bond, pulling off another fantastic job.  Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell also return to their roles, pulling off excellent performances as well.  The real gems in the movie are the very attractive Claudine Auger (as Domino), and the quite villainous Adolfo Celi (as Emilio Largo/""Number 2"").  Rik Van Nutter comes in to fill the shoes of Felix Leiter, I'm not sure he's the best candidate for the role, but he did just fine.  The rest of the supporting cast was quite good as well.The only complaint I have about the film is the length.  While not being a terribly long film overall, there are a number of scenes that could easily have been left out or shortened.  The first 30 minutes or so of the film are really great, but from then on it seems to drag a little bit.All in all, I thought this was a very good fourth installment to the series. I'm not sure it's necessary, but I would probably recommend seeing the previous three films before checking this one out.  Although, it's not absolutely necessary.  In any case, I hope that you enjoy the film as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris",Thunderball

The story is a really good one and Bond seems more like the spy he is suppose to be.Two war heads are stolen and Bond is sent to track them down.We see some lovely Caribbean locations and also the lovely Claudine Auger as Domino, one of the prettiest Bond girls.SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo is a great Bond villain and we are treated to lots of under water action (although some of the under water fights are a bit silly, pulling off a divers mask does not cause them to flay about in panic. Removing and refitting your diving mask is part of the qualification that all divers take ).Sean Connery is really good in this film and moves like a cat.Some aspects seems a little dated today but still worth watching over and over.",Thunderball
131,grendelkhan,"Starting to go over the top; but, still fun!",8,27 November 2012,"Up to this point, the Bond series has built upon the success of the previous movie. Dr. No started things off, introducing our hero and his world. From Russia with Love added deadlier enemies, more complex plots, and memorable allies. Goldfinger gave us the independent supervillain and the wonderful gadgets. Thunderball mixes it all into a cocktail that would be sipped again and again.Thunderball brings SPECTRE to the forefront, in direct conflict with Bond. We first get a glimpse of their inner workings at a board meeting of criminals, complete with the harsh discipline they employ. Then, we watch as they launch Operation Grand Slam. This is an organization with vast resources and deadly agents. Perfect opposition for Bond.Meanwhile, Bond has gotten more toys, from his returning Aston Martin to his jetpack (the coolest spy accessory ever). By this point, Q has nothing but open contempt for how Bond treats his toys, adding a wonderful touch to the briefing scenes. There are plenty of lovelies for Bond to woo, from his nurse at a health spa, to Domino, and a deadly SPECTRE agent.We don't get quite as much scope this time, as we are mostly centered in England and Nassau, though the Bahamian setting is lovely. What we do get is some amazing photography beneath the ocean, as we watch SPECTRE claim their nuclear prize from a hijacked Vulcan bomber and transport it to its final destination. We also get the ultimate in scuba battles. This is a very effects-intensive film and it would be rewarded with a deserving Oscar.This film is the turning point for the series, as we go from mystery and intrigue into spectacle and mayhem. There is still an intricate plot, bit it starts to take a backseat to the action. We do have a memorable cast, including Adolpho Celli as the cold blooded, but charming SPECTRE number 2, Emilio Largo. Largo is a man of great appetites and great horrors. He takes the cold nature of Dr. No and adds the arrogance of Goldfinger, though he mostly holds the mania in check. The ladies are lovely as ever and deadly, in the case of Fiona Volpe.Thunderball is the measuring stick for the more action-oriented Bonds, though it still has the intrigue of the earlier efforts. All of the elements are working here, creating a fantasy world of jet-setting supervillains and spies, scuba clad commandos, and jetpack escapes. From here, Bond moves from the implausible to the fantastic and never really returns, for more than a moment. It's a great film to discover when you are young, but still a delight when you are older.",Thunderball

Anyway, this film is set primarily in the Bahamas and it signals the return of the original Bond director Terence Young. The film once again pits Bond against S.P.E.C.T.R.E. who plans to hold the world hostage with two hijacked atomic bombs.This is the second and so far the last Bond picture to win an Oscar.

134,FilmFanInTheHouse,"Personally, it seems to lack in action",6,3 December 2006,"Thunderball is known as one of the great 007 movies, but personally i dislike it due to it's lack of action. The story is based on missing nuclear bombs, taken by SPECTRE. The movie includes 25% of underwater scenes. The movie started off on a high for me as James Bond (Sean Connery) battled with a disguised villain. The fight was made into a nice little sequence which included the introduction on the amazing jet-pack and a cameo from the Aston Martin. The next we see Bond is shrublands which starts the slow pace. He checks in with MI6, travels to Nassau and then onto a casino, just to find the Bond girl, Domino. After another scene of dancing, there's a chase scene which only lasts a few minutes, and doesn't create much excitement. More diving, and then onto an underwater battle. The idea of two groups of divers battling underwater, may be positive, but it really didn't excite me. The diver slowly fighting out, looked as if they were dancing. Once 007 finally reaches the villain, the action starts to pick up. The fight between Bond and Emilio Largo is intense, but only lasts a minute or 2. It didn't match up to the fight between Bond and Red Grant.This is my own personal opinion, so not everyone feels this way about it. If you look the mystery of finding the villain and the weapons, you would enjoy this. If action is your thing, you might not be too fond of this. James Bond will return in 'You Only Live Twice'.",Thunderball
135,jhaggardjr,Fourth 007 picture,7,2 December 2001,"""Thunderball"" is the fourth James Bond picture, and the weakest to star series best Sean Connery. That doesn't make ""Thunderball"" a bad movie though. I just like the other Connery Bond movies much better. This one is a bit overlong and moves a little slower. Still, it has Connery, and his presence makes it work. Plus, it has good villains, beautiful women, and exceptional gadgets. So on the basis of those elements, ""Thunderball"" works. But the out-of-control boat sequence that concludes the picture is laughable (thanks largely in part to some out-of-control camera work).

136,dfle3,If you love loads of underwater scenes you'll love this...,6,9 July 2010,"4th of 23 Bond moviesAs for me, I didn't find this kind of over emphasis on underwater scenery all that appealing. This fourth instalment of the spy franchise pretty much keeps to the recognisable formula established in the third movie ""Goldfinger"": Setting: Shot in the Bahamas, for the most part, those who like this kind of scenery will no doubt enjoy the movie more than I did.Plot: S.P.E.C.T.R.E returns as a recurring force of evil that Bond faces. This time the mysterious ""#1"" is seeking £100,000,000 ransom from N.A.T.O after stealing two nuclear missiles. If N.A.T.O does not pay up, one of the U.S.A or U.K will be targeted by a nuclear missile.Pre title theme song sequence: Yes. You get the Bond theme with Bond firing a shot at you...Connery's usual awkward gait followed by his wobbly back leg in taking the shot. The following pre theme song sequence does has fanciful elements to it...Bond using a jet pack...and it's not exactly clear how he managed to have the jet pack be where he wanted it to be. Don't let people tell you that Roger Moore's James Bond had a monopoly on silly scenarios! Guest artist singing theme song: Yes. Tom Jones sings here. Big name, but not a personal favourite song of mine...the ladies seem to have all the classics up until this point! Silly female names: No! Massive oversight? Sexism: Yes. Bond forces himself on a very attractive female character in this movie. I am sure that attractive women all over the world will be aghast at the thought of a virile Sean Connery manhandling and forcing himself on one of them. He also blackmails the same woman. Would blackmail be what it takes for an attractive woman to go to bed with him? Bond as a wine snob: Hmm....either this is another oversight, or I neglected to observe this in my notes! Q: Yes. He makes another appearance...he seems the male counterpart to the kind of complex relationship Bond has with the secretary, Moneypenny.End teaser: No, I don't think. Things to watch out for: * What happened to Bond's hat when he came out of the briefing with other 00s? * The existence of other spies like Bond is established...there are nine such ""00"" (double O) spies...you only glimpse the side of one's face in that sequence.* Bond gets shot in the leg but later goes diving in a place where the scent of blood in the water would be most unwelcome indeed! A continuity error?* It seems that at least 3 sharks really do die for the purposes of this movie...if that is the case, animal rights supporters may not appreciate this element of the filming of the movie. Apologies if this is not the case.* What happened to that guy at the end of the movie...did Bond just leave him there? The poor guy couldn't swim and he was in shark infested waters!This movie doesn't have a lot of repeat viewing value, I don't think, but for a first time view I could give it 65/100...actually, on first viewing I gave this movie around 75-80 out of 100. It just doesn't stand up well to repeat viewing, unfortunately. It's a pity about all that underwater action though...hard to know who was doing what to whom! Sean Connery does, however, fill out the role...he has settled into this character by now.",Thunderball
137,Al_The_Strange,Thunderball Review,9,20 September 2015,"After seeing James Bond in action in three big, iconic missions, Thunderball blasts to the scene with the promise of more action, more gadgets, more ladies, bigger stakes, more exotic locations, and so much more! At this point, the Bond formula had been established firmly enough so that Thunderball only has to follow a template full of established tropes and clichés. Many folks will say that it makes this one of the duller movies. I personally always thought it was a blast though. Among the highlights, this film follows Bond on a colorful journey to Nassau, where he has to constantly out-think and outwit the opposition. There's a lot of deceptive mindgames at work, followed by some chasing and some fighting, before a massive all-out battle underwater. It's a long film, but it is consistently thrilling and it has a satisfying payoff. Best of all, the film remains iconic thanks to the classic elements at play: Bond's classic charm, a classic villain we love to hate, and an overall sense of class.The premise is pretty simple, generally not much different than a lot of modern action movies revolving around stolen nuclear weapons (like Broken Arrow, The Rock, Mission Impossible, you name it). It follows Ian Flemming's novel practically word for word (which is unsurprising, since it was based on a screenplay to begin with). What makes it so fun is that it's twisty and complex, but not impossible to follow. Each new scene offers something that's either thrilling or alluring. The characters are as endearing as ever.Caught in epic widescreen photography, this film boasts plenty of bright and colorful scenery. Most of it looks great, especially with some steady and well-choreographed underwater photography. Some scenes, especially during the parade scene, are a bit rough around the edges. Editing can be nutty, as some dialogue has been cut, dubbed, and recut for various versions. Scenes usually transit well regardless. Acting is great: Sean Connery is still the man, and I always enjoyed the performances of Adolfo Celi, the lovely Claudine Auger, and the lovely Licuana Paluzzi. Writing is okay - the plot unravels well, and the dialogue is usually good, but some of the jokes can be a little goofy. This production uses great-looking locales, and lots of fine-looking sets, props, and costumes. John Barry's music score is as good as ever, and Tom Jones' theme song is hip.To me, Thunderball is one of the most perfect Bond adventures. It has all the right signature elements we know and love, but with tons of thrills and action. It is a long adventure that might strain the patience of many viewers, but I think it's classy, sexy, exciting stuff.4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",Thunderball

Well, it still has Sean Connery and beautiful women in it, but the movie is long and the story isn't really captivating and in fact feels painfully slow. A lot of the action happens underwater and while it looks impressive and probably took a lot of effort to film, it's just boring. It's still a decent Bond movie, but it's slow, main villain isn't anything special (same thing with the intro song) and it marks the point in time where Bond movies started to go over the top a lot, a trend which is continued to this day.

140,willcundallreview,A kind of good Connery Bond,7,8 May 2014,"Rating-7/10Thunderball is a Bond that may be slightly slower than the ones before it, but it still packs a punch in the franchise and stands tall among all the entries. With Connery continuing his suave but violent role, he manages to make this film fun yet plausible at the same time with the villain being not so insane as seen before. I felt that this film was solidly a Kind of good film film, and here below is why I felt so.The story is good fun and the adventure although maybe not scraping every part of the world, still manages to get a lot of out of only one real location it is set in. It has some good action and good scenes that are quintessential to any Bond fans, with big weapons and an underwater scene that is one of the resounding images of this film, it is just all good stuff, and with a plot that isn't afraid to be both light and dark.Connery comes back with maybe a film that wouldn't be his proudest Bond, but still manages to entertain and do a job that many think, no one can do better. Largo the villain is a good villain, maybe slightly stereotypically Bond but is still a bad one, which turns out good. I felt Adolfo Celi who plays him is very good and stands out for me as one of those villains who is evil when you least expect it, a cunning man indeed.The stunts are good fun and some of the things involved go a long way to entertain you, I especially liked that this film didn't have to rely on car chases for fun, it has more thrilling chases and a lot of boats are involved too. It is written OK and the script doesn't really go anywhere to help the film although Connery uses it well to his advantage, overall it is Connery who helps this film to it's rating.The only thing I could really find wrong with this film is that at times it can be slow and maybe just a bit boring, I feel this was only because the film has one setting for the majority of the film and although it is an interesting plot, maybe the over use of location effects it. It could also be said that the film lacks enough humour needed for early Bonds but that it is really up to you if you decide to watch it.Bond fans should enjoy this and although I don't think this will be there favourite one, it will still serve to entertain. Those who like Bonds with a much more spy like feel will enjoy this as he seems to get into some hiding places and stake outs to root out his enemy. One more thing to say is that this film has some great characters throughout and who is good and who is bad is always hard to predict, good fun.Overall I give this a 7/10, Solidly a kind of Good film, with this you have to just enjoy this and see exactly what Sean can do in a Bond film, I will mention the underwater scenes again because Connery executes them very well and it is one thing that sticks in your mind when you think about the film.

141,majikstl,"""His fight goes on and on and on""",5,8 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how THUNDERBALL rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: THUNDERBALL: Could they have come up with a more generic title? Maybe it is supposed to contain some slight sexual innuendo, though even that is stretching it. In a series where the titles tend to be a play on words or catch phrases, THUNDERBALL stands out for its banality. 1 point.Pre-Credit Teaser: James goes to a funeral and punches out the ""widow."" As an intro, the bit doesn't have a single thing to do with the following story, but it is funny and gives Bond an opportunity to show off one of his more famous gadgets, the flying jet pack. As it turns out, the opening proves to be the best part of the movie. 8 points.Opening Credits: Designer Maurice Binder gives us surrealistic images and silhouettes of young women swimming around in elegant patterns. No great meaning, but it would become the standard for the title sequences of Bonds to come. 6 points.Theme Song: Apparently several theme songs were written for this film and for some reason this was deemed the best. Makes you wonder what the others sounded like. The music is okay, I suppose, but the words are just plain nonsensical, revealing nothing about the movie itself. It's not even clear if the song is about Bond or about the film's villain: ""He knows the meaning of success / His needs are more so he gives less."" Huh? Tom Jones belts the song out with gusto, but there's nothing to really work with. 2 points ""Bond, James Bond"": Could it be that Connery is getting bored with the character already? After the opening teaser, he sort of walks through the rest of the film. It's a not a bad performance, but you get the feeling that he knows that the material is mediocre and is busy thinking about his next non-Bond project. 6 points.Bond Babes: Claudine Auger is pretty as Domino, the villain's mistress. There's not much more to say. 5 points.Bond Villain: As Emilio Largo (a.k.a., ""Number 2"" at SPECTRE), Adolfo Celi wears an eye patch, which is about the full extent of his characterization. Celi can't be totally blamed for this, since the film allows him few opportunities to create a character, or for that matter, to even have any dialogue. As a key player in a plot to set off nuclear devices, you would think the writers could think of something of interest for him to say or do. No such luck. 3 points.Bond Baddies: As assassin and seductress Fiona Volpe, Luciana Paluzzi could have stolen the film. She is certainly attractive enough and cold-blooded enough. But, again, the screenplay doesn't give her a lot of leeway for creating a colorful character or for flaunting her evil in an entertaining fashion. Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, her counterpart in the 1983 remake NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN would do so much more with the part. Even so, she gets a respectable 7 points.Plot: After the one-two-three success of the previous Bond films, it is surprising just how routine number four seems. Blofeld and company steal a couple of nuclear bombs and hold the world for ransom. Perhaps this is the first spy film to concoct that particular gimmicky plot, but that doesn't make it any less cliché and just plain silly. 2 points.Production values: Much of the story takes place underwater, where a hijacked NATO fighter plane is submerged. Thus, so much of the action is in slow motion and performed by stunt people wearing diving masks. Boring! Despite a countdown to a possible nuclear holocaust, the film lacks any sense of urgency and drama. 4 points.Bonus Points: THUNDERBALL is so undistinguished, it is tempting to subtract points just out of spite. But let's give it 1 point, just for the banter between Bond and Desmond Llewellyn's ""Q."" Summary: In the end, the film doesn't seem like one of the Bond series; it's more like one of the many imitations that flooded the theaters at the time. A lot of behind the scene haggling over film rights delayed production and apparently compromised the resulting effort. Nobody seem to put much heart into the project.Bond-o-meter Rating: 45 points out of 100.",Thunderball

Adolfo Celi is good as the evil bad guy, but not great, Claudine Auger looks well fit as the main bond girl, and there is Rick van Nutter as Felix Leiter still not as good as Jack Lord though. It is the action that is very good, particularly the underwater scenes, although continuity is a problem in those. In these early Bond films there were a few gadgets, but only a few, not so much in this one, more of advanced technology, such as a Jet Pack at the start and a super-yacht that splits into two. It is filmed authentically in France and the Bahamas.Direction is good, it is all well made, not perfect though, and the Tom Jones theme song is good with John Barry penning the great music score. I gave it an 8 because of some mistakes, but apart from that, great. The other themes are here too, no main henchman though, but Spectre makes its 3rd appearance in 4 films. In a bit of a change Bond has 2 sexy assistants, Madame Boitier (played by Rose Alba an English/Egyptian) at the start of the film, and Paula who was played by Martine Beswick a Jamaican/English actor who appeared in From Russia With Love as a Gypsy woman and got shagged by Bond in that, but not this time, she gets killed in the middle as well.Bond Girls :- Although Claudine Auger (who sadly passed away last December aged 78) is the main ""Bond Girl"" [no. 15) in this film, she is not the first, Molly Peters [no. 13] (who passed away in 2017) as Pat in the clinic shagged 007 first, then a bit later Bond shags Fiona Volpe [no.14], a baddie played by Luciana Paluzzi an Italian, who vies with Claudine Auger as the best beauty in the film, she still lives at the age of 82, but her character got killed just after shagging 007, as per usual.All in all, not perfect, but still a very good movie.",Thunderball

Some scenes are completely out of order, characters appear and disappear, and huge leaps of logic are made in the plot. Other than the bad Bond girl, there isn't a single intriguing character - other than Bond himself, of course - and the villain isn't especially threatening.

James Bond is sent to investigate, and as he gets deeper into the mystery, he ends up falling in love with Largo's mistress, Domino. Bond ends up fighting on land and under water to defeat Largo, and if he doesn't, the world could be in trouble. This is the most boring of the Sean Connery Bond films, but it's still okay.The first three James Bond films have an adequate amount of action and thrills in them while still keeping a good story with mystery and suspense. This James Bond movie does the same, but the story for the movie seems to drag on and on, and when it finally gets around to the action, the action drags on a bit too. The underwater fight is kind of cool at first, because you've never seen it happen before, but when it goes past the 10 minute mark, it starts to get old. I will say that this Bond movie features the best kill line out of all of them. ""Can my friend sit this one out? She's just dead."" The scenery in this movie is pretty good, at least I think so because I love water movies, but James Bond spending all his time underwater didn't translate as well for me. This is a well made James Bond film, that's for sure, but it just seems to drag on more than others.According to Connery, this movie features his favourite performance as James Bond. I thought he was as perfect as ever in the role. Adolfo Celi makes for a pretty good bad guy, and Claudine Auger is a great Bond girl.Overall, this Bond movie is as good as the first three. The only problem is that it drags on a little.7/10",Thunderball

148,dvc5159,For entertainment this achieves the highest of any other Bond movie.,7,14 June 2007,"Connery is back, better and more buff than ever, as super agent James Bond 007, this time seeing him on a mission in the Bahamas to prevent a nuclear catastrophe from happening. The cinematography is beautiful, as the Bond Girl Claudine Auger, who looks smoking hot in her bikini.For the acting, Connery is always there to take the spotlight. He zigs and zags his way around friends and foe in order to succeed. He is still the charming, witty, and deadly secret agent we have come to know him for. The villain is also good here, because not only he has one of the most diabolical plans ever, he also looks diabolical (an eye patch).The action here is non-stop, especially the underwater scenes. Some call these scenes overlong, thus causing the length of the film to be 2 hours and 10 minutes, quite long, but to me, it's just breathless and pulse-pounding. Also, the beginning of the film will want you begging for more Connery. Most of the action sequences rely on the team's special effects, but it's no problem, since the special effects are damn good for a 1965 movie, even by today's standard. Which is why it deserved to win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.Crew also reigns here. Producers Brocolli and Saltzman return once again, as well as Terence Young, director of the first two Bond films. This was his final James Bond film before he went on to direct Audrey Hepburn in her Oscar-nominated performance in the 1967 thriller Wait After Dark. It shows that you have a class filmmaker at the helm. John Barry gives us a beautiful and fast-paced score that mounts up the tension every time.Overall, probably the most entertaining Bond ever.7.73/10Delton",Thunderball

I like the first two Bond films, but found GOLDFINGER as a little bit static (despite the good actors).I actually consider THUNDERBALL a better film. I enjoy the ladies, especially Luciana Paluzzi's Fiona Volpe character very much; the same is true of Martine Beswick's. Both ladies are a delight. Adolfo Celi has a certain class as Largo, too.And THUNDERBALL has a real panache. Filmed in 1965, around the same time as the Beatles' film HELP!, in the same location(!), it is fun to watch. Sean Connery looks outstanding, and his toupee looks the best here. It is also fun to see Q showing up ""in the field."" Note also the Ford vehicles, especially Fiona's Mustang!

150,bluesman-20,Thunderball James Bond's finest moment.,10,4 July 2010,Thunderball after Goldfinger gave us more gadgets and a more coherent plot that makes good use of Bond's 00 status. The Film begins with Bond killing a enemy agent who killed two of his friends and a incredible escape by rocket pack. We are then lead to M's office where M orders Bond to a health club called Shrublands to rehab his body of all of Bond's bad habits. While there Bond becomes the attempted target of Count Lippe who tries to kill Bond after seeing him Lippe panics and believes Bond is onto him and the latest SPECTRE scheme. Bond is almost killed but pays Lippe back in turn when Bond gets orders to report to HQ. Two Atomio bombs are missing and SPECTRE has taken credit for it and threatens the world. The Mission is codenamed THUNDERBALL And The stakes are high . This movie creates a suspenseful atmosphere and gives us a credible picture of Bond at work rest AND play during this deadly mission. the film's diving and underwater fight scenes are the best filmed fight scenes in the movie. While some have criticized this film as being weak or boring or dull they are far from the mark this is perhaps one of the best Bonds ever made. Despite the Gadgets despite Sean Connery's growing displeasure with t he role of James Bond Thunderball remains a highlight of the Bond series. the Acting was never as good again and the plots just got sillier after this .

151,mnpollio,Bond starting to slip slightly,7,23 March 2007,"For the first time, the Bond films were starting to become formulaic, but there are still many things to enjoy about this fourth entry.Bond: Connery was still fully invested in the role bringing all of the charm, rugged sex appeal and dry humor he perfected from the previous entries.The villains: Adolfo Celi is merely adequate, failing to live up to the earlier promise of Red Grant or Goldfinger, but still better than the buffoonish Dr. No. Luciana Paluzzi partially makes up for the lag as the viper-ish Fiona Volpe. So strong is she as the bloodthirsty co-hort that the film suffers a bit when she is off-screen. Her lethal tango with Bond and Connery's concluding line are legendary to fans.The women: Claudine Auger is sexy, but pretty much a cipher for the duration of the film.The film suffers from a convoluted plot and too much dependence on underwater sequences. Despite the need of some editing, the film is slick and fast-paced, although not in the league of its predecessors. Tom Jones contributes the underrated title song.",Thunderball
152,EvanKevelson,Following Goldfinger 7.5,8,26 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
After the first three I personally felt there was too much emphasis on, likely because of the 60s, and how visually groundbreaking the underwater finale and sequences were as well as the first corny Q savior ""the tin foiled jet pack).
At the same time rewatching this in 1080p on a 55' screen instead of a 21' boob tube on VHS, I can understand why. But still this 4th installment threw Bond into the ""Way over the top"" story lines. One can argue in terms of special effects a grand achievement in Cinematic history in 1965 that would not be accomplished again until Starwars and again till Terminator II.
SPECTRE is back and the ridiculous Largo and his eyepatch definitely worthy of being the basis of Dr. Evil's #2. Largos pure ""Aryan"" hit man named Vargo does not escape me(wondering why V-argo). The villainess was perhaps the best Bond had to face until Golden Eye's ""Onatop"". Great swim gadgets and was beginning of a phase that would define Moore.
The first glimpse at the SPECTRE structure with an executive meeting and the Austin powers inspired chair dump into the incinerator of #9.

For that reason this movie is credible and not over the top. Connery delivers a humorous Bond with juicy banter throughout the film.

It was, in many respects, the first ""epic"" entry in the series, not only because of its phenomenal success at the box-office (when inflation is taken into account, it remains, as the tagline states, ""The Biggest Bond of All""), but for its complicated plot and tremendous underwater action scenes (that make the ones in the remake, ""Never Say Never Again,"" look like something done in a bathtub).  The dialogue is some of the wittiest in the series (""Some men don't like to be driven,"" Fiona tells Bond while she gives him a lift in her car.  ""Some men don't like to be taken for a ride,"" Bond retorts), and even the character of Felix Leiter seems, for once, to exist for something more than to be impressed with 007's way with the women.

155,squirrel_burst,"With this movie, I'm starting to turn into a big fan of 007",8,14 February 2015,"We've gotten 50 years' worth of Bond movies and when looking back at the best ones, you're looking for something that sets them apart from the rest. After all, you don't expect Bond to ever die at some point in the film so there's a certain amount of predictability to them. ""Thunderball"" has plenty to set it apart from the other ones and even though it's been remade as ""Never Say Never Again"" it holds up as a terrific spy thriller. The story begins when SPECTRE, the evil agency whose objective is to make money through criminal acts acquires two atomic bombs through a complicated plot. They now hold the world ransom and demand to be compensated for their efforts. MI6 agents are dispatched across the world while the governments count down until their deadline is up and they will have to fork over the millions or face catastrophe. That's where James Bond (Sean Connery) comes in, allied with a woman named Domino (Claudine Auger), he slowly pieces together where the weapons are located and gets ready not only to foil the plot. But that won't be enough for this new duo; they also need to ensure that the people responsible pay for their crimes.What stands out with this movie is the underwater cinematography. We've got Bond being thrown in a pool of man-eating sharks, nuclear weapons being salvaged from underwater crashes, our heroes infiltrating submarines and a big climactic battle with dozens of agents battling to the death in scuba gear. The climax is really interesting because it's truly a fight in three-dimensions, with vehicles crashing against each other, harpoons flying in all directions, the dead sinking to the bottom of the ocean, and the injured frantically trying to swim up to the surface because their breathing tubes have been damaged and they risk drowning. We've got a pretty good assortment of gadgets, with some really fantastical stuff like a jet pack early in the film and more plausible stuff that would be really handy for a spy like an underwater infra-red camera. My favorite gadget is probably a re-breather that allows the user to fake his or her own death by sneaking a tiny device on their person and pulling it out so that they are able to stay underwater long enough for their opponents to think they have drowned. I also got a real kick out of the final sequence of the film. If you're a fan of ""The Dark Knight"", it will really blow your mind. There's a lot of enticing action here and despite the fact that ultimately you can see where the movie is going to go, it will sweep you up in all of its intrigue, spy work and action.I'd say the ending of the movie drags a bit, but it's nothing too serious. I am not overly familiar with the Bond films, having seen maybe a dozen or so, but this is one of the movies that compelled me to buy the nice fancy 50 years of Bond Box Set and add it to my shelf. I think you'll have a great time with it. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 2014)",Thunderball
156,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,Animal cruelty: Sharks getting shot at exempts this movie,1,12 September 2020,"My initial review of this movie is below of what I am now realtering: latter part of movie it appears like Bond just shoots a shark while in a helicopter, is this real, appears so. This is an immense error in judgement and exempts this movie. Also severely shades the ""dir."" Mr. Young for his other two Bonds Dr. No and FRWL. Already I was not into this Snoreball until I start to come around to it thus the below review until this realization.Title: A technical achievement, logic shown A-B-C This has a real prowess inits technical aspect and in this I mean the way all the different elements that go into making a movie are, people are in synchronized mode, fine tuned, and on all cylinders to bring this movie to fruit. This is a movie that I have actually grown appreciation for since I originally saw it. What I say about the technical aspect is it just has a sense of total earthliness in the way it appears, everything is very extensive: 1.The movie is pretty lengthy, 2.The island location has a very lavish appearance, cozy at points, and others a certain lonesome streak that nature occasionally has, a cold shadow that I'll explain more, mixed with the fun. 3.Bond does a lot, almost hilariously singlehandedly 4.There is a lot of teamwork nonetheless around him (???) and the opposition. 5.There is loads of gadgetry in here in the way of mechanical equipment like scuba dive gear, and ships shown, because the movie takes place on islands. 6.There is also lots of exposition dialogue, exposition being dialogue that specifically is said to move along the plot, (not dialogue that's just purely for entertainment purpose for instance.) which I find fascinating, and adds to all of these Points of Extensiveness I just say here. I really admire this technical aspect of this movie which does occasionally overwhelm the entertainment factor which is interesting. Everything in the movie that I explain is done well so this movie should be just perfect yes? Well I think it's the exposition dialogue overwhelmingness mixed with too much footage of the scuba/ship gear and my rationale is they just want to not skip anything but reveal this extensive stuff to show it's a big deal, and there's lots of information that has to be said between characters and all of the gear to show how the good guys and bad guys achieve all of their stuff mechanically like from A-B-C. So the logic in this movie is definitely there because nothing is skipped of that A-B-C, all of the exposition dialogue is there, all of the mechanical machinery is shown in process throughout the plans of good guys and badguys. I speak of the one intriguing part of the natural locale of the islands and this is something subtly done in that at one point there's lots of coziness, but some points of there's this somber far-off lonesomeness when they show other far off island bits, when Bond is in some surface grotto like a cave waiting to get grabbed by a helicopter, you wonder how no human would want to be there themselves or how many have gone through those harsh swept island bits on some travels, hopefully in pleasant mode, because nature is a good gauge meter of where you are inside yourself, either cozy or lone sense, if the latter well damn It better be temporary. The eyes of nature are a good meter of where you are in yourself. The cozy parts are, actually lots of nightspots like the party scenes or a giant carnival, fun. Some of the connoisseur food is delight in here, beluga caviar(mmm), conch(clam) chowder, and of course beverages of alcoholic type(I find these amusing but personally alcohol's effects don't interest me, I find the brain rewires itself few years later to have things like iced beverages/soda do trick of easing but everyone's mileage varies with this.) I think the prowess of the movie is these night sequences, that include a cruising scene of Bond and a villain in 1 car through some night woods. This movie shows smidges of action in sparse parts. I also truly appreciate different facial expressions in people here. The nightlife is like this utter resort of people truly in vacation mode. This movie is like a celebration of nightlife basically, but pulsates with all of the spy intrigue nonetheless. Now the OTHER thing is the level of grit, I'm talking pure action which, is THE thing that has to payoff that is the bread and butter of these movies and I gotta say there's a bit more guns, a scuffle in the beginning and end so it's like bookends. On the length of the movie at some point when most of the plot is set up around the midpoint the movie enters that part where things breeze along most on that equilibrium of action, just lots of scuba gear battles, and some prowling around those sunlit islands. Again I just truly appreciate how the movie truly shows the logic, the technical achievement, over things like lapses in logic occasionally just to create a sense of fun. The fun itself is when technical things and logic are achieved, THERE is from where fun blooms. I must achieve also at all costs, technical prowess.",Thunderball
157,stormhawk2021,Look Up! Look Down!,9,19 June 2017,"This is the fourth entry in the James Bond series, and this timearound Bond once again finds himself squaring off against international criminal organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E.- specifically their member Emilio Largo- an eye patch wearing nut job who drops enemies and ineffectual henchman into a tank full of hungry sharks. Largo has hijacked a NATO nuclear bomber and hidden the bombs in the ocean depths. He gives the British government one week to pay him a ransom of 1,000,000 pounds or else he'll launch the weapons. Well, it doesn't take long before Bonds sets of for Nassau to foil this diabolical plot, and he's get a few beautiful woman to accompany him along the way. This is a fun one. It's Connery (once again), and, while he's not as strong as he was in the previous two entries, he's still quite strong here, and very comfortable with the role. It's a solid film, but maybe one of my least favorite of the Connery era. It's not a bad movie, just not quite as exciting as some of the others. It's a bit goofy, but I think it really only adds to the charm. Plus, we get some great underwater scenes, and those are quite well done, especially for the time period. Those are some of the best parts, but the cinematography in general is quite good, and there's some okay land sequences as well. With a decent title theme from Tom Jones, a fine score in general, and an entertaining title sequence, this is a really fun movie, and a decent entry in the long running series. Give it a go.",Thunderball
158,jonathanruano,Thunderball (1965) - Review,7,17 July 2010,"After a few years, I decided to see ""Thunderball"" again and found myself having a good time. This particular James Bond film does pale in comparison to its three brilliant predecessors - ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia with Love,"" and ""Goldfinger."" The underwater fight sequences are the weakest part of the picture. Despite all the inventiveness of director Terence Young, firing harpoon guns, ripping off underwater goggles, and underwater knife fights are not particularly thrilling when shown again and again and again. Worse still, a decision was made to have the big fight at the end take place almost entirely underwater. Additionally, a mixed verdict has to be delivered in regard to the villains. Adolfo Celi just does not seem that scary or interesting as the main villain Largo, even though his plan is to threaten to blow up Miami with nuclear weapons unless he's paid a lot of money. However, Luciana Paluzzi plays a great villain Fiona who is both seductive and dangerous at the same time. There is not a scene in this movie where Paluzzi is not fun to watch (including one where she thinks nothing about killing Bond after having sex with him) and, on top of that, she made the wise decision not to get involved in any of the boring underwater scenes. Along with Paluzzi, there are many other elements in this James Bond movie that work. Sean Connery shows once again that he is the best actor ever to play James Bond. He effortlessly seduces beautiful women, exudes genuine fear even in ridiculous situations (like being shackled to a rapidly moving spine stretcher or a rapidly accelerating car), and has a mischievous personality. In fact, Thunderball usually works despite being thin on plot because it shows the various ways that James Bond uses his mischievous personality to defeat the bad guys and save Miami. Moreover, the Bond women in this picture are the most beautiful probably out of any Bond picture. Domino (Claudine Auger) and Paula (Martine Beswick) are more attractive than 90% of the models currently in business. But Luciana Paluzzi ends up blowing the competition out of the water, because she plays a Bond girl and the best villain in the whole movie - a great combination. Lastly, the movie usually makes the espionage world of James Bond pretty entertaining. There are great fight sequences in the château, where James Bond murders a rival, vandalizes an entire room, and stages a dramatic escape. Another great scene which never fails is where Bond is receiving a briefing from the Home Secretary on the nuclear threat to the whole world and SPECTRE's ransom demands, followed by an audience with ""M"" (head of the secret service). The sequence where James Bond takes on everyone at Largo's estate is also convincingly staged, even though on the face of it is completely suicidal. Finally we see Sean Connery's James Bond get into trouble and get out of trouble repeatedly in order to thwart Largo and end the movie mid-air with one of the hottest Bond girls. So if one can skip the underwater sequences and overlook Celi, Thunderball is a pretty entertaining ride.",Thunderball
159,TheHande,Speed Boats and Nuclear Weapons,5,14 February 2007,"Thunderball is an example of a Bond film that starts out interesting, but turns boring and excessive towards the end. Thunderball suffers from its over-emphasis on gadgetry, becoming too campy to bare. The films attempts at being more serious with other scenes just creates an uncomfortable contrast that doesn't enhance the film in any way.The villain's plot in its intricacy is interesting to watch, but after that everything falls to pieces in the fashion of Largo's speed boat. The film is made slightly interesting by a larger cast of supporting characters, but the over-all weakness of the plot, backed by a rather disappointing climax makes this a very flat Bond to watch.Even Connery's typical charm can't save the film from it's excessiveness. This goes to the bottom of my Bond-film list along with 'Man with the Golden Gun'.",Thunderball
160,antagonist117,The last great Connery Bond,7,17 June 2013,"One of the best 1960s Bonds for its rich sets, witty quips that are actually witty, and exotic Caribbean filming locations. The movie's women, both the goodies and the baddies, are surprisingly strong and multifaceted for a Bond film. The underwater scenes that make up about a quarter of the movie's relatively long run-time are occasionally impressive but more often cause the mind to wander. Far better than Connery's next Bond outing, ""You Only Live Twice,"" but not as good as his best, ""From Russia With Love."" Here for the final time Blofeld is still a shadowy figure identifiable only by his modulated voice, and that helps give the film a sinister and dangerous atmosphere that some of the more campy Bond movies lack.",Thunderball
161,rparham,"This film strikes like a ""Thunderball""",8,12 November 2006,"Thunderball is often cited as being something of a letdown after Goldfinger, and to some degree this is the case. Thunderball lacks as strong a female character, the villain isn't quite in Goldfinger's league and film's concluding quarter drags on a bit long. That being said, Thunderball is still a strong entry in the Bond canon and worth seeing.The plot of Thunderball finds global terrorist organization SPECTRE hijacking two nuclear warheads from NATO thanks to the placement of a double for one of the officers on board the plane carrying them, Major Francois Derval (Paul Stassino). The operation is being masterminded by SPECTRE agent Emile Largo (Adolfo Celi), who also happens to be the guardian of Derval's sister, Domino (Claudine Auger). After the warheads are captured, Bond puts two and two together regarding Derval and travels to Nassau, where Domino and Largo are currently located, with the belief that the warheads are not far away. He runs into Largo's associate, Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi), who proves to be a mix of sex and danger, and quickly realizes that Largo is behind the theft of the warheads.Thunderball is one of the first large-scale Bond films, filled with elaborate action sequences and some exotic locations. It also features a somewhat more involved plot than Goldfinger, but not exceptionally so. It was with Thunderball that the filmmakers really tried to wow the audience with spectacle, and for the most part it works. However, it was also in Thunderball that the Bond series began to expand its running time and open up a bit, and this would prove to be something of a mixed bag. Thunderball is entertaining, no doubt, but it is somewhat on the long side. It seemed that producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had believed that to keep bringing in audiences they needed to expand the scope and length of the films, and that just wasn't so (Fleming's Bond novels were rarely more than 230 pages). Thunderball is hardly a snooze fest, it is full of what audiences are there to see a Bond film for, it just overstays it's welcome a little bit. One of the key culprits of this is the film's latter portion, including a long, drawn out underwater battle. After a few minutes, watching anonymous swimmers fight and shoot each other with harpoon guns becomes a bit monotonous, and kills some of the film's momentum.When identifying the success of a Bond film, at least two elements have to be considered: the girl and the villain. On both counts, Thunderball isn't quite a successful as its immediate predecessor. Claudine Anger is certainly attractive enough, but her character is bit limp and nowhere near as entertaining as Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore was. She's by no means the weakest Bond girl, but not a great one either. Adolfo Celi had big shoes to fill after Gert Frobe, and can't quite live up to them. He is appropriately dastardly as Largo, but not quite in the same league as Goldfinger. Thunderball does succeed at giving Bond his first female henchman in the form of Fiona Volpe, and Luciana Paluzzi proves to be one of the more memorable elements in the film. Her Fiona is both sexy and downright nasty and proves a nice counterpoint to Goldfinger's Oddjob. Despite a return of the Aston Martin in the early scenes in the film, Thunderball was a little short on gadgetry, preferring to rely on its location and action to set it apart, and that works just fine. The underwater material is different and the location is very attractive, to be sure. Many of the action sequences are well staged as well, it is mostly the last quarter of the film that is a bit repetitive.Thunderball is a strong Bond film, without a doubt, and more or less Connery's last really good one. It just had the unfortunate luck of following on the heels of Goldfinger and From Russia With Love, and is just not quite in their league.",Thunderball

By this point of course Bond had already reached Major Stardom status and the directors and actors needed new exciting adventures to partake in. He had already done so many exciting things in the good but a little boring ""Dr. No"" the absolutely stunning movie ""From Russia With Love"" and the classic and not as classic as number 2 ""Goldfinger"" and the audience was expecting for each Bond film to be bigger and better then the last. What they decided to make for a popular film was Thunderball.In this Bond film, Bond has many more gadgets then previous films, and who can forget the great escape he did in the short but exciting entry into the film and from there we see some of the best action in any Connery film before and after this. Anyway Sean gives another great performance in this movie and the end underwater fighting scene is dramatic and the action very well directed and acted by all of the crew alike. They really put their heart and soles into keeping this movie great.As for the Bond girl, she is another Bond girl that does n't actually does much and most of the time runs around in the bikini, but really that IS Sean Connery Bond, and even though he is a sexist we must all remember the different time Bond lives in.Overall, this Bond film is not up to the standards of previous films ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" but I do prefer it over ""Dr. No"".

163,vranger,Bond slips just a bit,7,3 April 2009,"Sadly, it only took until the 4th Bond movie for the series to start to slip a bit. Maybe the fourth film in four years was trying the patience of the director to film dedicated spy stories.Most of the movie stays somewhat true to the novel, and indeed gives the spy flavor that Bond stories deserve in order to really be Bond stories.Unfortunately, the underwater battle between 'scuba diver armies' at the end is an unneeded attempt to put a real action spark into the film. The sequence is ridiculous, and marks the true start of the really stupid good vs. evil army battles that would mark the climax of a disheartening number of Bond movies over the next 15 years or so.Still, this is a Bond movie, and well worth watching.",Thunderball

The opening scene is pure James Bond complete with jet pack and a belting song by Tom Jones, the only male singer up to that date. In many instances this film has all the classic Bond touches but this is the first time we really get to see a beautiful Bond villainess with shocking red hair and an evil snarl. The parade in downtown Nasau will be repeated in one form or another in many Bond films but it's the sudden killing of Fiona that stands out. The downside to the film is the overly long opening to set up the movie premise, I timed over 30 minutes until the plane has been camouflaged and the nukes escorted out of the plane. The battle under the sea is just as long. Even the cool water gliders complete with harpoons only provide mild excitement that quickly fades away. Largo as a villain pales in comparison to Dr. No or Goldfinger.

The film is a mix of revolutionary technology, British humor, sex and gorgeous women. In 1965 it was unbelievable to see such films.

166,Slarkshark,The Most Savage. The Most Dangerous,9,3 August 2021,"Also, the most beautiful Bond film from the scenery, water, and the women. The diving is what sets this Bond film apart. It is exquisite, and I enjoyed every second of those underwater scenes. Bond is as witty as he's ever been with so many one liners.Largo and Fiona are ruthless villains with tons of style, much like the Golden Grotto. Largo with his eye patch is definitely up there when it comes down to terrific bond villains.I know Connery has been quoted saying 'From Russia with Love' was his favourite, which is totally fair. However, 'Thunderball' is my favourite of his, and I'm sure he was a fan of it too as it is only fitting he took up residence and spent his last days in Nassau.",Thunderball
167,ryan_kuhn,"""I hope we didn't scare the fishes.""",8,11 August 2005,"If there was a perfect setting for a Bond movie, the Bahamas was it. We get to see beautiful women strut around in very little, the ladies got to see Sean Connery strut around in very little, and the seaside locations opened up vast possibilities when it comes to action scenes that are thrilling and seem fresh, even though they are basically the same chase sequences we've seen in the previous three Bond films. They say Thunderball is Connery's favorite of the Bond films he starred in, and it may because Bond carries most of the action throughout the film. Unlike Goldfinger, where Bond is captured and does most of his work through dialog, Thunderball features a Bond swimming, running, jumping, shooting, running some more, and swimming in a shark infested pool. Thunderball also features Largo (Adolfo Celi), SPECTRE's #2 man (notice the eye patch Largo wears and the one Robert Wagner wears in Austin Powers, coincidence?????), and Largo is almost as enjoyable as a villain as Goldfinger was, almost as suave as Bond, a cunning villain who soaks up the scenes he's in. The crowning achievement of Thunderball are the tricky underwater action sequences where most of Largo's plan takes place. As I said about Goldfinger, the plot doesn't matter, just sitting back and watch Bond do what he does in the manner that he does it is why we watch. Tom Jones is the principal singer for the movie's soundtrack, adding an added sexual energy to the movie. Must be something about the tropical setting, but this movie is dripping with sexual tension, with the biggest laugh of the movie coming from Bond's response to a woman in bathtub asking for something to wear. The man certainly can think on his feet.",Thunderball
168,vailsy,"Nice underwater theme, but gets pretty boring",5,18 May 2008,"This certainly has all the elements for a great Bond film but despite some memorable moments, it gets pretty boring and feels very long A lot of scenes are fairly pointless and it's really a plot by numbers at times. Bond finds this clue then onto the next scene and so on, with the film never really settling down. It'd probably have to rate as one of the noisiest early bonds too with lots of ridiculously loud scenesAs normal it's great in a retro way, with lots of interesting gadgets making for some great sound effects. The underwater propulsion vehicles sound particularly brilliant For underwater action though I prefer 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. 'Dr No' wins out on the beach theme with a superior Bond girl. 'Live and Let Die' is better for a Caribbean flavour etcOverall not one of my favourite Bonds, and not the franchises finest hour",Thunderball

170,carologletree,"A Huge Step Down From the First 3, but Still Decent",6,7 January 2016,"Some people consider this to be in the higher echelon of the James Bond series, but I'm not one of them. The film is fairly entertaining and has a some things going for it, but there are lots of flaws that bring the film down.First off, the film is about 20 minutes too long, and it didn't have as much action as I would have liked. The plot isn't bad, but it isn't terribly interesting and it does feel quite formulaic at times.There are also far too many slow scenes that really tend to drag on. The underwater battle at the end, while beautifully choreographed, got very boring after a while.However, the film isn't bad by any means. Sean Connery is every bit as good as ever, and Emilio Largo, played by Adolfo Celi, is a terrific villain. He is very sinister and he's 10x better than Klaus Brandauer's underwhelming portrayal as Maximillian Largo in the remake, ""Never Say Never Again."" His henchmen were quite dull, however.Claudine Auger's Domino is one of the most attractive Bond girls and the film is beautifully shot, taking place in the Bahamas. The music score by John Barry and theme song by Tom Jones are also stand-outs and the cool sequence with the jet pack is one of the better pre-credit sequences in the series.This film is not one of my favorite Bond films, but it certainly isn't the worst of the series or even Connery's worst. It's worth a look if you're a fan of the series. It just wasn't really my cup of tea.RATING: C+",Thunderball
171,Ibuk,Woefully under-appreciated Bond movie,6,9 May 2009,"Thunderball had the misfortune of being released just after three superb Bond entries(Dr No,FRWL and Goldfinger) and is generally regarded as the weakest of the first four. Whilst that is partly true, if Bond fans see it as a separate movie and with an objective mind there is a lot of fun to be had in this Bond entry.A criminal mastermind(Emile Largo) has hatched a plan to steal some nuclear warheads and hold the world to ransom. He intends to achieve that by making one of his men look identical to one of the pilots and kill the real pilot and put the fake one in his place. What Emile Largo doesn't count on is Bond recuperating in the same health spa as the real pilot. Bond notices some strange goings on but doesn't look much into it. Emile Largo's succeeds in stealing the nuclear warheads and Bond is sent on a mission to prevent his plan being successful. Thunderball boasts of a pretty good theme song(by Tom Jones) and some spectacular underwater sequences along with some great fight sequences. On top of that there is a great villain in the form of Emile Largo and a great sexy Bond girl(Domino). The only flaw Thunderball has is that it does take a while to get going, usually in a Bond movie there is an opening sequence, the theme song and normally it skips to Bond entering M's office. Thunderball focuses more on Largo's plan and therefore it takes at least half an hour to get going. After that however there is a lot of fun to be had.",Thunderball
172,matija-trost,"WELL, YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL...",6,22 April 2004,"...says 007, after he failed to convert a woman after making love to her (just remember Goldfinger). And yet, he was right. This one in the series is certainly not a winner. Why? Well, a new year and a new James Bond. In 1965, when Malcom X was murdered, Color TV and mini-skirts became part of our life, the fourth 007 was released. And it had quite a hard job. To beat ""Goldfinger"", probably the best Bond till now. Did he succeed?At my opinion...No. Despite always charming Sean Connery and witty humor lines, beautiful & chesty Bond ""villain-girl"" (25 years old Italian Luciana Paluzzi) and exotic locations (The Bahamas), I just couldn't get rid a feeling, that this is probably one of the slowest 007 movie. Despite the fact that the first hour is great, with classy opening scene and a sequel in England (Shrublands health spa), but soon we are witness too a slow paced underwater scenes, where I nearly fell a sleep. Not to mention the boring end. Although it got some peaks, before mention witty lines by 007, ""blond bombshell"" therapist (25 years old Mollie Peters) and a famous line ""What I did this evening was for king and country, you don't think it gave me any pleasure, do you?""...ahhh, pure 007. But still, too long and slow paced underwater scenes prevents me to rate this one higher as6 out of 10.",Thunderball
173,C22Man,Lightning strikes just enough times,5,6 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Not sure what it means, but it sounds pretty cool if that counts.Pre-Titles: We get a really exciting pre-titles sequence that sees Bond engage in a vicious fight with a SPECTRE agent who was disguised as a woman before fleeing via jetpack. It's great that some action is provided straight from the off and the fight itself is fast and fierce with Barry's pounding score as a backdrop. The jetpack is a bit silly, but it's still memorable and allows for a unique getaway.Theme Song: Welsh crooner Tom Jones puts in a decent vocal performance, but its John Barry's excellent work that makes the song great. The main hook stays in your head and the punchy instrumentation fits perfectly into the action setting.Plot: SPECTRE number 2 Emilio Largo implements a plan to steal two nuclear warheads and use them to hold NATO to ransom. Bond is sent to the Bahamas to follow Largo's trail and find where the warheads are hidden before it's too late. The plot has all the makings for an intense story, though it is told well enough it never takes full advantage of what could have been a gripping story. It takes far too long to get going and nothing is left for the audience to work out, it shows us exactly what is happening and that takes some of the edge off proceedings. Most of the film feels like James Bond on holiday and that isn't a bad thing, but it makes everything seem slow and a bit uninteresting.James Bond: Sean Connery carries on his more charming and witty turn that we saw in Goldfinger. I'd say that this is his Bond at his most relaxed as he remains cool and composed even when confronted by danger, but he isn't afraid to use brute force either. I think Connery again covers every aspect well, is fun to watch and it's the last Bond film where he looks like he truly cares.Bond Girls: Claudine Auger as Domino is something of a mixed performance. She looks the part, but she struggles to show true emotions and she doesn't really do much. The character isn't fleshed out very well and it's difficult to truly care about her as a result. Martine Beswick is underused as Bond's ally Paula and is a bit of a pointless addition. Villains: Adolfo Celi is a contender for the most boring Bond villain of all time as Largo, simply giving someone as eyepatch doesn't make them interesting. Celi does have a good look, but he again suffers from poor writing. I can't recall a single line of dialogue he has and in most of his scenes he just stands around looking annoyed. Luciana Paluzzi is excellent however as femme- fatale Fiona Volpe. She has an understated intensity, great lines and is the most believable threat to Bond here.Support: The funnily named Rik Van Nutter steps in as Leiter and does an okay job. He looks pretty cool and has a calming presence, but at this point Leiter is simply Bond's lackey and just takes orders. Bernard Lee is excellent again in his few scenes as a more anxious M.Action: The action ranges from decent to horrendously boring. There are far too many underwater scenes, all of which are slow and bring to the pace to a grinding halt. Bond fighting of henchmen and sharks is pretty cool at first, but it gets boring quickly. The climax is an absolute mess and it's like they didn't know how to end the film so they threw as much on screen as possible. It is impossible to tell who is who, the effects are ropey even for the time and the confrontation with Largo is a massive let down.Score: John Barry provides another excellent score. Many familiar rhythms make a welcomed return and his new compositions are all really good too. He makes some of the underwater scenes more enjoyable and, like Connery, he is firmly settled into his role by this point.Production Values: Firstly the film does look fantastic. The Bahamas was the perfect location for such an exotic adventure and it is captured in all its sparkling glory here, everything from the golden beaches to the clear waters look amazing. Terence Young keeps the low-key look that he went for in the first two films, but adds a bit more colour and style to proceedings. It's nice that he continued to develop and he does create some really effective shots throughout. The editing is a big issue however. As I've stated the underwater scenes drag on for too long and given how slow they are it can get quite tedious. I also thing that too much time is taking up explaining every detail of the plot and that the section in the health spar does go on too long. There aren't any really impressive sets of note either given the location.Conclusion: Thunderball has just enough engaging elements to keep things entertaining despite its many flaws. It is undoubtedly an extremely stylish film. It is also clear that Connery is as enjoyable as ever as Bond, the locations are wonderful and that there is an interesting story at the root of it all. But it does have glaring issues with Largo being extremely dull, Domino not being that interesting, mostly weak action sequences and the underwater scenes drag on forever. I think that if anything Thunderball was a case of everyone trying to go even bigger than they did on Goldfinger and it's not the right type of story for that even if it is good fun.",Thunderball
174,Kakueke,"Nice backdrop, women",10,14 October 2001,"Beautiful Caribbean backdrops, chiefly in Nassau, over and under the water, contribute to making this one of the best Bonds.  There was enough good stuff here to largely sustain the Goldfinger momentum without being too tiresome.  Bond is witty and all conquering, as usual, and the villain, Largo, sustains so many humiliations that one almost feels for him.  Well, OK, one aspect in which Bond was not all-conquering was with Fiona Volpe (Lucianna Paluzzi), as she stated herself--altho he conquered in the most important senses.  Not converted to angel choirs in this movie, Fiona is my all-time favorite, sexiest Bond woman.  There is perhaps the best Bond male fantasy scene in a spa with Patricia Flemming (Molly Peters).  In fact, with Paula (Martine Beswick) and principal Bond woman Domino (Claudine Auger), this flick has the best Bond women, in my book. Some of the progression in the second half of the film is somewhat hard to follow.  All in all, very enjoyable, highly recommended.",Thunderball
175,Mikew3001,A psychedelic masterpiece!,10,18 February 2002,"Next to the (inofficial) agent movie parody ""Casino Royal"", the fourth James Bond movie ""Thunderball"" is the most psychedelic and romantic part of the series. Though some people miss the pacing and the style of ""Goldfinger"" here, it's still an outstanding movie of the sixties. The settings are restricted to Nassau/Bahamas, but show some of the most colorful and exotic places like a carnival parade and a groovy South Sea cocktail lounge. The best of all scenes are Rico Browning's brilliant shot underwater sequences under villain Largo's luxury yacht ""Disco Volante"", showing breath-taking submarine moods, well-arranged action drama, underwater chases and a great sound track consisting of Tom Jones' cool title theme and psychedelic orchestral loops by John Barry.

This movie is not nearly as good as that one, and neither is it as good as the first two movies. But that does not in any capacity make it a bad movie.All the ingredients for a good Bond-movie are to be found here, Sean Connery is charming as always in his role, the villains, once again being the criminal organisation known as SPECTRE, are delightfully and over-the top evil, and the love interest, whilst serving a clear purpose as eye-candy for the main hero, has an interesting sub-story in her own right.The visual effects, which actually managed to win an Oscar, are jaw-dropping. The under-water action scenes are a true testiment to the eye of perfection director Terence Young (back again after taking a break from the franchise).This movie might not be as good as any of what came before, but it's still an important and recommended watch when looking at the Bond-series, and not one that should be missed!I give it an 8 out of 10.",Thunderball

181,susansweb,Makes it until the end.,6,21 January 2003,"One of the few Bond movies to follow the book very closely.  But that may be part of it's downfall.  Parts of the book that come off very well look pretty silly in the movie.  The most notable one is the underwater battle at the end.  It goes on way too long and the shots of the battle overhead make one ask why didn't they just strafe the area from a helicopter?  Then it gets really silly with the super boat.  But up until that point this is a good movie.  The whole scheme seems believable and pulled off very chillingly (never renegotiate with SPECTRE).  The scene with Blofeld is very well done and Adolfo Celi is perfectly cast as No. 2.  But for my money the best casting job was the lovely Luciana Paluzzi as the evil Fiona.  Of all the Bond girls, she tops my list as the best.  Her scenes with Bond were all memorable and her last one contains the best Bond quip of them all (you'll have to see it to find out).  But sadly, the last 20 to 30 minutes of the movie almost make one forget the greatness of the earlier part and thus the movie cannot be considered one of the better Bond films.",Thunderball
182,rjsf96,Under the Sea,8,1 October 2015,"After the outrageous thrills of 'Goldfinger' it would be unwise to think that 'Thunderball' had a chance of bettering its predecessor. It ends up amounting to the lesser of the Bond films from the sixties, but is fun nonetheless.Bond manages to find himself up against another member of SPECTRE. Emilio Largo has stolen two nuclear warheads and plans to activate them unless his price is met by the British Government. Bond most locate the warheads and deactivate them, in order to ensure that war is evaded.The key for any Bond film to succeed relies on one key element; the villain. As Bond is extremely talented, he requires a worthy opponent; someone who can match his skills and provide a challenge to overcome. Largo fails to live up to the standards set by previous villains such as Grant and Goldfinger. Apart from his eye patch there is little to remember him by. If Bond was given the opportunity to dispatch Largo in the early moments of the film then it would all be over in a matter of minutes.The women however, actually serve a purpose in this instalment other than standing around looking pretty. The Bond girl this time, Domino helps Bond against Largo and her talent extends beyond her good looks. Whereas, Fiona Volpe who works with Largo, acts as a much more compelling villain and is the first femme fatale that the series has to offer. Volpe personally wants to be responsible for Bond's demise and fantasies about it with relish.'Thunderball' unwisely has a runtime exceeding two hours. This leads to a final act that becomes ponderous. An underwater battle. The stakes feel far too low, because we cannot tell who is fighting whom. I know I lost interest and it's a shame, tighter editing could have fixed the majority of the film's problems and it would be a greater Bond film as a result. It sadly lacks the forward momentum of 'From Russia with Love' and 'Goldfinger'; it cannot hold a candle to their sheer power.'Thunderball' is a solid if underwhelming action film. The best roles are given to the women and that's great because it distinguishes itself from its more talented brethren. However, in a series of twenty three films nearing twenty four, that can only get you so far. Largo lacks the power that we have come to expect from a memorable Bond villain and he's just not interesting to watch. Unfortunately 'Thunderball' remains a lesser Bond film that with some minor tweaks and fine tuning could have been great. But, at the end of the day that's all that the film amounts to, a solid Bond film that should have been great.",Thunderball

184,stp43,Engaging Mixture Of Action And Character Interplay,8,14 November 2002,"Thunderball is the third and final of the Terence Young-directed Bond films, and is also the longest. While it drags at points, the length of the film nonetheless adds to the interplay of the characters.The film marks the return of the criminal enterprise SPECTRE, opening with a tense business meeting giving a clue to the sheer size of the organization. The ruthlessness of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (still unseen other than via the gorgeous Persian cat he lovingly strokes) is shown when a case of embezzlement is detected and its perpetrator electrocuted. The main plot then unfolds, as SPECTRE operative Emilio Largo outlines his plan to hijack an RAF nuclear bomber and use its war-load to blackmail the world. The crime itself is witnessed by the audience, a la the formula of the later Columbo series, and as with Lt. Columbo the suspense comes not from figuring out what happened but witnessing if James Bond can piece together the right clues to himself figure it out.This allows for quite a bit of character interplay, a quality lost by critics who attack the film's length and the fact that SPECTRE's action is seen beforehand. One of the better scenes comes via the first meeting in the film between James Bond and Felix Leiter (here played by Rik Van Nutter, who looks like football coach Pete Carroll), which occurs amid James' smoking out of a hidden assassin. The assassin is chased off, and gets his when he has to report to Largo.Though some scenes seem irrelevant, Terence Young doesn't waste anything, and once one gets used to the film's length it will come across as among the best of the Bond series.",Thunderball
185,TankGuy,"""Look Up! Look Down! Look Out!""",10,18 August 2015,"A Vulcan bomber carrying two nuclear warheads is hijacked by international crime syndicate SPECTRE. The jet is downed off the coast of The Bahamas where SPECTRE agents proceed to capture the warheads. Unless a ransom of £100 million in diamonds is paid the organisation will use the bombs to obliterate a city in either Great Britain or the United States. James Bond(Sean Connery)has only four days to recover the warheads, so he races to the Caribbean to find them and do battle with SPECTRE once more...Tipped to be the ""biggest Bond of all"", this fourth instalment in the 007 franchise certainly lives up to expectations. Not only did Thunderball replicate the stratospheric success of the first three Bond movies, it multiplied that success, grossing millions more worldwide. It would be (unofficially) remade eighteen years later as Never Say Never Again, also starring an older Sean Connery as an (illegitimate) Bond. Thunderball was one of my favourite films as a kid and has actually aged surprisingly well watching it now. Some of the dialogue did make me cringe a little but the script offers the obligatory Bond-isms that always make one chuckle(Bond, after harpooning a SPECTRE henchman on a beach-""I think he got the point""). Sean Connery is evidently loving his role as our globe trotting action hero and this is where the appeal stems from. Each Bond movie is unique in that every film is remembered solely for a different factor or plot element. In the case of Thunderball, that factor is the tight underwater sequences. Professionally shot, the lengthy underwater melee between hoards of SPECTRE frogmen and dozens of U.S navy SEALS was a rousing segment of action. Thunderball benefits fully from masterful cinematography and I was thoroughly impressed with shots of the realistically mocked up Vulcan bomber ferociously tearing up the skies as well as it's subsequent crash into the ocean. There is also a lot of undercranking(shooting footage at a slower frame rate so that the action appears to be super fast when played back)throughout the film, especially during the action scenes. Some will argue that this dates the movie horribly, but in my opinion the utilisation of this technique makes the action scenes in older movies like this one all the more enjoyable.Thunderball offers capable acting talent as well as some of the finest looking Bond girls the series has ever seen. Tom Jones' title song was good but it has never been one of my favourites. John Barry's orchestral score on the other hand marks some of the composer's best work. The soundtrack is slowed down for the scenes underwater and then sped up for the scenes on dry land which magnifies the excitement. The electrifying action sequences were given added punch thanks to magnificent special effects work(Those explosions were amazing!). Said action scenes never fail to disappoint and were executed in spectacular Bond fashion. The movie begins with an excellently choreographed fistfight followed by a rousing jetpack ride. Then we have a brief but rollicking car chase featuring the iconic Aston Martin DB5 as well as an intense foot chase through a crowded carnival procession. The aforementioned underwater battle was taut, it's one of the most chilling action sequences ever seen in the franchise!. Thunderball climaxes with an edge-of-your-seat naval battle between the U.S navy and SPECTRE henchmen before ending, quite literally with a bang as there is a fantastic brawl on the bridge of an out of control hydrofoil! James Bond would get better with each film as the 60s progressed and Thunderball is one of the franchise' most fondly remembered efforts. A rip roaring actioner that provides a couple of hours of unapologetic escapism, Thunderball is a sublime entry in the Bond series. 10/10",Thunderball
186,simonrosenbaum,No Thunder and as for the.....,3,20 November 2007,"Having watched this last night it's my new least favourite Bond film. There's far far too much action underwater which really slows it down, and I got totally confused with all the women, they all to seemed to look very similar. Things takes so long to happen I kept forgetting what the plot was. A lot of the scenes and locations were reminiscent of the previous three films. It had very little humour in it and very little action that wasn't underwater. I did find the last 15 minutes pretty good including that last underwater fight but it takes a long time to get there. If it was re-edited with at least 30 mins taken out there could be a half decent film there. Definitely the worst Connery entry and that includes 'Never Say Never Again' (3/10)",Thunderball

188,glenn-aylett,Watched Thunderball again and gave it an extra star,8,12 March 2012,"Thunderball was the fourth Bond in the franchise and expectations were very high after the massive success of Goldfinger( Thunderball actually grossed over a billion dollars at today's prices). Certainly the plot was promising: SPECTRE steal two nuclear missiles and threaten to blow up two major cities in England and America if a ransom of £ 100 million is not paid. Also the reappearance of the Aston Martin from Goldfinger early on, a villain in drag( shades of Diamonds Are Forever, but very daring for 1965) and SPECTRE's secret headquarters made the first half hour very entertaining. Yet when the action switches to the Bahamas, where SPECTRE Number 2 Emilio Largo( played very convincingly by Adolfo Celi) is hiding the missiles, the film can be a little slow, as a fair part of it is filmed in the dark. I watched the underwater fight scenes and for all it's a little unclear who SPECTRE and the good guys are at first( SPECTRE wear black, Bond's allies wear orange, this is a very well choreographed and filmed fight scene that won an Oscar. As for the Bond villain, Emilio Largo, played by Adolfo Celi, he is prepared to slug it out with Bond in the end, which most villains tended to shy away from, and is only defeated when his ex partner, Domino, shoots him in the back. Along with Doctor No and the first two incarnations of Ernst Blofeld, Largo is one of my favourite Bond villains now as he is a callous killer with an eyepatch, but also one of the few who is prepared to fight Bond hand to hand.Thunderball isn't quite up there with Goldfinger and maybe expectations were too high, but I've watched it again and awarded it an extra star due to Adolfo Celi's character and the fight scene on the Disco Volante. As expected, Connery is in peak physical condition throughout and still delivers some awful but funny one liners, he got the point being one of the best when he kills Vargas with a harpoon gun. Claudine Auger is very good as Bond girl Domino too.",Thunderball
189,scott-sw,Good follow up to Goldfinger,10,11 January 2008,"Although I agree Goldfinger was a better film, Thunderball was a strong follow up in the James Bond series. In fact, I would put Thunderball in the top five James Bond movies. It definitely came out on during the Golden Age of Bond. Bond must stop a SPECTRE agent, Largo, from using two stolen nuclear bombs as extortion leverage against NATO. He infiltrates Largo's group by seducing his woman, Domino. This is what I liked about the early Bond adventures. At the core was simple politics, extortion, and possible terrorism. In essence, you have a believable, down-to-earth villain who does not wish to rule the world. He simply wants wealth. He also wants Domino but cannot have her. This is what makes Largo one of the better Bond villains (although Goldfinger was the best villain). For me personally, though, was the extended scenes shot underwater. As a Pices who loves to swim, and SCUBA Dive, I really got into the SCUBA scenes, as well as Bond evading the sharks in Largo's pool. Is it the best? No. Goldfinger has that title. But Thunderball is up there for good reasons.",Thunderball
190,Katz5,Fun but no Goldfinger,6,6 April 2021,"Thunderball is well-known for its extensive underwater action scenes - there is even a mention of them in the opening credits. It is goofier than Goldfinger (and definitely through the silly meter compared to From Russia with Love). It's also too long....this and You Only Live Twice are usually mentioned as the two least-effective Bond films of the '60s, ones for the diehard fans only. Things were getting gimmicky (Bond and his jet pack, seen once near the beginning of the film and never seen or mentioned again during the movie). SPECTRE is the main nemesis, although the villain is not nearly as memorable as Dr. No, Klebb, or Goldfinger. It is also the first film where Connery seems occasionally bored. One more movie before he quits....for the first time, at least.",Thunderball
191,wrestlingsitewebmaster,Thunderball 1965,10,8 October 2005,"This James Bond film was fantastic. The characters in the film were really interesting and every single actress/actress plays his/her part with professionalism.This film involved a lot of scenes involving water, but I'm not complaining, because it was really fascinating to see that instead of the usual dry land scenes. One interesting note was the scene in which Fiona Volpe fires the rocket at the car chasing 007, Bob Simmons the stunt driver was almost killed in the spectacular scene. Simmons also played the man dressed up as a women in the beginning of the film. Sadly Bob Simmons died in 1988.Rik Van Nutter (yeah, yeah even I laughed when I seen his last name!) played Felix Leiter in a fantastic fashion. He was cool and when a situation arose he was calm about it. Van Nutter who is now 75 years old was not asked to play the part again, for reasons which are unknown but he will always be remembered for being one of the more memorable actors to play Leiter along with Jack Lord (Dr No, 1962) and David Hedison (Live and Let Die, 1973 and Licence To Kill, 1989).The man they called Ernst Stavro Blofeld oh yes! was played by actor Anthony Dawson who played Professor Dent in Dr No. Although we don't see Dawson's face in the film his voice was dubbed so it could be more frightening and entertaining. Just seeing Dawson sitting in that chair behind the screen with that little white cat (isn't that cat a legend?!) sends the chills down your spine. Anthony Dawson sadly passed away in 1992 from cancer.Finally the villain who was wonderfully played by Adolfo Celi - Largo was a fascinating character. Even this SPECTRE agent had his love for a particular animal that being Golden Grotto sharks. As suspected Celi had his voice dubbed for the final version of the film. Unfortunately Celi passed away in 1986 from a heart attack.This film ranks up there with the best along with From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964) and if you like James Bond you'll like this! Overall Grade - A*",Thunderball
192,Skragg,"Very good in general, but best ""villainess"" of all.",10,22 February 2005,"I've always liked it in general, but I've always been attached to it for more lopsided reasons. The main reason is Lucianna Paluzzi as ""Fiona"", so I'm glad about some of the comments that have been made here. It seems like, if an actress is in only a few minutes of one of these movies, let alone a bigger role, she has that label ""Bond Girl"" attached to her (a mixed blessing, of course). But with this actress/character, it's just the opposite- I've read longish descriptions of the film without one mention of her. But - no offense to Claudine Auger/Domino - Fiona really steals the movie as far as female characters, good or bad, go. I know there have been complaints here, of a ""technical"" kind, about the showdown with Bond, Fiona and the gunman (problems with her height and so on). But I've always thought (as far as I've ""analysed"" it at all) that what he did was supposed to be a ""calculated risk"" on his part, simply enough. And as for the scene before it, in the hotel room - and this remark isn't a comment on nudity - it showed just how ""steamy"" a scene can be with a couple under bedsheets. I have only one complaint about that scene, and it's only a half-serious one. Afterwards, when Fiona reveals who she really is, Bond makes the stinging remark (and maybe that's all it's meant to be, I don't know), that the lovemaking gave him ""no pleasure"". Now, does anyone who sees Luciana / Fiona in that film, and who knows the Bond character, really believe he didn't enjoy her, enemy or not? In fact, after the bed scene, she banteringly calls him ""you sadistic brute"". So (to get into a slightly touchy area), maybe he combined the two things, by enjoying it AND making it a little rough for her. But ""no pleasure"" is pretty doubtful. Some Bond fans, maybe even a lot of them, consider Thunderball at least a relative disappointment, maybe even more than that. But to me (and evidently I'm not alone), the only disappointment comes after Fiona ""sits this one out."" I think there's never been a better ""femme fatale"" in the movies.",Thunderball
193,CalDexter,The Underwater 007 adventure.....and a S L O W build up!,8,2 June 2007,"Thunderball is a James Bond extravaganza that goes overboard in plot and pace unlike Dr. No and From Russia With Love. The film is enjoyable entertainment from start to finish but there are boring bits in between the action sequences which are far bigger and impressive for its time.The reason Thunderball gets an 8 Vote from me is because of the final fight sequence on board the Disco Vilonte. Very poor back screen projection makes the cruiser look like its flying through the Caribbean rather than on it, and it looks production hurried in this sequence too. Where on the other hand the underwater battle between S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agents and Sea Commandos is possibly the best sequence in the entire film.Sean Connery sleepwalks through the film, having surpassed himself in the previous three films, he still looks great in the role, more gaunt looking than he was in Goldfinger and with a hint of grey around the Toupee he wears its easy to see this was when he was starting to get tired of the role.

Helped by the CIA and Largo's mistress, Bond's search culminates in underwater battle with Largo's frogmen.

The gadgets are present, but not too cumbersome.

196,98nurdinm-1,"Wet, wild...and weak!",6,11 January 2005,"""Thunderball"" will probably be remembered as the first time the series showed signs of weakness. People have criticised it as being boring, slow, and with too many gadgets. The latter could certainly be said. ""Thunderball"" is the most gadget-laden film in the Sean Connery era, a harsh contrast to the glory days of the Ian Fleming original, and the ""stupid policeman"" of ""Dr. No"". That being said, the storyline is pretty good. SPECTRE plan to hold the world ransom with a pair of stolen nuclear warheads they have stashed away in the Caribbean. Our man Bond has to find them and stop the launch of the missiles before the worst happens. This helps the film a little in terms of relevance - the threat of nuclear war is still very real today as it was in the 1960s - but the vast quantity of underwater scenes do not. There are simply too many of them for a modern-day audience. We are used to seeing underwater film of this magnitude nowadays. It could be the terrifying images seen in Spielberg's breakthrough hit, ""Jaws"", or the beautifully animated CGI of ""Finding Nemo"". Not that a modern day audience will not appreciate and enjoy the film. Far from it. It delivers all the usual Bond ingredients shaken and not stirred. In terms of eye candy, Claudine Auger is both very beautiful and emotional as the tragic Domino, and as her 'evil twin', as it were, we have Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona Volpe, the first Bond girl to moan on the screen. Adolfo Celli plays Largo, the pirate-like agent of SPECTRE very well, but unfortunately the dubbing can be a little too obvious at times. He also does not pose much of a threat physically to Bond, and has the disadvantage of not having a silent but determined henchman at his side in the final battle - the snivelling Vargas is killed off 3/4 of the way through, making Bond state that ""he got the point"" rather too well. Some bad blue screening upsets the final fight a little bit, but it's refreshing to see that even Bond needs a helping hand sometimes. Though I'd be worried if I upset that one, mate. You don't know where she might fire that harpoon! ""Thunderball"" is, therefore, the first truly weak Bond film. But fortunately you can still enjoy it, and at least it's not as weak as ""Diamonds Are Forever"", or worse...shudder...""Moonraker""!",Thunderball
197,freewillyfan,Thunderball,7,1 November 2019,Thunderball is the fourth Sean Connery Bond film. The location and some of shots were really good and some of the underwater shot looked great even if those parts of the film got slow. The final battle underwater I thought was quite exciting.

199,TimBoHannon,Barely Good Enough,5,4 July 2013,"I have gathered from my reading about ""Thunderball"" that both past audiences and today's viewers consider it a drop in quality compared to its three predecessors. Try as I may, I cannot find reason to disagree. Every positive I find is matched by a drawback. ""Thunderball"" has no exceptional aspects to hide those flaws, and that makes them really hurt. I have pondered and analyzed this Bond movie more than any other over the years. All of those thoughts cannot be placed in one review, so I am going to stick to some of my main thoughts on the fourth James Bond movie.James Bond (Sean Connery) spends the first section of the movie at an inpatient health rehab clinic. Officers of SPECTRE, returning as the enemy after a one-movie absence, are using the same clinic to set up their next project. First, Bond discovers a murder. Then he is recalled to work when the English Prime Minister and the American President receive an extortion demand from the now nuclear armed SPECTRE. James recognizes the murdered man from a photograph in his briefing file, and embarks for Nassau to find the victim's sister (Claudine Auger). Bond soon discovers that in order to have access to her, he must deal with Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), who is also SPECTRE'S second-in-command.1) Sean Connery gives his final good performance as Bond. He carries an innate toughness and confidence along with charm and likability. Even down to his smallest mannerisms and inflections, Sean took complete ownership of the part. Bias is not the only reason he is still considered the best in the role; he earned that respect.2) The early Bond movies boasted a lineup of great villains. First came the calm genius Dr. No; second, the demanding authoritarian Rosa Klebb; and third, the ever creative Goldfinger. Largo is an acceptable villain, but falls far short of the prior three. He has his moments, such when he murders an employee for failing a mission that never had any chance of success. Overall, Largo never makes the audience feel the great authority he wields; he just comes off as smug. Part of the problem comes from the next item.3) Luciana Paluzzi plays beautiful villainess Fiona Volpe. Paluzzi's predator-in-disguise acting makes Volpe far more fearsome than Largo. Regrettably, the script tarnishes the strength of the character by making her look good through the stupidity of the male villains. Count Lippe (Guy Doleman), the lead bad guy during the clinic portion of the movie, is incompetent. Volpe is a good enough character to be taken seriously without displaying her next to Lippe's carelessness.That flaw repeats itself when Volpe turns up in Nassau. She openly rebukes Largo at one point, and then speaks to him as if she is in charge. If Largo holds the second highest rank in SPECTRE, who is she to give him orders? Largo is supposed to be more powerful than any of Bond's opponents so far.4) Felix Leiter has made nine appearances so far. In ""Thunderball,"" Leiter is his best. ""Goldfinger"" portrays Felix Leiter like a surrogate uncle to Bond. Rik Van Nutter takes over the role here. Of the six others to play Leiter, only the underused David Hedison has matched Van Nutter's sincerity. He shares an unforced chemistry with Connery. Bond and Leiter are best friends and make the perfect team, so much so that Bond reminds Leiter that he ""knows him better than that."" It is too bad that Van Nutter only had three English speaking roles, because many movies, Bond or otherwise, would have benefited from his presence. My favorite moments in ""Thunderball"" are ones with Felix on screen.5) Approximately half of the action occurs underwater, where the photography is remarkably clear and colorful. The climax is set down there, but at over eight minutes far outstays its welcome. It soon becomes repetitive shots of two men floating in circles trying to best each other along with a few wide shots where rising air bubbles are potentially distracting. Contrast that with the Wavekrest scene in ""Licence to Kill,"" which worked perfectly because of its variety and brevity.6) The rest of the action is fine. The pre-title scene contains one of the series' most rousing and creative brawls followed by one its most delightful surprises. It is the highlight of the movie. Bond has a lot of gadgets here, and their use is dispersed well throughout. That is always a plus.7) Terence Young, an excellent director, tries to manufacture tension during times the script fails to provide it. One embarrassing scene stars a traction machine with settings ranging from ""Therapeutic"" to ""Homicide."" As with too many other scenes, the music is more menacing than what happens on the screen. These scenes are awkward.8) Finally, the movie runs too long because it moves too slowly. No major cuts would be needed to fix that. ""Thunderball"" spends far too much time displaying the mundane. Removing ten seconds here and 15 seconds there in a dozen or so scenes would have made a giant difference without removing a single scene.Overall, ""Thunderball"" is not a bad movie. I think the term ""Thunderbore"" is unfair. Compared to ""From Russia with Love"" or ""Skyfall"" it is boring, but I never felt like I was going to lose interest. ""Thunderball"" receives a passing grade on the strength of Connery and Van Nutter, and on Young's stalwart direction. It could have been better. It also could have been much worse. I say a five out of ten is a fair number.",Thunderball
200,Magenta_Bob,Thunderball,7,6 August 2013,"If the first three Bond films grew if not better then at least more balanced between camp and cool, Thunderball is the first one that feels slightly done on routine. You have already seen pretty much everything in this before, and in superior renditions to boot. That being said, Thunderball does bring something slightly new to the table with its strong focus on underwater action, which, while not always quite as exciting as I think the filmmakers believe them to be, does feel fairly fresh and exotic. And in any case, any excuse to shoot Sean Connery and/or one of his lady friends emerging from the water is accepted in my book.The plot about SPECTRE's number two (eye-patch notwithstanding far less intriguing than the concealed number one) hijacking a couple of NATO atomic bombs is quite stale. Instead, the film is more interesting in the love department, with a couple of elegant encounters, reinforced by the terrific leitmotif, where Connery is as charming as ever and delivers his pick-up lines effortlessly. I could probably just watch Sean Connery being smooth for two hours. The ass kicking is just a bonus.",Thunderball
201,jackbanister16,Probably my favorite Bond movie.,10,29 May 2014,"I've seen this Bond movie twice; Once when I was a young kid, and just a few months ago when I was 23. Needless to say, I appreciated it a great deal more when I was older.Connery is in his prime here. Suave, debonair, and handsome. If you are a Connery/Bond film fan, this is a good one. It doesn't get the same clout as ""Goldfinger"" or ""From Russia with Love,"" but it is my favorite by far.The film opens with Tom Jones' bond song, ""Thunderball."" It makes Adele's ""Skyfall"" theme seem like a nursery rhyme in comparison. Easily the best open to a JB film EVER.The plot is fairly straight forward. Bond must stop the SPECTRE agency from detonating 2 stolen nuclear warheads and destroying the world. Bond does what he does best...screw hot women and solve the problem.Speaking of hot women, Domino, the Bond girl in ""Thunderball,"" is incredibly voluptuous. Curvy and seductive, she's easily in my top three most attractive Bond girls.The underwater fight choreography in this movie is excellent. Even today it probably holds up as one of the best underwater fight scenes in history. It is crisply directed and the camera doesn't move too much (causing nausea). I'm pretty sure Spielberg was influenced by and probably lifted ideas from "" Thunderball"" when he shot ""Jaws."" Safe to say the director and DP did not skimp at all when it came to the underwater photography.It has a tight script, clever one liners, plenty of Bond gadgetry, hot women, and good action.

This film contains a lot of my favorite moments of the franchise: Blofeld punishing his SPECTRE employees, Bond intimidating Emilio Largo during a card game, Bond escaping a pool of sharks, Fiona Volpe and her fate.1/4 of Thunderball involves underwater action sequences, and especially during the third act it starts to feel dragged out ; 15 minutes could have been trimmed off easily.

It also has great dialog which is hard to come by in Bond films. The more recent films (notably Die Another Day) are filled with vomit-inducing sexual repartee which is so obvious and witless that it is gut-wrenching.  Thunderball is hard-hitting; Bond is cool, suave, and without mercy (for the bad guys as well as the ladies).  The underwater stunts are excellent, and the movie is much better for it because it was filmed before CGI.  Although some CGI effects can be quite impressive (Jurassic Park), some just make you shake your head and mutter ""As if...."". Most notably in this category is the laughably fake ""parasailing on the tidal wave"" bit from Die Another Day.Thunderball is also very intriguing, I can't even count the number of times I have seen it over the years.  And I enjoy it every time.  Without question, all other Bonds should model themselves after this one.  I hated it when MGM started to get into fantasy-land with such characters as the unkillable ""Jaws"" from Moonraker and Spy Who Loved Me.  I didn't mind the character himself (Richard Kiel is 7'2"" and looks like a very intimidating hitman), it is just the moronic things they made him do, such as bite through a cable car's 3-inch thick steel cable with his teeth or bite a shark to death.  In the opening sequence he falls from a plane with no parachute and lands unhurt!  It was so infantile it wrecked those otherwise impressive Bonds.  I also intensely disliked the condescending smirk Roger Moore adopted for the character, it was distinctly anti-Bond.  All of the Moore Bonds are flawed for their brutally fake ""pretend-skiing"" routines when it is so obvious that Roger Moore is not actually skiing nor performing any of his other stunts.  I have heard some Moore defenders comment that the films were made before blue-screen techniques were perfected, but I am obliged to point out that Thunderball has none of that.  There are light moments, witty Bondian remarks, and terrific action sequences, and all of it is believable!Altogether a terrific thriller and the BEST BOND of the bunch.",Thunderball
206,Theflyace,Bond Month #4: Really Slow but Still Good,7,30 September 2013,"There are quite a few occurrences in the Bond canon where you have a near masterpiece, and then a sort of run of the mill ""letdown."" Unfortunately this is an occurrence of that sort. Thunderball, while good, is super-slow and not all that interesting. Its has good bits though, lets see who holds the ""thunderball."" SPECTER is back once again in the form of Emilio Largo (SPECTER #2) He has devised a plan to steal two atomic bombs and hold them for ransom. This would seem pretty bland, but it's unique that he deliberately downs a bomber into the Bahamas so he can steal the warheads. Bond must stop him in six days (though the time-frame is of course, never specified as the film progresses)or Miami or somewhere blows up. The story, sort of like Dr. No, is a lot of filler. It has a story (unlike Dr. No) but it's too slow and filled with other scenes that seem very irrelevant.Well, I'm going to knock out the weaker elements of this movie before I go into the good things. Sean Connery is now looking bored silly and is surprisingly flat in this movie, which is a surprise after 3 great performances before. Largo is pretty bland and not really bad-ass or interesting. There are too many characters in this film to boot therefore they don't get much development or screen time (HECK we can even IDENTIFY who these people are half the time) The first Bond girl is something of a mystery to me. Claudine Auger plays Largo's ward Domino. She is a different kind of Bond girl. She is very beautiful, but not brainless. She possesses some sort of inner dignity but is naive in what her guardian really does. She is not tough, but very competent. She is good. The other Bond girl is Fiona Volpe. Now here is a femme fatale to the finest. Luciana Paluzzi is an ace. She is super sexy, conniving, manipulative, and extremely persistent to finish her job regardless of outside circumstance. She too possesses an inner dignity in that she doesn't like cheap sex or thrills or money, she is just bad but very good at what she does.The action sequences are an oddball of the franchise. They are way too slow paced and really long to watch. But with that, they are very impressively filmed and carried out. The producers even hired the Creature of the Black lagoon himself, diver Ricou Browning, to supervise them, and they are good, just a bit of editing might have helped a great deal. And then the final fight on the boat is really brisk and exciting, if only the rest of the movie was as exciting as the finale.This was a troubled production because of a plagiarism dispute between Bond writer Ian Fleming and producer Kevin McClory (both sides saying that the idea was stolen from each other). Series Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman decided to give McClory rights to film Thunderball under their roof. What results is McClory's vision of Bond, which is overall dull. Like I said before, this movie has some really good things, but is overall, not very interesting. Its worth at least one watch, but others may take a lot of time out of your day.",Thunderball

209,andrew7,Over-rated,4,21 August 2000,"The fourth entry in the Bond canon was certainly the biggest at the time. It was a full 20 minutes longer than its predecessor, Goldfinger.  It was also the return to the fold of original Bond director Terence Young.  But rather than backing away from some of the jokier elements of Guy Hamilton's Goldfinger and embracing again the (relative) realism of Young's own Dr No and From Russia With Love, Thunderball represents another small step on the downward slide that would result in simply horrible later entries like Diamonds are Forever and Live and Let Die. Sean Connery is confident and rugged as Bond, of course, so it's not as bad as it seems.  But the plot gets bogged down in all of the tedious underwater sequences.  And while the underwater battle scene at the climax of the film may be a film-making marvel, it's a dramatic failure.  The film ends with no satisfying feeling of victory or achievement, and there's practically no dialogue for the last, what, ten minutes!!!  If the special edition DVD is to be believed, this film cemented Bond's status as an international cinematic icon.  To me, it represents the exact moment where the producers decided that the gadgets, stunts, and special effects were far more important than the story or the plot.

Here he tries to stop SPECTRE from launching stolen nuke missiles to annihilate the world. The original story is a lot better and there should never have been a remake of this classic Bond film. Unfortunately, there aren't any other big name stars in this film, other than Connery, but the acting is quite superb in this film.

Its a terrible, terrible film! Terrence must have been really young to have made this crap! The only decent thing, logical thing, sensible, exciting and entertaining 'thing' in this film is the sequence in which SPECTRE members steal Nukes from a downed RAF's Vulcan bombers. It was nice see that and that sequence only. Apart from that, everything else sucked! And I mean everything. From timelines, continuity, editing, screenplay, direction, everything sucked in every possible way.Throughout watching the film, I kept thinking how and what a let down this film is keeping in mind the amazing nukes-stealing sequence in the beginning, I think I am now going to support and love SPECTRE and not MI6. SPECTRE chaps are awesome and intelligent and their plans are simple, efficient and amazing. On the contrary, MI6 chaps' James Bond is a buffoon who is just hanging out with girls at any and every opportunity.Think about it, he actually didn't do anything in the film. He happened to be their at the spa-hospital facility in the beginning where he sees the RAF pilot, the real one and the fake one! Imagine he wasn't their wasting time, he probably wouldn't have been aware of it and this film wouldn't be possible. 'Right' things were just happening at the 'Right Times' for the Bond. He goes scuba diving in the beginning and the girl he is chasing happens to get stuck and he happens to be there to help her out! What rubbish!Bond is carrying a mini 'Radioactive' homing-device capsule which apparently would work only if swallowed! NONSENSE!He is given an underwater grenade which he uses to blast 3 baddies! But why were the baddies chasing him at that moment in the climax, when what they really wanted to do was to escape with the nukes. Bond had entered an underwater cave or some sunk ship, the baddies could have easily escaped! But no! They decided to chase him so that it woud lead to a situation where Bond could use the 'underwater grenade'! What nonsense!!And then there was the utterly boring and pointless 'Mardi Gras' sequence! Let just say it sucked too! Terrible, terrible film! CRAP FILM!BAKWAS FILM!TATTI FILM!My ratings: 3/10 *** TOTALLY AVOIDABLE!!!!",Thunderball
212,dieseldemon85,Product of its time,5,30 August 2019,Have been a Bond fan since the age of 4 in the 80's. I have watched all the classics many times and it's one of those things it's subjective. Everyone's list is different. The pre teaser is quite good though the jet pack sequence is a bit cheesy. The song by Tom Jones is powerful but not quite on the same level as Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger. The middle of the movie is ok With a NATO jet being taken down and it's missiles being removed. Spectre is behind it and plans to hold the world ransom for a large sum of money. Adolfo Celli is average as a villain.Old fat guy with an eye patch who delligates dirty work to his possibly gay henchman Vargas. The underwater scenes are slow and could have been trimmed a bit as this film is 2h12. It could have been cut to around 2h. Ric van nutter plays Felix Leiter in this and is no David Hedison Who I think was best as Felix. There are better Bond films but this one is better than most of the Brosnan era efforts. Connery is good here and offers some humorous lines which is a nice break from serious.,Thunderball
213,Dock-Ock,"L007K UP, LOO7K DOWN, L007K OUT; This Bond Movie comes down to earth with a dull Bang.",6,26 September 2001,"Thunderball for me is a dreary Bond film. It is almost as if Goldfinger was a massive party were everything went right and you over indulged, and Thunderball is the morning after hangover. For me, it strays to close into the same slow moving teritory as Dr No [1962] and From Russia With Love [1963]. This could be due to the fact that the fun loving fast moving Director Guy Hamilton [Goldfinger] was replaced by Terence Young, who directed the first two segments to the Bond Cinematic Exploits. Perhaps it is a turning point. Sean Connery is the real saving grace. His performance echoe's his own performance in the aforementioned Goldfinger, but the whole feel of the film is caught in a time warp.Granted, everything that should be in a Bond movie is here. There is the fantastic action set pieces, such as Bond in the pre credits sequence, pulling on the Jet Pack and flying off [Pure Comic Book]. There is a memorable and catchy song sung by Tom Jones, wich isn't as good as the previous Title song by Shirley Bassey, but no less well performed. The Main Titles by Maurice Binder look garrish though, resplendant in greens and blues, but with beautiful sillouhettes to catch. John Barry's music is another high point of the film, his themes again being beautiful and moving. In truth Thunderball has many excellent moments, so why in my opinion doens't it work?It is because it is too slow. Terence Young may have shaped the whole look of the Bond films for years to come, but with scenes were the action should be rousing he fails. He is good with character interplay such as Bond with Largo [Connery and Adolpho Celi], but scenes wich should be tension filled, such as Bond in the Shark infested Swimming Pool just dont hit the mark. However, Sean Connery proves again what a great Bond he is, and his presence can save many scenes any many more films.Adolpho Celi is quite good as Largo, but you cant get the memory of Gert Frobe as Goldfinger out your mind. Perhaps that is another problem, Goldfinger is too fresh in memory for any other film to ahve much of an impact. Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi make lovely looking female leads. And Q's gadgets are again very usefull and wondefull additions to the movie, my favourite being the under water camera. The script too could be really, really exciting, with Largo and SPECTRE holding the world to ransom with Nuclear Hardware [one wishes Guy Hamilton had been given this to direct] But the direction and acting is too slow, and this makes it uninteresting.A missed oportunity if there ever was one.",Thunderball
214,carlwilkessob,Disappointing yet again,6,15 January 2021,Four films in I'm surprised bond became the sensation that it is. Thunderball is supposed to be the jewel in broccolis crown but it's just very slow and tediousAgain perhaps I'm being harsh on the old style of movie making but I really struggle to get past the ridiculous sound effects similar to that of the 60s Batman tv show minus the POW spec has bubblesConnery got to remake thunderball in never say never again and I much prefer that,Thunderball

216,rneil95,Relatively Standard Bond Fare,7,2 November 2013,"By the time ""Thunderball"" came out, Bond-mania was all over the world. People were clamoring for it, and the formula had already been established by the time this fourth film was released. Notable for the legal disputes behind the scenes, the film is again based on the Ian Fleming novel of the same name, with creative help from Kevin McClory. Terence Young returns to the director's chair for a final time after being absent for ""Goldfinger. When ""Thunderball"" hit theaters, James Bond was a global phenomenon, and it doesn't really stray from the formula all that much.The film retains the idea of an unrelated action sequence before the credits, and it's easily the best part. The action in this opening scene is intense, and a number of really cool gadgets are put on display, like the jetpack, and the iconic Aston Martin makes a grand return. It's a bombastic, explosive action sequence that really stands out amongst the rest of the film.From there, we turn to the main plot of the film, which involves SPECTRE threatening the US and the UK with nuclear destruction in exchange for money, and Bond is sent to the Bahamas to investigate. The plot takes a while to get going at first, but once Bond leaves the health clinic he spends the first half hour or so at, things really pick up. You get the feel right away that the stakes are higher this time around, especially through the MI6 scenes. Once he arrives in the Bahamas, things pick up a lot. Adolfo Celi as Largo makes for formidable villain, particularly when going toe to toe with Bond. Their verbal battles make for some of the best scenes in the film. We also get two Bond girls this time around, a heroine named Domino (Claudine Auger), and a villainess named Fiona (Luciana Paluzzi). Both make for pretty memorable characters, and it is refreshing to see two independent females, a rarity in these early films. However, some of the violence against women depicted in the film gets rather uncomfortable.The biggest issue I take with the film is the fact that so much of it takes place underwater. The underwater photography is well done, and was groundbreaking for the time, but it feels incredibly labored now. The action feels lethargic, like watching a fight scene at half speed. There's also no dialogue going on underwater, so these scuba sequences just feel rather dull now. These sequences are a bit of a chore to sit through by today's standards, making the whole film lose its momentum in the climax.All in all, ""Thunderball"" is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In many ways, it retains a lot of what made the previous films so good. There are tons of great, iconic moments here, but it drags a lot due to the underwater sequences. It also has its fair share of really goofy moments, losing a lot of the seriousness of previous films. That being said, it's still got a lot of good. Tom Jones' title theme is great, there is a lot of fun to be had from lots of the action, but when stood up against its predecessors, it just sort of blends in. It's relatively standard Bond fare, one that I could easily throw on TV and watch once in a while, not the greatest but still worth checking out.",Thunderball

Adolfo Celi plays Largo, another villain of SPECTRE, who oddly would return to play Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and be cast as Charles Gray. Also the THUNDERBALL theme song is one of the best as well, it was originally Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, you can hear instrumental parts of it in the film.",Thunderball

The women are sexy, the bad guys are their typical evil selves, and the locations are beautiful(The Bahamas). The basic story is interesting, hijacking nuclear bombs for ransom, but the movie is really a typical 007 comic TinkerTailor,Soldier,Spy'. The scene where Bond is dancing with the evil but chesty Fiona Volpe is an example. A bullet from a high powered revolver should have gone through her and into Bond, but of course it doesn't.  As Bond himself said in 'Goldfinger' to Pussy Galore on the private jet, the bullet from her gun would pass through him and the plane's fuselage like a blowtorch through butter!I guess the point is to just enjoy the wit and flare that Sean Connery brings to the early Bond films, and not expect it to be anything but an entertaining, far fetched typical Bond film.  That said, the ending where Bond and Domino are picked up by an airplane is positively moronic. Try to figure out what happens to them after that!",Thunderball

It's the classic James Bond formula, which keeps evolving.
More bad guys, action, one-liners, gadgets, girls, things exploding way too much for no reason and everything you would expect from a Bond movie.
It takes place around the world but in this movie, it mostly takes place around or under the water and it's exciting.It's the original time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days to understand Bond better and watch how the movie series began and evolved over time.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a Bond movie, but it's not a bad thing at all and it's very enjoyable even after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 1960s vibe works extremely well.This movie feels quite refined out of the early Bond movies and personally I liked Goldfinger more.
Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it, quite a lot not. Personally, after watching Goldfinger this feels like not the greatest one of them all and not the worst one it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

Emilio Largo, though much older than James, is a more-worthy, quite-athletic opponent who's surely able to beat the crap out of you if he can't beat you with plots and technology! Loved the appearance of the Vulcan bomber, the underwater photography, the basic plot line AND the very-beautiful, very-evil Spectre Woman, Fiona Volpe! She can murder me anytime. Also enjoy Bond's numerous, surely remarks throughout...when ""Every Double-0 man in Europe"" is hastily called to a meeting in Whitehall, James sloughs off it's importance ""Somebody probably lost a dog."" This helps set the tone for the casual bravery of Willis in ""Die Hard"" and Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon"".

222,russellalancampbell,The Last of the Fab Four Bonds,9,23 June 2019,"""Thunderball"" represents the final instalment of Bond films that truly represented a zeitgeist that was present in 1963 - 1965. It is perhaps impossible for those who were not alive in those times to comprehend how thrilling it was to experience the images and lifestyles Mr Bond brought to us but, for those of us who were, it opened up a whole new world of sophistication, travel and adventure. For a taste, watch the opening title/credit sequence. It remains a high point in what we all anticipated after the ""Dr No"" title sequence had introduced us to a new level of visual and aural excitement.
The scope of the scheme was also raised to a new level in ""Thunderball"" as was the astounding - for those times - size of the amount to be extorted - £100 million. Added to that was SPECTRE's weapon of choice - atom bombs. Nuclear weapons build up and threat had become an accepted part of life in those days.Whilst Danielle Bianchi in ""From Russia With Love"" remains my favourite Bond major conquest/confederate, Claudine Auger was utterly beguiling as Domino and Luciana Paluzzi wonderfully sexy/evil as Fiona Volpe. It is said by some critics that Adolfo Celi was one of the weaker Bond villains but I find him at least adequate. Martine Beswick makes a welcome return as Bond's agency contact in Nassau and Rik Van Nutter does well as Felix Leiter - a charater with an ever-changing face, physique and age throughout the series.The sets and locales were another highlight as was the underwater action. The underwater photography is a bit murky when compared to today's crystal clarity but, for that time, it was brilliant. And the sharks were very real!I particularly liked the vignettes and set pieces such as the chase through the parade in the streets of Nassau and its climax in the Kiss Kiss Club. The intrigue and casual romance with Molly Peters at Shrublands was another. Check for a glimpse of young Suzy Kendall in her shorty nighwear after Bond casually pushes the fire alarm button as a means of escaping the enemy's clutches. She had an instant presence that had people asking ""Who was that girl?""Enjoy the conch chowder, avoid the sea egg spines and remember that Domino has two moles on her left thigh.",Thunderball

224,sterlinrivera-2000,Awesomeness to the Max,9,5 January 2020,"Thunderball is basically James Bond underwater. You may think that concept sounds cheesy, but it's not. The film turned out to be very fun and yet another terrific Bond film in total.This time, a one eyed mastermind Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) leads SPECTRE to hijack two thermonuclear weapons from a plane to cause a nuclear destruction. James Bond (Sean Connery) has to go and get the warheads from Largo's secret lair in the Bahamas, facing underwater obstacles, and he has to convince the beautiful Domino (Claudine Auger) to be his sidekick.Thunderball is so good that it could be my 2nd favorite of the Sean Connery films. It had another fantastic story and it's concept was really interesting. Sean Connery did it once more with his awesome performance as Mr. Bond, and Auger was great as Domino, who was another really nice Bond girl.The action wasn't as awesome as Goldfinger's but still pretty satisfying. Especially towards the end when there's a battle underwater and everyone's using spear guns, and I liked how Bond used one of those instead of using is usual gun.At the end of the day, Thunderball is a really fun Bond film and one of the best ones of all time.",Thunderball

Thunderball can be considered to be the first of the epic Bond films due to it's Bahamas location, bold action set pieces being the first in the series to be shot in a wide screen format. Sean Connery is on top form whether battling the bad guys or charming the ladies. Adlofo Celi as Largo the SPECTRE commander who sees Bond as a threat for many reason, not just including the blackmail plot makes for a charismatic opponent. Playing Domino a woman who has been sucked into events because of her brother is Claudine Auger who provides both glamour and some depth into her role. Then there is Lucianna Paluzzi as Fiona Volpe a SPECTRE agent who uses her sexual charms in achieving her and her co-conspirator aims though she ends up caught up in her own trap, Volpe would be the template for all future Bond Femme Fatales. Thunderball features many memorable including the famed conference that has been lampooned many times that features the high command of SPECTRE discussing their operations including their involvement in one of the biggest real life crimes of the 1960s. Thunderball has a place in the top tier of Bond films for many good reasons.",Thunderball
226,tonynworah,Entertaining Underwater Adventure,7,24 January 2011,"The success of Goldfinger ensured that the James Bond franchise had a solid footing in the entertainment industry. It was inevitable that in their next Bond outing, they would make it bigger, more action packed, and louder than Goldfinger. The result was Thunderball a high octane action packed movie with high stakes. Sadly, despite the potential of the movie and the action, it still could not measure up to the entertainment quality of Goldfinger. That does not mean to say that Thunderball was a droll. Far from it. It was still very entertaining in its own right.The film features the return of SPECTRE and Bond's old nemesis, Ernst Stravo Blofeld. SPECTRE has managed to hijack twin atomic bombs from NATO and is planning to use it against the civilian population unless the sum of 100 million pounds is paid.Again, Bond is called to save the world. This was Sean Connery's fourth outing as Bond which he does with considerable charm in the exotic scenery of Nassau. From the exciting pre credit sequence where he straps on a rocket bag to make his escape from a château after a vicious combat with a SPECTRE member, to another entanglement with another SPECTRE member in a health centre, from his being drawn into the operation to retrieve the bombs and his lethal cat and mouse game with the beautiful female assassin Fiona Volpe and her boss Largo which culminates in an epic underwater battle, Connery holds his own and proves without a doubt why most people still regard him as the best Bond ever.Largo, played by Italian Adolfo Celi with considerable charm is No 2 in the SPECTRE organization and is the one entrusted with the job of stealing those bombs. He is aided by his assassin the voluptuous Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) who proves that she is more than a match for Bond. She is the first woman (since the Chinese lady of Dr. No) smart enough and strong enough not to succumb to Bond's charm after making love and shows that her alliance to SPECTRE is stronger than any seduction trick Bond may out of the hat.That is not to say that Bond does not have another chink in Largo's armour. The chink is in the form of Largo's mistress called Domino who has her own personal motive for wanting to help Bond. Despite her beauty and being on the good side, Volpe still made a much more interesting and arresting character. What can I say? Evil seduces and bad girls are always more magnetic than good girls. Remember the song of the Pussycat Dolls? ""Don't you wish your girlfriend was bad like me..?""

This one has a good bit of everything from plot to gadgets, and we also see the second outing of two Bond film essentials-the Aston Martin and Head of SPECTRE, although not known at the time, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. You will probably find that 'Thunderball' features the best bevvy of beauties in the form of Claudine Auger, Luciana Paluzzi, Martine Beswick and our very own, Molly Peters.A great pre-opening credits sequence which ends in a brutal fight is a must-see and a good kick-starter into the titles and dramatic theme tune performed immaculately by the voice of Tom Jones. This is arguably the best of the sixties bond theme songs...Adolfo Celi plays SPECTRE No.2 villian, Emilio Largo, and does a great job of holding the UK to ransom and almost over-powering 007 in the final nail-biting scenes aboard the 'Disco Volante'. The underwater scenes are something of a must-see also, even though a lot of critics find them too long to view in such film circumstances, but that is another unique element of this Bond extravaganza.I think this is Sean Connery's best James Bond film and was the subject of an amicable remake years later in the form of 'Never Say Never Again', welcoming the original Bond actor back to the fold for a final unofficial appearance as 007.",Thunderball
229,Reef-Shark,Was my father's favorite Bond film,7,1 April 2009,"The fourth film in this infamous series of espionage features Sean Connery returning to the role that brought him international fame. Of course it would be insane to imagine anyone else in this role at this point in time for the fledgling series that would go on to be the longest running series in the history of cinema.The film begins with Bond still stuck in the ongoing war between himself and the conning SPECTRE organization and has acquired special attention from their mysterious faceless, cat-stroking mastermind who has now decided that James Bond, Agent 007, must be taken out of the picture before he further meddles with the affairs of SPECTRE. But who in their right mind would want to take on the British super-agent? SPECTRE's Number 2, Emilio Largo seems up to the task shortly after the death of Number 6 at the hands of 007 in the beginning of the film.Largo's plan centers on the hijacking of two nuclear warheads which would cause enough fuss to attract any super-spy to the area, and he intends on it. Of course, why bother with a fully equipped agent if you can take Bond out when he's still recovering after his previous mission? Well, it turns out that even in relaxation James Bond isn't entirely defenseless and manages to leave the Spa unharmed...of course he doesn't leave without some invaluable information regarding Largo's plan.Off to the Bahamas goes Bond, where he finally lets his womanizing go too far, nearly leading to his death, but once again he sweet talks, and dances his way out of danger (Literally!). Of course an Agent's job doesn't only center on sex and alcohol. It's actually serious business, as he discovers Largo's fortified estate (complete with a pool of sharks) and yacht are the center of this nuclear weapon plot. So you'd think this sounds easy enough for our dear agent 007, right? Wrong. You forget that Number between one and five in the SPECTRE organization is going to have a countless number of faceless henchmen ripe for the killing (So many hired hands...What do they pay all these scuba troopers?).The entire thing leads up to one of the most interesting, violent fight sequences in the entire Bond franchise as a giant underwater battle erupts between SPECTRE and a group of Scuba commandos (joined of course by Bond) as they attempt to prevent Largo from detonating the bombs off the coast of Miami. Excitement and bloodshed erupts and the title of ""Most Violent Connery Bond Film"" is one by the end.Sean Connery as usual proves that he IS James Bond and delivers his lines perfectly. At this point Connery obviously has the character down to near perfection. He can fight, shoot, smoke, gamble, drive nice cars, and seduce women and make it come across as convincing. This is definitive proof that he was born for this role and that the series wouldn't have gone very far without his leaving such a great impact upon his initial run as the character.Adolfo Auger also makes for a good villain. Cold, heartless, and delivers his lines with the vicious nature of a shark. He is a driven villain, seeming to only desire to further impress his superior in SPECTRE, yet he never stoops to the rank of simple henchmen. So he works for himself, but also to impress his leader, but at the same time it feels he tries to detach himself as far away from the central SPECTRE organization as possible. Maybe he intends to prove himself and break away and form his own organization? He obviously has the money and resources to do so (unless ALL of that comes from SPECTRE).This was my father's favorite Bond film growing up and I agree that it is a classic that is a worthwhile movie, though the one complaint I have is that it has several slow parts that seem to drag endlessly, but these are rare.Also, the remastered picture quality on the latest DVDs is great, and if you don't already own the 007 editions from earlier this decade I'd highly recommend the Ultimate Edition of Thunderball, because it has quite a few extra features for you Bond fans (but not so many that it entirely outweighs the 007 edition; so if you have that release there is no need to buy again).",Thunderball
230,jonny_mcclatch,Unfortunate that it followed Goldfinger.,7,4 February 2020,"Thunderball tends to get quite a bit of flak from fans but often it seems to be for the wrong reasons. The balance of the film is a little off, there are stretches were you feel not much is happening then there will be a part packed with action before going quiet again. There are a lot of underwater scenes which considering when this was made are actually amazing in terms of the quality, it does seem to get a little bogged down by the amount of time spent in the water.The main flaws of the film for me are that it followed arguably the best Bond film, and that the main villain eventually takes the backseat to multiple henchmen or mini villains who steal the show. Volpe in particular was fantastic by comparison, by the end Largo is just there for the conclusion having spent most his time in the background. Despite the underwater scenes holding up, one thing that hasn't aged as well are the scenes purposely sped up or others when characters are in vehicles you know aren't actually moving. It makes those scenes look somewhat cartoonish today, which I know I shouldn't really fault them for. At the time it was probably quite an impressive step forward but it does take you out of it a bit.The filming is great, the action is great, Claudine Auger is still one of my favourite ever Bond girls. Domino has one of the more interesting storylines whereas over the years some just fade in and out of the film when it suited. There's also a inadvertently funny scene in which Bond is attacked by what is essentially a table while scoping out a health spa. That alone is worth giving this film a try.",Thunderball

And of course the around-the-world theme of James Bond that almost made a dry-out twenty years later, in terms of planning destinations for future 007-movies, all continents almost used, except the deepest arctic areas maybe. This overall great Bond movie has it all for being ranked as one of the classics; the action-packed opening scene, the memorable strong tune from one Tom Jones, the perfect look villain of Adolfo Celi. And the women, Oh! the women. I think most of the female actors in those days, who hanged around the largest movie company studios for ""gigs"" already knew by then, that a part in a 007 adventure meant immortality on the big screen. Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi no exceptions. These two enchanting women brings color to this picture when it sometimes starts to lack in tempo. And YES, I have to mention it: the too many under water shots, who had been discussed by Bond fans in almost fifty years.

The icing on the cake is the grand underwater action sequence towards the latter half of the film. It was beautifully choreographed and struck a chord with me in a way very few movie scenes have had in the past. Another jaw-dropping scene in this movie was yet another underwater action sequence wherein the nuclear weapons are stolen from the plane and the plane is camouflaged thereafter. These scenes, along with the rest of the movie, create a tautness that transfixes the movie's audience in a very unique way.",Thunderball
233,d-apergis,veneered with glossy pop exoticism,7,21 December 2009,"Main problem here is the overlong underwater sequences which nowadays make the film look more like a Cousteau documentary than a Bond episode. Despite their novelty at the time, they feel somewhat sluggish now and do slow the film's pace.""Thunderball"" does, however, have its thrills and some of the best lines in the series, and Connery shows a harder edge which was missing from the previous installment ""Goldfinger"". Additionally, the film is veneered with glossy pop exoticism (due to the story's setting in Bahamas) that makes one feel sorry for not having lived in the sixties. But as a whole, it doesn't really take off until its final third.",Thunderball
234,vangamer,Less would be more,8,10 July 2020,"After the stratospheric success of Goldfinger James Bond mania truly exploded globally, raising both the budget and expectations for Bond 4.
Under the direction of Terence Young, who had helmed the much leaner Dr. No and From Russia With Love, this would feature cutting-edge underwater photography showcasing tons of submerged hardware - from mini-subs and sea scooters to a submerged RAF Atomic Bomber and a deadly hydrofoil yacht.
Unfortunately, the only thing the producers skimped on was time. While Young wrangled this truly massive project in an era well before computer effects, the producers were eager for to release Thunderball in time for the lucrative Christmas holiday season.
The result was lack of sufficient time for post-production work and editing. Instead Thunderball became a ""kitchen sink"" of a movie with all that watery photography and machinery onscreen. Thunderball became the first Bond to run over two hours, with its 130 minutes clocking 20 minutes longer than the nimble Goldfinger.
The rush to release also resulted in continuity errors (Bond's colour-changing aqua mask) and overclocked effects as Largo's souped-up yacht hits preposterous speeds.
And more's the pity as Thunderball shows Sean Connery at the top of his game and surrounded by sexy glamour, great locations and a menacing Bond villain in Adolfo Celi's Largo.
Honestly, I wonder if EON productions would ever consider a Thunderball Redux, leaving in all that wonderful Caribbean intrigue but draining some of the watery bits.",Thunderball
235,spinin,A big time Bond adventure that tries to go even bigger than Goldfinger,7,25 June 2021,"James Bond (Sean Connery), travels to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear missiles stolen by Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), SPECTRE's agent No. 2. The organization threatens to destroy a major US or British city, unless they are paid a huge ransom. Bond soon meets Largo, as well as his mistress Domino (Claudine Auger), whom Largo keeps under a tight watch in his mansion and aboard his ship the Disco Volante. Domino is unaware that her brother was killed by Largo and SPECTRE during their theft of the missiles, but Bond hopes to get her over to his side and stop Largo.Thuderball is both a major Bond film in the series and a bit of an overblown mess. A lot of the suspense created by the storyline is quite great. Sean Connery gives another very solid performance, and is perhaps at his most effortless in the Bond series here. However, the effortlessness is starting to look a bit like boredom in moments as Connery was starting to become jaded with playing Bond.The film is stunningly colorful and beautiful in many places as most of the action takes place in the one Bahamas location. This was the first Bond film shot in full widescreen. However, the drawback of the sole Bahamas location is that it does get boring over time. At times, it's like being on a beach with soothing waves, which lull you to sleep, rather than whisk you away to great action.Adolfo Celi, as the main villain Largo, has a strong screen presence and is very memorable. However, the movie pushes that over-the-top villainy to the point of being laughable at times. It's the sort of stuff that has spurred the Austin Powers movies to parody the character. Domino is beautiful, but is also not a terribly exciting Bond girl. One could argue that since her character is essentially trapped by Largo, this may have taken some life out of her and the quiet naivete is appropriate.Then, of course, there is the unforgettable Fiona Volpe, played by the stunning Luciana Paluzzi. A henchman of sorts, she is just as cold, intelligent, and ruthless as she is beautiful. She has an almost equal part in SPECTRE's plot as Largo and clearly ranks high up the SPECTRE ladder as an agent. She gives Bond a taste of his own medicine in many moments and nearly takes him out herself.The film really plays up SPECTRE in this movie once again, after From Russia With Love. This side-plot would be fully opened up finally in You Only Live Twice. It's kind of hilarious how all the SPECTRE agents wear the same rings with a logo of an octopus, essentially giving themselves away.The film is beautiful, but empty at times. The action scenes are great in concept, but flat in execution. In particular, there is a great deal of debate among Bond fans over the huge amount of underwater sequences in this movie, which many argue tend to slow it down and add to the lull of the film and its location. I'm somewhat in agreement with that. While early on, they have a feel of mystery and suspense, the underwater finale especially is disappointing. The choreography of the final underwater battle is good, but constantly made me question if such shooting and fighting moves would even be remotely possible in the water. And the battle does drag on, when it could have easily been resolved by larger NATO forces swooping in.So the film is very uneven. It is big, bold, and colorful, with memorable villains, Bond girls, and a gorgeous location. Sean Connery is good as well, but no longer at his best and this is the movie where the paycheck for him started being more important than the role. Some scenes, like the ones that take place at the recuperation center, the interplay between Bond and Largo early on, and the scenes with Bond and Volpe stand out. The pre-title sequence is fairly good as well. But many other scenes really drag as the plot unravels slowly. There are a few parts that feel roughly edited in and look more like they were shot for a TV movie. And the use of backscreen projection is also quite bad in places. The action scenes, especially the final underwater battle, are a disappointment. This was the first Bond movie I saw as a kid with Sean Connery, and maybe the 4th or 5th Bond film I saw overall, so it did have it's impact on me precisely because of many of the big story elements. However, now it feels like an unevenly executed, big budget Bond movie.",Thunderball
236,jackhamel1987,The Escapism continues...,8,7 April 2013,"Thunderball, the fourth Bond film, can't quite live up to the previous 3 films, but still gives them a run for their money. It doesn't specifically have any iconic scenes, and whilst the villain is good, he's not great. This does, however, boast some great underwater scenes, a solid plot and perhaps the best Bond femme fatale in Lucianna Paluzzi's 'Fiona Volpe'.Following the theft of two atomic bombs (MOS type, as arch villain Blofeld coldly explains), James Bond springs into action in an attempt to stop the UK and US governments from paying £100million in diamonds to SPECTRE, and to stop SPECTRE agent Number '2', Emilio Largo, from detonating the atom bombs off Miami coast. Acting on a lead he discovered at a health farm, Bond is sent to the Bahamas, where he meets bad girl Fiona Volpe, and good girl Domino, who is the mistress of villain Emilio Largo. With the help of Felix Liter, and some sharks, Bond is able to get closer to Largo and the truth behind the theft of the atom bombs, and SPECTRE's plan for them. The final showdown between the two villains is pretty epic, and a rather sharp surprise is in stall for Largo before he gives up his ghost. In terms of underlying plot, Thunderball was and still is rather relevant. The idea of nuclear bombs in the hands of terrorists or a rogue regime is entirely believable, and that is where Thunderball's biggest strength lies. The film also benefits from strong set actions scenes that set a new standard for fights underwater (these were some of the first to be filmed underwater), and Thunderball does also benefit from a strong cast in the form of Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo, a subtle but ruthless criminal, and also the rather dazzling redheaded villain Fiona Volpe (Lucianna Paluzzi). Sean Connery as Bond is as strong as ever, and I would say that he is at his best as Bond in this film, as the producers, writers and director clearly knew how to play to his strengths and his sense of timing. Thunderball's weakness is perhaps the time it takes to get moving at the beginning, and also the length of some scenes towards the end. Also, whilst Celi is brilliant as Largo, he's almost too subtle at times, so the villain never really stands out in the way that Robert Shaw's Grant did, or Dr No, or Goldfinger. Nevertheless, it's still a hugely worthy Bond film, and is a lot of fun all the way. I'm happy to give this an 8/10",Thunderball
237,chancey-23,A Bond film that seems underrated,8,15 July 2012,"Sean Connery returns for the fourth time as James Bond 007 in his finest acting performance yet. Yeah, I know it's just my opinion, but I find this to be his most charismatic, smooth performance of his six/seven films. Add to that one of the series' better villains, Emilio Largo, deliciously played by Alfredo Celi, a threatening supporting villain, Fiona, and some fine underwater camera work, and also a greater plot than you might imagine. There are a few criticisms as well, I must admit. The Felix Leiter character seems unnecessary, the Bond girl is a bit forgettable, and the end fight seems too long, as does the runtime. But once you put it all together, it's one of the better Bond films, especially when you compare it to Connery's next film.",Thunderball
238,MondoMirth,Disco Volante,6,4 January 2020,"Some good cinematography, the least humorous bond, except for a few scenes so very corny they draw laughs. The best thing about this film is the beautiful setting and sean Connery's acting. Pretty classic, but not as much a Goldfinger.",Thunderball
239,BrohmaBull007,My Favorite Bond Film,9,24 February 2006,"Now I realize the fact that I said Goldfinger was the best Bond movie but that doesn't have to mean its my favorite. This movie is my all-time favorite Bond movie. I liked this film because the plot was very entertaining and action packed. Connery once again enjoying himself as Bond in what he says was ""His favorite"" movie. This movie also gives off a lot of new material. Bond doesn't look invincible but he actually shows a weakness in this film but he uses his smarts and quick thinking to fill those holes. The head villain was another great cast and he wasn't a villain that just stood off to the side. I also like how the fight scenes in this movie were really original and the first of its type. Like I said before the plot was outstanding and the run length of the movie wasn't too long or too short. It was great watching Connery (still in his prime) play Bond. This was also the first movie where Connery has the rug on his face. Overall I really enjoyed this film and I find it under-rated on the IMDb polls as I think it deserves more than a 6.9. I know how good Goldfinger was and I think this movie measured up to what Goldfinger was like.",Thunderball
240,fdpedro,"""I hope we didn't scare the fishes.""",8,6 September 2004,"Out of the 20 official entries of the James Bond series (to date) ""Thunderball"" is often mentioned as 'the underwater one' and for a very good reason. It had big shoes to fill since the previous year's ""Goldfinger"" became a box-office phenomenon across the world. Although Thunderball was even more successful, there are debates on weather or not it was a better film. In this fan's opinion, it was.Picking up after the most unusual pre-titles scene featuring MI6 secret agent James Bond meeting his match with a man in drag and escaping in a jet-pack, ""Thunderball"" features the most generic (and parodied) Bond plot: The international terrorist organization SPECTRE, led by a mysterious unseen cat stroking leader, hijacks two nuclear bombs for a huge extortion plan. James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Nassau where Domino Derval (Claudine Auger), the sister of the pilot who appears to be responsible for the theft, resides with her wealthy and older husband Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi). Bond eventually finds out Largo himself is the eye patch wearing SPECTRE #2 and he is in charge of the nuclear warheads. Will he survive Largo's squad, including lethal assassin Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi), and a tank of sharks?""Thunderball"" is directed by Terence Young picking up after Guy Hamilton from the previous film. Young, who directed the first two films of the series, is certainly one of the most important filmmakers of the Bond saga. In the hands of some hack, ""Thunderball"" could have easily been an overlong boring disastrous attempt, but Young fills the screen with the same thrilling charm and glamour that made the first two Bonds so unique. The most cinematic of all Fleming novels, the movie is quite faithful to its source material while adding some welcomed changes (the character of Fiona Volpe for example) an therefore making it a more entertaining movie-going experience.The action is mostly underwater and that is what usually divides fans of the series since some find them sleep-inducing. The special effects crew was awarded with a Best Special Effects Oscar in 1966 and for a very good reason. The film's extensive use of underwater photography was quite breath-taking for it's time. And the visual effects themselves are quite impressive, especially the explosion featured in the climax which shattered many windows in Nassau. Thunderball is based mostly on thrills than stunts, which is something recent Bond films should start to concentrate on. It is all well orchestrated to one of John Berry's most memorable contributions to the Bond saga. The '007 theme' is used at its best during the action sequences, especially during the climatic fight at Largo's yacht. The theme song, sung by Tom Jones, is one of the most memorable tunes of the series, although I prefer the original unused song ""Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"".Two usual standards of the series, villains and girls, are both filled quite successfully. Adolfo Celi is one of the most parodied villains (eye patch anyone?) but his portrayal of #2 is incredibly fun to watch. He is indeed a one-dimensional character, but a very memorable one. Claudine Auger is one stunning-looking woman and her acting skills are above average for the time. She is one of the most likable Bond girls around and her lack of clothing makes her quite heir apparent to Dr. No's Honey Rider in terms of sexiness. But Luciana Paluzzi steals the show with Fiona Volpe. She is the first Bond girl to stand up to the agent's charms (Pussy eventually gave up) and the psychotic look of rage in her eyes responding to Bond's macho insult is particularly memorable: 'But of course, I forgot your ego, Mr. Bond. James Bond, the one where he has to make love to a woman, and she starts to hear heavenly choirs singing. She repents, and turns to the side of right and virtue... (she steps on Bond's foot)... but not this one!' Volpe stands second only to Xenia Onatopp among the sexy girl villains.This is the last time we see Connery at his best portraying 007 before he was eventually bored with the in later entries, particularly in ""Diamonds are Forever"". He indeed shows why he is considered by most fans to be the best among the Bonds. He has amazing screen presence and a suave charm of a sophisticated playboy that just makes every guy want to be him and every girl want to be with him.One of my personal favourites and certainly on my top five, ""Thunderball"" is one of the most well rounded Bond adventures to date. Exotic locations, beautiful women, battle sequences, gadgets, suspense, terrific music, and a memorable villain add up to the best of the ""popcorn"" Bond movies. Terrific entertainment!",Thunderball
241,trekfan2001,Average Bond,7,14 June 2003,"Thunderball is probably one of the average Bond films. It's not too bad, but it's nothing special. Basically, I think one of the major problems with this film is that it's too slow. Compared with ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"", this really feels like a couple of steps down.*** spoiler alert ***I think the biggest problem is the speed of the boat at the end. The external shots look ok, but the obviously projected images inside the boat make it look like it's travelling at warp speed! I nearly fell out of the chair laughing at this.*** end spoilers ***However, it's still a very entertaining movie and it's also the first Bond in 2.35:1.

242,quincy-white,BEST BOND FILM EVER,10,28 June 2003,"I loved this movie, but I am aware it has its detractors, even among Bond fans, who often prefer Goldfinger.  Goldfinger was great, but I think Sick Boy in Trainspotting summed up Pussy Galore well. (I can't do it justice here, just see Trainspotting)  Goldfinger's final fate was also more ludicrous than anything people complain about in Thunderball.  In Thunderball, Largo may not be one of the best Bond Villains, but he is a good tough guy and a rare dose of grittiness in the elegant world of James Bond.  Domino is without a doubt my favorite Bond Girl, sexy, voluptuous, and strong.  She is also one of the few women with whom Bond seemed to form an actual emotional connection.More than anything else, though, I absolutely loved the underwater battle sequence.  As it started, with the para-troopers arriving, I felt this great rush of energy.  That is what I look for in a Bond film, or any film for that matter, not some intellectual exercise.  Yes, it was the old Calvary arriving to save the day, but Bond films have always excelled at re-inventing cliches.  As far as I'm concerned, Thunderball's finale is up there with the D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan or the helicopter scene in Apocalypse Now as one of the greatest battle scenes ever.It also features one of the great dry Bond lines- ""You're glad?""  You have to see the movie for it to make sense, but in the context of the scene, and with Connery's delivery, it was very funny.I hate to admit it, but I even liked the Tom Jones song.",Thunderball
243,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,A worthy addition to the Bond series (SPOILERS),9,18 August 2004,"By 1965, James Bond was a pop icon. ""Goldfinger"" had been a huge success for producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and the anticipation for ""Thunderball"", James Bond's fourth film, was through the roof. There were more James Bond-related brands than ever before, maybe more than any other movie product today. With inflation adjusted, ""Thunderball"" remains the highest grossing Bond film ever, with almost a billion dollars in ticket sales.Obviously, the filmmakers must've done something right for the film to have been as big a hit as it was. When compared to the previous outing, ""Thunderball"" is something of an upgrade-- it has better locations, better direction, and much better Bond Girls. While ""Goldfinger"" defined the ""Bond formula"", ""Thunderball"" uses it better, while still delivering a darker tone and a close adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1961 novel.The film opens with an exciting and involving pre-title sequence that shows Bond (Sean Connery) narrowly escaping death when he once again butts heads with an agent of SPECTRE (they seem to turn up everywhere!). Very little of it makes any sense, but it does set the tone for the rest of the movie: serious, but not without humour. We're then treated to one of the better title songs and a colorful title sequence, after which we get an amusing scene of SPECTRE plotting it's boldest plan yet: the theft of two nuclear bombs and demanding a huge ransom, or they would detonate the nukes somewhere in the world.Bond stumbles onto the plot and meets one of main operatives while he just so happens to be staying at a health clinic, recovering from wounds suffered at the beginning. This section is actually pretty slow, and is devoted more to setting up the rest of the plot and characters than explosions and gun fights. That being said, it's all still very enjoyable and provides Connery the room needed to show off some great Bond moments, like when he steals a grape from a bad guy's room. Sir Sean is again having fun among the big sets, showing a more relaxed side to Bond, without seeming too indestructible, like in ""Goldfinger"".The main villain this time is Emilio Largo, played with suitable authority by Adolfo Celi. While he's a departure from the version of the novel, he's one of the better villains in the series, even though he doesn't stack up to Bond's adversaries in the previous three films. Faring worse is Largo's main henchman, Vargas, who gets a bigger than necessary introduction, but eventually just fades into the background and becomes completely forgettable. Ironically, his death is more memorable than he is, and he doesn't even compare to Red Grant or Odd Job.Making up for Vargas and even Largo is Luciana Paluzzi's Fiona Volpe, who's one of the best villains in the entire Bond canon. She's intelligent, cunning, and cold, providing a perfect match for Connery's 007, while also being extremely attractive in every frame. On the side of good, Claudine Auger, who plays Largo's naive mistress Domino, is stunning to look at, and even though she isn't as strong-willed as Fiona, she isn't completely wasted and helps the plot move forward.Returning also is Felix Leiter, this time played by Rik Van Nutter. While not the best or most memorable Felix, he's a trustworthy ally for Bond and helps with key moments of the film. The best thing about the movie is its setting in Nassau, which was shot on location. When Bond arrives there on a hunch, the scenery lends a unique feeling of exoticness to the film, and it's better handled here than in future Bond adventures that shot in and around the same place.It's the hallmark of ""Thunderball"", the underwater sequences, that slow it down the most. While the choreography and cinematography is impressive, they don't excite as much as they were supposed to and seem to go on forever, like early in the running time when the Vulcan bomber is investigated by Largo's frogmen. John Barry's music is once again perfect for these scenes and many others, but one gets the feeling they should have been trimmed, along with the Angelo/Count Lippe/Francois Derval sub plot.""Thunderball""'s climax is, appropriately, an underwater skirmish, and is one of the other scenes that could've been shortened, as entertaining as it is. Apart from this and a few fights scattered throughout, there aren't any show stopping action scenes, while there are numerous technical aspects, like dubbing and editing, that look too distracting and jarring. But the movie is still classic Bond and holds up well after 40 years. 8.5/10",Thunderball
244,asdodge,Connery's Bond comes to full maturity,9,15 December 2008,"""Thunderball"" is James Bond's 4th go-round in the movies and the most explosive of the Connery Films. More intense than ""Goldfinger,"" it sees SPECTRE at its most aggressive. The plot begins with the theft of 2 nuclear bombs. SPECTRE, through its agent #2 Emilio Largo (played by Adolfo Celi), holds the world for ransom, and it is up to Bond to figure out the who, when, and where of the attack. Largo is ably assisted by the best bad-Bond girl in the entire history of the films- Fiona Volpe (played by Luciana Paluzzi). She is both sexy and scary as Largo's top assassin. Unlike the later psycho-vixen in ""GoldenEye"" Xenia Onatopp. Volpe is a believable killer- not a overacted character meant for sexual innuendo jokes. Volpe is cool, confident, and a real killer. She easily steals most scenes she appears in. The featured Bond-girl is the character Domino (played by the gorgeous Claudine Auger). Domino is, to me, the most beautiful of the Bond Girls, even over Ursula Andress. Unfortunately, our femme-fatale is dubbed by the same actress who dubbed Andress's lines in ""Dr. No."" Between similar plots and situations, the two characters (Honey Rider from ""Dr. No"" and Domino) come across the same, as if it was the same character in both films. ""Thunderball"" has no true weaknesses as a Bond film, except the vocal dubbings of many of the actors. Celi, Paluzzi, and others all have their voices overdubbed, and they do not always line up as well. A minor fault when watching. This movie is the Bond Formula at its strongest, being still young and not set in its ways. The plot is a bit hackneyed yet believable, even more so today. The thought of a couple of nuclear weapons being stolen and used as threats for ransom money is not that far-fetched today. Bond is still a detective here, but the fights and action sequences take precedence for the first time throughout a Bond film. There is enough balance to keep the film strong in terms of plot and realistic events with the super-agent storyline. A very good Bond film, and the most re-made and copied... from Matt Helm Films to Austin Powers.",Thunderball
245,theonewithallthecontacts,"The first ""decent"" Bond film...",7,2 December 2012,"I have always seen Dr. No, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger as the definitive Bond movies, and I suspect that many people will agree with me. Of course, a fourth outing of the British agent James Bond would not be as good as the three first. And it wasn't. Goldfinger marked the point where Bond movies would try to top the previous in any way possible! Not only would it hurt the movie, but it would't be very positively viewed by the fans. Thunderball was the first Bond movie trying to top the previous. And it just didn't work. Thunderball isn't a bad Bond film... it's just not that good! It doesn't has the same stylish feel as the others, and it isn't anyway near as entertaining or intense! It's also kind of forgettable! It went to become the second (and possibly last) Bond film to win an Oscar. It won for best effects, best visual effects.Surprisingly, Terence Young directed Thunderball. While he directed Dr. No and From Russia With Love flawlessly, it's like he doesn't know what to do with this movie. Is he going to make another serious Bond film which resembles a spy thriller, or a silly but still entertaining Bond flick as Goldfinger was! SPECTRE has stolen two atomic nuclear warheads, and are threatening to blow a city in USA or England up, unless ransom money are paid. As always it's Bond's job to prevent it all, find the warheads and disarm them. Not a bad plot. But the movie is just so bland! It lacks the suspense and intensity that made the the other three so great. But the movie isn't that bad! It's got some memorable action, some very beautiful women, good humor, etc. I suppose that it's because it precedes such good films as the previous. Had it been a later entry in the series it might have seemed better! But the movie could have been told better, and it could have been much more entertaining instead of much more bland!Sean Connery is James Bond for the fourth time, and he's good as usual. But I do think that he sometimes looks bored, and this is the first film where he begins to show his age. But Connery is Connery and he is awesome! But I do think he could have been better and more sophisticated in this film! Claudine Auger is the Bond girl, Domino Derval! She's incredibly sexy, but she is kinda boring at times, and her acing isn't that good. But she's OK. She is relevant to the story, and you can't say that about many Bond girls! Adolfo Celi plays the films villain, Emilio Largo! He's SPECTRE nr. 2 and that's kinda cool! But he's just a middle aged man with an eye patch. When you compare him to the other Bond villains he's kind of a let down. Whatever, his performance is solid and he's an OK villain. But just OK. We don't really have an indestructible henchman, but we do have the femme fatale in the form of Fiona Volpe, portrayed by Luciana Paluzzi! She is one of the sexiest Bond girls in the entire series and she's a good actress! Her character isn't given much depth, but she's very cool! Desmond Llewelyn is awesome as Q, and Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell reprises their roles as M and Moneypenny, respectively. We also have the second appearance by Ernst Stavro Blofeld at a SPECTRE convention! He's still epic and awesome, and his scenes are one of the only scenes in this movie to be truly memorable!Thunderball is kinda' bland, boring and forgettable compared to the three previous Bond flicks, but you do get the ingredients to a decent Bond film! I watch it sometimes and I think history has been kind to it. I like it more every time I watch it! The movie feels like Bond is on a vacation, and not stopping over the top villains. It doesn't quite work. But it is a decent Bond film, and hardcore Bond fans (such as myself) will find it watchable and enjoyable to a certain degree! Casual viewers my find it a bit boring, though. All in all Thunderball is a decent Bond flick, but not one of the best!7/10",Thunderball
246,ivan2012,Too many boring underwater scenes,7,10 June 2014,"Do you have an enthusiasm for water sports like Bond? If you do then you will probably love Thunderball. For me, however, there were too many boring underwater scenes (snorkeling, diving, or whatever he was doing), and that drags the rating down to a 6/10. This film is still a fun adventure. It just doesn't compare favorably to the other Bond films. I actually liked the remake, Never Say Never Again, more than this. On the plus side, Thunderball has more than the usual number of Bond girls. I counted four (two good, one henchwoman, and one which was not involved in the plot). The bad guy (No. 2) was also one of the more memorable Bond villains. A 6/10 is still a good score for me, so don't get the wrong impression. I still like this film. It just has some boring parts that make it a below average Bond film.",Thunderball

Goldfinger may have had the memerable villians, but in this one, everything is memerable. From the opening sequence with the rocket pack, to Spectres high tech meeting room(which was later copied in Austin Powers) and the stolen nuclear weapon plot, which was repeated in several Bond films to come. Connery was at his best in this film(even though at this point, he was beginning to tire of the long shooting schedules), the gadgets were in great surplus, but werent yet oversadowing the character of Bond, and the action sequences were superbly staged and shot.The film does however get bogged down during the theft of the vulcan, and later in the climatic battle between Largo's men and the navy. Still, these shortcomings dont ruin the film from being the best Connery film.

Many fans and viewers think Sean Connery is most zestiest and suave in this movie, and that this one of the best Bond films ever made. I do not agreed with this being one of the best Bond films ever mad. The movie before this one isn`t either because both movies had plot-holes and story development and most Bond movies used the same plot over and over with meglomaniac trying to harm the world in some sort of way and Bond always saving the day, but that wouldn`t change until the early days of Roger Moore and most of the Bond movies from the 80`s.

249,electrictroy,Sean Connery's Favorite Bond Film,9,13 August 2005,"Apparently a lot of people don't like this movie? Well after seeing Thunderball last night, I have to disagree. It's as good as From Russia With Love or Dr No. Perhaps even a little better.Without rehashing the plot, I'll just say - I *really* enjoyed the underwater scenes. It's refreshing to see battles taking place with scuba gear and arrows, instead of the overdone guns-firing routine we see day-after-day on TV cop shows. The underwater scuba gear, subs, and arrows add something new & different to enjoy. Plus, the overlying music does a great job of adding to tension.And of course, the Bond women - not just one, but a set of three - a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead - all looking stunningly beautiful in their bikinis (or nothing at all).Still not convinced? Well as I put in the title, Sean Connery considers this his personal favorite. If Mr. Connery recommends it, it's worth at least one viewing in my opinion. Go watch it now. ;-) troy",Thunderball
250,sinomatictool,Shaken and Stirred into Fantasy land,6,23 November 2002,I found this Bond a lot harder to believe than the others I have seen. Especially the final scene where he far exhausts his breathing supply. At only 4 minutes his little tube would not sustain him while in a constant fight for closer to 10 min. But its Bond so thats expected. The overall plot was simplistic and not that fun to try and follow as some are known to be. It also broke many of the traditions of the formula for Bond. Which could be taken either way. This was a good Bond but not a very entertaining one.5/10,Thunderball
251,ianbrown65,Mid-ranking Bond but still a favourite,7,20 January 2015,"Terence Young returned for Thunderball at the height of the 007 craze, but this fourth Bond marks the first signs of the polish of the Eon formula becoming glazed. Young blamed the underwater sequences which dictated their own – inevitably more languorous – pace, although the muffled thud of the harpoons as they puncture the bodies they slam into gives it a nasty edge.The more cluttered script in Thunderball may lack the clean narrative line of its immediate predecessor Goldfinger, but there is plenty to enjoy. If the baddies are not quite so grotesque, Adolfo Celi has a powerful feral malevolence and Luciana Palazzo a voluptuous sexuality heightened by her refusal to succumb to our hero's charms (composer John Barry even awards her a musical legit motif of her own). She's got much more sexual electricity than Honour Blackman in the previous film, or indeed of main heroine Claudette Auger in this one. Young generally handles sex better than other Bond directors. Although the clichéd shots of Connery and Auger embracing underwater don't much work, the final shot in which they whisked into the blue yonder by a USAF rescue-plane has a rather magical quality.But it's also the first film where the gadgets begin to intrude. The protracted hijack and ditching of the Vulcan bomber, and the climactic underwater battle, means Connery is either not on screen or is semi-recognisable in a wetsuit, reduced to merely an operator of the propeller-back-tank.Other scenes - such as the Shrublands health farm and M's office - are pretty mundanely handled by Young. The fleeting reappearance of the Aston Martin, shot from only one angle in the short chase with Lippe's car, suggets there wasn't enough covering footage for the editors to assemble into something better. Meanwhile, clumsy continuity and poor colour grading intrude (Young only just escapes a disastrous lapse with Connery pictured in long shot with Rik Van Nutter's Felix Leiter at the casino before the script has them meeting next day).But Ted Moore's photography makes good use of the Bahaman location, all hard azure sea and white beaches. His handling of the Junkanoo carnival chase (one of the best sequences in the series) is a riot of exciting vibrant colour. Apart from the main theme, Thunderball boasts some of John Barry's wittiest music, notably his pounding calypso score for the Junkanoo chase, repeated for the climatic fight on board the hydrofoil. Only designer Ken Adam is constrained by a screenplay that doesn't call for a single large elaborate set, although the MI6 conference room is rather elegant. The traction-device in the health clinic, although even more sexually allusive, lacks the outré frisson of the laser-beam in Goldfinger.And the climax certainly delivers. Even if the matte shots used in the fight in the hydrofoil's cabin – as it skims precariously between the reefs - are quite blatantly speeded-up the resulting action is as vicariously exciting as Connery's battle with Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love, a furiously cramped bout of kicks, scuffles and bone-breaking blows, with music and editing used to maximum effect.",Thunderball
252,bsamdahl,Much better than the remake Never Say Never Again,7,8 February 2003,"I just wanted to comment on how I thought Thunderball was much better organized than the remake, Never Say Never Again. How the atomic weapons were stolen was one of the best parts of Thunderball. It just seemed that there was more intensity in Thunderball. Part of this may have been due to an attempt to make a competing Bond film after legal battles with the original Bond producing company.  The underwater battles were actually well done in Thunderball. Usually I don't care too much for underwater footage but this film made it clear as to what was happening.",Thunderball
253,mcfische,"Decent follow-up to ""Goldfinger""",5,6 August 2003,"""Thunderball"" seemed to be a little distant from the rest of the Bond films. It may be it was produced by Kevin McClory, show biz's biggest baby. Maybe it was because Ian Fleming had never visited the set of this film. Maybe it was the fact it had to live up to Goldfinger. Or maybe it is because of it's lousy re-make, ""Never Say Never Again."" Whatever the reason, it is distant from the rest of the official 007 films. The plot is good, no doubt there.SPECTRE is back after a one-film absence. The still faceless Blofeld, his cat now fully-grown, has called in his top agent, Largo, for his latest mission; sink a plane and recover the two nuclear warheads on it, and hold the U.S. and England major cities for ransom at 100 million pounds. 007 is called in, and Sean Connery still has it. Felix Lieter is good in this film, but his hair is too gray. All the women are just worthless parts. I like the Jamacian setting, M, Moneypenny, and Q (although Q seems overly irritated with 007 here). The film's isolation, however, makes it hard for me to describe and gets it a 6 out of 10 rating. The song is one of the best, but not as good as From Russia With Love's. I like the Goldfinger song, but not the singer.A decent follow-up to the first major Bond film, ""Thunderball"" needed no stupid Baby McClory re-make.",Thunderball
254,jacob-l-williams,"Great start, lame middle, good ending... a typical Bond movie",5,3 June 2010,"Thunderball is a perfect example of everything that a Bond movie should be and upon viewing this film it is clear how all twenty or so films have been so successful.The film mixes action with comedy and romance to portray the life of someone who is in essence an assassin. However the film for me brought nothing new to the Bond films as some of the other have done.Now you may say to me that it did bring something new to the Bond genre because it was only the fourth film and I have seen many of the others before this, but I have recently begun watching them in order and of the four this is by the far the poorest. The action does not live up that in Dr. No, it is not as witty as From Russia With Love and Sean Connery's performance is nowhere near the standard he reached in Goldfinger. Even the girl in this one does not reach the same standard of beauty.When I turned on this film, like most Bond films I was enticed by the scene before the titles that sets up the film and once again the Titles themselves were impressive and the song sung by Tom Jones is as good a theme as any. However after the initial excitement the film seemed to turn into a drag out of underwater scene followed by underwater scene, now I know that at the time this underwater action was cutting edge but I still find it a bit extreme and can see why people refer to Thunderball not by it's title but as 'The Underwater Bond'. After this tedious middle it does pick up when Bond escapes through the carnival and the final underwater fight scene and the part on the boat are also impressive, it's just a shame it couldn't reach a consistent level.So overall the film is typical for a Bond nothing particularly special but if you are a fan of the James Bond action, romance, witticism in your films you will enjoy it but maybe not love it.An average film so 5/10 :)",Thunderball

256,benjscott,"""Codename... Thunderball""",7,4 May 2019,"After 3 successful films in this series. It may have followed trails from Goldfinger (1964) to something far greater. The truth is, it's not. I have to admit that director, Terence Young who also did Dr. No (1962) & From Russia with Love (1963). Did a smashing job with action scenes in this film. Sir Tom Jones became the first male singer for the opening credits sequence.What I disapprove about this film. Kevin McClory. I don't care who came up with the plot for Thunderball, novel or film. Kevin McClory was the venom of this Eon productions' iconic film series. Kevin McClory sued the creator, Ian Fleming for the rights of Thunderball. Which lead Ian Fleming the rights to the novel version and McClory the film version. With the stress of Ian Fleming's defeat of McClory's victory. It lead to Fleming's death. To avoid risks of jeopardising the film series, Harry Saltzman and Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli gave Kevin McClory credit to be the main producer of this film. Later in 1983, McClory remade Thunderball named, Never Say Never Again. Which also starred Sean Connery as James Bond. Which rivalled the 13th official Eon James Bond film, Octopussy (1983).",Thunderball
257,Orpington,Bond takes a dive,4,24 July 2003,"After the huge success of Goldfinger, the producers of the Bond series wanted the follow-up to be bigger and even better, and Thunderball thus became the most ""epic"" Bond film yet made. However, although it made more money at the Box Office than its three predecessors, it is nowhere near as good as any of them. Indeed, Thunderball is arguably the weakest of all Sean Connery's Bond films, along with the tacky Diamonds are Forever.One of the film's central problems is that it tries too hard to outdo Goldfinger. The lengthy underwater sequences look grand enough, but precisely because they are underwater it becomes difficult to follow the action, and confusion and boredom set in. Given the epic scale of the film, the editing is surprisingly shoddy, and most of the cast appear to have been dubbed. It is a shame that this was director Terence Young's last Bond film, because he had done a great job with Dr No and especially From Russia with Love. Thunderball, however, is just not up to the same technical standards, and it sadly meant that Young left the franchise with a whimper.The cast is also a disappointment in this film. Connery himself is fine as OO7, but his performance is less intense than in earlier Bonds, and it seems as if he was already tiring of playing the role. Sadly, he gets little in the way of good support from other cast members. Adolfo Celi turns in a rather dull performance as the main villain, Emilio Largo, and although Claudine Auger looks good in a diving suit, she does not make Domino one of the more memorable Bond girls. The plot fails to hold the attention either, which is a pity because the basic scenario - SPECTRE steals two nuclear missiles and holds the world to ransom - had the potential to be much more exciting. This film, however, is much too pedestrian to generate the excitement required.Thunderball looks big and epic, but it is really something of an empty shell, drowning in its own underwater world. There are some memorable scenes, and Tom Jones' title song is enjoyable, but ultimately it is one of the least satisfying entries in the series. Ironically I preferred Never Say Never Again, the much-lambasted remake.",Thunderball
258,Brooklyn-Boy,The best James Bond movie and the prettiest Bond girls,9,14 May 2005,"This is definitely the best 007 James Bond movie ever, with the best actor who interpreted the agent Sean Connery, you have to see for the year 1965 the special effects were very good, and the girls, well what can i say?.I have always like the James Bond movies because of the action scenes and because of the girls, and in this movie the girls are prettiest than ever, with redhead beauties Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi, and brunette gorgeous Maxine Bershwich, this movie have drop dead gorgeous beauties, which i like as a female beauty lover.What else can i say, it is important to see this movie not only because of the girls, but because it was like what we have before the action movies we have today, and there we can see how these movies were before.",Thunderball
259,ymamedy,Clumsy,2,20 July 2001,"Sean Connery reached the zenith of his Bond career in Goldfinger and it was all downhill after that.  The first difference I noticed about this movie was that this was the only Sean Connery film where the gun-barrel sequence was filmed in colour.  But unfortunately, the picture quality throughout the rest of the movie is poor, with much speckling.The opening sequence is very good, with Bond tussling with a SPECTRE agent in drag.  However, the credit sequence and title song are very disappointing.  The main problem with this film is that it does not flow smoothly.  Many of the fight sequences are filmed inelegantly.The plot concerning the theft of two NATO nuclear weapons is overly simplistic and insults the intelligence of the viewer.  Largo is a comical character rather than a menacing villain.  But Thunderball sees Blofeld at his most threatening, his face shielded from view.  In You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever we see Blofeld's face and this makes him seem less nefarious.Much of this film takes place underwater and this leads to it moving at a slow pace, especially during the last hour.  Sean Connery put in a good performance as 007 in this movie but he didn't have a lot to work with. After three succinct and relatively low-budget Bond films the producers decided that big was better.  How wrong they were.After Goldfinger the producers should have put the Bond series on hiatus for a couple of years, but instead they rushed to produce this lame effort. Putting Connery's Bond movies in order from best to worst: -1- Goldfinger2- From Russia With Love3- Diamonds Are Forever4- You Only Live Twice5- Never Say Never Again6- Dr No7- Thunderball",Thunderball
260,The_Eighth_Passenger,"The name's Bland, James Bland.",6,26 January 2010,"Terrance Young is back in the director's chair for Sean Connery's fourth outing as James Bond. You wouldn't believe it if you didn't know it though, as Young seems to have decided that more is more and so lets things get even more outlandish than they were in Goldfinger as Bond is sent on a mission to discover who has stolen a nuclear missile.S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are back and again we get a faceless Blofeld pulling the strings. The main villain of the film however is S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s no. 2 Emilio Largo, played by Aldofo Celi. He is a relatively uninteresting villain but Celi's performance is satisfactory. Connery is again good as Bond and the character feels more like he did in Dr. No and From Russia With Love after feeling somewhat diluted in Goldfinger. This is the last time Connery would even appear interested in playing 007, so lap it up. Claudine Auger as Bond's squeeze Domino gets the job done and looks very nice indeed. Felix Leiter appears, again, and is played by a different actor than before, again. Rik Van Nutter contends with Norman Burton from Diamonds Are Forever as having the worst performance as the C.I.A. operative. He is completely useless and Bond even talks down to him and shuts him up. I don't know what it is with this character but the filmmakers just seem to want to make him look like a buffoon for the most part.Much of Thunderball's time is spent underwater as people dive and this is where the film really falters. The entire 20 minute action sequence leading up to the films' finale is nearly unwatchable as there is too much going on, too many henchman swimming around thus rendering it impossible to tell who is who and who is doing what and it is too damn dark to try and make any sense of it anyway. Young really seems to have lost his touch when it comes to action, although there is quite a good scene earlier in the film when Bond is thrown into a swimming pool full of sharks. All of the Bond films up until this point had utilised the idea of speeding up the film after the fact to make things (cars, fights etc) appear to be moving faster than they really are. It is an old fashioned editing technique which is sometimes distracting but I often find it charming for some bizarre reason I cannot explain. This technique is used far too much in Thunderball however, especially in the climax as Bond and Emilio scrap on the bridge of a boat. It really takes you out of the scene and to be honest, I laughed. It looks crap, enough said.It's not all bad though and Young's direction, while not as good as it had been previously, coupled with Connery's presence is enough to keep things moving along nicely during the first two acts. Despite having a rather boring finale and not much of a villain Thunderball still manages to settle somewhere midtable in my overall Bond rankings. Tom Jones' title song is one of my favourites, maybe that has something to do with it. Make no mistake though; this is 007 at his most mediocre.",Thunderball
261,armandcbris,one scene stands out...,9,18 November 2006,"...of many, of course.Many other reviewers have written about this film in various capacities, but let me offer my own take by highlighting one scene that made me laugh and yet was perfectly in keeping with Connery's take on the Bond character.In the card-playing scene with Largo, Bond manages to beat him at cards several times, whereas Largo states: ""You seem unbeatable, Mr. Bond."" What does Bond say? Nothing. He just puts on a smirk and waves his hand as if it's a given. Bloody brilliant. The scene stood out upon watching the film in the new special editions that came out recently. Having seen the movie many times before, it was just one scene that illuminated Connery's mastery of the character in this particular brilliant Bond flick.",Thunderball
262,josephkinion,The 4th film to Star Sean Connery as James Bond,10,29 April 2019,"The film begins with James Bond attending the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a SPECTRE agent who had murdered two British agents. As it would turn out, a woman who Bond notices open a car door for herself at the funeral is Bouvar in disguise. Bond comes to this realization and ambushes Bouvar at his château, where he kills him. Afterwards, Bond escapes using a jetpack to fly to his car parked outside the château where he has a brief battle with his pursuers, during which Bond uses water cannons on the Aston Martin DB5.
A major difference between the novel and film versions of Thunderball is that, in the film continuity, Bond was first introduced to SPECTRE in Dr. No and the events of From Russia with Love are also masterminded by the organization. The plot of Thunderball deals with SPECTRE attempting to hold the world hostage by hijacking two nuclear bombs. In the film, the Avro Vulcan that is transporting the bombs is hijacked by a SPECTRE henchman who has undergone plastic surgery to appear as a NATO observer that would accompany the pilots on the trip. Once in control of the plane, the henchman lands it in the middle of the ocean near the Bahamas where Emilio Largo (number two in SPECTRE) and his men retrieve the warheads and conceal the plane from any sort of overhead reconnaissance looking for it. The bomb retrieval begins after Largo kills the man posing as the NATO observer because he demanded more money prior to the hijacking.
Prior to this event, Bond is ordered by M to attend the Shrublands health farm in order to improve his physical condition. While enjoying a massage from a employee Patricia Fearing, Bond meets Count Lippe, a shifty individual who becomes distrustful of Bond when 007 notices a gangland tattoo on the Count's arm. Lippe subsequently attempts to murder Bond on a traction machine by extending his spine to incredible lengths, but Bond is rescued by the attendant (whom he promptly beds); Bond subsequently has his revenge by trapping Lippe in a steam bath, although the count survives. Things become stranger when Bond finds a dead man wrapped in bandages, and survives yet another attempt on his life.
Due to the SPECTRE crisis, MI6 calls an emergency conference where a number of 00-agents are briefed and given assignments (although no faces are clearly seen, this is the first time 00-agents other than Bond have been seen on-screen). Initially M assigns Bond to Canada, but Bond recognizes a photo of the NATO observer as the dead man he saw at the health club. Since the NATO observer's sister is in Nassau, M allows Bond to journey there to investigate. The sister, Domino, is Largo's mistress. Bond exploits this connection to get close to Largo after meeting Domino while scuba diving.An additional character in the film is Fiona Volpe, who is not in the novel. A member of SPECTRE, she was responsible for the substitution of the NATO observer, and attempts to kill Bond after rendezvousing with Largo in Nassau. She is later shot in the back by a bullet intended for Bond while dancing at a nightclub with him during local Junkanoo celebrations. Bond leaves her body at a table, saying: ""Mind if my friend sits this one out? She's just dead.""
Amongst Bond fans it is controversial as to whether or not Bond intentionally moves her into the path of the bullet, Fleming's Bond being against killing anyone in cold blood.
In Nassau, Bond teams up with Felix Leiter and the two set out to find the hijacked plane, which they eventually find along with the corpse of the phony NATO observer. Afterwards Bond informs Domino that her brother was killed by Largo and pleads for her to aid him in finding the nuclear warheads. She gives Bond information that allows for him to take the place of a SPECTRE agent on a mission with Largo, who is retrieving the nuclear warheads from their underwater hiding place, in order to plant one at its target just off the coast of Florida. After an underwater battle that Bond barely escapes from, he is rescued by Leiter from the underwater cave where the bombs were concealed. Bond informs Felix of the location of the bomb, and then he as well as a platoon of U.S. Navy Frogmen parachute to the location of the bomb where a massive underwater battle takes place. Bond eliminates numerous SPECTRE frogmen, utilizing various high tech devices, as well as his bare hands. As the battle ends, Largo escapes to the Disco Volante which still has one of the two warheads aboard, and Bond follows, sneaking onto the vessel. Bond encounters Largo, who is attempting to escape by using the Disco Volante's hydrofoil to speed away. The two have a fierce hand-to-hand fight; however, Largo is shot in the back with a speargun by Domino. Bond and Domino jump overboard as the out of control hydrofoil runs aground and explodes. Bond and Domino are spotted by a B17 who throws down a raft and a bag. Domino and Bond get in the raft and Bond throws something out the back of the raft and hooks a tank to it. It turns out this is a helium balloon and a Fulton Skyhook the movie ends with the plane snagging the balloon and Bond and Domino flying off at the end of the skyhook.",Thunderball
263,anders-rock,A little slow and bloated but still decent,6,13 March 2011,"After ""Goldfinger"" the Bond series had become the biggest theatrical event on earth and while I wouldn't say they dropped the ball with this one it doesn't hold your attention as well as ""Goldfinger"" and especially ""From Russia With Love"". For the one thing the plot is a rather generic one with the villainous organization SPECTRE demanding a considerable ransom for two stolen nuclear warheads or they will blow up a city or two. And the movie is a tad too long as well. Some scenes seem like they should have been cut or at least trimmed and at times the movie gets a little boring. But it's not the fact that ""Thunderball"" is a bad movie. There are some interesting action scenes such as Bond being trapped in a pool full of sharks, a pursuit on foot through a junkanoo parade and especially a big scale underwater battle between good and evil frogmen with Bond joining the fight. Sean Connery is still at the top of his game and has several great lines like: ""I think he got the point"" (You'll get it when you see the movie) and while Largo isn't as intriguing a character as Goldfinger, Dr No, Rosa Klebb or Red Grant he is still a fine villain played with menace by Italian Adolpho Celi and Fiona Volpe played by Lucianna Palluzi is a memorable sidekick to Largo.

267,naysbaghai,An explosive amount of fun,10,5 November 2015,"The title Thunderball may refer to the threat of atomic annihilation, but I think the name of the fourth James Bond film refers to the explosive amount of fun one has while watching the film. Call me ebullient, but this is easily one of the best Bond films to have graced the silver screen, powered by its gratifying, absorbing and exciting nature.As an entry in the Bond canon, Thunderball gloriously exhibits all the features of a 007 film with unmistakable excellence. Starting with gadgets, everyone is familiar with Bond's brief but iconic jetpack escape in the film's opening. Although most of the gadgets introduced by Q are humorously dated by today's standards, this is a nanoscopic flaw, as we are also treated to the repartee between Bond and the classic characters of Q, M, Moneypenny and Felix Leiter. It would be criminal to avoid mention of Tom Jones' sublime title song, which introduces the stunning sounds of the brass and musical motifs that appear throughout the film. Casino Royale fans will easily pick up on the many references to Thunderball, such as the setting of the Bahamas, a visit to the casino, sexy beach scenes and much more.The film exhibits the classic fashion, architecture and visual style of the 60s, and its revolutionary devotion to underwater sequences still demands respect from the audience 50 years later. I disagree with the assertion that the underwater scenes are monotonous and too long; they are exquisitely shot, despite the inconsistencies in lighting and editing, and they overcame the miscellaneous difficulties of shooting underwater (think pre-digital cameras, currents, sharks and communication). If you disregard some of the future Bond films and the fatuous Austin Powers films, the premise of the world being held hostage by two NATO bombs feels original and genuinely threatening.It's no secret that I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond, but he marginally beats Sean Connery, who commands the film with an inimitable coolness, wit and handsomeness, even if he acts like a misogynist prick at times. There are many memorable one-liners, such as ""She's just dead"" and ""I think he got the point"". In addition to the gorgeous Bond girls of the film, Connery is also supported by the formidable villain: the eye- patched Sicilian Emilio Largo, who bears a striking resemblance to the Tintin villain Rastapopoulos. Despite its brief appearance, the Spectre office is a gorgeous Ken Adams set that is simply breathtaking. In addition to Thunderball's influence on other classic blockbusters, such as The Godfather, Jaws and Star Wars, its most memorable (and perhaps strongest) quality is the immense fun and excitement experienced by viewers. Rarely have I cheered for a film throughout its entire runtime, constantly reminding myself not only how brilliant it is, but how the best action movies are not restricted to the 21st century.",Thunderball
268,thomas-williamson-ga,The Best of Connery's James Bond ?,4,26 February 2011,"Apparently many viewers seem to favor Thunderball as one of the top ranking Bond films. I have seen it three times but really didn't find the movie to improve with each viewing. Is it fair to say that Thunderball is the worst of the series? Definitely not. In fact, it isn't what I would call a bad movie. So then why do I give a 4/10 rating? Well to be quite honest, most everything held up except for the pacing. The story is good, the acting is good, and some of the characters are interesting. Sadly, THE PACING IS TERRIBLE! This is what ruined Thunderball for me. My biggest complaint aside from the dull moments of this movie is the much appraised underwater climactic scene. I'm sure the scenery for it's time was deemed magnificent. To be fair, the underwater segments were shot quite well. The problem is that they went on for far too long. Moving on to the bond characters of Thunderball; three in particular. The central villain of this movie tried to come off as a fearless leader yet had the personality of a rock. The bond girl really wasn't given much to work with and between her and the female villain, I rather fancied the female villain. OK, moving on... After seeing Connery's Bond reach his peak in the superior Goldfinger, I suppose my expectations for Thunderball were not met. Final Thoughts: A number of those who read this review will probably not agree with it. In fact, I found the loose remake of this movie (Never Say Never) to be the better version of the two. Mind you, I have all the Bond films and really enjoy most of them. Still, Thunderball is one of the few that just didn't do it for me.",Thunderball

With the return of director Terrence Young who helmed the first two films, the grittiness of those films are on display. The silliness that was introduced by director Guy Hamilton in Goldfinger carries over a bit, but isn't distracting. Largo is a great villain and Domino is one of the best Bond Girls. A real standout is Fiona Volpe, an absolutely fantastic henchwoman. Rik Van Nutter is perfectly cast as Felix Leiter, but the character is given so little to do that he's rather insignificant.

Even the music has to be about the best of the series, the lyrics of the title song delivered by Shirley Bassy in a brash & over stated style that she does so well.Later Bond movies paled in comparison, especially the Rodger Moore series. Only recently has Bond begun to find his feet again, even if he does travel by German cars instead of the excellent Aston Martin he used to have.But that's beside the point. These films will never be equalled, because the era they came from has gone. Bond could be as un-""PC"" as he liked & that gave a little spice to the character that is a little lacking these days. There was also the implacable enemy of The Soviet Union & Communism to play with and supply a string of enemies, leaving countless opportunities open for plot-line innovation.And lets face it, Bond will always be Sean Connery, like it or not. The shadow of his Bond will cast a long shadow over any future interpretations.For the plane spotters out there the sight of a Vulcan bomber being ditched in the sea (even if the special effects used for the scene let the rest of the film down) is always a sad event. But the underwater shots taken after are superb & clearly showed the way that the action in Bond movies was headed.A good one for Sunday afternoons & still capable of holding audience attention after all these years whenever it's shown.",Thunderball
273,Sloke,The film that made Bond great,7,9 February 2000,"""Thunderball"" is a solid addition to the 007 series, with great fights, fantastic locales, the finest bevy of Bond-women bar none, and Sean Connery giving his most relaxed and assured performance in the series. ""Goldfinger"" may be the movie which made Bond a social phenomenon, but it was ""Thunderball"" that gave it real legs and assured Jimbo would outlive his '60s milieu.I can't give the picture more than a ""7,"" however. On its own merits, apart from what it did for Bond, ""Thunderball"" not a great movie, or even an especially good one. The opening half-hour, as many have said, is very confusing and not a little dull. There are logic holes throughout, none fatal but increasingly annoying with later viewings. The underwater sequences are overlong and not particularly interesting to watch despite the wonderful score and the beautiful underwater scenery. I like Adolfo Celi as the lead villain, and Luciana Paluzzi was as good as bad Bond girls ever got, but I never felt Bond was truly menaced in this one, apart from the great Junkeroo sequence, which is really the highlight of the entire film.Yet I still find myself watching this film and enjoying it again and again. Yes those questions still pop up, like ""How come Largo has about a dozen henchmen swimming with him and the bombs, yet we see 007 kill more than 20 of them?"" And ""If Bond really attached himself to a floating line that was suddenly scooped up by a B-17, wouldn't it rip his torso in two?"" You start to realize after a while, as the Austin Powers people did long ago, that catching such things, and realizing they slipped by you before, is part of the fun of watching movies like ""Thunderball."" From the '60s on, fun is what a good James Bond movie has been all about.",Thunderball
274,sonomarcng,"Slower story, but well done",6,12 May 2020,Some people complain about the slower paced quiet action scenes in this one but I thought they were unique and that made them more enjoyable. Some of the editing and special effects aren't great but I can ignore that and see a good movie shine through. Rewatching the Bond movies after a 20 year gap I was most surprised with this one being better than I remembered.,Thunderball
275,mdilore,The best of Connery,8,4 March 2008,"I think that Thunderball was Sean Connery's best bond film. It had very big shoes to fill after its predecessor, Goldfinger. This is the film I think of when someone mentions James Bond. This is a true spy film with all of the sneaking around by James around Lago's house at night, the underwater investigating, and James's narrow escape at the local Mardi Gras.I cannot believe that Kevin McClory was dissatisfied with this film and went on to make Never Say Never Again. In my opinion, Thunderball is much better than that movie.I liked all of Terence Young's bond movies, but Thunderball is truly the best. I highly recommend this movie if there are any Bond fans out there who have not seen the film.",Thunderball
276,williamwallace-30771,A mediocre James Bond Movie,6,31 July 2015,"There is just nothing about this film that jumps out, neither iconic sound track, amazing storyline or characters, its just a run of the mill Bond Movie with all the usual sequences in it, Bond girls, fancy cars and SPECTRE. This outing Bond must recover 2 stolen atomic warheads in the Bahamas.Directed once again Terence Young, released just after Christmas to cash on holiday sales. It was the highest earning Bond movie in a 15 year period from 1962-1977. But I think that was just due to its release date. Christmas.Connery's script was better with lots of comical 1 liners. There weren't as many henchmen or gadgets in this particular film, but I like the gadgets so maybe a little disappointed. I am also a little bit minded to think that the underwater scenes dragged out a little. It also continues the trend of over dubbing the characters with voice over actors. There is one scene in particular with an out of control boat it just looks out of place almost cheap and nasty even corny.Emilio Largo is played by Adolfo Celi (although voiced by Robert Rietty) Dominique Derval is played by Claudine Auger.

The only parts that I actually enjoy are the ridiculous/laughable scenes. These scenes include the stretcher and the big final battle. The final battle is funny because it's obviously sped up and ridiculous. It's funny because of the film making techniques that were used. Bond movies don't have to be masterpieces. They can be serious and amazing like Casino Royale or they can be dumb fun like Tomorrow Never Dies. Thunderball does neither of those two things for me. This is my least favorite Bond film.",Thunderball
278,beany-3,*The* Bond movie,7,13 June 2001,"This is the quintessential Bond film. Connery was as comfortable in the role as he could be, but hadn't started to look too obviously old for the part (unfair, as he's younger than Roger Moore). Perhaps it was the lack of obvious icons - no Fort Knox, no Pussy Galore, no scar-faced Blofeld - but it was Bond himself who stood out. The dialogue was sharp, and funny, and it was in this film that Bond's long struggle with Spectre came into sharp focus.Can't be more specific than that. It just seems to be the prototype for all the Connery Bonds (and some might say, all the *good* Bonds). Everything else is a variation on the central theme.",Thunderball

280,JMitnik,Its like Bond has no fear... for sharks.,7,28 March 2010,"Goldfinger was great. It had everything you wanted. And afterwards, came Thunderball...The music wasn't anything special this time. It was OK... nothing to exciting, except the ""chaos music"". That was pretty cool.The story, was for that time original. If you watch the movie now, you'll get where millions of movies got their inspiration. This was probably the standard for the ""Give me money, or die"" scene. I liked the way Bond remained calm, and his cooperation with Leiter. That is something to notice...As for the actions... cleverly thought. I liked the fight in the basin, the encounters with the sharks, and the underwater battlefield. I mean, some people may find it boring, but I found it intriguing.The special effects were well done... except for the part in the boat at the end. It looked as if the boat was going faster than a plane... but that might be because it is not the newest movie ever created.I still liked the movie, and due my phobia for sharks, I remained stiff every time I saw one.",Thunderball
281,ThomasHayden,The biggest disappointment of all Bond films.,4,14 September 2005,"I perhaps despise Thunderball so much because I had great expectations when I watched it. Considering it is the highest-grossing Bond film of all time, I expected it to be at least on the same level as Goldfinger. But it wasn't. As a matter of fact ,it is rather mediocre. The problem is not that silliness that plagued so many Moore's flicks( many of them were nevertheless enjoyable), but a horrible, ill-conceived screenplay and a technical work which seems amateurish. As I have stated many times, Bond films( From Russia with Love aside) are not espionage movies. They are action-adventure flicks, dealing with exhilarating chases and fights ,death-defying stunts and a bevy of beautiful women. Therefore the real problem a Bond movie can face is not a thin ( even nonsensical ) plot, or cardboard characters, but a plodding, non action pace. And Thunderball is slow, painfully slow. For the most part , it is an exotic intrigue which would be OK if there was any mystery to solve. But there isn't. Everyone is a step ahead of Bond. Just imagine how boring is to watch ""Death on the Nile"" once somebody has told you who the murderer is. When Bond is not spending his time flirting with the gorgeous Fiona Volpe or the dull Domino, he just does some diving to find out where the bombs are. He is indeed having a good ""holiday"", but a 120 minute film simply cannot afford to spend 25 minutes with underwater sequences which add nothing to the plot. As for the technical flaws, they are particularly noticeable in the final scene when Bond confronts Largo on board the Disco Volante. Using fast motion back projection to give the impression the yacht is moving fast makes Thunderball feel like a B movie instead of the $9 million budget picture it is.I could go on with a lot of minor flaws, but it's up to you to watch this and decide. Thunderball is strictly for fans.",Thunderball
282,historian64,Peak of the early Bond series,9,27 February 2008,"I agree with the poster who said this film set the stage for Bond parodies. The title sequence was spoofed in ""Spy Hard"" and Largo's eyepacth and designation as Number Two was spoofed in the Austin Powers series.Anyway, this has the best supporting cast of any Bond film. Claudine Auger, Martine Beswick, and Luciana Paluzzi were all fine Bond Girl, Assistant, and Villianess roles, but the male supporting characters are well played. Rik Van Nutter is a young and active Felix Leiter and seems to get on quite well with Connery, but the best supporting role is that of Adolfo Celi as Largo. Unlike Goldfinger, who was a brute and a bully, Largo is charming and debonair, which magnifies his ruthlessness when it shows up.What keeps this from getting a perfect score is the stupid line involving Fiona's diatribe about coming over to the dark side after a nookie session. It's a harbinger of the awful scripts that would plague the Roger Moore films.",Thunderball

After the underwater scene, which can be entertaining at times, the ending is not bad at all. Overall I like this movie. A big portion of the likableness of this movie is that Sean Connery adds many more of those funny one liners James Bond is famous for.",Thunderball
284,rossy_boy27,"Thunder water, but far from thunderwhelming",8,12 July 2020,"Watching all the bond films in order, this is the first film I felt compelled to review. Dr no and from Russia with love are both decent spy movies introducing the character and genre but are both far too slow to really your juices flowing. Goldfinger is undoubtably one of the best bonds of all time but this is well know and it speak for itself, however thunderball has and always will have find a soft spot in my heart.
I remember the underwater battle seen well from my childhood and even now it is just as thrilling and impressive. No dialogue (being underwater and all) and yet gripping stuff for far longer than could be expected in a normal adrenaline packed romp like a bond film.
The plot is solid and the pace is electric. No one is safe from being killed off at a frenetic pace and bond barely has a moment breath between spearing a henchman and speaking a wenchman. Lots of beautiful woman and despite the rapey overtones of the early bonds you can't help but feel that something is lost in his character without that this unabashed womanising trait he has all but lost in the last Craig era.
Sean Connery gives us some of bonds best liners and Domino has to be one of if not the most attracted dame. The patch eyed largo is an interging yet realistic foe and his pet sharks are the most famous of the kind bar Jaws himself.

287,flynn1066,THUNDERBALL- My Alltime Favorite 007 Flick,10,15 October 2006,"Let's get this straight right here and now,this is my favorite Bond flick.Do I consider it the best,almost.That honor goes to FROM Russia WITH LOVE however THUNDERBALL is my personal favorite.Let's start with that man among men, Sean Connery.In THUNDERBALL, he's at his physical peak as an actor, he owns this part,otherwise every actor since him wouldn't be unfairly compared to him when they play 007.In this movie he was 34 or 35 and looks like he could take out a terrorist organization.Plus Connery has more charisma than any twenty actors that've ever lived.His Bond was a total s.o.b. which is why he's my favorite Bond,no teary eyes when a colleague or dame gets offed,he just catalogs it and takes it out on the perpetrator when he gets his hands on 'em.He's a brutal cold-blooded assassin.A football hooligan in a Saville Row suit.Is this exactly what Ian Fleming had in mind for 007? No, but with Connery you believe he could pin a man to tree with a speargun and go back to charming a beautiful woman less than a second later. He is my idea of 007 in this movie, Charming, hard-as-nails and will use anyone and any tactic to stop the bad guys.It obviously bothers him that Domino gets hurt (otherwise he'd have left her on the boat in the climax)but he's got a job to do.His fight scenes are fun to watch (not like real fights which aren't fun in any way to watch),they're ooh cool! and build up the idea that Bond is the secret service's best agent.It can't be said enough times,Sean Connery is the coolest actor who ever has or will live.I like the other Bond actors, all of 'em but for me Connery is IT. Now, The villains,I've heard some folks say Largo in this movie isn't up to snuff.I highly disagree, what is a SPECTRE if not a glorified mafiosi? Terrorists, mobsters the only difference sometimes is ideology and that is only sometimes.Adolfo Celi has beau-coup presence and charisma, enough to where you think he could be a criminal mastermind,easily.He ain't pretty or young and I think that's what the younger audiences don't like,nowadays everyone in movies has to look like GQ posterboys.Celi is loathsome as Largo,you can't wait for him to bite the big one and how he does is absolute poetic justice of course seeing Connery beat him savagely is lotsa fun too. Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona Volpe is my all time favorite Bond girl,she's cruel,vicious,sadistic and a match for Connery's Bond in the bedroom and the killing fields.She's one of the few henchman to put Connery's Bond on the run and bleeding to boot.Plus she's one of the sexiest redheads in the history of mankind.There's no converting her to the side of the angels she likes being evil, it gets her off.It's nice not seeing a character being rationalized and given the ""relativity of evil"" crapshoot we always see nowadays in flicks,some people just love hurting others and it's fun watching an actress playing that kinda part especially with as much relish as Luciana Paluzzi does here. Now to the good girl,Domino as played by Claudine Auger.WOW! she's beautiful no matter what.She's not given a lot to play with here but she's playing the innocent in wayyy over her head and in need of a real man like Connery's Bond to rescue her, although she does return the favor later in the flick.She's sympathetic,lovely and seeing her being tortured by Largo just intensifies one's desire to see Largo dead as Dillinger. The story is a cool race against time as Bond tries to find the stolen nukes before SPECTRE unleashes them on the western hemisphere. Bond goes through Largo's lackeys like crap through a goose and it's fun to see Connery in unabashed anti-hero mode.It's wrong maybe of me to enjoy it so much but his speargunning of Vargas is my favorite part, Vargas was such a loathsome little maggot,as a kid he kinda creeped me out so when Connery offed 'im, I cheered. If there's a weak spot in this flick it's Leiter,I wish Jack Lord could've returned but Rik Van Nutter was the closest to the Fleming Leiter in looks (except he had all his limbs, then again that've been taking method acting a bit too far).However he is my second favorite Leiter. The underwater action sequences are a bone of contention with lots of folks, but not me.I love'em, I have no problem differentiating the good guys from the bad guys.The music, the grappling over knives and spearguns by the combatants it gets my blood pumping.Not to mention Bond's dirty fighting tactics and his gear,or maybe I'm an aquatic action movie junkie.All said this flick is the epitome of the ""cinematic"" 007 for the Fleming 007 that's FROM Russia LOVE. I love this movie sooo much it's one of my ten favorite all time movies.Those that don't like it well that's your God-given right but I just don't get ya,probably a two way street,eh? If you like good harmless,non-p.c. 60's action movie fun, I don't think you could make a better choice than THUNDERBALL,made in the days when action movies didn't have the pacing of an A.D.D. victim on crack,sorry that was cheap and beneath me,albeit true.",Thunderball

And throwing hand grenades off the boat into the water to try and kill James Bond? Really? SPECTRE has to be the most inept group of wanna be terrorists in the history of mankind. I really didn't find the Bahamas all that interesting of a backdrop either. Why not Cuba? By the end I was rooting for the sharks to eat everyone so the movie would HAVE to end.

She sets the standards for many other female villains in the series such as Helga Brandt, Naomi, Fatima Blush, Elektra King, Miranda Frost and many others, and unlike others she does not fall for Bond and almost comes close to killing him a few times.

The movie lacks the suspense the previous two films had and it lacks the fun and spectacle later entries would show us. Its a dull film all throughout the runtime.Thunderball is 5 steps above and beyond. It has a great and interesting plot with the big explosive action. Its really the first epic Bond film. Connery nails Bond yet again and gives us his best performance as the character. The Bond girls are both gorgeous and are much more memorable than Pussy Galore (Only famous for the name because she is next to worthless in Goldfinger) and Largo makes a great villain. The cinematography is gorgeous and has some of the best locations in the whole series. Terrance Young milked the tropical setting for all it was worth. Some claim Thunderballs underwater scenes boring. Im baffled by this statement. For a film nearing 50 years old I have yet to see a movie capture underwater photography better. The epic end battle is still exciting to this day and puts most big budget CGI event films to shame.Great performances, a good plot that thankfully doesn't cross the line into camp, gorgeous locations and classy directing make Thunderball one of the very best Bond films.9/10",Thunderball
295,tapennock,"""Here Comes The Biggest Bond Of All""",10,7 December 2002,"After the great success of ""Goldfinger"" in 1964, the Bond producers, Cubby (Albert R.) Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had to find a way to top the remarkable success of their 007 film ""Goldfinger"". Kevin McClory owned the rights to the story line of ""Thunderball"". He would team with Broccoli and Saltzman to work on ""Thunderball"". To make it the ultimate underwater film, the producers decided to go with Panavision. The producers enlisted the aid of Ivan Tors Underwater Studios in Florida. This studio was famous for underwater television shows and feature films of the 1960's. Master underwater cameraman Lamar Boren A.S.C., who lensed many underwater TV shows & features like Flipper and Sea Hunt was hired to photograph the ""spectacular"" climax in reel #7 of the film: the underwater fight between good frogman vs. bad frogman. Jordan Klein,(also with the Tors Florida Unit), was underwater engineer on Thunderball. His job was to install motors in the underwater props. Ricou Browning was hired as underwater director. British cinematographer, Ted Moore, B.S.C. was at the helm of the project as Director Of Photography. Veteran British director, Terence Young, (who directed the first two films, Dr. No and From Russia With Love), signed on as director of Thunderball. He took a leave of absence after the first two 007 projects and director Guy Hamilton took the helm for the third film, Goldfinger. Thunderball would be the last Bond film Terence Young would direct. As a child of ten in 1965, ""Thunderball"" really caught my attention. Up to the point of seeing ""Thunderball"" I had only seen flat films. I had never seen anything in scope. Thunderball would be the first 007 epic photographed in scope 2.35:1 aspect ratio, released originally in the dye transfer process I.B. Technicolor/Panavision. I can see why Thunderball won John Stears an Oscar for special effects in 1965. The film is truly amazing! On a budget of only five million, (small by today's standards) the film became a landmark vehicle. What amazes me is the great work of editor Peter Hunt in regard to Thunderball. Assembling the underwater fight, like a jigsaw puzzle, certainly was a feat of magic!!! He would later go on to direct, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", in 1969. Master cinematographer, Lamar Boren must get a lot of praise for all his work on ""Thunderball"". Working with ""bulky"" three strip Technicolor cameras and slow film stock, was certainly a chore. Lighting the underwater fight was a very remarkable achievement. Also Lamar Boren and Ricou Browning had no headsets in 1965 for communication during the underwater sequences. They communicated totally with hand signals. A far cry from today's technology! Thunderball is a ""GREAT"" James Bond film. John Barry's wonderful ""mellow"" score enhances the total effect of Mr. Boren's underwater sequences. In my opinion John Barry is the only film composer that can score a Bond film properly!!! This film incorporates a lot of talented people like Terence Young, Lamar Boren, Jordan Klein, Ricou Browning, John Stears, Peter Hunt. The list is endless! Also ""Thunderball"" has a good villain Adolfo Celi (as Largo), beautiful Bond women like Luciana Paluzzi(as Fiona Volpe) and Claudine Auger (as Domino). Sean Connery is in top form at age 35. It is a great action/adventure film. Ted Moore's style of cinematography was brilliant and a lost art today. The many optical lab (picture) wipes in the film were unique and special! The only other Bond film to use these lab type scene dissolves was ""From Russia With Love"" It incorporated these types of optical wipes as well!!!This review is dedicated to underwater pioneer/cinematographer Mr. Lamar Boren A.S.C. who passed away in January of 1986! I think Mr. Boren was a genius when you look at the brilliant underwater battle. All the credit must go to Mr. Boren who was able to photograph it so well. I am still impressed with his sequences 42 year's later. The fact that this film hold's up so well after ALL these year's is a real tribute to his great cinematography!!!",Thunderball
296,danielstefulic-71531,"""She's just dead."" like this movie feels",5,26 March 2017,"Some fourth movie installments prove themselves to be great and some... not. Thunderball, sadly, doesn't.Terence Young returns to direct his third James Bond movie in official series, but he doesn't really make much. John Barry's soundtrack, among with Tom Jones' song is brilliant, but without Saltzman and Broccoli the production seems off. Why? Kevin McClory.James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to find two missing nukes, stolen by SPECTRE. SPECTRE holds the world hostage in an exchange for millions of pounds. The man who's leading that ransom is Emilio Largo AKA Number Two (Adolfo Celi). With the help of Domino Derval (Claudine Auger), he'll do everything to find the nukes, but Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) won't think so.James Bond goes from United Kingdom all the way to Bahamas to prevent any kind of disaster under any means necessary. The pre-title sequence is good in my opinion but it feels like it's lacking some taste that FRWL had. Thunderball theme song is really good in my opinion. Sean Connery delivers his performance quite good and Fiona Volpe is the best character in the movie. Sadly, there are more cons than pros.The ultimate girl of the movie is Domino Derval, played by Claudine Auger. She's beautiful, but I don't think she leaves much impression in the movie. There are some other girls Bond deals with, which in my opinion, doesn't work quite well. Unlike the previous three villains, Emilio Largo is only memorable by this patch and that's it. No wonder why Robert Wagner spoofed him 32 years later in Austin Powers. The scheme is even for today's standards too ridiculous. Every henchman except Fiona is forgettable honestly. Felix Leiter is recast again by Rik van Nutter. He's not bad, but not good really either. Even the allies seem like walking in the movie and then they're gone. The scene with Q is probably my least favorite due to the juvenile behavior in it and it's really, really bad. What's the movie's biggest problem is that the whole plot is revealed in the beginning unlike in the other movies.Sean Connery and Lucianna Paluzzi are the only ones who save this movie. Shockingly, movies like Diamonds are Forever, The Man with the Golden Gun, Moonraker, Octopussy, A View to a Kill and The World is not Enough are the movies I'd pick any day instead of this one, Die Another Day and Quantum of Solace.2,5 starts out of 5.",Thunderball

I'm not impartial to its tropical setting and John Barry's magnificent score either.The only negative points are the underwater scenes, of which there are too many (it must be difficult to make fast and exciting action sequences in water), and the death of Paula Caplan (yes yes I know, it's called the sacrificial lamb, but couldn't we have seen a bit more of her?).",Thunderball

It all ends under water.I guess from this movie onwards, you've finally got all the classic Bond elements in the movie : gun-barrel sequence, pre-title action sequences, iconic Bond theme song with title sequence by Maurice Binder and so on. Great. Spectre is back as the main antagonist, this time with Spectre's No. 2 - Largo - as the main villain. Yes, we are moving up in the hierarchy. The story is a little complex to follow with Spectre using outsiders as pawns in their game, but we end up in Bahamas with Bond following his own clues to where the bombs might be. Bond gets up close and personal with the villain, suitable impressive represented by Largo, ending up in this close friend/deadly enemy game we often see to good effect. Throw in several women as well: a female Secret Service counterpart (not really - more of a helper, producers didn't want to steal the show from Bond), an antagonist and a protagonist woman, and you got a classic Bond mix, reused in many Bond movies. It all adds up to a large scale underwater battle off the coast of Miami, involving a huge crowd of Largos men and american Navy seals. This is where things gets kind of blury. The large underwater battle was designed to be an impressive and novel movie ending, but it soons gets a bit boring, when you can't tell Bond from the next man in the huddle under water. And once more we are treated to a very unrealistic action sequence with background projections running in high speed to make things look more impressive. I wish they wouldn't have, it makes it look rather stupid and dated. And the title, Thunderball? Sounds really sixties, doesn't it, but that was Ian Flemings call. And if you feel you have seen this story before, it could be because it was remade in 1983 as the non-EON produced ""Never say Never Again"" with Sean Connery reprising his role as James Bond one last time. All in all it's a 7 out of 10 from me.",Thunderball
299,david-goldstein-b,This film shows the decline of humanity,8,28 September 2020,"This one has action, a heightened sense of danger, grand plot and four Bond girls. The main one Domino is a super slender hottie. Compare that to more modern movies! How humanity and movies have fallen. You knew humanity is in trouble when we were supposed to be interested in shorthaired Halle Berry!
Thunderball is a great bond film, but I am deducting point for the killing of the shark and the cruelty and arrogance that represents.",Thunderball
300,david_espesset,"Best Bond movie starring Sean Connery - Spectacular, thrilling, bondian, and action-packed.",9,7 April 2019,"There was a time when we were granted genuine Bond movies, which I call classical Bond movies - which were, of course, the best. This period lasted for almost thirty years, from 1962 to 1989, as the Bond movies were produced by the late Albert R. Broccoli (and, until 1974, by the late Harry Saltzman). Then, after 'Cubby' Broccoli passed away, the production team changed and the Bond movies would start to degenerate, slightly between 1995 and 2002, then (almost) completely afterwards.The very first aspect of Thunderball I ever discovered was its music, even before I had the opportunity to watch the movie itself. It is extremely difficult to overestimate the contribution of John Barry's unique music to the success of the James Bond films. The fact that Barry composed the music for eleven Bond movies clearly shows that the then producers were highly aware of this contribution. It is thus a shame Barry was later discarded from the series, a fact that reveals that the new producers were completely missing the point.To me, Thunderball is the best Bond movie starring Sean Connery (and also the best of the nine first Bond movies). Just one year after the lighthearted and somewhat caricatural - although highly enjoyable - Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball brings us back to a darker, more sober and more violent tone, a characteristic of the style of Terence Young. It would then take twenty years to have dark Bond movies again, thanks to John Glen, with A View To A Kill (1985), and more specifically Licence To Kill (1989).Thunderball represents what the Bond producers could do best in the sixties. It would take twelve years, and a new actor as Bond - Roger Moore, of course... -, to make a better Bond movie: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Despite its numerous underwater sequences (beautifully photographed by Ricou Browning), Thunderball moves at a fast pace and is overall highly spectacular. Two years later, You Only Live Twice (1967) would be even more spectacular, but the movie somewhat lacked a sense of danger, Sean Connery seemed bored to play James Bond, and Bond himself was too passive throughout the film. Thunderball also displays one of the best villains in the whole series: Emilio Largo, played by the excellent Adolfo Celi.The remastered BluRay reedition of Thunderball is splendid: a bright and colourful image, a very good sound (especially the music by John Barry, and also some spectacular sound effects) - I could hardly believe I was watching such an old Bond movie.
Thunderball: 9/10. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Thunderball

303,JimBallard,One last hurrah before Bond became generic,8,31 December 2014,"I haven't seen Thunderball for years though it was always a favourite Bond film of mine. When I was young I generally liked Bond movies for the action sequences but now I'm more likely to ask the question - who wouldn't want to be a secret agent stationed in Nassau? Even by my rather conservative tastes I have to admit that the Bahamas would be a pretty fine place to spend some time. Oh and save the world in the meantime. You see Bond gets to do all the fun touristy bits - scuba dive, make love to beautiful women, eat caviar, drink Don Peregnion '55 whilst saving thousands of lives at the same time and we love him for it! We don't start off in the Caribbean as we have an original pre-title sequence (bizarre in some ways but 100% Bond) and then a long first act at Shrublands, a health clinic where Bond is recuperating with the help of a pretty nurse, which just happens to be conveniently located near to an RAF base...... In this rather sanitized environment of all places Bond stumbles on something, but he's not entirely sure what, which is no surprise as this is about the most densely conceived plot of any Bond movie, implausible probably, but easily believable enough for a Bond movie thank you. It's also nice that the plot isn't over-explained too much as the movie flows, you may need to watch it more than once to get it all, which is fine. Connery clearly owned the role of Bond by this point, remember that Ian Fleming had initially been against him playing the character but by the time he died in 1964, he thought Connery was the consummate Bond. His concept of Bond as an upper class daredevil now seems quaint but Connery brought a convincing hard edge underneath the sophisticated manners and palette. Here he seems to be at the point of playing Bond like it's the most natural thing in the world without sleep-walking through the role as he would later. A Bond film needs more than the man himself though and preferably a good baddie. What's great here is that we actually have two. Emilio Largo oozes savagery - surely a shark loving, eye-patch wearing mastermind should choose a better disguise, but hey it's a Bond movie! - and Fiona Volpe might be the best female antagonist Bond has ever had (either her or Rosa Klebb, that would be a fight worth seeing). She is in some ways a female equivalent of Bond, cool, sexy and a very capable killer, she's just chosen the other side of the law to live on. And just as happy as Bond to use sex as she needs to. Ruthless and highly strung it's a mystery why she wasn't more of an inspiration for later female characters in the series, rather than the plastic dollies we ended up with. In all honesty she's more interesting that nominal 'Bond Girl' Domino, played by former Miss France Claudine Auger, who's perhaps a little bland but also beautiful and sympathetic. In quite a large supporting cast Bond's assistant Paula and Largo's curious henchman Vargas, who does not drink smoke or make love, are worth noting too. The film contains many of the series' most memorable set pieces, be it jet pack clad Bond, the tense Spectre meeting room complete with electric chairs, the impossibly grand, seemingly enormous MI6 conference room, the landing of a Tornado in the middle of the Sea, Bond's escape from Largo's shark tank and his cat and mouse games with Fiona, from a surprisingly tense 100 mph car ride through to the dance at the Kiss Kiss club during the Jamboree. Most memorable of all perhaps is the exquisite photography of the Bahamas, much of it shot underwater, quite a feat in 1965 as Q would have you know. Therein however is the film's main weakness and why it doesn't quite manage full marks. Whilst some of the underwater scenes are very good and in the case of Bond and Domino remarkably sexy, the ending fight sequence doesn't work perfectly, going on for too long and being rather ambiguous. Sharper editing and more clarity would have helped. Having worked so hard for the first two thirds of the film to create the most tense situation imaginable, the final act doesn't really deliver as you'd hope and is actually less suspenseful than many of the (much derided) ticking bomb climaxes of other Bonds. The increasing focus on high tech gadgetry at this point in the series, with each item by coincidence helping Bond escape from a particular situation pushes things a little as well though not as much as with later Bondage. So all in all it's not quite as flawless as the previous year's Goldfinger but Thunderball perhaps gets unfairly maligned as the point when the Bond series started going downhill. In fairness it represents one last hurrah before Bond became generic.",Thunderball

305,steppingstonefilmsltd,"Bond flick with a fit looking Connery, slightly confusing plotting but average to good movie overall",7,24 December 2005,"Bond is looking smart, fit and trim in this one. Connery at 35 running around is fun to watch. The girls are abundant, pretty and very willing as always, however I found them a bit similar looking and sometimes it was confusing who was who if one was dosing off after a big X-Mas dinner.Underwater sequences are the highlight of the movie and they are well made considering it was 1965. The tradition of raising standards of stunts/action sequences and spectacular locations is well maintained.The story however is a bit confusing to follow sometimes as it moves abruptly and quickly at times. Some of the underwater scenes are too dark to fathom but don't last too long to annoy.Bond looks like a secret agent in this one by his attire and manner. However the movie lacks some of the charm all over which makes it ... well a bit dull compared to the others due to long instances of no dialogue and not much action. Some might like that as it brings some seriousness to product. It takes itself a bit more seriously that other Bond movies.Still a well made Bond movie and mostly remembered by its aqua theme.",Thunderball
306,aslon05,Superb,8,13 May 2006,"This is the best Bond movie I have yet seen. The story is very good, Connery is simply superb in the role (much better than Moore and Brosnan and all the others that have followed), the women are really sexy, the background music for the action scenes superb and the underwater scenes amazing for a film made in 1965.I have never understood the fuss about ""Goldfinger"" which is supposedly the best Bond movie. I have to disagree. This must count as the best movie.The Bond films had a particular significance during the Cold War. And that context made them extremely enjoyable (when made well). They shouldn't make Bond films now because the context is gone. And all we have now is just special effects rather than a classic Spy movie.",Thunderball
307,gregplx,Probably the worst acting in a 007 film,2,19 January 2007,"Most people on this site think this is a great Bond film. I found it slow moving, fight scenes underwater that went on, and on, and on way too long. The worst thing of this film is the acting. Connery is great, but everyone else is flat and deadpan like they were just reading the lines with nothing else. I think after the success of Goldfinger they rushed this one. Just as the underwater scenes, the ending fight between Bond and the villain is drawn out way too long. To say nothing of the way they ""speeded"" up the action by speeding up how many film cells per second is very bad. I love the Bond character and most of the other films, but, I'm sorry, in my opinion this was the worst Bond film.",Thunderball

309,mattbattison,The Quintessential Bond Film,9,27 April 2005,"Many fans of the James Bond films will say Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond film, but Thunderball is the one Bond film that would explain to anyone who hadn't encountered the genre what a Bond movie is all about. And Thunderball outshines Goldfinger in the vital categories by which a Bond film is measured: The women Bond interacts with (Claudine Auger, Luciana Paluzzi, Martine Beswick, Rose Alba) are more beautiful and plentiful, and their wardrobes are more sexy. The dialog is better, with more good quips and wry humor than Goldfinger. The villains are more memorable (see the Austin Powers movies if you can't figure this out). The location was more exotic (watching the Bahamas as a backdrop beats the heck out of the same old U.S.A. most movies take place in.) And the Q-type gadgets were numerous but took nothing away from Bond's bravado.This movie bears some similarities on the surface to Dr. No, the first official Bond movie -- the Thunderball story supposedly was selected for the first Bond film at one point -- but Thunderball has considerably more polish to it than Dr. No did. One can forgive the shortcomings of Dr. No, which had a more modest budget at a time when no one could accurately forecast the appeal of a Bond film. But Thunderball was the apex of what a Bond movie could be. The plot of Thunderball also got about as realistic and serious as Bond movies ever did, before the genre plunged into self-satirizing from the 1970s on.That stated, the movie is not flawless. (No Bond movie is, for that matter.) I had to have some reason to give it nine stars and not ten:Continuity problem: In an underwater fight near the end of the movie, Bond loses his blue dive mask. He grabs a black dive mask from a nearby villain, puts it on and clears it, and...surprise! Next time we see Bond's face, his mask is blue. I suppose we can rationalize that, as movie viewers, we just didn't see a moment where Bond used the black mask to locate and recover his blue one. Maybe Bond is concerned that he'll be mistaken for a bad guy if he keeps the black mask?Stretching reality: Bond and Domino are airlifted from a raft at the film's end by a moving airplane that hooks the balloon and tether from the raft. I hope there is a lot of elastic in that line (talk about sudden acceleration), and I would like to know how they'll be reeled in when the tether was captured at the plane's nose. I can only imagine that the plane has some sort of track under the nose that can carry the cable back to a receiving area in the plane's belly.Stretching reality again: Bond struggles with thugs underwater, beneath the Disco Volante. Then, as he swims away from the scene, grenades are dropped overboard. We can only imagine that several minutes of Bond's progress towards shore are edited out here, as the concussion of a grenade underwater would kill Bond at a close proximity, stun him from further away, and still deafen him permanently from a still further distance. Grenades under water are hazardous over a greater distance than they are above water.Now, to address other common issues people have with the movie:The frequently reported ""missing"" bombs and scientist: There are no missing bombs. The para-trooping scuba force would have recovered one of the bombs by gradually overpowering the Spectre scuba divers. This isn't highlighted during the film, but is a logical assumption. The second bomb may have been among the remains of the Disco Volante, and would not have exploded in its full mushroom-cloud potential unless properly detonated. The Disco Volante's demise might constitute the first ""dirty bomb"" explosion, possibly scattering radioactive material on the small island that the ship hit. This might spell bad news for the ""missing"" scientist, who one can assume swam to shore on one of the small islands or atolls nearby, rather than spoiling Bond's final intimate moments with Domino by joining them in the raft. If the second bomb was not loaded on board the Disco Volante, it should turn up in the underwater cave that was used to store the bombs earlier in the movie.Why does Bond get away at the Junkanoo? Here, Fiona Volpe dies because Bond, while dancing with her, turns her toward the gun at the last second. (Bond's a lucky guy, once again...but what a waste of a sexy body!) The gunshot sound is masked supposedly by the deafening bongo beats from the band. The mystery for many is why the bad guys scurry away afterward, when they could simply take another shot at Bond. Considering that their cover (the loud bongo beats) is over, and no one has yet noticed the fatality, the Spectre thugs have the option to depart unnoticed, or to make a scene. They immediately take advantage of the chance to depart. Bond could have called attention to them and to Fiona's death, and whether or not Bond took any gunfire from the thugs, the police would then be alerted. Had the Spectre thugs not decided to get a head start home, they might not have been able to escape town, and at the very least, they might have had to shoot it out with police. That kind of a screw-up, even if the thugs made it back to Palmyra, would probably invite some quality time with Largo's sharks. It was far easier for the group to return quietly and report that Fiona was the one who screwed up, and that Bond killed her. Bond simply exercised a similar option to keep quiet, not wanting to spend the night answering questions in a Nassau police station.",Thunderball
310,frankbouwkamp,one of the best bond movies,9,27 October 2005,"Thunderball is the perfect bond movie with beautiful underwater locations and a good villain (Largo). I liked the part where all the Spectre agents are together and are listening to Blofeld. You see also all the 00 agents together in a beautiful designed room. The underwater fighting scenes at the end of the movie are brilliant and Fiona Volpe is a beautiful bond girl. I really liked the sharks in the swimming pool of Largo.
