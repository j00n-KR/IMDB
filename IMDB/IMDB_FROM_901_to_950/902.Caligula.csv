0,Leofwine_draca,Flawed would-be Roman epic,6,21 December 2015,"Here's a historical film that's epic in length, if not in production values. A film financed in the US by Playboy, made in Italy with a cast of British leads, this was hugely controversial back on its release due to the explicit scenes of sex which litter the production. Be prepared for acres of heaving flesh throughout the film's course. Only one or two scenes (the lesbian interlude in particular) seem to have been clumsily inserted into the movie by Tinto Brass and generally the rest of the sex fits the story and adds to the realism of the times, e.g. the epic Roman orgy which is probably the closest filmed to how it really happened back then.Sadly, despite some impressive sets, the movie just looks cheap all the way through. Cheap, tawdry, with poor costumes, and not at all the expensive production I had expected it to be beforehand. Despite the incredibly long running time, it doesn't really drag much, even when nothing is happening, which can only be in the film's favour. It's also not as violent as I had expected, with only two scenes of graphic bloodshed which really stand out - the first is an offbeat interlude involving an incredible ""decapitation machine"" which rolls along and chops off heads sticking from the ground with huge metal pincers; the second, the film's grisly close.The inimitable Malcolm McDowell takes the lead role of Caligula and puts in his trademark intense performance. This is a very scary man who convinces you that he's insane and McDowell's turn is commanding without being over-the-top or hammy. Instead, he's just believable, underplaying it to the point in which you understand his motivations and actions. Top-notch support comes from Helen Mirren, who also excels as Caesonia, Caligula's arranged wife and a former prostitute who stands by him until the end; Peter O'Toole also appears as a madman, Tiberius, the former Emperor.As well as Mirren and O'Toole, we also get a cameo from British thespian John Gielgud, who was obviously convinced that some kind of high-brow movie was being filmed and not just a cheap exploitationer. Two other cast members are worthy of note; firstly, Teresa Savoy, who plays Caligula's sister Drusilla who is the object of her brother's incestuous desires. Savoy is underused but from what we see of her, she's totally convincing as a voluptuous, smouldering love interest and it's easy to see why Caligula wants to marry her. Euro-action man John Steiner has a memorable turn as Caligula's bald aide, Longinus, always plotting and toadying to his master until his true colours show through at the end.There are many memorable moments in this production - the aforementioned decapitation machine being one of them. Caligula's descent into a bleak madness is shown by scenes of him sharing a bed with a horse (!)The scene in which McDowell cavorts naked in the cold night air is very similar to a moment with Olivier in Shakespeare's King Lear, yet this is the more convincing situation thanks to McDowell's half scary/half tragic portrayal of the doomed Caligula. Without McDowell, I have a feeling that this movie would be worthless trash. With him, it's a flawed but occasionally worthwhile would-be epic.",Caligula
1,Hitchcoc,Ugliness to the Nth Degree,2,30 November 2016,"I just feel I need to hone in on a movie that, for me, has no redeeming value. It is based on a character from history whose life evolved around the cruelest of actions. I know that for some, the squeamish don't deserve a say in anything. I am not squeamish, but when one sacrifices plot and theme for utter violence, it's hard to watch. I have gotten used to violence since the first Sam Peckinpaugh films where could see graphic dismemberment or worse. In this, it's like a trip to a slaughterhouse. I don't think we should shrink from portraying scenes when they are necessary. This one did nothing for me. Its glossiness and high tech efforts simply exacerbated its lack of a message.",Caligula
2,mark.waltz,Ancient imperial Rome died of perversion.,2,2 August 2016,"Certainly Malcolm McDowall has been excellently cast as the most nefarious of ancient rulers. Whether you have read historical accounts of his life or Jay Robinson's portrayals in ""The Robe"" and ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"", or most notably John Hurt's in "" I, Claudius"", then you know what a mad man he was. Taking that BBC mini-series to a different level in dramatic liberties, adding various perversions into the story.Starting from the last days of Tiberius (Peter O'Toole, much more lively than the subtle George Baker of ""I, Claudius""), this tries to give the impression that Caligula didn't really start going mad until Tiberius began taunting him about being murdered by family members himself. It lacks the motivation of what Caligula was like as a child which through history made him mad from the start.The sexual activity of the film gets boring after a while, showing straight and gay sexual acts of every kind and even having McDowall deflowering a virginal bride on the wedding night and even taking it upon himself to humiliate the groom as well. While not shocking to me, I just found it gratuitous to show that, especially after a scene where Caligula and his court pelt victims of a head chopping machine with eggs right before they get lopped off.It's lavish to look at, much like a Fellini movie, but lacks in real artistic flair. A lengthy orgy scene with Tiberius is tried to be topped later with one when Caligula turns the senator's wives into prostitutes for his palace bordello. There are some moments where I did laugh and do double takes, but mostly, my eyes just rolled.John Gielgud manages to save some dignity by departing after only two scenes. I couldn't even recognize a young Helen Mirren, and I didn't care enough to rewind. But the hand on the fast forward button did come in handy to get through close-ups of the groins of naked women, leading to unnecessary lesbian sex scenes. All I really wanted to see were the historical highlights. The rest of it, well, not so special, and ultimately sleep inducing.",Caligula
3,kosmasp,Rome goes crazy,7,29 July 2020,"Do as the Romans do? Please don't! When it comes to this movie that is - which apparently had certain things depicted that people actually did. And while I won't knoch any woman (or man I guess) who tries semen cream, I don't think that is what many would call another day at the office.If that sounded gross (you probably already left disgusted), I only described something that happens in the movie. And it is just one of the many despicable things happening. So if that bothered you ... oh boy (or girl). You're in for a treat. But maybe you shouldn't watch this. Although I wonder how the theatrical cut is? Then again, they would have to cut so much out ... the movie would seem weird to say the least.Still apparently there is another version to be released which is closer to the version it was supposed to be and one that Malcolm McDowell might like more (and maybe I will too). As Malcolm says (in the entertaining and very open audion commentary), there is a hidden gem here. There is also a lot of other things that are dirty and reprehensible. It will be tough to watch, with almost no redeeming character around to root for ... maybe the sister (Drusila, I wonder if Josh Wheddon was thinking of her when he named the character in Buffy) - but even she is no Angel! She looks like one, but what debauchery, what impure activities ... and more.One of the versions released had hardcore scenes in it. So apart from the ""normal"" nudity and craziness, you had that added layer on it. There is a reason the movie is infamous. It is almost as crazy as the main character portrayed by Malcolm ...",Caligula
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's shocking, graphic, violent, but worth a look.",7,27 February 2021,"The rise and fall of one of the most famous, and infamous Caesars of all, Caligula.I had only ever seen the edited version, recently I was made to watch the whole, uncut version, it was so long, it seemed to be on for almost three hours.If I'm honest, the uncut version seemed to make more sense, it flowed a lot better. The original better shows the level of depravity of the man, and the behaviour he condoned and encouraged.I can't say it's a great film, but it's definitely worth watching, at times it's just too gratuitous, and too self indulgent. It's worth watching to get a version of Caligula, I was left feeling a little confused, as to whether it's an accurate form of the man, or just the director's desire to make a porn film.McDowell is excellent, he's wild eyed, manic, and clearly very comfortable playing such a part, I think some of the acting elsewhere is very dodgy.That scene with the bride and groom on their wedding night is overly grim, it's too much.Amazing sets, and some of the production values are very decadent.It doesn't surprise me that this was a massive flop, I'm not sure audiences were ready for it.It's interesting, it held my attention, would I watch it again soon? Not on your Nelly!Worth seeing, 7/10.",Caligula
5,gavin6942,What?,6,16 December 2013,"Details the graphic and shocking, yet undeniably tragic story of Rome's most infamous Caesar, Gaius Germanicus Caligula (Malcolm McDowell).The film should have been good. Written by Gore Vidal, and starring an actor who was not afraid to tackle sex and violence... how do you mess up the biography of one of the most disturbing people in history? And yet, Roger Ebert gave it a rare zero stars rating, calling it ""sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash"", criticizing not only the film's vulgarity in its depiction of sex and violence, but also its technically incompetent direction and structure.I watched the R-rated version (at 101 minutes) and thought it was no masterpiece, but hardly the tripe some say it is. Perhaps the unedited version is much worse.",Caligula
6,jboothmillard,Caligula,1,17 July 2010,"I had heard quite a lot about this controversial historical film, admittedly because of the mention of a lot of sex featuring, I just didn't know how much it would have. Basically it traces the rise and fall of the most notorious Roman Emperor, Gaius Caesar Germanicus, better known as Caligula (Malcolm McDowell). Caligula (meaning Little Boots) started as the Prince with his father Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) ruling Rome, with a little guidance from men like Nerva (Sir John Gielgud). Caligula is very rebellious trying to get the crown, and takes drastic action when his father becomes very ill, he gets Macro (Guido Mannari) to strangle the Emporer to death, with Gemellus (Bruno Brive) witnessing. After Caligula is made the new Emporer, he immediately has Macro executed when Gemellus says he witnessed it, and then he starts forming his new government. The insane Emporer has many of his servants wearing no clothing, and he has a very sick incestuous relationship with his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy). We hear that he fruitlessly invades England, he kills anyone who displeases him, and he is made to marry the woman he finds most attractive, the most infamous prostitute in Rome, Caesonia (Dame Helen Mirren). But it was his love for sex that is the most frequent site in the film, as he arranges mass orgies in his palace for money, and there are no holds barred for what you will see. The tragic death of Caligula's sister is a big blow and he orders everyone to join in the day of remembrance, but he goes back to normal not long after and enjoys a little passion for his wife. In the end though, his terrible reign comes to an end when the men he trusted decide to murder him and his wife on the steps of his kingdom, and they declare Claudius (Giancarlo Badessi) as the new Emporer of Rome. Being made with the help of founder of Penthouse magazine, Bob Guccione, I think it obvious what the film makers were going to end up with. Obviously lovers of hardcore pornography and violence will love seeing women performing all unprotected oral, anal and intercourse, and some blood being spilt during. But me, I do not want to see almost the entire film featuring it, as well as some gay and masturbation action, especially not in a mainstream kind of film like this. If you are going to make a hardcore pornography film set in the Roman times, you don't use great British stars like McDowell, Mirren, Guilegud and O'Toole! It is like the British equivalent for Showgirls, and it is easily the worst British film I have ever seen in my life, right up there with Freddy Got Fingered as worst in my life! It was number 60 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very, very poor!",Caligula
7,BA_Harrison,A gob-smacker of a film that needs to be seen to be believed!,7,26 November 2014,"Charting the titular Roman emperor's rise to power and his descent into madness, Caligula (the unrated version) is a curious beast. A top-class cast star in this lavish big-budget spectacular, written by renowned scribe Gore Vidal, but produced by Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, and directed by erotic movie maker Tinto Brass. The result is a fascinating epic with fantastic production values, some gruesome violence and a whole load of explicit sex.Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (or Caligula for short), as you may be aware, was the tyrannical ruler of Rome from 37AD to 41AD. During his short reign of power, he ensured his place in history with his many acts of depravity, cruelty and sheer madness. Malcolm McDowell is totally believable as the loony leader who shags his sister, makes his horse a member of the senate and forces his senators' wives and daughters into prostitution. Other big names that signed up for this highly controversial movie include (Dame) Helen Mirren, (Sir) John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole.Watching these highly regarded thesps mixing with Penthouse pets performing hardcore lesbian trysts and blow-jobs is a real eye-opener and really has to be seen to be believed. The film, at a running time of two and a half hours, is quite slow going but it's worth persevering! Where else will you get to see McDowell raping a virgin bride and then fisting her husband, or a man being killed, emasculated and then urinated on. What other big budget movie gives you a smattering of dwarf sex, a machine that decapitates prisoners buried up to their necks and a woman using semen as a skin lotion? The film might be a bit hard going at times, but fans of extremely bizarre and trashy movies should definitely see this one if they can.Caligula is by no means a great film (it is overlong, factually inaccurate and at times I was tempted to fast forward through the slower bits to get to the next 'shocking' scene), but it is one of those movies that one needs to witness first hand in order to understand how truly unique and unusual it is. It's a hard one to rate, but I think I'll give it a reasonable 7 out of 10 just for its willingness to go the extra mile to entertain.",Caligula
8,Quinoa1984,art vs. porn - who wins? who knows,4,28 February 2010,"A film that announces how bad it is is something of a kind of luxury for us film buffs who are almost expecting it. Sometimes a movie's awfulness will creep up on a viewer after a while, or one will be worked up by the possibility of it being decent or memorable. Caligula may be memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. It's the prime example of what happens when someone mistakes artistic merit (or lack thereof) with a porno. There were, perhaps, some good intentions going into it: make the most vile, exposed account of the rule of Caligula, one of the most notorious ""Gods"" in history. Show the sex, show the violence, show the rampant horror of an emperor/Caesar gone awry. And cast some good actors- real actors- in the chief roles, actors like Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud, and, um, others I guess. And get a director whose directed some stuff (not sure what, but who cares, he can direct, kind of) to helm the production.But the conflict came not even so much when the producer, Bob Guccione of Penthouse, didn't go up to the director Tinto Brass and ask ""why aren't you directing with more competency? This ""epic"" looks like an exploitation flick, and not in a good way"", but in Guccione's own profit motive. He was confused, and so was the film - how does one sell a film with such prestige actors and a notorious character, but ALSO sell it to the company that one works for? What happened was the footage that Brass shot was taken away from him and the producer and his editors took lots and lots of footage of explicit nature (cunnilingus, fellatio, orgy, regular and anal sex), and spliced in footage where it either wasn't needed or became extraneous. As if to further dig it to Brass, they used the *bad* takes, ones that weren't supposed to be used, for the majority of the action.Having the sexual footage wouldn't have been so bad if a) the explicit sex wasn't so dull and repetitive (as, say, a typical porno turns up to be), and b) the rest of the movie around it wasn't so excruciating. It's also distracting at certain points that have some promise to be better than it is, for example a morose three-some between Caligula, Drusilla and Caesonia that has the potential to be erotic... but the Guccione cuts away constantly to a female orgy behind the curtains. It's a stupid call to make, untrusting, in fact, of either the audience there to see the actors, or those handful of folks watching it simply to get off. If Guccione really was cutting the film together for the latter, he also failed because someone watching it just to get off would turn off the film before it ends.The dialog, written by a distanced-from-the-production Gore Vidal, is turgid most often, and other times is just barely passable as being able to be spoken. And for all of the extravagance of the sets and costumes, the production feels cluttered and excessive. And the extreme acts shown in the film, and believe me, there are many (some with McDowell like the ""deflowering"" of the virgins, or the cutting off of the man's crotch, or the giant saw-machine cutting off heads), are done in a slack exploitation style that doesn't even excite on the basis of blood and guts and things. It's one thing to muck up usual things like acting and dialog, but another, if one is a exploitation director, to muck up visceral pleasures. It's too self-serious to be campy, and too graphic to make it in an art-house for too long.So why the four-out-of-ten rating? Malcolm McDowell, really. He knows he's taking a p***, so to speak, but he does have fun with a role that requires that much. His other contemporaries- O'Toole and Gielgud- barely have enough screen time to show much, though they look bored or just befuddled to even be on the production, and Helen Mirren, while attractive and competent in the role, doesn't add much to the production. But McDowell seems to get it, of how to go over the top (or even in the struggle to find a top to over this case), and there are some scenes where he's very funny, like when he gets his senators to bah like sheep, or when he shuffles through papers to sign with his seal. If nothing else, McDowell makes this mess watchable, and, sporadically, very entertaining.But even he can't save a troubled production. It's troubled from the first scene on, and it rarely gets to a point that the makers thought they would achieve. It's not good art, it's not good porn, it's not even good exploitaton. It's just... a fascinating blob of a movie.",Caligula
9,BandSAboutMovies,"Well, I had to watch it someday...",6,31 May 2021,"Caligula is a movie that several wanted to make their own, but only its producer could fully own.Scriptwriter Gore Vidal had intended to call it Gore Vidal's Caligula, writing a script that had a strong focus on homosexuality and only one heterosexual scene. That one was between Caligula and his sister Drusilla. He was paid $200,000 for his work and received the credit that the movie was adapted from his script, but he wanted nothing to do with the film.Tinto Brass ended up being the director, selected after elaborate sets, costumes, jewelry, hairstyles, wigs and makeup were created by production designer Danilo Donati. John Huston and Lina Wertmüller had already turned down the movie, but after Salon Kitty, it was decided that Brass would be a good fit, despite the knowledge that he was difficult to work with. He would only do the film if he could rewrite Vidal's script, which is hilarious to me, and added plenty of orgies, female nudity and male genitalia pretty much in every scene.In an interview for Time, Vidal called directors parasites and claimed that screenwriters are the true makers of the film. Brass demanded Vidal not be allowed on set and Vidal filed a lawsuit against the film. The battle between Brass and Vidal is, quite frankly, better than the movie, as Vidal wanted ten percent of all profits, calling the director a megalomanic while Brass would say, ""If I ever really get mad at Gore Vidal, I'll publish his script.""The real power we alluded to earlier?This was the only feature film produced by the men's magazine Penthouse. The magazine's founder, Bob Guccione, dreamed of making an erotic feature film narrative with high production values and name actors. He'd helped fund Chinatown, The Longest Yard and The Day of the Locust, but now it was time to make the Citizen Kane of adult films.Vidal wanted the idea of absolute power.Brass saw Caligula as a born monster.Guccione wanted to see hardcore coupling on the big screen, something that neither Vidal or Brass wanted.Well, Bob got what he wanted, locking Brass out of the editing process and shooting his own hardcore inserts -- hell, most of the movie -- with his Penthouse Pets as extras and using cameraman Giancarlo Lui as the director.Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) is the next in line for the throne of the Roman emperor, but his uncle Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) is still on the throne, despite being absolutely mad due to advanced venereal disease. He wants to kill the boy, who is protected by Marco (Guido Mannari), who ultimately kills the old man to hasten Caligula's path to power.Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then tells all that his sister and lover Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy, Salon Kitty) is his equal. To prove that he is his own man, he has Marco killed, which should show the world that maybe this kid is not alright.His sister, who he cannot marries, picks one of her Isis priestesses -- Helen Mirren! -- to wed her brother, who soon goes wild, assaulting husbands and wives on their wedding days and coming up with all manner of off the wall tortures and gladiator affairs. After barely surviving a fever and enduring the death of his sister, Caligula fully gives in to the madness inside and destroys everything about Roman society before he is killed, his blood washing down the marble steps as the film closes.The big disagreement between Brass and Guccione was over each person's taste in women. Yes, this really happened.When the film came to America, it battled pornography laws in nearly every place it played. It's also one of the few movies that Roger Ebert ever walked out of.Here's a fact that I love about this movie: According to McDowell, Peter O'Toole's first words to Sir John Gielgud were, ""Hello, Johnny! What is a knight of the realm doing in a porno movie?"" When McDowell first saw Gielgud, he asked him if he'd seen the set, to the reply of ""Oh, it's wonderful. I've never seen so much cock in my life."" Gielgud later told McDowell that he liked the movie so much, he paid to see it twice.This movie was legendary in my high school days, as there was only one copy available in our very small Western Pennsylvania town and it was in the dreaded back room of Prime Time Video. Kids who may -- or may not -- have seen it spoke breathlessly of the wonders and horrors that it contained.",Caligula
10,michaelRokeefe,Take it for what it is.,5,24 June 2009,"The early screenplay written by Gore Vidal was intended as a unique lavish big-budget epic based on the history of the controversial reign of Gaius Germanicus Caligula. By the time directors Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine fame and Tinto Brass contributed to the project, CALIGULA became an over-the-top porn/gore extravaganza. Vidal has been said to no longer lay claim to the picture. A star-studded cast may have given the movie some needed credibility. The acting is rather good. Of course the best being Malcolm McDowell as sex-driven Caligula and Peter O'Toole as the dying Tiberius. Graphic and shocking as it may be, this movie should not me mistaken for even the least bit of history to found on a trip to a good library. Also in movie are: John Gielgud, Guido Mannari, Teresa Ann Savoy, John Steiner, Helen Mirren and Bruno Bive.",Caligula
11,Theo Robertson,What Version Have I Seen ?,2,19 June 2002,"Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and "" Big "" John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if  I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely  awful film. You could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . Yes you read that right , a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !Trivia point. Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my Island and it been copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA meaning the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of  CALIGULA of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of THE THING starts . This led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. Well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . But having seen the whole of CALIGULA I don`t know what it meant either",Caligula
12,preppy-3,My first X-rated film....,1,8 January 2002,"I saw it when it came to America in 1980 and was almost banned in Boston. I had just turned 18 and was curious so I went to see it. YUCK!!!! This movie was truly sick. Castration, disembowelment, mutilation, beheadings, bestiality, necrophilia are all shoved in your face. I could care less if it's historically accurate or not...whatever it is, it's revolting! This theatre was packed when I went. During the movie many people walked out...in disgust I'm assuming. I had to leave after the two hour mark. There was a bad taste in my movie (from the movie!), my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. That should tell you something.The only saving grace in this is that they got some respected actors who, despite the material, give good performances The late John Gielgud is in the first 10 minutes and then killed off (a wise choice), Peter O'Toole is killed off after 40 minutes (another wise choice). Poor Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren (who admits she did it just for the money) suffer through the entire film. They give two great performances...much better than the film deserves.A total piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs!",Caligula
13,dbborroughs,A unique viewing experience,7,25 October 2009,"Huge sprawling epic misfire about the life and times of Caligula was written by Gore Vidal (who had his name removed), directed by Tinto Brass (who was thrown off the production and ""finished"" by Bob Guccione who added hardcore sex scenes). The film was never truly finished, production was just stopped with sequences never completed and others never filmed, it was simply thrown together because of strict release date and released on an unsuspecting public (much like the unsuspecting cast who only learned off the added hardcore after the fact). This is a unique road accident of a movie that really needs to be seen by anyone interested in films and film history.Is it any good? I honestly have no idea. I originally saw the R rated version of this film in a mostly empty theater. I was horrified and enthralled by what I was seeing because I had never seen anything so spectacularly wild. Years later I saw the uncut film on video (the only remotely adult film I ever watched with my parents) and continued under its spell.As I said the film is a road accident. Its an odd mix of wonderful scenes, poorly edited sequences, thoughtful dialog, over the top performances and a wonderful sense that more is more. Sequences begin and end at times randomly. Things happen that make no sense, people have sex and are killed in horrible fashion. There has never been another film like this and I hope there is never another.Anyone with any sense will hate the film and be offended, but then again there is something about the film that has made it survive for 30 years as a well known film when so many others have gone by the wayside. I doubt that you will be bored for long at any time in the film.Truly one of the most unique films in history",Caligula
14,Bunuel1976,"CALIGULA {Unrated Edition} (Tinto Brass, Giancarlo Lui and Bob Guccione, 1979) *1/2",3,20 March 2008,"I had watched this on late-night TV while on a visit to London in September 2002; it transpired to have not been the full-length version, since I don’t recall the hardcore footage found here. Anyway, the film is still perhaps mainstream cinema’s biggest folly: while Gore Vidal’s original screenplay may have been interesting, the end result lumbers on for 2½ hours for no particular reason except to wallow in its repellent excesses but proves to be extremely dull, even annoying, into the bargain! Despite some imposing credentials, it’s little more than an extended home movie from the people at “Penthouse” magazine: director Brass was only credited with “Principal Photography” since he objected to Lui and Guccione’s “additional footage” – which, apparently, boils down to little more than six minutes of no-holds-barred hardcore stuff! Danilo Donati (famed for his equally garish and overblown collaborations with Federico Fellini) serves as art director/costume designer – the film itself recalls the vilified later work of Pier Paolo Pasolini (with editing by Nino Baragli, no less) and, of course, anticipates the recent controversy caused by the ultra-realistic ROME TV series. The music, at least, includes judicious excerpts from the classical work of Aram Khachaturyan and Sergei Prokofiev; incidentally, according to the IMDb, the Paul Clemente listed as the film’s composer is a pseudonym for Bruno Nicolai…which is a quite fitting credit, given that he often worked for another notorious purveyor of sex – Jesus Franco! As for the cast, Malcolm McDowell re-affirms his tendency towards hamminess when not guided by master film-makers such as Lindsay Anderson and Stanley Kubrick (another notorious contemporaneous effort I had watched and should re-acquaint myself with in the near-future is the star-studded war drama THE PASSAGE [1979]) – he’s got the right intensity for the title role but is visibly ill-at-ease with the sex scenes (intending to stress the era’s utter decadence, more often than not these prove a distraction from the main plot) and particularly embarrassing when breaking into an inane dance routine. Perhaps mercifully, the thespian skills of Peter O’Toole (as a demented and sore-riddled Tiberius, appearing much older than his 47 years) and John Gielgud (as the latter’s counselor who opts for the easy way out rather than serve Caligula) are on display for only the first 40 minutes or so of this debacle. Also on hand are a number of notable regulars of Italian cinema – namely Leopoldo Trieste, Paolo Bonacelli (another Pasolini alumnus) and a campy bald-headed John Steiner. The ladies – led by Teresa Ann Savoy (sharing an incestuous relationship with her brother the Emperor) and Helen Mirren (as Caligula’s wife, dubbed “the most promiscuous woman in Rome”) and including several “Penthouse” starlets doing their thing – provide the expected glamor and titillation, though male nudity is just as much in continual evidence.Another sensationalistic aspect to the film is its level of gore, occasionally demonstrated in inventive fashion – none more so than in the solitary arena sequence where prisoners are buried in sand apart from their head, which is summarily lopped off by a cumbersome machine fitted with deadly blades! Following the bloodthirsty assassination of Caligula and his entire family by his closest associates, his obese and effeminate uncle Claudius is made Emperor; incidentally, I should be acquiring the celebrated I, CLAUDIUS (1976) TV series – with Derek Jacobi in the title role and John Hurt as Caligula – soon enough…and, eventually, I’ll presently be getting to Peter O’Toole’s other epic about the Roman Empire – MASADA (1981), itself a TV mini-series!",Caligula
15,neil-476,Eye-popping mish-mash,7,12 January 2014,"Caligula was the Roman Emperor between Tiberius and Claudius. He was also a card-carrying fruitcake, given to extreme sexual deprivation and horrific violence, and this film purports to give an account of his period as Emperor.This odd - one might even say extraordinary - film pretty much defies description, but here goes. The subject is undoubtedly a serious one: Caligula has been studied by many serious authorities on the Roman Empire, features heavily in Robert Graves' I, Claudius, and is here the subject of a screenplay by respected heavyweight writer Gore Vidal. And one must recognise the quality of the cast: Malcolm McDowell, always edgy as a young actor, is perfect casting here, and he is joined by the likes of Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Geilgud.All well and good. But now factor in the fact that the film was financed by Penthouse magazine (and produced by its then chief executive and managing editor Bob Guccione), was directed by art-house sexploitation director Tinto Brass, was the subject of massive fallings-out between all the major creative people involved, had hard-core sex scenes filmed and edited in afterwards by Guccione without the knowledge of the featured players, has ended up with at least a dozen different versions edited differently for different reasons, and has been disowned by virtually everyone associated with it.It is a mess, whichever version you see. The sexual material, whether trimmed to the bone or in full explicit flagrante delicto, is salacious, rather unpleasant, and mostly gratuitous. The same can be said for the violence. The thing screams ""sensationalist exploitation."" But the main actors all give wonderful performances, deserving of the serious film they thought they were making.Don't take that as a recommendation, though: this is a shocking film in more ways than one.",Caligula
16,HumanoidOfFlesh,Truly mind blowing epic of sleaze and violence.,9,18 June 2005,"""Caligola"" stars Malcolm McDowell as the Emperor and chronicles his rise and fall as the brief ruler of the Roman Empire.The film focuses heavily on Caligula's infamously deranged sexual practices,as well as those of his contemporaries.It's surly a pretty controversial piece of work which was heavily censored in several countries.I own the original 156 minutes long version which was cut down from the Cannes 210 minute version,which may still exist somewhere as a bootleg.The film is not as bad as it's reputed to be,unfortunately both Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have since expressed regret in participating in the film.It's clear that ""Caligola"" was directly inspired in look and theme by the vastly superior and even more controversial 1977 Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo:The 120 Days of Sodom"".Still this is a strong film guaranteed to offend the prudish and the squeamish.The sex scenes are as intense as most of your standard hard core porn,with rampant fellatio(male/female plus homosexual)and actual sexual penetration featured throughout.The film also boasts some fine grue including a castration(with the penis fed to dogs),numerous decapitations and disemboweling,so fans of sleaze and gore won't be disappointed.The lesbian scene between Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner is truly arousing as is the imperial orgy sequence.Overall,I enjoyed this film and you should too,if you are a fan of exploitation cinema.A must-see!",Caligula
17,christopher-underwood,"deserves to be watched, at least once",8,15 November 2019,"Undoubtedly the film is a mess, but a rather splendid, even glorious one. Indeed the sheer level of over the top scenes and brazen, even explicit sexuality do seem to reflect our understanding of the period depicted. Accurate historically or not it makes a change within a Roman epic to see nasty torture and killings look nasty and for orgies to actually have people without any clothes. There are magnificent and opulent scenes and there are smaller more intimate ones. There are grand speeches and jokey asides. And all of this within such a long film should not be problematic but the editing is all wrong and scenes collide with one another instead of following on. One is constantly being pulled up from one incident to address another and the lack of continuity becomes problematic. Having said all that, I have previously only watched bits and pieces and the original UK butchered version, and I have to say the overall effect here is fairly stunning and deserves to be watched, at least once, in its fabulous if flawed full edit.",Caligula
18,JamesHitchcock,"Where There's Gore, There's Brass",4,7 December 2004,"Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty. As one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', there is much naked flesh to be seen, and the film lovingly catalogues Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as though Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'Gore'). Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during the reign of Commodus, an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both those films are artistically far better than 'Caligula'.The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star) it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honourable Senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill. Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question). The film does not, however, succeed upon any other level, either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even seen as erotica it is second-rate. 4/10",Caligula
19,MovieAddict2016,Take your pick.,3,27 February 2004,"210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version released into theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), and I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.Not much of anything here, other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: ""It was like one moment I'd be staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it.""How true.What an awful movie.1/5 stars.",Caligula
20,sddavis63,"It's ..... Different, To Say The Least",2,27 December 2010,"There's a sense of sadness that I felt as I was watching this. Sadness, because Caligula is, in fact, a fascinating historical character (even if, in truth, there's not much known about him) about whom a truly good movie could be made, and sadness because producer Bob Guccione clearly went the extra mile and actually put together a pretty decent cast featuring the likes of a young Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, supported by a young Helen Mirren as his wife, and backed up by solid veteran actors Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud - all of whom, with talents pooled, could have done a pretty good job with a serious production. Ah - but the clear warning sign is that this movie was indeed produced by Bob Guccione, better known as the publisher of Penthouse Magazine. Guccione manages to take some snippets from history (admittedly not necessarily true, because much about Caligula is unknown, and much of what is ""known"" may well be legends and propaganda spread by his enemies) such as Caligula trying to make his horse a priest, and Caligula's supposedly incestuous relationship with his sister, up to and including Caligula's assassination but then he does little more than use the barebones historical record as a backdrop for what this was really about - a chance to give a degree of credibility to a movie that was about nudity and sex. I wouldn't call it porn - not even soft-core - because there was nothing particularly explicit depicted, but the nudity was everywhere. I'm sure this served as an opportunity to highlight a few ""Penthouse Pets"" of the era.I went into this with my eyes open. I knew it was produced by Guccione and Penthouse Films. I watched it out of curiosity mostly, and for a while it's interesting in a bizarre and even comedic sort of way. But I have to say that at a certain point - certainly by the halfway point, if not sooner - this literally became painful to watch. I suppose Guccione deserves some credit for the audacity involved in putting this out and assembling the cast he put together (although one wonders why well known actors such as Gielgud and O'Toole would be bothered with this) but audacity does not make a good movie. At least, it certainly didn't in this case.",Caligula

It runs (in its unrated version) 155 minutes, the plotting is poor and there isn't even one sane character in sight, to draw us in. And yet, you are never bored. You just sit there stupefied, wondering how far it's willing to push the limits of your tolerance (and of good taste!).  It's a bizarre hybrid of gore, sex and historical drama; the different parts don't connect well at all, so the graphic depictions of oral sex and rape, for example, seem to come out of nowhere. As for the acting, McDowell is actually pretty good, John Gielgud keeps his dignity (and departs early on) and Teresa Ann Savoy is quite luscious as Caligula's sister, but Peter O'Toole hits an all-time low with a brief but shameful performance.All in all, this movie IS worth seeing, if you are prepared for some of the most inconceivably and jaw-droppingly graphic sex scenes you'll ever see in a non-purely pornographic film (the violence is also strong, but not THAT strong).

I normally never watch porn at all, but I was willing to make an exception for this movie because it was the only one that I could really find that was in standard movie guides. I remember reading how much Roger Ebert despised this film and then hearing that it was Brad Jones' (Cinema Snob) favorite movie. It's so ridiculous because all he did in his review was talk about how horrible it was.This movie may have at least been tolerable if not for the fact that it goes on forever. It might be the longest porn movie ever made. You could have trimmed all the nudity out to make this an hour and a half. The film becomes too predictable, being nothing but sex scenes over and over. The acting and dubbing is quite poor too. As far as I know, this is in fact a historically accurate film. I don't know quite that much about the real life Caligula.

But it definitely isn't pornography.Worthless trash?! I suppose it is a question of taste. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

25,Dr_Coulardeau,Outrageously outstanding,10,27 January 2007,"This 2008 edition of this film in four DVDs is a marvelous piece of information about a film that was scandalous when it came out in its theatrical format. At once there was an ""uncut"" edition in VHS but the present imperial DVD edition gives three versions of the film; the totally uncut version, the alternative version, the theatrical version and a full DVD of extras. The interest is to see how our societies cannot accept to be shown what history was, cannot accept it to be shown in public, and yet let that historical reality be distributed in private, even commercially, because, among other reasons, there is a lot of money to make with it instead of a confidential black market profit.This film is basically in its total uncut version a pornographic depicting of what the reign of Emperor Caligula Caesar was. The pornography is in the film because it was in the real life of this time, of Rome in this time and of Caligula in particular. Rome was in the first century after Christ, and even probably before and long after a completely morally decadent and economically expanding society based on slavery. This slavery meant that a great proportion of the population was deprived of all freedoms, forced to do all kinds of work and they did not even have the control of their own death that could be the result of any exhaustion caused by overwork, any mistreatment from physical punishment to starvation or from whatever some slave-owners could think of, and any caprice from any slave owner or free Roman citizen that could kill, maim or in anyway torture to death or to temporary vegetative survival of any slave available at this or that time, when this or that perverse caprice, desire and impulse came into the head of the said slave-owner or free Roman citizen. We have to understand that it went even farther than Willie Lynch's recommended practices because in Lynch's case the slaves were supposed to be productive for the profit of the slave-owner to be as high as possible. In Roman times they had so many slaves and slavery was so much part of the general culture, practice and environment that they could deal with an average low productivity with some slaves working harder and some just being the toys of free people, including children.This is atrociously shown with a particular emphasis on the sexual level of this slavery. Slaves, women, men or children, could be used to satisfy any of your phantasms if you were a free citizen of Rome. There is absolutely no limit to that. What's more the Emperor had the full free use of anyone under him in any way he wanted. He could use a simple soldier or legionnaire for his own pleasure that could imply the torturing, raping, maiming in any way imaginable the said soldier or legionnaire at his own hands, or at the hands of any person under his authority. Caligula is one extreme case of such emperors, but by far not the only one. This is fully shown in the uncut version, and mostly censored in the theatrical version. The reasons of this censorship are obvious, though totally unacceptable in a free society. If a film does not satisfy the moralistic standards of our governments, then rating is the way it should be controlled. For a film producer to be X-rated is of course a catastrophe. So they prefer to be R-rated and to cut off some scenes to get that rating, knowing that the VHS version (at the time) and DVD version (today) can distribute and circulate the uncut version. The R- rating is a guarantee that the uncut version will be wanted by the public, at least a wide enough public to make it profitable. The R- rating becomes then the object and subject of some publicity if the communication necessary for that is properly organized. That was the case. This nevertheless is not supposed to hide that this atrocious social and sexual situation has to be seen in political perspective.Caligula is the relapse of the Roman Empire or society into a barbaric state that it had only partly, and even superficially left behind. This slave system was not typically Roman since it existed before and was in fact inherited from the Greeks and even beyond from the Egyptians and all societies that developed from these two centers of civilization. That kind of social order was in fact the result of the emergence of agriculture and cattle husbandry as basic activities somewhere around 10,000 BCE. This development needed division of labor and intense work in some fields like agriculture and various crafts connected to the building ""industry"". The sexual part of it was only the result of the simple fact that human beings were sexual animals. Sex was nothing but a natural activity like drinking or eating. It is this society that produced Socrates, Plato, Cicero and many others. These philosophers were the advisors of the rulers themselves, including in their sexual phantasms or their torturing pleasures.The film shows more or less, but probably not enough, how political decisions were validated, never how they were made. They were validated by the Emperor who did not even read them. They had been made by the Senate and the various counselors of the Emperor, with very little participation from this Emperor. What some people today consider as the acme of democracy, a Greek word by the way, was in fact the anarchistic dictatorship of a very narrow elite over the whole society. Human rights and civil rights did not exist at all. At best you had some ""rights"" of the elite as long as the Emperor accepted to respect them. Then if the Emperor did not respect them the only solution was his elimination.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Caligula

Even with the image only slightly compressed whole scenes focus on billowing curtains, people in the background, or action that is entirely unimportant to the advancement of the plot. Major characters speak off camera, and the camera doesn't seem to care. Extreme closeups are the order of the day, alternating with the cinematographer's one trick--zoom in, zoom out--to create an unsatisfying viewing experience. Considering the apparent opulence of the sets, and the obvious large investment in same, it is maddening to see such inept photography.

30,smatysia,Not as bad as all that,7,20 December 2000,"This comment refers to the unrated 156 min. version. Although I haven't seen ""Boogie Nights,"" from reading about it, it seems that in the late '70's there was some thought that porn could go mainstream. ""Caligula"" should be seen as an effort to further that idea. Well, we all know that didn't happen. But, I think that's why the porn scenes were included. Otherwise, this film unsatisfactorily straddles two incompatible markets. Many people will be offended by the explicit scenes, but there aren't nearly enough of them to satisfy the porn crowd. Perhaps that's also why some major stars appeared in this film. It may have been unclear at the time what the ultimate limits of sex in mainstream films would end up being. ""Caligula"" answered that question, the answer being ""Not that far.""
About the film. Direction was fairly poor. The script could have been better. Within these limitations, most of the cast did very well. Malcolm McDowell nailed the part. Peter O'Toole played it a bit over the top, but how could he resist. Sir John Gielgud maintained his dignity, as he always did. I haven't seen Teresa Ann Savoy anywhere else, but she certainly was beautiful, and did OK. Helen Mirren was great. No, the film wasn't totally historically accurate, but it's a historical drama, not a documentary. I saw men sitting at tables to eat, and to a Roman, only barbarians did not lie down to eat. I never saw an accurate-looking toga, either. Although Caligula often wore deep red, which is likely what the ancients referred to as purple. A historical note to a previous comment. Caligula wasn't the last of the ""legitimate"" Roman emperors, meaning those with some familial ties to Gaius Julius Caesar. He was followed by Claudius, and then Nero, who was the last emperor related in any way to Caesar. Afterward, the emperor was usually whoever could amass the most military power. Overall, this film is OK. There are some disturbing, and even offensive images. There are some good acting performances, limited by direction, writing, and some cheesy sets. The violence is not really any worse than that occurring in the average slasher movie today. It has some (cinematic) historical value as the failed attempt at merging porn with other filmmaking.",Caligula

Add to that Peter O'Toole as syphilis-ridden emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell sticking his finger up a male victim's anus, and you begin to appreciate that Caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick/outrageous films.The film charts the life of notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitations, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes.Although Caligula was totally mad in real life, and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not, the film is still inexcusable filth. The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi-layered story - the sex IS the story. After a while, all the nudity, hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild-eyed posturing. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he's in it purely for the money?!). Rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post production, but in truth there isn't a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well-made. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again, so in that sense Caligula is a one-of-a-kind experience... on the other hand, it's so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is ""one-of-a-kind"" is a blessing in disguise.",Caligula

The soft-core pornography repeatedly interrupts the plot. You get the feeling that as originally conceived, the sex was meant to be more gross and impersonal than arousing, more a display of the animalistic side of the people in power.

Disc 3 includes the original vintage one hour documentary as well the alternate 10 minute featurette, 15 behind the scenes featurettes and more. Die Hard fans of the film will enjoy this new edition. Although some viewers will find the Special Features more fascinating than the movie, especially the commentary tracks. This film went on to be a cult classic and it's the notorious behavior of the picture what makes ""Caligula"" is still talked about all these years. It would have been a different movie if Brass had his final cut on his film. Especially if Guccione didn't produced this film. The cast are extremely good in the movie (especially McDowell), production values are first-rate and Brass visual style makes this distasteful if odd film an strange experience. If you dislike pornography, it is closer to be a real film on disc 2 of ""The Imperial Edition"". It's still a very flawed film but at least, you knew the director of the film or the screenwriter intentions didn't want to make this picture a XXX feature. It was certainly one of the most fascinating movies ever made during the 1970's. Don't miss it. (****/*****).",Caligula
35,EVOL666,Epic Sleaze Masterpiece...,9,5 March 2006,"I'm sure CALIGULA will divide a lot of viewers - but I personally loved it. It has to be the highest budget sleaze film ever made - and the fact that they got such respectable actors as Malcolm McDowell, John Gielgud, and Peter O'Toole to star in this trash-fest is absolutely amazing to me.The story is of Roman Caesar, Caligula, and his rise to power and exploits as the Roman leader. How much of the film is accurate and what is total fabrication - I really have no idea - so I can only base my assessment on what the film portrays. Caligula was a power hungry freak who was in love with his sister. Being the Emperor of Rome, Caligula had the power to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted - so citizens, officers, guards, Senators, etc...who outlived their purpose were put to death in pretty inventive fashions. Caligula was also quite fond of the ""pleasures of the flesh"", so he would bone pretty much whoever he wanted at will. Due to his crazy antics, he was eventually plotted against and murdered...CALIGULA is to this day considered one of the most controversial films ever made - and with good reason. There is more nudity and perversions going on here than you can shake your boner at. My only gripe, is that with all the explicit blow-jobs, lesbianism, orgies, and other fun stuff going on - CALIGULA could have actually used more hardcore sex scenes. There were only two that I counted, and they were brief and not very explicit. I say - if you're gonna make an epic sleaze film - go ""all the way"" with it. There is also some decent violence, including a pretty inventive head-mowing scene and a few other tortures, but the violence in the film is pretty tame by todays standards. The performances in the film are all quite good, given the trashy nature of the overall production, and the set design and costumes are amazing.As a historical documentary, CALIGULA will surely fail to impress - but to those of us that LOVE sleazy cinema - this film is an absolute must-own. 9.5/10",Caligula
36,I_Ailurophile,There was a fragment of a good idea here,3,2 January 2021,"One line review: Don't get sucked in by the hype or controversy - this really isn't actually worth it.An historical examination of Caligula as a figure may well be worth watching. A sensationalized film about him could also be worth viewing in its own right. This, however, is neither of those things.This is about Caligula, certainly. The actors hired to actually act in this are quite good, including of course the unmistakable Malcolm McDowell, and the commanding screen presence of Peter O'Toole. As others have remarked, some of the set pieces are actually rather impressive. The screenplay had potential, even taking into account the extreme violence and focus on sex.Yet if Katherine Hepburn starred in a modern teen comedy, and gave the best performance of her life, and if the sets of that comedy were the most beautiful creations since Tarsem Singh's 'The fall,' it still would only be a teen comedy, with all the cheap and shoddily written jokes and otherwise hackneyed acting we usually get from such movies.And so it is with 'Caligula' as any possible value of the film is subsumed by the hardcore porn. It seems fairly well established in the lore of this production that even despite financing by Penthouse, it was only after the likes of McDowell and O'Toole gave their performances that additional footage was inserted to make this the extremely pornographic feature that it is. And if that's your thing, well, good for you. But graphic and explicit sex scenes do not of themselves make a good movie, nor necessarily contribute to one.it's been years since I've watched this, so I suppose it says something that it has still stuck with me. Yet I recall very well too that having watched this in high school, during the time that I worked at a video store with 'Caligula' on its shelves, I took this home to view specifically because I thought I was being transgressive to do so. I was young and naïve, a sheltered kid watching a pornographic film for the first time just because I was curious what exactly this storied feature was like.And yet I was bored.In hindsight, watching this and having no reaction whatsoever, even as a teenage high school student, should have been a big clue that I was ace.If porn is your thing, or if you don't mind such scenes overwhelming what otherwise could have been a decent movie, then go ahead and give this a try. Or if you're especially curious. Just manage your expectations, because 'Caligula' really isn't everything that it's made out to be.",Caligula
37,Jonny_Numb,A Brilliantly Vile History Lesson,8,6 January 2008,"In regard to the Bob Guccione-directed pornographic inserts in the uncut version of ""Caligula""--what better way is there to exemplify the excesses of a crazed Roman ruler than with a little of the 'ol in-out, in-out? And what better actor to preside over the excesses of a Sodom-esquire Rome than Malcolm McDowell, who lent ""A Clockwork Orange"" its amoral backbone? Here he plays the titular emperor, who carries on a long-standing incestuous relationship with his sister, Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy), and weds Rome's most promiscuous prostitute, Caesonia (Helen Mirren), only to descend down a power-mad spiral of paranoia, insanity, and death. Director Tinto Brass (himself a porn auteur) uses this bit of history as a springboard into unspooling a lavish, extravagant pseudo-epic, rife with overwhelming sets, costumes, and carnage (dig the motorized decapitator!)--all of which become extensions of Caligula's excessive character. McDowell--who at first seems to be doing a gloss on Alexander DeLarge, clocks in a portrait of murderous tyranny with a mix of cold-blooded conviction and tongue-in-cheek camp. The rest of the cast--including John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole in small roles--adopts the same no-boundaries Method histrionics, which lends the film a fittingly surreal tone. Furthermore, the porn inserts (including two lusty lesbians and a wild, full-blown (pun intended!) orgy scene)--whose integration runs the gambit from clumsy to seamless--are entrancingly sleazy, a complement to Caligula's own prurient pleasures, and an affirmation of our own.7.5 out of 10",Caligula

Ignore bad reviews of this movie and of Tinto Brass, Even at his most sordid, is a far better prospect than the rubbish we get served up at the local multiplex.

40,Galina_movie_fan,"""A viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world""",6,13 May 2006,"Maybe it helps to be familiar with the history, Art, and literature of the Ancient Rome because ""Caligula"" is surprisingly truthful adaptation of the chapter about Caligula in ""The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars by C. Suetonius Tranquillus, the Roman Historian. If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.The movie is notoriously famous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been documented in the historical documents that still exist.I don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that ""never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula"" and that he was rearing ""a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world."" When the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors. Not every day you can see porn with Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud, and of course, Mr. Clockwork Orange himself, Malcolm McDowell.",Caligula

As it was very unusual for my brother and I to go to bed like this, i think we asked them the day after how was the movie and they got really upset and don't want to talk about it ! For sure i recorded the data for later and as an adult, it was a duty to look for it ! Honestly it's very hardcore, graphic and i can't fathom my parents watching it with their family as as this time in France no porn movies were aired to the TV ! The great idea of Guccione was to sell it as a Peplum and not like an adult movie ! For a naive audience (like my family), they see a cover with a roman coin so it's very innocent ! This movie is such a classic that every antiquity hot scene looks like it ! The girls, and especially Anneka, are beautiful and are really skilled experts : all the sexual combination are done and it's totally exciting (especially the lesbian, orgy scenes)! I don't know if it's the most expensive porn movie ever but at least, the production is sumptuous and the sets looks like the best Hollywood movies (and have also some big names in it!).

The publisher of Penthouse should have never gotten a hold of this project.Thank goodness its 24 years later and I believe SOMEONE could bring to the screen the History of Caligola. To be honest, the film would be full of hard core sex, S&M, Incest, Violence and Madness because that is the way Caligola turned out. This film was a mess. Bad script, the acting was pure bad 70's.But the subject matter is a difficult one to transfer to the cinema back then, I guess Bob thought doing it the old pornography way was the way to do it.

44,Terrell-4,"Humorless hardcore? Why not? Someone had to make sex boring, and it looks like Bob Guccione was the man",2,3 March 2009,"If anything could give a bad name to Caligula -- a boyish emperor whose only sins were to love his sisters too well, to have too ironic a sense of humor, to exercise justice too emphatically and to have too optimistic a view of his future -- it would be this sodden pile of oozing lasagna. I, Claudius it ain't. The cast consists of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Peter O'Toole as Tiberius, John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and the flopping, furry bits and pieces of a lot of naked Italian extras. It is stunning and amusing to see the likes of Gielgud and Mirren recite their lines with serious intent and then watch a quick cut-away to hardcore fellatio at a Bob Guccione version of an orgy. It has to be said: The orgies are the most boring part of this movie. Guccione cuts in hardcore sex with all the timing of a metronome. Extras do so much genital fingering I'm surprised they didn't come down with carpel tunnel syndrome. Peter O'Toole, as a seriously degenerate Tiberius, has been known to give ripe and awful performances in his career. Here, he outdoes himself. It's not that the man is shameless, it's that he appears embarrassingly to be trying to give a performance. Malcolm McDowell is the only one who seems to be amused at the awful role he agreed to play for what, I hope, was a lot of money. McDowell is a fascinating, sly, humorous and serious actor. Even when he's humping around enjoying both the bride and the groom at a wedding party, or doing a lascivious dance to please Peter O'Toole, or ordering his legions to attack the papyrus, or playing the sneering host at a long, long orgy (with all those close-up cut-aways), I still like him. He carries what acting weight there is in this tank of rancid Penthouse rejects. Guccione, the editor and publisher of Penthouse who produced Caligula (and directed the hardcore parts), seems to have no more an erotic imagination here than he had in his magazine. The movie is so humorless, so hypocritical and so cheesy it not only will put you off Caligula, it probably will put you off genitals.",Caligula
45,PatrynXX,Deceptive.,7,13 March 2004,"(spoilers?)For obvious reasons, I was surprised that Netflix carried this movie. There's so many blow jobs going on in the film, one could easily puke. (heck I believe another guy was shown doing such to another guy.  ) I think it's fairly obvious that they cared less what they weren't wearing. You can't tell me Malcom didn't know what was gonna happen.  Maybe John Guilgud or Peter O Toole, But there's several compromising positions that there's no way in hell he didn't know they'd do what they did. 
I don't know the history of how the film came together.  Obviously it's controversial, but is it a quality film?  Probably not, but I rated the movie alot higher because I found it deceptive.  I heard lots about the nudity part.  But I had no idea the film would show insanity to the core. It is much like the propaganda film Triumph of the Will.  It changes your mood.  Midway thru the film I was pretty much like whoopie.There is no plot.  Sure he's gonna die.  But that director while silly, but just deceptive as hell.  Very good editing.  To take a film that the actors thought had so so nudity and turn it into Penthouse was a feat.  It's so seamless.One complaint.  The dvd label.  Penthouse musta used cheap ink.

46,marcin_kukuczka,Scandalous attempt to combine film art with pornography,2,22 October 2006,"As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. Yet, the negative feelings raised in me quite soon, particularly at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. During the second half of the film, I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself ""This is one of the movies that one may really hate"" ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste. I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims at combining film art with porn. That is, I think, the most serious matter the film may be accused of. Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them. Some say that the Rome under Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes, it is true. Corruption bloomed at that time, various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens. Yet, I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic. I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies... HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES: The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It is noticeable, for instance, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Yet, the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes. Moreover, Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding. What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife together with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister. The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding. Yet, the only strong point of the movie are the performances, particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall raises the value of the film. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, you may at least admire his performance. I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances. Therefore, I don't rate the movie 1/10.LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. Let us analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed constitutes a bad omen. And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying...? All in all, I don't recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves' gorgeous novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise's mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, in its most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic.There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty,there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer,there are movies that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral,there are, however, movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds,CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group",Caligula
47,gftbiloxi,"The Ben-Hur of Porn: Gratuitous Sex, Violence, & Weirdness",4,23 April 2005,"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might. CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited ""R"" and original ""Unrated"" versions. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.In a documentary that accompanies the DVD release, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best. That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.On the plus side, those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.The movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism. If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Caligula
48,rockman182,Caligula (1979),5,4 May 2017,"Here's a film I wanted to check out because I'm a fan of Roman Empire era films. I wasn't that familiar with Caligula and his reign so that was an added interest. I learned that the X rated cut of this film has tons of sex and nudity in it but that kind of stuff is not something that I mind if the film has substance. Unfortunately, I can see why this film was basically panned by all parties upon release.This film is meant to be a bit of a life and time of Caligula's reign but it just meanders so much into pornographic, unsimulated sex. There's just not much going story-wise. I read that Tinto Brass (the director) had nothing to do with the hardcore sex scenes that were added to the film, and I can see why he and the cast wanted to distance themselves from the film.The cast of this film is actually pretty great. You have young Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren just to name a few. Its just crazy that a film with starpower like that can fall so off the cliff. I know the initial writer and director didn't have much to do with the finished product, but damn what where the producers thinking? They must have been looking to shock viewers and create the most controversial film of the decade.Erm, I can't really recommend this film because its hard to actually watch with someone else. Its about as close to watching a porno with a plot as you'll get in Hollywood. The film gets distracted in its multiple sex scenes; so much so that the plot suffers greatly and any interest you have in this long dreary film is lost right away.

49,TOMASBBloodhound,A $17.5 million dollar abomination.,2,20 January 2008,"Maybe this is what the Burt Reynolds character from Boogie Nights had in mind when he wanted to make a large scale porno film with real actors and an actual plot. Bob Guccione's Caligula might have been something truly memorable and noteworthy, but it ends up being nothing more than simply ""notorius"". It isn't just the eye-opening hard core sex and violence that mars this film. The film is hurt every bit as much by the terrible editing, lack of cohesive plot, and the general ugliness of its tone. The film is still viewed regularly, and has more than made a profit. Mostly because of the curiosity factor. Once the viewer gets used to the copious amounts of gratuitous nudity, torture, and explicit sex, they quickly notice that there isn't much else to this project.A very entertaining project could certainly be made about the pagan ruler Caligula of early A.D. Rome. And Malcolm McDowell is certainly a great choice for the title role. As Caligula, McDowell basically gets to extend his lusty fantasy he has mid way through A Clockwork Orange. Imagine Alex from that film as emperor of the known world, and that's the perspective this film takes. There really isn't much of a linear story here. Gore Vidal wrote the original script but who knows how much of the finished product is his idea. Likely not much since he would later disown the film. Director Tinto Brass did likewise after producer Guccione insisted on editing the film himself. He is apparently the one to blame for all the incessant zooming in and out throughout the film. It seems like they rarely even knew the right perspective in which to shoot most of these scenes. The post dubbing of voices is all too apparent, and the running length is ultimately just too long. Some of the sets look impressive, and it must be noted that the acting is often very convincing. There are some big named actors here like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole that should be ashamed for appearing in this. McDowell has always been a daring performer who brings such effort to his character that he can be forgiven. Incredibly, Bob Guccione was originally trying to get John Huston and Jack Nicholson. At least they had the good sense to pass.Overall, it was the mean and cynical tone of the film that put me off the most. The technical problems were also too much to overlook. Another problem was the lack of historical perspective. The film never really defines Caligula, or the times in which he ruled. And there really aren't enough actual porn scenes to satisfy the horny voyeur who might only be looking to get off. The film is pretty much a failure at every level. It made Guccione a good chunk of change, though. 2 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Caligula
50,The_Movie_Cat,"""Come, my little fishees""",4,14 November 1999,"There is a scene mid-way through Caligula where Malcolm McDowell as the eponymous emperor kisses every square inch of his naked, dead sister's body. Surprisingly, this is perhaps the least repulsive image in this crass movie.Any film which contains such a high sexual content as Caligula indeed does will always face a negative reception of knee-jerk reaction and authoritarial opinion. But what really offends about this movie is how witlessly the pieces are put together. The most divine music imaginable is used, with Khachaturyan  and Prokofiev used to decorate the drama. Unfortunately, this acts as an ironic counterpoint to the low quality of the script (at best) and, at worst, an insult to the music and a feat of utter pretentiousness. Famously, between five and six minutes of hardcore pornography were filmed and inserted into the film by Penthouse representative Bob Guccione, causing it's ban in many places, including England. The version I got to see was a 20th anniversary special cut for the British television company ""Channel 4"". This excised - where it could be identified - Guccione's additions, and reinserted some cut scenes of the original work. However, even on the open-minded fourth British Channel, this came under close scrutiny of the BBFC, causing some scenes to remain almost statically focused (or out-of-focused, as the picture was blown up to centre on innocuous images) while the soundtrack gave a clue as to what our eyes were prevented from seeing. Even without the hard-core content, the movie is repugnant in its almost infantile need to constantly shock. The images of graphic violence, notably near the climax (no pun intended), are so over-earnest they are nought but repellent.Where the film could have salvaged itself is by the acting, and the central core of the plot. While Peter O'Toole is wonderful, (though Guccione alluded in interviews to him being under the substance of narcotics), Malcolm MacDowell greatly disappoints and in no sense recreates his magnificent display of ability in ""A Clockwork Orange"". An insane dictator with a predilection towards bestiality and incest, it is a one-note performance throughout, with no hint at depth beyond the crazed rhetoric to give the audience something to fear, sympathise, or even RELATE to. This may have worked if there were some other sense of normality within the film to anchor it to some sense of reality, but every other character is as mad as Caligula. Only towards the finale, when the senate discuss their hatred of his actions, do we get something approaching an honest emotion, but by then it is too late.The budget for this one was revealed as coming in at $17.5 million, a proud boast from Guccione who intended the film to revolutionise modern motion pictures. This it may have done were it of merit, but every cent of its overblown budget is turgidly transferred to the screen without any ounce of artistry. Though notorious, very few people have seen this film (as the low number of IMDb voters - 745 at date of writing - attests), whether due to its widespread ban or merely due to indifference. Famous it may be, its contribution to the film canon is negligible.",Caligula
51,Vivekmaru45,Caligula: The Mad King Of Rome,10,30 March 2014,"This is a must see film for anyone interested in Roman history, particularly the fall of the Roman empire. ""Caligula"" (Latin: Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) was the popular nickname of Gaius (31 August 12 AD – 22 January 41 AD), Roman emperor from 37 AD to 41 AD. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The film focuses on the period from his adolescence and crowning as Emperor till the time he is brutally assassinated with his wife and child. The method of assassination of Gaius is eerily similar to that of the emperor Julius Caeser who was stabbed 30 times. The film portrays him as a cruel tyrant who loves to torment his Senators and also as sex pervert. The film shows him having sexual relations with his sister Julia Drusilla. The film shows him as a man who thinks he can do anything he pleases, without any shred of thought to the consequences and also thinks that he is a God.He doesn't win favor with the Senate and is assassinated before he can do more damage to the Roman Empire. Veteran actor Malcolm McDowell(A Clockwork Orange, Time After Time) plays the emperor Caligula and gives a powerful performance. Other notable actors/actresses are: Peter O'Toole as Emperor Tiberius John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Paolo Bonacelli as Senator Chaerea.The film contains scenes of sex and violence and I therefore do not recommend it being shown to persons under the age of 18. This film is one of the most infamous cult films ever made and remains banned in several countries to this day.Despite this film being regarded as one of the worst films of all time, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it portrays the most chaotic period in Rome's history.Similar films: The Robe (1953) and its sequel Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954), Julius Caesar (1970).",Caligula
52,Pedro_H,One of a kind movie - but that doesn't mean special.,6,20 October 2002,"The life and times of the mad Roman emperor Caligula.What a curiosity piece: A Gore Vidal script that had been doing the rounds for years, but considered too risqué for mainstream Hollywood, produced as a big budget epic by softcore powerhouse Bob Guccione..Quite what the Penthouse boss had in mind is anybody's guess, but it cannot be what appears on screen. This production seems like a video nasty made by the Carry On team. Most of the blame has to go to director Tinto Brass who was only known for producing low budget exploitation - and this hasn't changed in the years since.Amazing cast: Malcolm McDowell (doing his best-of-breed mad act in the title role), Helen Mirren, Peter O'Tool and - wait for it, wait for it - John Gielgud (Sir later): What a brave actor he is, takes every part so seriously and his diction is in another league.The problem with this film is that some people want to see a porno, others want a horror film, while others might want a black comedy. It is non of these things. What it is doesn't actually have name but if it did the word would have to smack of excess.To be fair, real Roman times were bloody and violent and sex was the TV of the day. The fact that so many people have been brought up on the Hollywood myth version is not the producers fault. Some of the scenes are gruesome (the beheading scene is gross!) and some of the text is pure silly. There are hints of child sex (adult actors were chosen that looked young) that leave a bad taste in the mouth.The movie shows all the signs of the internal struggle that overtook the production and you feel that those that initially passed on this script had plenty of good reasons to do so.Worth seeing if you have a strong stomach and want to see a one-of-a-kind movie. That doesn't mean it is very good though.",Caligula
53,petarmatic,What a film!,9,31 October 2013,"When I was a teenager I saw unedited version of Caligula and it basically changed my life for good! I was so impressed in synergy of porn and regular film that I thought that new era in the film industry is dawning and that we will not have ratings any more. Oh boy was I wrong! Not only did porn go away from the movie theaters to the VHS and further online that regular film rearly have explicit scenes of sex in it. It is obvious now days that porn and regular films are separated and probably they will stay that way for a long time.Caligula remains an extraordinary tryout in putting those two genres together. And it should be studied in every film academy in the world! I am so glad that Caligula was republished in the unrated version on the DVD and you can find clips of it all over internet. It means it will survive for generations to come. Bravo!!! As far as the actors go they fit their roles well, but Helen Mirren will always stay my favorite playing role in this film and in The Queen. Film is just great art no matter how you put it! With so many twists and turns!",Caligula
54,Son_of_Mansfield,Textbook Example of Bad Movie-making.,2,3 July 2005,"There were far too many people involved in this movie, each one wanting something different. Every one of them failed due to lack of vision and storytelling. The finished product is just as warped as the man it is about, which is the only praise it deserves. There seems to be nothing going on other than sex, violence, and overacting. While this may be an accurate portrait of a time in the Roman Empire, it is purely by accident. Yes, there was a lot of sex and death in Rome, but to put that in a movie and expect everyone to lap it up was a delusion of grandeur. The problem is, when you remove the excessive sex and violence, you are left with very little. The editing is scattered, the sets and costumes cheap, and the big names are underperforming. MacDowell scowls with wide eyes and is generally what everyone thinks a madman should be. O'Toole borders on annoying with his ""look at my mad contorted face"" acting while Gielgud sleeps through his part. Helen Mirren is sufficiently nasty, as is MacDowell, but that is all we get from them. They were all mad, murderous, sex starved sadists. A point that you don't have to watch this 150 minute movie for more than ten minutes to get.P.S. It should be shown, along with a complete making of, to film students to show them that even professionals take dumps.",Caligula
55,sashank_kini-1,"Characters show flesh, but never flesh out in another attempt to bring history to life",2,9 March 2012,"After his sister's tragic death, Caligula (played by Malcolm McDowell), after declaring a month's mourning, surreptitiously walks through the streets disguised as a beggar and witnesses the lawlessness and decadence of his people. When, in a show, two people dressed as Caligula and his dead sister Drusilla enact vaudeville, an outraged Caligula disrupts the event and is later thrown into a dingy underground cell where many other offenders of both sexes perform depraved acts of fondling openly. A greasy bearded man comes to him and asks for money but Caligula outwits the man and in turn wins his respect. When free, he finds the senate to be a corrupt quagmire swimming with offenders of all kinds, and extracts his revenge on them, also appointing criminals at the prison as Senate members. At this moment did I really was able to appraise how far this film would have gone had it been told by a competent director and written by a capable writer. Unfortunately, Gore Vidal has written this film and Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione have directed it, and therefore Caligula, a biopic of one of the most notorious rulers in the Middle Ages, became Caligula, the most controversial film of the 20th century, now the most controversial film of the 21st century. Its fate is similar to Mommie Dearest's and The Room – the makers themselves fear that they wouldn't recover their money and therefore advertise the film in a different, crude way.Caligula, as mentioned above, intended to show the rise and fall of the Emperor most known for his brutal executions, salacious and extravagant life and eventual madness. Thank god the filmmakers refrained from showing the 'sawing' method of execution otherwise it would've caused even more outrage. They however did pay particular attention to the 'sex' and the 'violence', and we do see Caligula giving orders, mostly irrational and bizarre, but that is all we get in the 156 minutes of the film. A quick read through Wikipedia should be more resourceful – it is believed that after Caligula's accession, the first two years was marked with development. Caligula had passed many laws for the benefit of the people and therefore was respected by his countrymen. His mental debilitation was gradual, and many stories about his cruelty were debatable. Gore Vidal and the directors of the film aren't interested in most of the facts, all they want is to depict an infinitely evil and barbarous Caligula and an equally filthy Rome.The most unforgiving part about the film is that it always wants to reach the extremes of everything – sex, violence and corruption, and in the process, obliterates any space for true human feelings among the characters. Compare this with A Clockwork Orange and we find that Alex resided in a radical, dystopian society that resembled, in a metaphysical way, our modern, changing society. Caligula does not give this feeling at all, because it was written without much thinking by Vidal possibly while he was hating the world or feeling aroused. Sex in Caligula includes incest, fondling, rape, fisting, deep throats, oral sex, anal sex, ejaculations etc by straight, gays, lesbians and some weird humans. The nudity is so high, if the movie were released in India its runtime would be four minutes or even less. In fact, the movie makes you want to see more clothed people rather than the opposite! Most of it is exaggerated and depicts a pornographic version of ancient Rome, except that many of the models look hideous. The violence is offensive because it mostly includes genital mutilations rather than stabbing or poisoning. The Roman lifestyle feels highly exaggerated and the directors seem to have read the 'excessive sex' part only.The movie also fails to have any dramatic element, unless sex is drama, which is very unlikely. Dialogues are asinine, and they make Caligula seem like a mad immoral teenager who doesn't think of anything but sex. In fact, there are reviews that praise the part where he is about to die and a senator tells that he would give up his life for Caligula instead; hearing which the emperor eagerly accepts his proposition. I feel that such scenes make the drama reductive rather than ingenious; the only part that slightly impressed me is the one that I mentioned in the first paragraph. Helen, Toole, Teresa and Gielgud only present shadows or rather fleshes of their characters, and keep their speech to the minimum. The rest do mere skin show, though I do admire their guts for doing it for such a big budget, mainstream film.While watching Caligula, my mind suddenly thought of Cleopatra, the movie that I had watched some time back. Both films depict fall of an emperor, two in the case of Cleopatra, and both are badly made. While Cleopatra is glossed up with extravagant costumes and over-the-top, affected performances, Caligula is replete with sex and very thin characters. In both I sensed an absence of human element and feelings that are required to hold the integrity of a film. Both the films required fictional aspects that were however built on reality, and better chemistry between the characters. But I would choose Cleopatra over Caligula solely because it stuck true to facts and tried not to rely on cheap tactics.In a word, Caligula can be described as: Scrotum.My Rating: 2 out of 10",Caligula
56,phenomynouss,Best and most realistic gritty ancient Rome epic from the 70s/80s I've ever seen,10,3 May 2006,"""Caligula"" is by far the first and only movie so far that I've seen that I would DEFINITELY not recommend ANYONE under 16 watch. It's very gritty and filled with explicit sexuality and violence, including close-up scenes of stabbings (not real, but gruesome), cutting stuff off, and sexual abuse.Despite that, it's not too much as to make someone cry out and wonder if its actual snuff. I think it was said best by one of the people working on it (forgot who), that Caligula is the kind of movie you can't watch through modern eyes. In order to fully grasp it without revulsion, you'd have to have knowledge and understanding of Ancient Roman morality and such. This means alienating some of the audience.The acting is absolutely splendid, for what has been blasted as being ""the most expensive porno ever made"", with Malcolm McDowell absolutely fiendish as Gaius Caligula, in his best role since Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"". Peter O'Toole is fabulous, as is everyone else involved.The cinematography and set design is stupendous and adds a depth to the scenes that is really powerful. The film quality is quite crappy (on the DVD) but you really don't notice or even care once you get into it.With all movies comes a share of problems, which Caligula seems to suffer much of. The most important problems I see is the influence infamous porn director Bob Guccione has done to the flick. Apparently defying the other directors/producers/whoever, he's added some very unnecessary sex scenes which are focused on for far too long and serve no real purpose other than to add to the explicitness of the film. It's really unnecessary to have the camera focusing on a woman giving oral sex to a man for a solid four or five minutes without any transition or overlapping dialogue.Another problem seems to be that one of the editors cut the film incorrectly, and so some of the scenes are completely misplaced from the film (noted by Caligula's lack of facial hair in some scenes, present in another) including the frolic in the forest scene with Caligula and Drusilla, placed at the very beginning of the film whereas its true purpose was to be placed much later on.The way the film portrays Caligula I feel has been misunderstood by people. Granted, the only sources on Caligula left to us by historians has portrayed him as a cold, heartless, utterly insane Emperor who was killed by his Praetorian Guard and did all sorts of obscene and radical things to Rome, including severely draining her economy. The film finds a middle ground in portraying Caligula in the beginning as a mischievous young man who slowly becomes more and more demented as the film goes on and he finds himself in control of all of Rome. His only hold on sanity appears to be his sister Drusilla (whom he loves very much, nearly to the point of incestuous love), which evaporates with her death. The quote from the Bible (I think its the bible) at the beginning of the film perfectly portrays Caligula, I believe: ""What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole word, and lose his own soul?""Mark 8:36.The best thing about Caligula I find is the dialogue, which is rich and vivid with absolutely brilliant and great quotes, almost Shakespearian in attitude, had Shakespeare lived and wrote in Ancient Rome. My favorite ones include the one mentioned above, and Caligula's quote at the beginning of the movie: ""I have existed from the morning of the world and shall exist until the last star falls from the night. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula, I am all man as I am no man, and therefore, I am a god""Nerva: You can't, he controls you. Anyway, even with Macro dead, (looking at Caligula) Nerva: how could I go on living with this... reptile? Tiberius: (to Caligula) You will respect my friend always, won't you, reptile? Proculus: Divine Ceasar, PLEASE! What have I done? Why am I here? Caligula: Treason! Proculus: I have always been loyal to you! Caligula: That IS your treason! You're an honest man, Proculus, which means a bad Roman! Therefore, you are a traitor! Logical, hmm? (Caligula is sick with the fever) Attendent: I offer my life if Jupiter will only spare our beloved Emperor! Caligula: Jupiter accepts your offer. (Caligula turns to his guards) Caligula: Execute him. (Caligula's child - who he has just announced as his son - has been born) Julia Drusilla: It's a girl. Caligula: It is not a girl! Did you not hear Caesar say? Julia Drusilla: I heard the voice of Caesar. But your daughter did not. (Quotes taken from IMDb)Excellent!",Caligula
57,johannes2000-1,Quo Vadis meets marquis De Sade.,4,29 August 2020,"This movie has become some sort of cult-icon, due to all the exciting stories concerning the production, and of course due to the content: a mixture of historical drama, an abundance of graphic sex and equally graphic violence. So you can either appreciate or detest this movie for all these different reasons. Any which way, the result is disappointing and unbalanced (to put it mildly).When you just concentrate on the story of Caligula, I have to admit that it is, from historical perspective, quite well done (how could it not, being based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, who by the way later wanted his credits withdrawn from the production). Unfortunately director Tinto Brass covered this with a tsunami of nudity and sex. Sure, in the Capri- and the brothel-scenes (based on true facts) this can be considered functional, but at many, many other places it's totally superfluous and gratuit, like the flimsy and revealing outfits that virtually everyone wears (totally unthinkable for Roman citizens!) or the nude soldiers, and of course the notorious, later by Bob Guccione added, pornographic footage. It all results in an overkill of nudity and sex that gradually makes you exasperated and in the end just yawn in boredom.As to the acting, Malcolm McDowell and Peter O'Toole did a superb job (whatever you may think of the things they were made to do in the movie, or whatever they afterwards have said to discredit their participation in this project). O'Toole is absolutely fascinating as the worn-out but still overbearing and threatening old Tiberius, and McDowell delivers a real tour the force as the indefatigable Caligula, from exuberant to deeply caring (like with his sister) and at last lapsing into madness. Other big name Helen Mirren didn't have a very big role anyway and John Gielgud's part was short and rather static. The sets were in many scenes quite overwhelming and impressive, they must have cost a fortune and certainly were worthy of a better cause.All in all, a weird and very unsatisfying movie with at it's core an historically adequate story, unfortunately totally overshadowed by the grotesque sexual fantasies of the makers.",Caligula
58,Java_Joe,Thespian porn with a little actual porn.,7,29 July 2018,"The story of Caligula is a long a fabled one and a lot of what people have heard is probably wrong. During the first part of his reign he seemed to be doing okay and then the madness crept in and it was characterized by cruelty, sadism, extravagance, sexual perversion and this seems to be what the movie is based on. And while these records are highly suspect, there is literally not a lot of information out there about the man although he did try to increase his power and was eventually killed by his own guard. But that doesn't really matter because where else are you going to see giants of the British screen and theater in the same movie playing Romans and chewing the scenery? Malcolm McDowell is great at playing the crazed psycho no matter what the role is. He's utterly charming and has this devilish look on his face when he's contemplating something. Truly a sight to behold. The sets and cinematography are top notch. The actors are all on their game, the dialogue might be a little trite and yes, there is actual porn going on in some scenes. Bob Guccione, of Penthouse magazine, was one of the producers and literally spliced in some scenes of hardcore pornography. Well, maybe hardcore is taking things a little far. There's definitely nudity both male and female, there's a lesbian scene which literally adds nothing to the plot and in the scene where Caligula creates the brothel there are real people actually having sex. You can't see much but you don't really want to. Seriously in today's day and age it's much easier to get your hands on actual porn if that's what you're looking for.In the end this ode to pagan Rome while it has it's moments is known more for it's notoriety than what actually goes on in the movie.

Although no one would confuse this with I, Claudius, it's still worth a laugh.Malcolm McDowell plays hyper-depraved Roman Caligula, who becomes emperor after the death of Tiberius. McDowell chews scenery by the Corinthian column, matched only by Peter O'Toole, who appears to be drunk for his entire performance. Other actors who find themselves in this mess include Helen Mirren, who despite playing ""the most promiscuous woman in Rome"" has no real nude scenes. Compared to the porno actresses around her, she seems positively chaste.Overall, this film works better as comedy than as sexploitation. The sex, although explicit, is nothing you haven't seen before. Better to watch it for those wacky Romans, with their head clippers, horse-men, dwarf sex, and imperial brothels.",Caligula
62,alicecbr,Gore Vidal Disavowed (Mis)Treatment of his Writing But Still Good,8,25 February 2005,"Sometimes the worst of a great writer is better than the schlock of an expensive movie with well-known movie stars, poorly written. Such is 'Caligula', which I bought several years ago and was disgusted by because of the continual sex scenes. In fact, there's so much sexual activity, it gets boring. It's amazing that the present Bush administration hasn't ordered all copies bought up and publicly burned. That's coming, as we march backward into der Fuehrer-land. It's almost refreshing to watch this movie, so as to remind us of a time when movie producers weren't terrified to produce anything that showed the left titty of a woman. On some discussion boards, the word 'titty' is censored as we become a nation disgusted by sex and turned on by violence.""Caligula"" needs to be seen as well to remind us of that other empire, where the moral degeneration was such that the leaders of the empire provided the people with sex orgies and animals rending human beings limb from limb to divert their attention from the rot within the government. This is similar to the NASCAR and ""Desperate Housewives"" diversions, in which people profess 'moral values', but flock avidly in the hope of seeing death on the circular track, and sexual teasing in prime time.Roddy McDowell was not at his best in this movie, and you can see why Gore Vidal wanted nothing to do with this director, once he saw the way the movie was being shot. It would be interesting to find out how much of Vidal's work was actually left in the film. Should be seen for historical interest, and a lesson for today.",Caligula

64,David-240,It's a shame they couldn't sack the producer!,6,8 December 2011,"As a kind of antidote to ""Quo Vadis"" I watched this fascinating film last night. It's probably a more realistic depiction of Ancient Rome and its debauchery, which is shown in explicit detail. There is the kernel of a great film here, with stunning sets and costumes, Oscar calibre performances from Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell, and a script by Gore Vidal. Sadly the director was replaced by Bob Guccione from Penthouse, who was producing the film, because the film wasn't explicit enough for Bob's taste. So he re-edited it, and added some completely gratuitous hard-core porn sequences. The result is something of a mess (if you excuse the pun), but the controversy ensured the film's big box-office success. This is the first time I've seen the uncensored version and it is pretty full-on! Sad really because this could have been a great film instead of just being an infamous one.",Caligula

It seems to have no point but violence and porn - and I can say this, although I haven't seen the 170-minutes version, only one that ran 147 minutes. But I guess all they left out was some ejaculations.For me, ""Caligula"" has about the quality of ""The Passion of the Christ"": it is a film worst seeing because it lacks any notion of art, because its pompous an megalomaniac, and because famous actors are in it. McDowell is a good actor, he does his best to portray the mad emperor convincingly. Peter O'Toole is really great as Tiberius: for me, he is the ultimate highlight of this film. And Helen Mirren is at least well-cast as Caesonia, Caligula's worn-out but clever and affectionate wife.I don't know why but I think it is a film one should have seen, maybe because of the extremity of disproportion and excessiveness.",Caligula

In ""Caligula"" and ""Madame Kitty"" she demonstrated that she was one of the few women that really could act with and without her clothes on.  In ""Caligula"" she flawlessly betrayed Drusilla as the rock behind the insanity of Caligula's rule and when she was no longer in the film it was an obvious loss for both the film and Caligula.  Her virtually flawless physical beauty and considerable acting talent, for me, are what almost carried entirely made this film worth watching.

67,coldwaterpdh,Ridiculous little porn-romp with horrible sets and minimal gore.,3,17 April 2010,"Ahhh, the wait is over. I finally got my hands on the Uncut Director's Edition of ""Caligula."" I can only assume that some of the folks on here saying that this movie is not that pornographic have only seen some chopped up, edited version. It is most definitely porn. We see lots of BJ's and tons of straight up sex. Lots of it appears to have been spliced in after the fact and does nothing for the movie at all.The costumes and the sets here are atrocious. It's something like ""Planet of the Apes"" meets ""Clash of the Titans"" meets ""Masters of the Universe"" (the one with Dolph Lundgren) meets some random, off-Broadway play. Too many scenes are filmed on what is just a plain, black stage with cheesy backdrops. The props are awful and embarrassing.There are a few good gore scenes, but nothing that will impress an Italian horror buff or a gorehound. It's mostly just naked men and women lounging around and getting each other off. It was all very disgusting and certainly not a turn on. Couldn't see beatin' it to this flick, call me crazy!Malcolm McDowell delivers a great performance but he basically does little Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"" again here. It's not hard to see how he went down the 'straight to sci-fi channel' road after this one. Helen Mirren is non-existent really and Peter O'Toole is not in it very long, so these comments about the 'big name stars' are a little silly.Overall, I expected a lot more gore and disturbing scenes. They just aren't there. The ending was pretty cool though, I like how they hoist up the halfwit to be the new Ceasar.I'd have to recommend a ton of films before this one if you want disturbing.

68,CelluloidRehab,Roman Tax Reform..........couldn't hurt ??,7,7 April 2007,"This is one of the earliest movies I can remember seeing. The other two being Conan the Barbarian and Halloween. My initial view was a brief 30 minutes or so, caused by a cultural misunderstanding. It would take another 10 years or so before I saw the movie in its entirety. It is interested to see how things have evolved and shows like Rome and the Tudors (movies like the Gladiator, 300 and Alexander) have come in the aftermath of this movie. It would almost seem as the prototype for the dramatic historical fiction narrative. It is graphic in terms of sex and violence and tries to depict Rome in terms of its own morals and not ours. This isn't an everyday Roman's view, but rather a look at lasciviousness of the ruling class.Written by Gore Vidal, starring a pretty good cast. Peter O'Toole (as the dying and diseased Emperor Tiberius), Malcolm McDowell (Caligula) in yet another full frontal movie (Clockwork Orange), Sir John Gielgud and Helen Mirren (thats right the Queen herself).It is nice to see Peter O' Toole and Malcolm McDowell fully embedded in the hedonism of ancient Rome. I can easily see them as downing cartons of wine before scenes and hanging out with John Holmes in the mirror room. It is nice to see the classically trained (Mirren and Gielgud) joining in this Roman foray as well. I can't help but me reminded of Fellini in terms of style. I am thinking of the influence of Roma and Satyricon. It is heavily stylized and the theatricality is quite visible. At time is feels more like theater than a movie. It might lead one to forget that one is watching porn.Even though there is a heavy story about how Rome works and perhaps the other motivations of the young Emperor (sympathetic eye towards Caligula amongst the cruelty and scandals), the politics of Rome and the question of morality, it is still in the context of the incest, sex, orgies, homosexuality, sex, bestiality, sex, masturbation, and pure unabashed hedonism (and sex) of a corrupt and failing system. The authenticity and production quality leads more to the impression of a stylized documentary rather than porn. And just when you are comfortable with that assessment of the movie, it shoves some genitals in you direction just to make sure you remembered this was a porn. Yet despite all this it still somehow works and has some time to develop. As opposed to most porn, it doesn't forgo the story for the sex. The story develops organically, while periodically linked by one of Rome's eccentricities (a.k.a. the sex). The scene where Caligula rips the Emperor's ring off is amazing. The sheer energy of this scene(sound and imagery) sets the mood for the rest of the movie. Powerful imagery such as the metaphor of casting a ship to sea (and thus declaring war) to the frenzied energy of a fellatio. This one is hard to recommend to anyone. This is a view at your own risk kind of movie, not suitable for the TGIF/Fast Food Nation family crowd. It is artistic, graphic and somewhat accurate. I guess its a lot like the history its trying to recreate.",Caligula
69,flingebunt,"Sex, Violence and Togas",8,8 June 2005,"In recent years there have been a number of movies released that contain explicit sex (Ken Park, Baise Moi and Romance). None of which really need it and they are generally low budget affairs.I was surprised to find out about Caligula, and wanted to see this seventies attempt as a explicit movie was like. Caligula is different, it is a big budget movie that is part porn movie, part Hollywood epic, part bad seventies camp romp. Yet, it was one of the most powerful movies I have seen recently. Sex and violence were explicit and common place in Empirial Rome, and so they must feature in this movie. They are not little inserts but they are the raw emotion that over shadows the plot (maybe there is too much sex really).In Empirial Rome your father had the right to kill you, an Empress once competed with the most famous whore in Rome to see who could sleep with the most men in one night, and the Empress won. Violence and death were public entertainment and emperors lived in fear of their lives while being obeyed instantly.The pure feeling of this movie makes it powerful beyond any other sword and sandals epic made before or after. Historical accuracy is not important, only the fantasy being emperor and the thought experiment of what such a life would do to someone.See it becauseit is differentbecause it is emotional and primalBut don't watch Mel Brookes' History of World before watching this or you will probably laugh too much.",Caligula

72,ccmiller1492,Fellini it ain't...,4,24 June 2006,"""Caligula"" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 ""Fellini Satyricon"" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the ""glory"" of ancient Rome. But Fellini it ain't... First of all it is not as entertaining. Far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. The portrayals by Jay Robinson in ""The Robe"" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in ""Emperor Caligula"" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. The only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. These two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.",Caligula
73,D_Burke,"A Fractured, Lazy, Meretricious, Uneven Mess of a Movie.",1,13 July 2010,"""Caligula"" is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is pure garbage. I would use different words to describe how awful it is, but IMDb does not permit the use of such words that I would give to this atrocious piece of junk. The film reel that holds this film would be better used spinning in a toilet bowl than on a movie projector.So why is this film that bad? You can tell right in the first scene. It shows Malcolm McDowell playfully chasing a very pretty girl through a forest. Not only is the shot out of focus, but the editor somehow felt it appropriate to intersperse this scene with footage of sheep running through a crowded street. Why? What do these sheep even have to do with this scene? It's not even metaphoric. It would be if it showed McDowell speaking to a large crowd of people who are influenced by his words. This way, the metaphor would be that the Romans are like sheep blindly following their leader. However, that is not at all what happens at any point in the film.In fact, no one in this film seems to take McDowell's character of Caligula seriously. McDowell, who I loved in ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and other films, plays the Roman Emperor in a one-note performance that seems to undermine his acting ability. Caligula in this movie is a whiny brat of an emperor who seems to do four things: fornicate, flout about wearing no pants, send people to be executed at random, or elevate his status from Emperor to God. I don't know much about Roman history myself, or at least not about Emperors after Marcus Aurelius. However, the real Caligula must have had more complexity than this.There are other great thespians in this movie who, according to what I've read, played their parts while not knowing the mess they were getting into. Peter O'Toole did what he could playing Tiberius, but just seeing the ugly makeup he wore made me want to take a shower and use rubber gloves. That's why I cringed when McDowell and others kissed him on the cheek.Helen Mirren was also wasted in this movie as Caesonia, Caligula's wife who, according to his sister and lover (yes, that's right) Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. Not only do you not see her with other men in this movie, but she also goes through the entire movie looking bored and just going through the motions. I actually don't blame Mirren for feeling that way if she actually did. Fortunately, better roles would come her way in the next 30 years.But again, the biggest weakness of this film comes in the editing. I have not seen a movie before which has sloppier editing, and the flow of the story is completely thrown off because of it. The scene where Caligula first gazes upon Caesonia is followed too abruptly by a man getting his head cut off in a stadium. It goes right from harp-like music playing to a scream and the sound of a sharp knife slicing through bone in a second. Any sane moviegoer would react by saying, ""Woah! What the hell happened!?!"" in that second alone. I found myself saying that phrase through the whole movie.Many films have strengths and weaknesses, but this is the first film I've seen where I can't think of any strengths whatsoever. It's sloppy in its editing and storytelling, less than mediocre in its character portrayals, and even the settings and backdrops look too much like movie sets. In fact, the scene where Caesonia is giving birth looks like it was filmed in a high school gymnasium.If someone who actually knew what they were doing would have made this film, it would have been a lot better. What is most surprising is that the film is gaining an audience with the most recent DVD release. It may be because of its notorious hardcore sex scenes, but to me, those parts of the film aren't even sexy or erotic in the slightest. This film just should not have been made, period, and I don't say that about many other films.",Caligula
74,jaibo,Ancient history as Contemporary Vision,9,25 March 2001,"It is interesting that this film is so reviled and does not even exist in a definitive version. Watching it again recently, I saw that instead of it being a monumental folly  or the most expensive porno ever made  it is in fact a work of Visionary Prophecy which predicts and shows the horror that the Western World has fallen into in the last 30 years. The first section of the film, in Tiberius' court, is obviously based upon what was happening in America in the seventies. The continual partying, the fascination with loveless, experimental and sado-masochistic sex, the self-indulgence and egotism are all there. The film goes on to show where this behaviour leads: to the madness which is the tyranny of an uncontrolled Ego. Caligula in this film is Egotism personified  paranoid, authoritarian, insane. The film is a series of poetic Visions  the harvesting machine which crops human heads (the harvest of  global capitalism has been and continues to be wide-scale suffering and death); the wedding of Proculus and Livia (loyalty and honour is raped and humiliated in the service of despotism); the prostitution of the Senators wives (those in power-positions in corrupt states find themselves wedded to harlots  i.e. corrupt materialist philosophies); the election of a horse (Man's animal nature elevated); the pyramid-structure of Rome (a rigid hierarchy with a `reptile' consciousness at its head and slaves at the bottom). Caligula IS Western Capitalism as it now exists. If you buy into it  if you live in its court  you will find yourself on an uncontrollable wheel of fate which will replace and  kill you at the finish. Mankind's rational ego has set itself up in the place of God and finds only horror and tragic death. The most poignant moment of the film has the Emperor attempting to make love to his sister's dead corpse  the barrenness of life lived on a purely physical material level exposed for all to see  nature breeds only a perishable vegetable being. The film looks as good as any Fellini and contains some brilliant work from the actors  McDowell is legendary, Gielgud and Steiner great (notice how Steiner's Longinus, Caligula's treasurer, is a physical manifestation of the penis, complete with a slit on the top of his head). The film is a grand warning for us all  and a portrait not of ancient history but of the HERE and NOW.",Caligula

76,bbhlthph,An appalling film with a great film inside but unable to get out.,3,19 August 2003,"IMDb lists 121 users who have commented on this film - these comments will make 122. Clearly this very controversial film has attracted much more interest than many outstanding films that were released at about the same time, and this is presumably a direct result of its controversial content. Some information relating to the production of this film has become common knowledge and is referred to by several of the users who have provided comments for this database, nevertheless when the whole story is told, it will form a very interesting account of how not to create a great film. It appears that there are at least three often incompatible threads contributing to the film as it was finally released. The original script was an attempt to provide a framework for a historically accurate account of life at the Roman court  during the reign of a mad emperor. This script was sufficiently complete to enable many fine stars to be signed up for major parts, but when filming began the Director, Tinto Brass, chose to exploit all the violent parts of his story to such an extent that several of the cast became very dissatisfied. John Gielgud for example who gave a very fine performance as Senator Nerva, later commented publicly that he wished he had had nothing to do with this film, even though his contribution to it must certainly have enhanced his reputation. Then we are told that prior to its release Bob Guccione, one of the principal backers, decided the excessive violence was so distasteful the film as produced would be a major flop. He therefore insisted on adding to it a large amount of additional sexual material, including the highly controversial lesbian action scenes, which did not readily fit in with the original story, but which he felt would increase its general appeal.How far all this is true may be hard to tell, but there is no doubt that some parts of the final film do not blend well with others. Whatever ones personal inclinations and tastes, there will be parts of the film to satisfy them, whilst other parts of it are likely to be offensive. Depending upon which parts one feels are most important, it is as easy to defend it as a great work as to condemn it as pornographic garbage.Sex and violence are both part of everyday life and therefore must have a place in many films. Fortunately most people enjoy a considerable amount of sexual activity but relatively few experience serious personal violence. Unfortunately current moral standards have meant that the latter is exploited far more often in films than the former, which immediately creates a distortion of normal life. The problem with Caligula is not that it faithfully reflects the violence that was a part of everyday life at the time, but that it concentrates on and emphasises this in a totally unrepresentative way which panders to any sadistic instincts that we may have. Its period is now historically fairly distant, and when we watch it we develop a self righteous glow because the standards of our own society have advanced such a long way during the intervening period. We do not think of the many modern dictators such as Hitler, Idi Amin or Sadaam Hussein who have recently behaved in just the ways portrayed by Caligula in this film. A film that would make us do this could be a great work of art.Ultimately Caligula is an appalling film as it is designed to pander to the worst instincts in each of us. There is a really great film within it which we sometimes see struggling to get out. But unfortunately it is never given the opportunity to do so. The rating I give it would depend upon whether it is being rated simply to guide readers as to its possible interest to them, or whether the rating is intended to recognise how far the film is successful as a work of art. In the former case my rating would be 1 on the 1-10 scale. In the latter case this film deserves some credit for attempting to display Roman court life with a semblance of historical veracity, rather than simply showing it as an ongoing sexual orgy liberally decorated by Penthouse pets (this would have been much easier to do and might have brought in better returns). It also merits credit for some fine acting from a few members of the cast such as John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole. On this basis I would reluctantly give it a rating of 3/10.",Caligula

Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula and does a really great job in the role. Peter O'Toole plays Tiberius, Caligula's adopted Grandfather and he does a great job also for the short time he is in the movie. Basically, this movie tells the story of Caligula's rise and fall and all that is in between.

79,rhinocerosfive-1,"""As if there ever could be an antidote to Caesar""",2,22 January 2009,"I like a movie that begins auspiciously - after a few shots of Teresa Ann Savoy's anus, we head to Capri. Tiberius' palace lives up to Suetonius' account, and is as good a representation of hell as those in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY and CONSTANTINE. Actually the whole movie looks like a Penthouse layout, which is a cross between a Persian's living room and a Frenchwoman's toilet. And a toilet is where this movie belongs, briefly, before it is flushed. Afterward, use the bidet for a couple of hours, then have the house burned, and move to a new town.An undying exaltation of bad taste, CALIGULA is one of the truest examples I know of the axiom about absolute power corrupting absolutely - in the case not of Gaius Germanicus but Bob Guccione. Here is a man with great tools at his disposal: actors like Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud, and a script by Gore Vidal; and he manages to kill off the first two in the second reel and rape the third beyond recognition even of its author. A man who takes a movie away from a professional (if a mediocrity) like Tinto Brass in order to insert his own favorite fetishes, like water sports and bad zoom photography. A man who, let's face it, styled himself the tasteful alternative to Larry Flynt, because his magazine featured women urinating instead of defecating.What he made is a movie that fails to arouse, titillate, shock, or even interest, despite its heavy content of penetration, ejaculation, and at least on the part of O'Toole and Gielgud, mortification. It is an incoherent and tawdry epic, at two and a half hours too long by three, a spectacle so ugly as to defeat the term. For an entertaining and enjoyable telling of the Caligula tale, I recommend John Hurt's turn in I, CLAUDIUS.Oh - there is one important historical question raised by this opus: where, in ancient Rome, did they find all those circumcised penises?",Caligula

Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this?

82,Rathko,"Damn You, Guccione, Damn You",5,13 April 2007,"Tinto Brass always struck me as a kind of Italian Ken Russell. They shared the same anarchist tendencies to push the limits of taste, and not only challenged what was morally acceptable, but artistically. They had the same obsession with over-the-top grandiose and baroque set pieces that always seemed oddly stagy, as if the whole movie was taking place beneath the proscenium of an enormous opera house. These director's work in symbol and metaphor, and possess a certain crazed wit and artistry and a keen eye for the outlandish.Gore Vidal clearly intended a more serious, though not necessarily less extreme, story of the dehumanizing nature of absolute power. Anti-establishment mavericks, Brass and McDowell were more interested in exploring the idea of Caligula as a revolutionary anarchist, an anti-hero (much like Little Alex) trying to dismantle and destroy the bureaucratic institutions of power, only to find that those institutions are able to crush even the cruelest of tyrants.Of course the whole thing would have been wildly tasteless and over-the-top had the slimy Bob Guccione never gotten involved. It was clearly Brass and McDowell's intent to produce a shocking, outrageous, almost psychedelic, and thoroughly offensive piece of work. That's not a bad thing if it's for a just cause, but any illusions of political commentary that Brass and McDowell intended is obscured by the heavy handed, self-serving agenda of Bob Guccione.From the outset, whether the others involved really knew it or not, his intention for 'Caligula' was to bring adult entertainment to the masses; pornography in to the multiplex; and he brought on board the latest Penthouse pets to costar. Their are those who refuse to call the offending scenes in this movie pornographic, though it's tough to imagine what else you call multiple close-ups of blow jobs and masturbation. Perhaps Brass and McDowell underestimated him and thought they could take his money and retain some creative control. They didn't. Throughout the movie, the dull and heavy hand of Guccione can be seen everywhere. You only have to compare the gleeful fun and theatrical shocks of the Tiberian Grotto scene to the later dull and boring porn inserts to see the difference between the two directors. Where Brass attempts eroticism, Gucionne goes for porn. Where Brass injects wit and humor, Gucionne in boringly earnest. Where Brass in inventive, Gucionne is dull and repetitive.What could have been a shocking, but provocative, art house commentary on the indestructibility of bourgeois rule, was turned in to a crude exercise in the most dull and tedious kind of porn. There's enough of Brass's original vision to keep things interesting. It's not for the feint-hearted, but fans of Ken Russel, and later, Peter Greenaway, may appreciate the sheer insane spectacle of it all. But Guccione's ham-fisted ineptitude is so apparent in almost every scene that it becomes, at time, almost impossible to watch. Although he only shot six minutes or so, the most sexually hardcore six minutes of the movie, he re-edited the entire thing in to the mess that it is.I've never been an advocate of censorship, but 'Caligula' seems to be so far removed from the intentions of all involved that Brass needs to be given the opportunity one-day to re-edit it back to the film it could have been, which I suspect for all its shocking and offensive imagery, would have been pretty good.",Caligula
83,arthurclay,Unbelievable! But . . .,7,31 May 2005,"I may be the only person in the world who has figured out what this movie really is. Yes it is a porno of course but it's more than that. Brace yourselves ladies and gentleman. It's a comedy! Could it be? Really? Granted it would make it the most sickest, depraved, most-outrageously unfunny comedy of all time but it is a comedy nonetheless. Think about it for one second. His little boots hanging from his bed, the thing with the horse, his sister calling him little boots, and especially the scene with him stamping the documents over and over as Caesar of Rome, the scene with the senators making him a God, the ""conquest of Britain"" scene, and so on and so on. The sex scenes are so erotic they blow your mind thanks to the beautiful Penthouse Pets and the violence is the most demented and sadistic I've ever seen. This one was way better than A Clock Work Orange IF REPEAT IF you are interested in those things and those things alone. I tell you this guy was one disgusting, crazed, megalomaniac probably the biggest and unabashed one in all of history bigger than Hitler and Stalin put together as far as personality goes. The very fact that Rome allowed this nut to take and hold power explains why Rome fell even after 1000 years of glory and purportedly this was due to of all things lead poisoning! It appears Rome used a lot of lead in their drinking cups and this caused extreme insanity and eventually death which affected many of their Imperial Emperors like Caligula. In any event this is one that has to be seen to be believed. Not for classroom purposes or entertainment but for insight into the real Rome and the end results of madness and power mongering.",Caligula
84,polsixe,Read Suetonius first,3,28 February 2008,"I saw this way back when and faintly remembered the porn, the head chopper and doggie snack bits. Recently I picked up the translated book from Suetonius, ""12 Caesars"" and then you see where this movie comes from. The Tiberius and Caligula characters are extrapolated from that book. Now, in seeing it again, some of the set pieces are pretty good - e.g. the all white building interior in wide angle and a bright red-robed Caligula sashaying up the middle, that kind of stuff is still cool high style today. Surprisingly, the dialog/soundtrack itself is pretty tame and apart from some screaming is actually only PG, and banal. McDowell hams it up a bit too much, the bug-eyed maniac is tiresome, the point seems to be that this Caligula knew he wasn't a god and resented the way the Roman aristocracy propped up the role of emperor, and seemed relieved to finally get his in the end.

86,JPfanatic93,"Intrigue, passion, conspiracy, murder and lots and lots of intercourse",7,23 September 2013,"One of the most bizarre entries in the recorded history of cinema, this kinky movie is clearly a product of the seventies with its 'laissez-faire' attitude towards movie contents. The story behind this production is at least as intriguing and sleazy as the final product itself. A grandiose mixture of historical epicness and pornography, this movie went through many tumultuous phases, both during and particularly after production. At its core it tells the story of Caligula (Malcolm McDowell), a young man who rose to be Emperor of ancient Rome at the death of his vile old uncle Tiberius (Peter O'Toole surrounded by naked people), but ruled for only four years because of his disgusting appetites. The movie shows, among other things, Caligula hosting several orgies, engaging in incest with his sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) and having hundreds of people viciously executed for next to no reason. McDowell does an excellent job of portraying the spoiled but traumatized young emperor, but he's outstaged at every turn by the abundance of explicit sex scenes, including fellatio, cunnilingus, lesbian sex, group sex, people urinating on each other, attempted intercourse with fish and various other animals, naked mutants and about everything else the Penthouse producers could think of: it'll come as no surprise original screen writer Gore Vidal had his name removed from the credits when he noticed what had been done to his serious screen play. From a camp perspective, this is actually all rather fun, but if you're looking for historical accuracy, or subtlety, you'll find little here. The movie is still banned in several countries, while there has been almost a dozen cuts in circulation over the years, and none of the make for a really good film, but all of them are fascinating to behold nonetheless.",Caligula
87,Solnichka,Awesome and worth watching at least once in your life,9,11 March 2016,"Okay, this is almost a pornographic film, but not quite - just very sexually graphic. If you have an active sex life, you can deal with this movie easily. That being said, it is one of the more interesting films you could possibly view, all things considered. The film tells the story of Gaius Caligula, the Roman emperor who ruled from 37-41 A.D. and was well-known for his vacant soul. His neglect of matters of state and his indulgence in pleasure and torture drive the plot towards its climactic ending. Technically, the film is interesting - some imagery will stay in your mind, such as the circular guillotine. The sets are lavish, and overall, the film is a firm cinematic achievement, technically speaking. The acting is mostly stellar - McDowell is able to step into the psychotic Caligula, both alternately as a charming head-of-state and a deranged pervert, sometimes in the same scene. O'Toole and Gielgud are only in the film's first 45 minutes, as Tiberius and Nerva, respectively. O'Toole is particularly captivating as the dying emperor, fraught with syphilis (according to historical records) and paranoia. Gielgud's performance is lukewarm - maybe he'd already seen the rest of the movie before filming his scenes? Helen Mirren is captivating as well as Caesonia, the lascivious wife of Caligula. I've seen her in many films, but this and Excalibur are the two I remember most, to be sure. Finally, Theresa Ann Savoy is very strong as Drusula, the incestuous sister of Caligula - she plays the role with a certain soft firmness of character, likable and rational, at least when compared to McDowell's Caligula. The film is full of nudity, sex and graphic images. Some add to the content, some detract - that can be said of any film's imagery. A viewer should not let the mere content dictate the effect. What these images do is lend validity to the story being told, a story of an emperor not fit to be so, an emperor more obsessed with his own benefits rather than the good of the people and the Empire, an emperor so morally depraved - well, this may have been the only way to truly tell the story of Caligula. And it's worth watching, at least once. The first time I tried to watch it, I was 19, and not ready to deal with the content. It is a film for mature audiences only, no doubt. It's up to you to assess your own maturity level, though - not me.",Caligula
88,sinnerofcinema,Only the ignorant would see this as pornography -THIS IS A MASTERPIECE FOR ITS TIME,10,4 October 2007,"I've seen lots of pornography in my time and I'll hardly call this pornography. This film was very beautiful and fantastic and quite an ambitious project for its time. Its just an art-house film with lots of nudity and sex. No different that would you would see today but with accurate historical elements. If all you see is porn or all you want to see it porn here, you must be looking for pornography and I suggest you rent porn. This is a cinematic achievement. The sets, the acting, the story, make up- all in all- a good product. Most, who are in themselves puritans, would see this as porn for they have no sense of what artistic expression really involves. If there is nudity, it must be porn, right? wrong! Sex, nudity, the human naked or nude body, aroused or not, and all that encompasses it can be quite artistic and it is shown here with various degrees of visual artistry. If you want to rent this film because you'd like to see porn for sexual stimulation then why not rent a real porn that has no story or artistic value. Pornographic material ultimate goal is to stimulate you to orgasm. I hardly think that was the point of Caligula. So please, be less illiterate and ignorant for there is some history going on here both for its time, 1979, and as a period piece from pagan Rome.",Caligula
89,jbacks3,Wretched excess,1,3 December 2004,"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out (almost smokey) look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it ""paganography"") wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-70's BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS instead... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look somewhere else.",Caligula

I didn't expect this because Malcolm McDowell stars in it. However after the opening scene and seeing in the opening credits that Penthouse was involved, I knew it was going to be an unusual movie.I know just a little bit about Caligula so I don't know if this movie is historically accurate or even aiming for that so I didn't look at it from this perspective. A movie almost 2 and a half hours long, ancient Rome is portrayed as a vulgar and brutal place. Full of debauchery and people getting killed at the whims and fancies of the bloodthirsty emperors and the equally ruthless population.The settings were amazing. It must have been a massive undertaking to visualize ancient Rome. It's very impressive.The excess in nudity and sex was effective in showing the vulgar empire of Caligula but also got tired quickly. As were the insecurities and monstrous side of Caligula. I think the nudity and brutality did add a certain level of rawness in portraying ancient Rome as an animalistic society.
However the movie still got repetitive as the same scenario seemed to be repeated over and over again. This movie would have been better if it was an hour shorter.",Caligula
92,whammy666,A misunderstood masterpiece...,9,29 January 2007,"Caligula is not a porno film. It is a disturbing historical drama and should be viewed as such. I, for one, found this film hard to watch, it is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, along with films like Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and Cannibal Holocaust. The idea that there could be a ruler that forced people to have sex, and so on. Sure, this movie has much nudity...male and female...but this all adds to the film, making it more disturbing. These sex scenes aren't meant for you to whack the weasel to, they are more meant to get a reaction like ""Oh my God, we DO live in a good world."" Imagine being in a place like Rome in this time, we are just lucky we don't have to live in it. So the movie is not exactly historically significant, but it gives you an idea of what it was like to live in these times. A time no one wants to live in. Also, this movie, like such films as Scarface, is about the fall of man. Caligula was a ruler, and he was on top of the world, then he lost it all. Poof. So if you watch this film, don't think of it as a porno, think of it as a disturbing historical drama. People who see a movie just has sex and just label it a porno and don't try to look deep down into the film, to find meaning and plot are not true movie fans.",Caligula
93,bergma15@msu.edu,What happened? It had so much promise.,3,21 April 2006,"Caligula is an example of a film that was trying to go in too many different directions and ended up tearing itself apart. Anyone who looks at it on paper should realize that it does have some very strong points. The basic story was written by Gore Vidal. The cast is superb (Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren, just to name a few). The scenery, sets, and costumes are excellent and may be as close to authentic as one will find. However, this film fails because it had too many clashing personalities working on it behind the scenes. Gore Vidal left because he didn't like the way Tinto Brass (director) was going with the script. Brass left because he was not allowed to edit the film. O'Toole and Gielgud were unaware that hardcore sex was going to be in the film (otherwise they wouldn't have done it) and McDowell has since commented on what a mess it is. It seems that producer Bob Guccione was more concerned with filming hardcore sex scenes to show the debauchery of ancient Rome than with making an accurate or entertaining film.The plot is basically that of the life of Emperor Gaius Julius Caeser Augustus Germanicus (Caligula was his nickname). It starts at the end of the reign of Tiberius, who ended up giving Caligula half of his estate to be shared with Tiberius' grandson Gemellus. Caligula either goes power mad, or actually insane, history isn't quite sure which, and begins behaving in very bizarre ways. Caligula slept with his sister Drusilla, married a prostitute, had numerous senators executed for questionable reasons, declared himself a god, and had his army pick up sea shells as spoils of war.Most of Caligula's ""legacy"" is conveyed in the film, but the film itself seems to be more of an excuse to make a high class porn film than an actual study into the life of the emperor. In addition, the film makers made some large historical errors.First, they have everyone calling him Caligula. Caligula hated his nickname and was not afraid to get rid of anyone who he didn't like, so anyone calling him this to his face probably would have been executed.Second, they have some kind of large machine that looks like a house but moves slowly to decapitate its victims. There's no evidence anywhere in history that such a machine was developed in ancient Rome.Third, Praetorain Cassius Chaerea did strike the first blow in the assassination of Caligula. However, it was not done in the palace but rather a tunnel leading from the stadium where he was watching gladiatorial games. Chaerea also had several accomplices who were of the senatorial class, and the assassins fled shortly there after because Caligula's guards were going to either kill or arrest them for the slaying. Similarly, Chaerea took no part in the crowning of Claudius as emperor, Chaerea wanted to kill him.These are just a few errors, I'm sure I could find more if I sat down and watched the film again. I really have no urge to because it is a mess. This film could have been great, but it ended up being extremely disappointing.If you want to learn about the early Roman emperors watch ""I, Claudius.""

A lot of the stuff shown are still not acceptable in mainstream movies to this day, a quarter of a century later.The extreme stuff you see in this movie are not all that different than what you can see in a porn movie.

Caligola is colourful, visually stunning experience and at the same time distressing for some. It's certainly not a cheap adult movie as some might think but it does contain a lot of nudity which may be disturbing and that might be the reason for such a low rating as many viewers are expecting more conventional movie.After seeing it i was left puzzled and i didn't quite know what to think of it.

My dad was recording something on Channel 4. I checked it out on Teletext, and it seemed appealing - a Roman epic from 1979 about an emperor who goes mad with power. I thought, ""why not?"" I was certainly not prepared for what I ended up seeing.I get the impression Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought what I thought - that this was going to be a Roman epic and not a porn film. Oh, well. I enjoyed it. The version I first saw was three hours long and had historic scenes interspersed with almost hardcore pornography.Obviously, the sex scenes turned me on, and watching this film felt like an extremely guilty pleasure, but to be honest, I really enjoyed the other scenes too. The film as a whole seemed scattered and not professionally edited, but it had a charm all of its own. I began to feel compassion for Caligula, despite his faults heavily outweighing his strengths.One thing that deserves a special mention is one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever. The main theme is one that provides the essential backdrop to the film, and in this case it paints Caligula as a tragic hero, defeated by his own madness, giving a sympathetic feel, overall.By the end of the film, I felt as though I had been on an epic journey, and I didn't feel shortchanged. It was full of bizarre sex, bizarre violence, and bizarre decisions - phallic symbols aplenty and sexual deviance accompanied by a king mad with power.It's well worth watching, because there is nothing out there like this film.

This awful movie, which is artistically poor and technically ridiculously amateurish, would have been soon forgotten wouldn't it be for the numerous sex images and, sadly, the presence of some good actors. How they got involved, I have no idea.What is it? Basically, a porn movie, with an unbelievable sophomoric pretention at making ""art"". Ah! Art? My God! Poor direction, amateurish and laughable cinematography (so dull I first thought it was on purpose!), contrived scenography, inexistant sense of unity... no art whatsoever. Not even competence. Only bombastic pretention and the desire to shock the audience... so immature.It tries to compete with Fellini's ""Satyricon"", Ken Russel's ""The Devils"", Pasolini's ""Salo""... but all of these movies, wether one likes them or not, have inherent artistic and technical qualities that ""Caligola"" totally lacks. Showing more sex and violence doesn't make up for the emptiness of the project.But maybe, the snobbish have here an opportunity to openly watch a porn flick, with the excuse of ""art"". I feel sorry for them, not only because they need this kind of excuse to assume their libido, but also because defending this movie is revealing such a bad taste that in the end, it's worse than openly looking at porn movies. My opinion, though.Anyway this must be one of the most ridiculous films I've came across, and because of its incredible pretention, I'd say it's maybe the worse movie I ever saw. I can't be tolerant towards incompetence and mediocrity when it's pretending to be art. No mercy for the phoney!",Caligula
100,GTeixeira,Strong and graphic depravity; but Caligula's story deserves that,10,23 February 2013,"It's very difficult to rate this movie. It's a strong gore-fest, unnerving and gut-wrenching at most times. It has been universally dismissed as nothing more than exploitative semi-porn trash by the critics and apparently by most 'common' people too (the IMDb rating). Under certain circumstances, I would be glad to give a film like this a 1 too.But this is one movie where all those things that were used to criticize are, in truth, virtues. How would one show the story of Caligula, the infamous Roman Emperor that could easily be the greatest monster humanity ever saw? The fact that they had the courage to show violence and nudity, not shying away from the depravity of the subject matter, and also showing the 'dark side' of Ancient Rome, is in the end what makes this a cinematic masterpiece.Another plus is that, if you can focus away from the depravity, the movie is all around very solid. The story is very interesting and engrossing, the soundtrack is great, and the cast? You have big names like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, together with beautiful and talented women like Helen Mirren. And what is there to say about Malcolm McDowell? The man is one of the best, most underrated actors and has shown before that he can play a devious lunatic like no one else.The fact this is directed by Tinto Brass (known for his almost pornographic movies) and produced by Penthouse (no explanation needed) might be one of the motives for the film's overly poor critical reception. A director like Pasolini, for example, made worse depravities years before and got away because 'cinema experts' said it was an allegory for the human nature or whatever it is they use to justify overrating their 'art' films. Or maybe it would have been better to sugar-coat the story, making Caligula seem like a victim of whatever disease caused his lunacy, like John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'?",Caligula
101,blurnieghey,One of the best ever,10,27 November 2019,"Some of the reviews for this movie are hilarious. How could anyone willfully watch a notorious video nasty like Caligula and then complain about gratuitous sex and violence? Well, there's no mincing words about it with me: that's why I watch the thing and Caligula is about as high budget and classy as it gets for this level of nasty. Not ""historically accurate""? Seriously, how many movies where they try to show life as it was hundreds or thousands of years are accurate? Probably none. The nightly news can't even get a story straight that happened a few minutes ago.The way the story plays out in the film is above average, not fantastic, but interesting and not garbage. I think the pacing is OK and it is never boring, despite the long runtime. The acting is also pretty good for a film of this nature. The fact that they sunk as much money and effort into this film as they did allow the film to stand as a towering oak, casting shade on the puny saplings attempting to shock and offend that followed afterward. It is truly a benchmark of extreme sex and violence that few films have come close to touching in the decades that followed. Of course, I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, but I would think the film's reputation would precede itself at this point. Love it or hate it, chances are there will never be anything else like it, so check it out.",Caligula
102,aeo,Good but not a great movie.,7,5 February 2008,"I saw this movie many years ago and thought it was just OK. I thought it was too sexually graphic and a bit too melodramatic but I saw this again several years ago and found the movie to be quite good. The reason for my change in attitude is that, in between the two viewings, I had the chance to learn more about Roman history; specifically their culture. This movie portrays Rome as it really was during Caligula time. They were very sexual and openly displayed it.This is the story of Caligula or Caligola, the emperor of Rome. In historical context, he was not as bad as some would have it. He actually accomplished quite a bit even though he was not mentally all there. But then given how he grew up, I am surprised he was able to accomplish the amount that he did.When he was young, his uncle Emperor Tiberius killed Caligula's mother and father. He went to live with his uncle who subsequently molested him countless times. I was shocked by this but pederasty, an intimate or erotic relationship between an adolescent boy and an adult male, was quite common in those times. The real shocker was that Tiberius had his Praetorian Guards throw many young boys over a cliff after he was bored with them. If I recall, hundreds if not thousands of boys met their doom in this way. Caligula constantly lived in fear that he too would be thrown over the cliff like those other boys.If you don't know much about Roman history, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie. There are intricacies here that will escape those who are unfamiliar or are a novice to Roman history. I'm not saying that you should read a whole college textbook on Roman history but do some internet research on it and afterward watch movie. I'm sure you will like the movie more if you do so rather than just watching it without doing any research at all.",Caligula

If you're expecting a story that describes the infamous adolescent emperor in traditional, polite terms, then you will HATE this one. As it is, Caligula could have been produced by the psychotic prince himself. Bob Guccione must have found his role as corrupter of an otherwise mainstream production both ironic and satisfying, he obviously identifies quite deeply with the tyrannical paranoid boy-king. Don't think of it as just a film, or a movie. It is a unique spectacle; a totally unapologetic exploitation of everyone and every idea involved. It is NOT for aficionados of elegant discourse. It IS a genuinely sick product from an increasingly corrupt, depraved, declining society. The fault, dear Readers, is not in our stars, but in ourselves... Enjoy.",Caligula

I don't know if such a story was real or not but such things were there in past. That arrogance of humans in few places is depicted honestly or at least bravely. If one can overlook un-overlook-able eroticses in the film, one will definitely move along with it in its depiction of madness, lust of power and sex, and what not. Can't say again if incidents are real then how much honestly they are filmed but sure thing that such events are reality of human history not too old at various developing places.I wish this movie can tell about or show us about the extreme or limit of money, power, sex in human life. Some idea can sure be taken in as to what happen now when i have everything.",Caligula
105,bedazzle,"failed potential, gratuitous",6,1 September 2001,"There is no way in which a film on Caligula could be non-sexual. A certain amount must be depicted simply because of Caligula's character and behavior. So, for example, it is necessary to show sex scenes and scenes in which our culture would term ""perverted."" Normal sex scenes demonstrate Caligula's infatuation with sex. Perverted scenes illustrate the magnitude of this infatuation. Thus, both normal sex, orgies, and incest are necessary for the accuracy of the film. Orgies are especially relevant historically given that they became a large source of state income under Caligula. However, each of these types of sexuality were depicted in gratuitious way that was not necessary from the point of view of accuracy; i.e., it is not necessary to spend ten minutes of footage - with multiple close ups to boot - to present the fact that orgies existed in Caligula's life. Though some sexual aspects are left out which would have strengthened the idea of Caligula's immersion into sexuality of all types; namely, acts of beastiality which are as historically true as any other sexual facts on Caligula. This would have been, from a standpoint of accuracy, much more desired than the actual gratuitous sexuality displayed. A superfluous amount of these director mis-judgements compromises the potential for a good film. It is important to understand Caligula from both a modern and classical perspective, but educational and historical understanding and partially bartered for mere arousal and porn profits. But what can you expect from a penthouse-produced film?",Caligula

After watching this movie, I couldn't believe someone actually committed this screenplay to film. Storywise, let's just say it's Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"" living out his life in Roman times. For those who haven't seen ""Clockwork"", basically a spoiled brat interested in perversities. Yes, a lot of the scenes are just plain gross and shocking, but not necessarily in a good way. If you consider Let's just say that half of the movie is a combo of a S&M and porn director's movie with a colossal budget. This would have been a better movie if it explored Caligula's mind and at least tried to analyze why he performed the atrocities he did. Any person who has read or seen documentaries on Caligula could see that the director chose the most depraved acts and committed it to film, yet nothing is mentioned about his megalomaniac thoughts on being one of the gods and how this really lead to his subsequent demise.

I had heard about the explicit sex scenes, gruesome violence, and the notorious debauchery. I sat and watched and I began laughing! The set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously...it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The book of Mark no less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you.

As for the others, I will not watch anything they produce either. To see

In fairness to everyone involved in this mess they had a great idea and just went overboard. The violence and sex, as graphic as it is, has almost a comical feel to it, as if not to be taken too seriously. McDowell wildly overacts as Caligula. This could have been great if only toned down somewhat and also if Guccioni had given the viewer some insight as to the cause of Caligula's madness instead of this viewer left groping as to figure out what the hell went wrong in Caligula's mind to do the terrible things he did. I wanted to know more about Caligula and wasn't given anything to try and figure him out. Instead we see sex (very graphic in the original version) and lots and lots of violence, which if handled properly I don't have a problem with. But Guccioni, in his attempt to shock (he succeeded very well)forgot the storyline and just went scattering in all different directions.

I, however noticed one more thing, and it makes the picture even more painful: small fragments of a good movie. From what I can tell Tinto Brass delivered a good version of CALIGULA before the studio got its claws into it. The scene with a dying John Gielgud being questioned by Malcolm McDowell about immortality is too good to be in the picture. The wedding scene is also excessive, but it still looks like it was shot for a movie and not a porno. The scene where Caligula is ill and a senator says he'll give his life if Caligula may be well again, not expecting the fatal results, is the best in the film. What's wrong? Bob Guccione thought it would be a good idea to gut a movie and then fill in the empty space with random sex. There's so much damned sex that after a while stops being shocking or arousing; it just gets boring. I'd love to see the original film, but the final cut is still a piece of s**t.

116,LBarlane24,Ignore the naysayers,10,9 June 2019,"Co-directed by Tinto Brass and Bob Gucciane (who also served as co-producer), Caligula stars Malcom McDowell as the titular character, along with Teresa Ann Savoy, Helen Mirren, and Peter O'Tool as Tiberius Caesar. It is a historical drama revolving around none other than the titular character, Caligula, and tells the story of before and when he reigned.Since the year it was released, critics and some (if not, most) of the mass majority have dismissed as nothing but a porno. To which, I respond by asking a simple question, 'how?' I mean, it does have countless sex scenes (which are, without a doubt, very explicit); including the orgies. But last time I checked, a porno is usually very low budget, which this film was clearly the opposite; after all, it has an actual (as well as, there I say, true) story. Each and every one of the set designs look genuine at best, and I could basically say the same thing for wardrobe designs.As for the acting, where do I begin? McDowell gives one of his best (if not, the best) performances of his entire career. Savoy was terrific in the role she played. She was sexy in pretty much every scene she was in, and the same thing can be said for of course Helen Mirren; and no, it was not just because of their nude scenes. O'Tool was also pretty good, despite the fact that he was apparently drunk when filming most (if not, all) of his scenes.Like it or not, this film is, without a shadow of a doubt, a masterpiece. I will agree most (if not, all) of the scenes involving graphic intercourse (as well as felletio) were a lot longer than they needed to be, but using said scenes to dismiss the film as a 100% failure is just flat-out redundant; unless you are a prude, sex and or nudity should not be difficult to embrace, nor even view.",Caligula

119,fidelio74,'If only all of Rome had but one neck',3,2 December 2010,"'Caligula' is a thoroughly unpleasant experience. It is depraved and disgusting, and it captures the unlimited excesses of ancient Rome very well. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the film is that it attracted such acting heavyweights as John Gielgud (Nerva), Peter O'Toole (Tiberius), and Helen Mirren (Caesonia); who are all excellent. As is Malcom McDowell in the title role; his wide-eyed, utterly deranged performance is spot on, and his madness seems to grow as every minute of the running time ticks by.Virtually every perversion one can think of is represented here, and is performed against massive, stunning sets which are lavish and amazing in their construction and attention to detail. There is casual sadism aplenty; people are put to death at Caligula's slightest whim, and sex is never far from the frame. The film has been called the most expensive porno ever made, but directors Tinto Brass, Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione, and Giancarlo Lui, deserve praise for not taking the easy way out and making some awful 'I've come to repair the cable' kind of affair. Instead, they have attempted a much more ambitious project: the story of the rise and fall of the most notorious Roman emperor in history.If you can stomach all the sex and violence, then you can certainly watch 'Caligula' for its acting. But you are definitely going to need a shower afterwards! You might do better watching the superb HBO cable television series 'Rome'.",Caligula

122,kailomonkey,unrated version = full picture ... rated cut = hints and winks,10,3 March 2012,"The full unrated version of this film goes to some real extremes of sex and disgust. The rated version is only left with hints to the extremes that are being portrayed.As a tale of the main character Caligula, and his love affair with his sister, her refusal to marry him in hope of him marrying someone respectable and acceptable, alongside his innosence at not being able to kill his adopted grandfather... given the opportunity to choose another wife he picks the worst, seemingly blind to what his beloved was trying to do for him, separating him from something that was good in him... happy to eventually rape women and men, to kill and torture... facing the reaities of being fated to be killed, going to extremes to avoid it yet at other extremes encouraging it... His sister's eventual death and his reaction... Shot amidst constant intermittently-graphical sex orgies...In my opinion it tells the story well, not too blatantly, as you have to consider the characters yourself to see their issues.The sexually graphic and graphic indescency is also nice to see in full, not for pornographic purposes because porn doesn't need a full movie of context and meaning, but that a major film went to such extremes (for whatever reasons, other reviews explain), that it all fits into the context of the movie and that such content is often cut for what good reason other than standardised normality in film.The only scene that does really seem to cut away from the film is the explicit lesbian scene of the two women who have been watching Caligula having sex with his wife and sister. But even that has a point in mirroring the activity going on in the room between Drucilla and Caesonia, without showing it: Which goes further than the cut version to again, merely hint at.Not a film I'd watch with relatives, for them I'd stick to the cut, rated version.

123,Pinback-4,"Bad, but bad in its own way.",1,29 August 1999,"This movie is incredibly bad, but it's so strange that it's bad in its own way.  The question I kept asking myself throughout the film is what kind of audience did the filmmakers have in mind who would want to see this? Certainly not history buffs, because the story is all but incomprehensible, and offers no insights into the life of Caligula or anyone else.  Certainly not fans of the gifted and famous actors like Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud.  If they did this film for any reason besides the money they should get their heads examined.  They have never done anything remotely like this before or since.  If the producers hired them in order to give their film ""legitimacy"" were sadly mistaken. Certainly not for people who like pornos.  The film is absurdly overlong at two-and-a-half hours, and only a few precious minutes feature hard-core porno.  Since Penthouse produced the film, what they should have done was cut an hour out of the film and add more porno scenes in order to make it a standard porno movie and not some half-hearted epic.  I was at least expecting the film to feature glossy photography just like in the Penthouse pictorials.  Boy, was I wrong.  The cinematography is really ugly.  It's underlit and washed out, and it looks like one of those cheap Italian gladitor films of the '60s.  The editing is a joke.  The scenes don't flow together, they just pile them on, one after the other, in no apparent order. Nino Baragli, who edited Sergio Leone's films, worked on this film as well, if you can believe it.  This is the kind of film that should be put into a time capsule for a hundred years and then seen again to see if it's any better.  It just might, because I was surprised at the high number of ""10"" votes by imdb users.   My only other comment is about Malcolm McDowell.  He actually gives a performance.  He is onscreen almost all the time, and he plays his part with a straight face.  He recites the silly dialogue as if he was making an important film like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Nothing fazes him, not what happens onscreen.  One would be hard-pressed to recall another instance in which a talented actor worked so hard for such a minimal payoff.",Caligula

This is an idea of pagan Rome,a fragmented dream-world loosely based on fact with unreal tangents sprinkled liberally in between fornication, bloodshed & bureaucracy, presided over by our stunted man-child.The shoddy camp chintz scenery establishes a sickly-sweet air,overripe & too bright & just plain off, Flash Gorden meets John Waters,a fetid atmosphere where vipers thrive. It feels like a squalid imitation of something real, right down to the plywood marble columns, cheap & luxurious at once.Everyone's playing dress-up here, children in costume.""It doesn't matter"" exclaims Caligula at one point. ""Its only a show!"" Plethoras of naked slave bodies melt into a neon pornotopia decor, denied any individuality outside of objectification, used & discarded at will. The entire ruling class of Rome show such a callous indifference to humanity in fact, removed from it by virtue of position, that scene after scene of vile cruelty is constantly enacted: sliced c*cks & fisted men, giant baroque beheading machines, lesbian golden showers & hermaphroditic penetration - the swine must be shown a firm hand at all times.The grotto scenes offer the most succinct vision for what the filmmakers were going for but which is sadly not sustained through-out. Like entering one of Dante's circles of hell complete with billowing smoke, its an underworld of writhing bodies, torture devices & disembodied screams with roman aristocrats leisurely strolling round discussing the naked art of power (every now & then the Caligula that might've been pops up between the cracks like this).The best performance isn't Mcdowell doing his spoiled-child-from-hell shtick though. Peter O'Toole's loathsome emperor Tiberius easily steals the show, sinking into a pit of self immolating depravity in his final years, literally rotting from within while spitting out words lest he choke on them. Only a lapsed idealist spews this much venom and in Tiberius we see the last vestiges of a great republic before its down-slide into an iron clad boot heel. Caligula has no such context- he's a sheltered uncivilized youth. His cruelty is weightless & banal, a product of boredom. He never had a soul to sell, the opening biblical quote belongs more to the old man Tiberius, a once-goody whittled down into a self-loathing, sadistic monster that O'Toole sells with every bit of scenery he chews. When he goes the spirit of his island fortress goes, deprived of its black animating force. I wish the whole film had been about this guy.Caligula paints a candy coloured burlesque of power, ostentatious pageantry hiding a dreadfully empty centre. Everyone wants power here & will gladly murder for it, hollow cut-outs playing human on the stage of the imperial court. Little Boots wants & gets but only because he has nothing else to do besides fondle his sister.This is no tragedy, he's an empty vessel. Once he's crowned he's clearly at a loss how to use his power beyond masturbatory ends, leading a lazy life of cruel hedonism like Peter Pan with the world's greatest train-set. All too quickly we witness the boredom, the frustration, the spiritual emptiness of unlimited power & what it would be like to truly never grow up. Its like that episode of the Twilight Zone where the crook thinks he's in heaven and gets everything he ever wanted, only to find its actually hell he resides in. The final shot really pounds home the arbitrariness of this charade- one minute orgies in the sun, the next your guts pooled in a gooey mass round your sandals, wondering where it all went south. Ba da boom. Significant too, the idyllic grace before the killing shot, rising to a beautiful crescendo as the state eats another of its own, complete with kiddie slaughter & be-headings. Caligula sees whats coming & naturally embraces it, death being the only rush left. It all happens so fast as to be an afterthought too; just as Caligula & co. hit the ground their entire retinue disperse, the assassins moved onto more important duties while the help quickly rinses the blood off the furniture lest it stain. Ouch- the rat race goes on. There wasn't any other way for the movie to end, really: an upside down, bloodied Gaius staring freeze-framed into the lens as credits crawl up his corpse- It's nihilistically note- perfect & kind of beautiful. The Apollonian I Claudius dealt with its politics in a rational, Masterpiece Theater way, while Caligula the low-brow Dionysian flip-side, revels in the mud like its drooling idiot brother, laughing away those airs of grandeur & rubbing our faces in nothing *but* the p*ss, the sh*t, the vomit, cum & other fallout of those same politics. Uninhibited new guard meeting high-dignity artifice old- I don't see how it could've ever achieved the mainstream recognition it clearly pines for, thank Jupiter.

I first watched this as part of a University Dare Night, where myself and my flatmates decided to watch something really racy and preferably controversial (because as we all know, when you go to University, you check your brain in at the door!).So what's the grilling? The film tells the story of Caligula, played by the always controversial Malcolm McDowell, the infamous psychotic, incestuous and delusionally murderous Caesar of Rome as he rises from his frightful youth under the rule of his Uncle Tiberius (played by Peter O'Toole, while drunk apparently), to his dominance as lord of the known World.What are the problems with this movie?

It's got all the gratuitous sex and perversion that you'd come to expect from a movie like that, the only problem being that it's not particularly sexy, if anything it would probably put you off.At the same time this is offset by incredible amounts of graphic violence, including brutal beatings, stabbings, murder, suicide, decapitation by moving wall with spinning blades, etc. This film really does push the boat out.The acting is incredibly questionable, either because you question what the actors were thinking when they did these unspeakable acts to each other, or questioning how many of these actors may or may not have been actually killed during production. Malcolm McDowell especially, who really seems to be getting into his role as the debauched ruler.I will however give this film two points. One point for the magnificent sets and locations built for the movie, which, now that I think about it, all seemed to have gone to complete and utter waste, and another point for the outfits, of which quite a lot of work appears to have gone into, for the few people who actually wear outfits and don't just wander about in the nude!Bottom line, I really cannot recommend this film on those two points alone. If you want a historical drama, this isn't for you, if you want a pornographic movie, it still isn't for you. It's incredibly violent, not sexy in the least, has no historical accuracy, and is about as fun to sit through as Root canal treatment. Stay away folks, stay far, far away!",Caligula
127,matjpi,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,2,5 March 2012,"When I first saw this I was intellectually and experientially disadvantaged and for those reasons (but mostly because I scarcely remembered it) I decided to see it again, nearly 30 years later.On a set copied sedulously from a down-at-heel Chinese brothel populated by people gathered from the Strip on any 70's Saturday night in LA, Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) with fragments of post-it's stuck all over his withered face, mouths fatuous plasticine dialogue as Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) looks on in starry-eyed adoration. Later Caligula gets to play a much hackneyed role from a San Francisco bath house in the 80's (perhaps even the 1880's). If Caligula were indeed the dissipated creature he has oftentimes been portrayed (a _very_ early devotee of carnality with his sister for example) it's hardly likely that he would find Tiberius' unsustainable Brothelicon a shining beacon of desire.Leaving aside the underplayed (and mostly redundant) carnal component of this cornucopia of calamitous cinematic crap, one wonders if any of the people involved consulted even a single (sober or soused) historian prior to writing. Rome, like victorian England, had its twisted sides but such things were never secret for long and, for all the Praetorian Guard's prowess, the people would not have taken this kind of thing ... um ... lying down, for long. But that's to poke a hole in a swiss cheese the size of Switzerland.The thing about cinematic catastrophes such as this is that the director gets his cake either way. He can always claim it was a genius challenge for which the jaded establishment public were inadequately prepared, else he can claim it was a sensitive and humorous parody, which the dim-witted public could not appreciate and thereby missed the inverted/reflected brilliance of his double-bluff to their parodied middle-class bourgeois values.It's not a terrible film; there are many worse. It is a notorious film, and for all the wrong reasons. The sets are dark enough to take our minds off their paucity. The dialogue is sparse enough to take our minds off it's painfully skeletal composition fleshed out with fatuousness. The acting is scarce enough to take our minds off. Gielgud was so completely discomfited by his role, he seemed to be speed-reading his lines off his mental teleprompter so he could get off the set and wrap his tortured soul around a warm amontillado and call his agent for a rant and recompense.I'd say, if you're /really/ bored and this is sitting by the player, load it up and flop into a beanbag.

We live in a society which is bound by a set of rules called Law. Try to imagine what the world would be like if there is no law to govern! Man will become animal. His thirst for blood grows. Absolute power to an individual will bring out the animalistic cruelty and sexual perversion.Caligula is a film that deals with such absolute power and its by-products, that are bestowed on the infamous Roman Ceaser. Malcolm McDowell did a wonderful job in enacting the maniacal role. All the other actors are merely supporting his performance. Peter O'Toole was great in his role. He was very expressive as a dying tyrant who doesn't trust his heir to the throne. His character is also very pervasive and Toole splendidly performed a s one. Helen Mirren has nothing much to do than standing as an eye candy wife of Caligula.The movie is filled with nudity and gore. Yet, you will not remember the movie as a softcore or you wouldn't be aroused by the content. Director Tinto Brass made sure that the tone was maintained throughout. Watch Caligula for the pure passion of a bunch of men to tell a shocking story.In my opinion, this is one of the finest movies I have ever seen.

130,crendine,Turned it on but got turned off !,1,9 April 2015,"I viewed the full-length, uncut version of this film and it struck me as merely an attempt to make a porno version of the Ten Commandments with a bit of Night of the Living Dead thrown in. Guccione's idea seems to have been to portray the perverse and sick side of the Roman era and at the same time, to destroy the Hollywood perception of Biblical movies (given the cast of some well-established actors and actresses). The result was an absolutely disgusting film whose only merit was in its shock value. As many of my fellow IMDb reviewers have pointed out, there is actually a scene early in the film where a group of individuals are buried up to their necks in the ground and are decapitated by a lawn-mower type machine wielding a very large blade. And the scene is very graphic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think engines existed in this era ! As for the remainder, the script is just plain awful and speaking quite frankly, the ""adult"" scenes (if we can refer to them that way) are not very stimulating or exciting at all. Also, there are many scenes of orgies, bestiality, incest, and just about any other perversion you can think of. To me, this movie was an expensive attempt to create a pornographic film set to the backdrop of Ancient Rome and throwing in extreme violence and established actors just to lend it some credibility. I'm sure there are many historical errors here as well but in short, this is just an awful attempt at cinema. At a length of a little over 2 and 1/2 hours, it really becomes boring and pointless. Also, if we check the history books, this movie isn't even close to the facts. For one, the emperor's name was not even Caligula. That was a nickname given to him by the Roman soldiers when he was a little boy. It literally means ""little boots"". He would parade around in front of the soldiers in a soldiers uniform that his mother made for him, which included a tiny set of army boots. And, his reign as emperor only lasted 4 years and was, by far, more violent than sexually perverse. He wound up being assassinated by 2 soldiers whom he insulted. So, this movie technically fails on 2 fronts. Terrible.",Caligula

134,thesandfly77,The Truth Hurts,9,2 September 2009,"Ah, Caligula.Somehow, in my early teens I managed to rent this all on my own from a small video rental kiosk attached to our regular after-school amusement arcade.Whoever it was behind the counter (a woman in her twenties, I recall) had either never seen it or was nonplussed as to ratings.As I remember this was just before the video nasty laws were introduced and heavy censorship blighted our lives.It was the full-on no-holds barred version I watched jaw-agape in my teenage bedroom.And, you might ask, how does one grow up from that rather turbulent early experience to NOT become a serial killer? Purely because, even back then, I recognised this as something rather special.More of a pantomime staged in hell than a movie, the reason this provokes such polarised opinion is its complete and utter truthfulness.Subsequent viewings over the decades have slowly revealed Caligula the movie's shameless audacity to be in line with all accounts of the time history can throw at us.Each perversion, each shocking ultraviolent episode is delivered with much relish and much gratuitously beautiful cinematic execution, BUT, and this is the crux of the film's 'charm', BUT NEVER with judgement.It is left to you, the audience, to provide your own moral compass and that is a device (or lack of) seldom permitted to be employed at all nowadays.'Tell us what we're meant to think/feel/do!' your tenderised modern-western conscience screams. Porn! Violence! Outrageous melodrama from some of cinema's finest thespians! Sweeping epic sets, beauty and horror in abundance and very often side by side.And Caligula the movie does offer no answer, merely a repetition of Malcolm McDowell's smarmy, sneery, deadly smile.It'll stab you in the heart; it'll stab you in the back; it'll love you and rape you; it is still quite unlike anything I've ever seen. A truly 'adult' epic.I watched it again tonight and I'm smiling too. At McDowells creepy, campy, over-the-top portrayal of Rome's darkest heart; remember, like Ledger's Joker interpretation, all the world really knew of Roman nobility was the imperial grace of the 50s and 60s blockbusting epics. To show an emperor in such light was brave, sordid, and shocking. Where was the romance, where Anthony and Cleopatra? (scr*wing under a pile of bodies in at least one scene I'd hazard a guess...) I still love this film (and the uber-sexy goddess Helen Mirren), in all it's 'glory'. Hardened to the sensationalism which enrapt me as a teen, I've no doubt that even 30 years later when everyone's seen it all and sees it all on the net 24 hours a day, no major Hollywood production could ever hope to get away with what they did back then.So it is difficult if not impossible to apply any regular film critique to something which will always be more than a film.I long for the day when someone breaks silence and we get the full diaries of events surrounding the production of this monster, because it sure as hell radiates off the screen that everyone was having the time of their lives. After all, don't you always disown your own most indulgent and raucous excesses? Thank you Brass, Gucionne, McDowall, Mirren, Vidal, O'Toole, etc, etc, etc right thru to the 'fluffers' ;)), for a most epically enduring epic and its all-pervading honesty and mayhem.They sure don't make 'em like this any more, and I don't think they ever did; at least not outside ancient Rome anyway.",Caligula

I'm a huge fan of 1970's exploitation films and this is the best. There is lots is hardcore, XXX, full penetration sex. The gore was decent but I the story telling made up for it. It's one of those rare movies that I could watch forever and wish it didn't have to end. It gets it point across very well and it portrays Caligula as not a monster or a mad man, but as an average young man given more power than he knows what to do with. It show him as a scared young man and how the power gradually corrupts him and he gets more evil and becomes more of a tyrant as the movie goes on. As far as the sex it's very erotic and high quality. The only down side is the gore was a bit lacking. I don't know why so many people hate this film, I would guess there just closed minded, uptight, prudes that can except a movie that is daring and won't hold back to tell the true story as accurately as possible.",Caligula

Some seam to take offense at the graphic and sexual content but frankly... what did you expect. This is a movie about what is considered to be one of the most decadent emperors of Rome. So obviously the director and producer went for it recreating a repulsive era and this is where the movie succeeds with some horrific scenes and Malcolm McDowell in his most exuberant role besides A Clockwork Orange. It's about a Roman Emperor who went mad and succeeds very well at portraying it.

137,manalone923,Interesting if you like the Caligula story or dig depraved porn,7,19 February 2004,"I gave this film a seven. How can I defend this, when any other comment will mention its tastelessness, depravity, etc.?Well, I defend it based purely on the fact that it's historically accurate. Some liberties are taken, but for the most part, this movie captures Caligula's story. However, this also means that Caligula's sadistic, bestial nature, and that of the Roman era as a whole, are also very disturbingly rendered.For those who don't know, Caius Caligula was one of the Caesars of Rome, its highest official. Caligula was widely believed to have ascended to the position by murdering the previous Caesar, his own uncle.  Once in control, he went on a sad, cruel and twisted rule that saw mass beheadings, permissible sexual depravity, and flat out cruelty to even those close to the man himself. Caligula had an incestuous relationship with his own sister, had murdered his own friends and co-conspirators, and I believe he willed all his possessions to be given to his horse.So, Caligula the film stays true to the facts. That alone would make this a disturbing film. What compounds the issue is the fact that it was co-financed by Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine, and as a result every effort to show lewd and tasteless behavior is taken. In the uncut version, you will see hundreds of completely nude men and women involved in sexual acts with each other, and with themselves. You'll see men on men, women on women. A slain man is urinated on by 2 women, onscreen. A man has his vital organ sliced off and fed to dogs (onscreen, but fake this time). There is suggested rape, item-oriented sexual assault, and things even more disturbing such as twitching,  apparent mutants engaging in said behavior as well.Therein lies the problem. The line of genuine reproduction and smut for smut's sake was crossed, and crossed fast. There are actually only a handful of sex scenes in the movie (all of them very graphic and equal to any of today's pornos). But the bulk of the tasteless stuff is arbitrarily shown in between regular scenes. So, you don't just get a bunch of story followed by bizarre sex, but instead you watch as main characters discuss regular topics and are then disturbed when the camera randomly cuts to an image of extreme sexual behavior. Much of it is irrelevant, and that's where the intent of the film is blurred by its porno roots.Although I'm not a regular watcher, I've seen porn before. And if you are curious about this movie to see if it has any comparably sexy scenes, there is certainly stuff to catch your interest. But for th0e casual viewer, it's wise to stay away from this one because so much of it IS genuine porn, and much of the random cuts show stuff that are in the most specific of weird porn genres. That's a shame to me, because I was interested in the Caligula story and wanted to see a good rendition of it. I did get it, and I was also surprised to some very alluring imagery. But that was offput by all the random, disturbing stuff that I would have preferred not to see.
The acting is fine, McDowell does an admirable job just being a nutcase throughout most of the film. The set design is great, as are the costumes. It's clear that a lot of money went into this, but it's hard to speak too highly of the end result.So why do I give the film a 7?  Well, plainly put, it is what it says it is. It is Rome at its sleaziest, with its most depraved of operators at the helm. I didn't rent it expecting a porno, and was pleasantly surprised by some of what I saw. But then the rest of it, the overabundance of juxtaposed weird stuff, was off-putting and unwanted, and unfortunately does take up a significant chunk of screen time.  My advice is to see it if you're curious to see just how much weird sexual stuff is in there, or to see an unashamedly graphic portrayal of the subject. Everyone else is urged to steer clear, because this is not a typical Hollywood docu-drama, and you'll be made uncomfortable if you're not prepared for what it contains.",Caligula
138,groatski,"Not all that bad, but there wasn't much to work with.",6,25 September 2008,"I finally succumbed to the hoop-la and decided to watch this movie, just to say I did.Gore and pornography aside, this movie's greatest weakness was that Caligula was simply not an interesting person. He was the Uday Hussein of the classical era; a sadistic and emotionally stunted 15-year-old in a man's body. There was never any intelligence or forethought to his brutality, it was purely random. That alone might make a movie interesting for an hour or so, but after that it just gets boring. Watching Caligula for 2-1/2 hours was like watching a child slowly pulling the legs and wings off insects.For the first half of the movie there is a rather competent storyline (which is repeatedly interrupted by scenes of gratuitous porn that appear to have been added after the fact for no apparent reason), but beyond that it's just one scene after the next of a deranged man-child laughingly dishing out sadistic punishments to whomever happened to be standing around him.The first 30 minutes or so are well worth watching. Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) was Caligula's predecessor, and he was a much more fascinating character. One gets the idea that he started out as a wise and noble leader that slowly went mad over time, and that would have been a much more worthy subject for a movie of this magnitude.After nearly 2 hours I had all I could stand and fast-forwarded thru the rest.",Caligula
139,austex23,Outsider Cinema with a Big Budget,5,17 February 2001,"Further proof that the line between inept and visionary is sometimes invisible.  Having heard about Caligula since it was first released, I took advantage of the DvD issue to see it.  Neither as good nor as bad as its reputation, I found the film to be one of those movies that is hard to compare to traditional films.  The reviewer here who compared it to Plan 9 is right -- not because Caligula is as bad a movie, but because, like Plan 9, it discards nearly all the conventional ideas about filmmaking and strikes out boldly, even foolishly, on its own.  The unrated version is far more graphic in its sex scenes than I was expecting, and adds to the sense of the film's resolute difference from other movies.  A mish-mash of directorial styles -- from trite to  frenetically bizarre -- Caligula lurches from predictable to surprising, sometimes within the same scene. Nearly every element of the film is eccentric, from the script to the lighting, whether through design or mistake is beyond my ability to judge. For fans of outsider cinema, with a tolerance for porn and an ability to forgive silly costumes, strained dialogue, and a moral stance that can only be summed up as deranged, Caligula is well worth seeing.",Caligula
140,thale05,"A Mean-Spirited, Ugly Piece of Cinema",1,5 March 2011,"Leave it to Penthouse to produce a movie about Caligula, one of history's most evil men. They dumped money into the project to turn ancient history into a boring, sickening, and vile sexploitation porn film. It is pitiful how an important time period was used to sell audiences disgusting filth. On top of that, the movie manipulated some of the finest actors of our time and embarrasses them on screen. I do not tell people to go see or avoid movies because they have a choice of their own that is beyond my grasp. I only tell them what I saw and what I thought of it.As I watched ""Caligula"", I became confused, bored, offended, and disgusted towards the material. All my eyes beheld were fully naked bodies, pointless close-ups of genitalia, acts of oral sex, orgies, hardcore sex scenes, mutilation, self-mutilation, urination, some form of necrophilia, castration, rape, and senseless violence and torture (sometimes sexually). I do not feel proud telling anybody what I saw in ""Caligula"". It is true that the real Caligula committed such senseless acts but I felt most of these sights were completely unnecessary.If that's not sick enough for you, there were actors and actresses who pleasured themselves as they saw people tortured or killed. Was it a way to depict the sadistic atmosphere of Rome? I know there are much classier ways to reflect the horrible society of the Roman Empire. I simply watch ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"". Yes, there was an extreme amount of blood, sex, and brutality but there were also great stories with emotions and feelings that kept the series' heart beating. ""Spartacus"" reflected both ugliness and beauty but ""Caligula"" could only show me ugliness. Speaking of ugliness, I will share a couple of examples in ""Caligula"". In one scene, Emperor Caligula raped a newly-wed couple in a kitchen as a ""wedding gift."" First, he had intercourse with the virgin bride and then he (be prepared) stuck his fist up the groom's rectum. Why on God's good green earth did I have to see it?! What's even worse is that the movie gave us no emotion out of the travesty, not even an emotional flurry of music to give me a cathartic chill.The other scene was one of the torture sequences. Caligula tortured a guard by slashing him to death and a couple of random girls sexually urinated on his corpse. Seriously, this was garbage. But that didn't stop there. No, the guard's genitals were cut off and fed to dogs. This is referenced in Eli Roth's ""Hostel Part II"" but the big difference is that Roth did it to shock and horrify people. ""Caligula"" did it just to get some attention because it wanted to be the most controversial movie ever. And they polished a nuclear bomb to reach that target by going with the orgy of the senators' wives. It was a waste of time and utterly disgusting. As I look back at his role of Alex DeLarge, I could see Malcolm McDowell as Caligula but he was in the wrong production at the wrong time. The man himself said he hated the movie. Overall, his performance was satisfying yet it had terrible moments. When McDowell acted paranoid or screamed, I was disappointed how unconvincing he was. Helen Mirren had the role of Caesonia, the wife of Caligula, and she did a decent job but I was devastated to see her wearing a leash around her neck like a subservient dog. She deserved more respect than that. Giancarlo Badessi portrayed the uncle of Caligula, Claudius, and he annoyed me. He made Claudius look like an overweight, idiotic buffoon; according to history, the real Claudius did not have such attributes. It was unfathomable how Peter O'Toole could be involved in ""Caligula"" as the Emperor Tiberius and be below-average in the role as well. All O'Toole did was awkwardly pronounce sentences and burst out exclamations as if he had Tourette's syndrome. O'Toole and his co-star John Gielgud claim they never knew hardcore sex scenes were being filmed. How could they not?! I saw O'Toole caressing fully nude girls, kissing their bodies while sitting next to fully nude men in the movie! I suppose he was in denial. There were scraps of the movie I did admire. Some of the dialogue worked well in the movie and I enjoyed some of McDowell's comedic parts. Some important moments of Caligula's reign were covered but not enough to outweigh the ugliness in the rest of the film. The ending was the only scene I liked in the movie even though it is shot and executed sluggishly. The movie needed to end the way it did, no matter how horrible it looked. ""Caligula"" is an ugly, boring porn film which aims to exploit history in favor of cheap hardcore sex footage and gross-out shots. If there is any sort of reason to view it, see it to understand how I felt. As I stated before, I only share my thoughts to people and the decision to see a movie lies with them. For those who are brave enough to sit through ""Caligula"", I commend you all for your courage. My Rating: 1/10",Caligula

I was immediately taken in by the highly atmospheric settings and production design, plus the highly emotive classical soundtrack.In all fairness to ""Caligula"", it is nothing like the disgusting great steaming pile of garbage that its detractors have made it out to be. True, it is by no means whatsoever a perfect film, but what most people fail to realise is that the writer and the director of ""Caligula"" had originally set out to make an allegorical story about life in the corridors of power in Ancient Rome, as opposed to a hard-core pornographic peepshow, The visceral scenes of violence are alarmingly compelling. The sheer savagery of the dark underbelly of Roman life is vividly, and quite accurately captured (though not quite historically accurate).Malcolm McDowell gives his all and all as the deranged Roman emperor, Caligula.

143,john-souray,Cut and uncut versions,3,1 March 2007,"There is available in the UK  often in bargain bins  a heavily cut version, though still rated 18, coming in at just under 100 minutes, losing an hour from the ""cinema release"" listed here at 156.That cut version I saw years ago on British television (where it may have had further seconds shaved off). But now, with the wonders of international mail order and multi-region DVD players, I've seen it uncut. How does it compare? First reaction; astonishment that they rescued 98 minutes of material both broadcast-able yet retaining some narrative coherence. The sex and nudity is so pervasive. Even where characters are explaining critical plot developments  as with the young Caligula's talk with Tiberius  there's things going on behind them. And though the sex generally has some point, some of the nudity is hilariously irrelevant. Where increasingly deranged Caligula launches a play-acting invasion on an imaginary Britain, the attacking troops are bafflingly nude (and splendid chaps they all seem to be too, hundreds of them). Earlier in the film, as Caligula makes his way to his audience with Tiberius, we pass a road-mending gang also in the nude. Why? This isn't a matter of prudery, just prudence. I know the Roman Empire was more casual than we are nowadays about health and safety in the workplace, but with all those pickaxes and shards of rock flying around, a little bit of elementary protection for a worker's dangly bits would have been just commonsense.What about the sex? I don't watch porn films as such, but I've got access to the internet and I've seen modern films like Empire of the Senses, Nine Songs, and Baise-moi. I was all ready to adopt a bored indifference. But by the end, I have to admit I was a bit shaken. There's just so much of it, both relentlessly through the film, and simultaneously. It's that last point more than anything that counts. Alright, you can tell I've never been invited to an orgy. But while no single act portrayed represents anything that hasn't been seen on screen before, I wasn't expecting quite so much of it, all in the same room and at the same time. I can't pretend I wasn't impressed.But what was the point of it? Some people here compare it to Pasolini's Salo, and I think that's instructive. I'm not sure Salo is a good film, but its moral and political purpose is clear, which is to chart the corruption of fascism. It achieves its effects by a gradual escalation of depravity reaching a shattering conclusion. Whether successful or not, it certainly disturbs and haunts the imagination. The defence of Caligula, presumably, works similarly; it is a portrayal of decadence and corruption and the political forms accompanying it. But if so, it simply doesn't work; for two reasons, I think.Firstly (a fault it shares with Salo) it is too hermetic, and doesn't explain enough about the social and political background against which this depravity takes place. Secondly, it is just too relentless. For example, towards the end, we see Caligula deliberately insulting and humiliating the senators by prostituting their wives in a specially built state brothel, which is a key event in crystallising the coup against Caligula. But the outrage is unconvincing. The wives themselves don't seem to mind, approaching their duties, largely oral on this occasion, with no more nor less enthusiasm than anything else they've done. ""Oh, come on"", the viewer protests, ""you're all at it all the time anyway; how does this make it any worse?"". And sure enough, the senators on hand seem merely peeved rather than outraged.The film fails too as a personal portrayal of the corruption of Caligula. Here Caligula is corrupt from the outset, despised and suspected by the honourable Nerva, and admiringly described by the dying Tiberius as a ""viper nurtured in the bosom of Rome"". There is no sense of any process of undermining early ideals or even innocence; his behaviour just gradually gets even more and more transgressive. It isn't helped by a performance by Malcolm McDowell (who I've frequently admired elsewhere) that seems to come straight from ""Carry On Caligula"". His humiliation of Proculus and his bride-to-be ought to be seriously disturbing, but instead just comes on like a pantomime villain.Is the film a spectacle (other than as an orgy)? Allegedly it cost some $15 million dollars but one can only imagine that most of that was spent on persuading enormous numbers of extras to ""do it"" on camera. The sets are astonishingly stage-bound, many scenes opening with the same establishing shot with a flat ornate backdrop (niches, marble panels etc.) and the furniture and props laid out left-to-right in front of it. You can almost see the imaginary proscenium arch framing it. Most of the film takes place indoors, yet there is no sense of space or layout in the buildings involved; just a succession of stage sets. When the characters started to enter and leave rooms by ducking behind curtains, I laughed out loud, as I was simply reminded of an Ed Wood spaceship. The outdoor shots fail to open the film out in any way either. The arena of the grisly beheading machine is particularly claustrophobic, bound by the same four-square geometry that ties so many other scenes to the strict dimensions of the screen.Am I glad I saw the full length version? Yes, but then I'm always interested in seeing the extremes of film-making. Is this film successful? No; a monstrous folly. Is it porn? Of course; just because it represents a failed genre  attempting to import porn into mainstream cinema  doesn't mean it isn't porn. Good porn? You'll have to ask the man in the dirty mac; I'd guess only intermittently.But it deserves a few stars just for the sheer bravado of its folly.",Caligula
144,deideiblueeyez,"Not nearly as good as it could have been, but I was entertained",6,18 May 2015,"I watched the 160 minute version, which may have been a mistake on my part (or not?) because it had all of the pornography that wasn't in the original script added to it. If the film had had more direction, if it truly had buckled down and focused on Caligula and simply had the sex as an *element* of the film and not an overall theme --though that may have been difficult as the Romans were more liberal than many at the time, even more so than the neighboring Greeks when it came to sex in some aspects--and while that may paint the background, I do not think it was really necessary to be a part of nearly every single scene. Naked slaves and worker bees I can understand, and of course Caligula's reign did have a very promiscuous color to it, but there were, in my opinion, much more pressing matters that the film only touched upon that could have served as more entertaining. Him naming his horse as senator was obviously a joke and with Malcolm McDowell's wonderful acting you are left guessing how many of his actions are due to mental instability and how many of them are as a means to belittle the system that he rules over.Don't take this the wrong way, readers, but I never thought I would have ever rooted for a brother-sister couple like I did with McDowell's Caligula and Savoy's Drusilla. Their chemistry was beautiful and lovely, their sibling bond plunged into erotic and romantic waters which never ebbed up until the very end. Again, it is very, very weird to me that I *felt* for them during their time on screen and wished them to be happily married (shivers) but somehow McDowell always seems to make the most taboo into a ""Eh, why not? It can't hurt"". I recommend you watch a fairly well-edited version instead of the full 160 minute slog. Too much porn ruined the story telling. Goddamn Guccione. There's no way a film like this could ever be made again with the same Shakespearean seriousness, stifling awkwardness, and on- screen lasciviousness that for the latter may be a good thing in the end.",Caligula

To do that would be to waste time as much as watching this movie is. I laugh at the reviewers who try to analyze this movie like it is anything but porn. Yes, the original idea was brazenly R material that was supposed to be a realistic expose of the life of Caligula. However, the owner of Penthouse put the final product together, and the result is an obvious attempt to make porn more ""mainstream"" by connecting it to big screen actors. I laugh at reviewers defending it when the very actors that starred in it and the writer of the screenplay want nothing to do with it, seeing the final product for what it is- the most expensive porn flick of all time. I had to forward through much of the movie; frankly, I don't know how non-depraved people can actually sit and watch the whole thing. There is a tremendous blow job scene at 2:10.

You don't see many movies that actually stick with the facts instead of making it 'Hollywood.' I reccommend this to people who ""know"" about Caligula in advance so that they know what their seeing instead of going into the film not having a clue what its about. I don't think they could've made the movie any better that relates to Caligula- he was a psychopath and it showed in this movie.

I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie.  John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story.  Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudius.  The climactic (?) assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today.   There are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions.

151,SpitztheGreat,"Certainly Bad, but a step back reveals a missed opportunity",3,27 March 2007,"I'll be real frank and come out and say that this movie is very, very hard to watch. It is certainly one of the more ""disturbing"" (I hate to use that term as it get thrown around lightly around here) films out there as it depicts rape and incest. However the movie, in the end, just is not very good.The story follows the emperor Caligula from his beginnings to his rise to power and then his fall from grace. That's where the easy part ends, nothing else about this movie is clear. The legends behind it are very well known, from Peter O'tool's proclamation that he ""did not know there were hardcore sex scenes being filmed"" despite the fact that he is in said scenes or that the director has disowned the film, nothing about this film lends itself to logic. Scenes are out of order, ideas are half worked out, characters under/over used without reason, dialog that makes no sense or has no context, just real rubbish. If you want an example of poor editing that resembles this movie go watch Vampires vs Zombies.However for all its faults this movie does have some things going for it. Caligula is an obviously interesting character that deserves to be explored in a film. His position of power, how he arrived there, his relationship with his sister, and his eventual death could make for a great movie. Even the sex is not in any way arousing, but rather it fits to the tale of a society gone wrong. Morals and virtue have been thrown out the window in favor of decadence and violence. The fact that Penthouse funded this film should not cause one to think that it is in any way porn.If all of this had come together with editing that had made sense then it could have been a decent film.

152,darth_borehd,The decadence of Rome never looked so good.,9,25 February 2000,"The movie traces the rise and fall of Caligula, the last real emperor of the united Roman Empire; before the military took over the government and instituted a line of puppet rulers.Nothing is held back in showing the moral decay and decadence of the final days of the empire.  Because of this, there are very few people who will not find at least some part of the movie offensive.  While the attempt at realism is admirable, it makes it difficult for some viewers to look past the offense to their personal sensibilities and appreciate the film as a whole.The movie has a lot of big names stars, but strangely it is a relative unknown, Theresa Ann Savoy, as Caligula's sister that provides the best performance.  Malcom McDowell, John Gielguld, and Peter O'Toole present performances that are fine, but far from their best.The film does seem to lack anything resembling a plot.  Instead of a cohesive story, the characters move from one unrelated scene to the next. The movie is more akin to a voyeuristic view into Roman life as it was during this period of time.The sets and the atmosphere, however, are excellent.  ""Caligula"" presents the best vision of the opulence and decadence of Rome since Fellini's Satyricon.  While some viewers have criticised the movie as exaggerating the concept of Roman orgies, one should remember that ""Caligula"" takes place during the fall of Rome, where the power of the Emperor and nobility had reached the epitome of corruption.  The days when Rome was a center of scientific and philosophical advancement had long disappeared by the time Caligula comes to power.  During this time intellectuals and dissidents were slaughtered, the nobility had given up any appearance of proprietary, apathy ran through the citizenry like a plague, the  military assumed more and more power, and celebrations and orgies were held constantly in a vain attempt to stave off rebellion.  Because the strength of the movie is in its ostentatious depiction, I suggest watching the long version (the short version just doesn't convey the intended vision strongly enough).While not everybody can appreciate the movie, I would recommend it to any student of Roman history or afficionado of film techniques.",Caligula

I paid my money at the local ""art"" cinema and walked in without having read any reviews. I made it through less than the first hour. When I felt like I was going to throw up, I walked out. There was not a single redeeming feature in the film. Brilliant actors fell to an unsurpassed low. Photography seemed to have been done while blindfolded. Writing was NAUGHT. Plot was NAUGHT. Music was REALLY NAUGHT. But the worst part was that the scenes of debauchery and sadism were still there, and their purpose was NAUGHT.I am not in any way prudish, but there were scenes in this film that were designed to shock even the most vile sensibilities, and what is the point of that? The purpose of art is to stimulate our lives. That does not mean that all art is going to be happy or beautiful or even understandable. Nevertheless, It should provoke thought and conversation and ultimately contribute to society in some way. I believe that there are dark aspects to each person's life. These dark places exist and need a form of intelligent, thoughtful exploration. We cannot triumph over our own darkness without an awareness that it exists. But this film's sin is that it has no redeeming values. Rather, it seems to dig out the deepest, darkest places in demented amoral behavior and put it on display with a vengeance.

154,Byers,"So bad, even the porn wasn't good",1,21 April 2000,"""Caligula"" is simply not a good movie.  In fact, it's a really bad movie, and that's the God's honest truth.  If it weren't for the pornography, this piece of garbage would have been long forgotten.  As with most bad movies, the problems start with the writing.  The dialogue is corny, the history is poorly told and the transitions from scene to scene feel disjointed and out of place (for the record, I saw the complete and unedited version).  The direction, set design and cinematography are also horrendous.  The cameraman seemed capable of only two views: close, and far.  There was no movement to the camera, as if it were firmly planted on the set.  Speaking of the sets, they were also pretty nasty and poorly done.  Instead of conveying a period feel, they screamed ""we just threw this together in a few minutes"".  The lighting didn't help much, either; it was either way to bright, way to dark or way to red.  Then there were the costumes (or lack thereof).  The Romans did not wear black togas with gold trim; they wore white togas with purple trim.  And there were a few moments where we really didn't need to see nude bodies.  The best example is in the beginning of the movie, where naked slaves are engaged in some kind of road project.  Slaves may not have lived well, but they at least had a tunic or a loincloth.  Finally, the porn scenes.  I'll admit, I was shocked the first time I saw masturbating men and women, group orgies and couples engaged in various acts of intercourse, but I suppose that the intent was to get some shock value, and compared to what's out there this was relatively tame.  Nevertheless, the sex added nothing to the movie, and wasn't exciting or stimulating.  It felt as though it were thrown in simply as a gimmick, a way of attracting movie goers with the allure of a large scale porn movie.  In conclusion, if you're looking for exciting Roman history, or pornography, or a combination of the two, don't look to ""Caligula"".  For Roman history, see ""Spartacus"" or the upcoming ""Gladiator"".  If you want porn, type ""Pamela Lee and Tommy"" into your search engine, or visit an adult video store.  But whatever you do, stay away from ""Caligula""; the movie, in more ways than one, sucks.",Caligula
155,Hebitsukai,Not pornography...but paganography!...,6,5 June 2009,"...these are the words of Bob Guccione as I saw the documentary! It's Paganography alright! Deep inside we all would love to live in total awareness of sex as the Romans did in the past and see it not as sin but as a natural thing! I'm not going to comment much about the movie itself because only by seeing it...you'll understand all the mystique of the gossip surrounding this movie! And I'll explain my vision why:Several pornography companies dedicate all their efforts to make tons of money on tons of movies of the same awful background stories with the same porn ""actresses""! What should they do is to make what Bob Guccione made with this one...take a script...and make the sex part within that script rules! Therefore they actually would be putting in the market something worthwhile to buy and see...other the same sex positions...the same plots...the same bodies...all the same...same...same old news that people actually buy and they make money out of a no good piece of s***!Caligola is a good satire movie about the vicissitudes of Roman empire and it's Senate, using sex and senator's wives to put an end to their power without sacrifice! Don't know if Emperor Caligula actually made senator's wives sell their bodies for 5 gold coins as it states in the movie...but sure hell is a way to criticize the corrupt and vulgar ways that one get to conquer power! Caligula (at least in the movie) only tried to actually made the senate sacrifice themselves for the people...as they never did (and unfortunately never will do)!As for me...I sure liked to see more theatrical paganography in the future! I doubt it ever will happen like this again...but it sure would be awesome to pick up historical figures and make movies of this kind!I gave it a 6 out of 10 for three reasons: Tinto/Vidal's open war actually made a bad influence in the movie!

They really should work as a contribute to that movie and not traveling the ""egotrip"" train so much! Also because I really thought that the movie has a awful editing job (without the Tinto's hand on it, became another product to sell as much as possible with the largest amount of profit)! As it was said by John Steiner (who played Longinus), Bob Guccione made this movie without costing him anything...and got a profit of hundreds of million dollars! And finally the inaccurate historical facts of Caligula!It's a fairly good movie, not for all people (as it shows explicit sex), worth to watch (because of the satire involved)! The DVD set includes some good extras about the movie and characters and some things that went really wrong (as the first choice of Drusilla that was going to be played by Maria Schneider, who states that she said to Tinto that she's not a prostitute, but at the same time she came to Caligola's audition right from making money with ""the butter scene"" of ""Ultimo Tango a Parigi"" and other sex scenes movies that she was involved in!",Caligula

157,djohn2581-1,A big nothing.....,2,30 November 2005,"There's more good drama behind the scenes of CALIGULA than there is on screen. Bob Guccione should have stayed in the background as Executive Producer and let the professional filmmakers and editors do their jobs. He couldn't do that and the end result is a confusing hodge-podge of drama, horror, attempted humor, and well-shot but totally unnecessary pornography.The real story of Caligula is fascinating. He was an inept leader who set new standards of depravity and madness that shocked even the bloodthirsty and jaded Romans. He was probably insane and yet he ruled a mighty empire, if only for a few years. If you want more than a picture of his depravity and mental instability you will have to look elsewhere. May I suggest the very excellent ""I, Claudius"" as a good place to start?If you want history or good drama, look elsewhere. If you want good porn, you won't find it here, either. CALIGULA really has no reason for existence other than as a vanity piece for Bob Guccione.

160,nbubacz,"Caligula, an aberration of an emperor,an aberration of a film",1,9 April 2006,"I'm currently slogging through Gibbon's 'Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I've had all things Roman on my mind. I'm not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan, and Hadrian haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. This brings me to reviewing this film. I'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome,as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period.My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's proponents. I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island ,exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies, the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant, and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into. Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him. His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius. Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common through it's entirety, it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns, in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fancy. The depictions of the violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture beforehand was rote. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, I just don't see it having gone down exactly like that. The death machine, the beheader, is certainly something like you've never seen in movies, and something once seen you shall probably never forget, even as I, you wish you could. The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same, once you've seen this shame it is yours forever. These things strike me the director's and that porn magnate's fantasies. They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record.The acting is pretty good. I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. The film could have done so much better story telling, it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was. For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or shown that he was mad, paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously. It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares.Finally about the sex. It is porn. It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people. Male on male, female on female, male on female. It is passionless, disgusting sex. Sex that if your point is to get off on it, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman. I don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange, depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it.This film should probably never be watched, if your curious about it , let it go. It is something, as I said earlier, if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come. I don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in whole.",Caligula

Great cast, beautifully elaborate sets, and a Gore Vidal screenplay are the parts of the movie that could have made it a classic historical epic.  Instead we get piss-poor directing and cinematography, and Bob Guccione adding mucho gratuitous sex and nudity.  Not that I have any problem with sex, but if I want porn, I'll watch porn.  Malcolm McDowell gives a good, not great, performance, and this is basically the only highlight of the movie. Maybe the R-rated version is better in terms of conciseness and flow, but even the removal of all the hardcore scenes (which add nothing of value, but then again that was the whole point wasn't it?) still only makes this a below average movie.

162,feministafanatico,An interesting idea that has become a colossal disaster !,1,29 October 2019,"The idea of depicting the Roman Empire with all it's sexual excesses would be interesting as long as the film didn't have any taboo. However, this was not the case with this project, which involved many high egos in a fight for creative mastery.First of all, the final editing made by Guccione resulted disastrous, making the film incoherent. The hardcore inserts are out of place, specialy the very long lesbian encounter between Anneka di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner.In the sexual depertment, it's curious to note that the movie omitted many of the practices that still are taboo today, but that were common in the pagan Rome.There are just two very quick glimpse of gay sex, maybe to not shock the majoritary heterosexual audience. I think that a serious depiction of the costumes of the Ancient Rome shouldn't be limited by the taboos present in our society. Being produced by Penthouse Magazine, it's not surprising that the producer have made the film to its readers!Teresa Ann Savoy is very badly dubbed (they should have called her to dub herself). The respectable actors don't get involved in anything sexually explicit, what is a shame, considering that the film sets out to be a mixture of porno and art. How can the depraved emperor not be showed in any explicit scene? All scenes where he is having sex are softcore, obviously because respected actors like Malcolm MsDowell and helen Mirren never would accept to do nothing explicit.

Logical, no? Once, several years before Star Wars, Gore Vidal wrote a screenplay about possibly the most depraved Roman emperor of Ancient times. It's probably safe to say that his mistake was in asking a porn magazine to fund this movie's production. Throw in the involvement of Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione and you have Caligula, one of the most notorious failures of 70s cinema. While it's not quite as vicious as Cannibal Holocaust, it's still excessively exploitative; while Holocaust used real killings, Caligula used real sex - so as to try to boost sales of Penthouse magazine, apparently. So what grabbed my attention for this film so strongly, especially when I initially thought it'd give me nightmares? I mean it's not like it's entirely historically accurate, is it?

And the musical score is recognisable, at least among classical music aficionados.Well, I took one for the team when I went to pick up a copy of the Imperial Edition DVD set. This included the uncut release... which SHOULD warrant an R18 where I live but somehow doesn't... the 1999 ""Rated Version"", misrepresented as the ""Theatrical Version""... and there's the one I chanced at, the Alternative ""Pre-Release"" Edition, a new edit created from an earlier cut which re-arranges a few scenes back into their original context, and most of the explicit sexual inserts added by Guccione are removed, filled in by a handful of 16mm behind-the-scenes footage. So, fair enough, it's not so much of a sex film as it was before. But not even that could save Caligula from being one of the most miserable films I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing.From start to finish this turkey blows (in more ways than one!), and it's not hard to see why: you have three conflicting artistic differences duking it out, and while sometimes it works, it can't really be excused that sometimes you can forget you're watching a film with explicit sex, and then a helping of genitalia brings you back to earth with an unpleasant thump. Not to mention the violence, as well - in one early scene, a soldier has several gallons of wine poured down his gullet, and Tiberius personally pokes a hole in him... just to prove to us that neither the Ancient Romans nor the Modern Writers have limits when it comes to pointless and senseless violence. Still... I guess it's fair game if, historically, Tiberius ordered to have the scales of a fish rub off a victim's face...And as for the explicit porn - how did this get into public cinemas again? It's clear proof that Bob was a sex tycoon who sneaked back onto the set to film a hardcore porno movie for which - though as I recall, most of the acts are legal - the authorities could shut down the set and sentence everyone to jail. It almost happened anyway - in several theatres the movie was shut down and seized by police! I'm just saying that this is the sort of thing that doesn't bear watching if you aren't in the mood. I'm not going to say anything about them, for obvious reasons. Even if I did, perhaps my arguments would be invalid - except for the fact that they replaced some of the more important scenes.This excessive sex and violence aside, the point is this: Caligula in general is a major dud - a long, drawn-out (seriously it drags on well over two hours!!) piece of work of which not one bit is historically accurate, nor assembled in a historically accurate order. If Bob was holding out for artistic freedom, then he'd failed in that respect because really, even ART has standards! Of course, it's not all bad news... Malcolm, Helen, Peter, John and co. did a fairly good job in their acting, and the music, like I said, is a splendid compilation to listen to. The sets aren't bad either, even if they do represent a nightmarish version of Ancient Rome. Also on the Imperial Edition DVD, there are a few deleted scenes which SHOULD have stayed in the film, as they surely would make it less of a disgrace than it is now. A complete and detailed history of the production of the film is also being written by James Ellis Chaffin and Ranjit Sandhu, with research from Thomas Ryerson, called 200 Degrees of Failure: The Unmaking of Caligula, slated for a release sometime this year, or possibly the next. You can find a lot of their research at their site (caligula.ws). I'm sure that the story behind how Gore Vidal's work fell apart would be a much interesting read, and I'm looking forward to it.",Caligula
164,samberdina,The Porn Was Offensive and Distracting,3,24 March 2018,"For those who doubt that Caligula was a pornographic film: a well-known porn site has the entire movie listed among its other pornographic videos. 
Though Caligula was a notorious politician, the graphic sexual scenes splattered throughout this film detract attention from the historical merit of what could have been, whether fact or fiction, the profile of a famous, though notorious, figure. The duties and reactions of Caligula's political circle were even unclear. Fortunately for the cinematic world, the careers of Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and Malcom McDowell seem undamaged by this artistic train wreck. They maintain their strength as acting greats, even though the movie was frightfully lacking in any redeeming qualities.",Caligula
165,micke83fi,"Fascinating ingredients, but cinematographically mediocre",7,25 December 2005,"People tend to understand this movie entirely wrong. It is definitely not just porn.The story of the Roman emperor Caligula has it all. Love, sex, paranoia, treachery and fear in a morally quite different landscape. I don't think that a pornographic approach is wrong at all when studying a Roman emperor. Our moral barriers are a creation of our own culture and Christian heritage. People might be discussed by the explicit sex scenes, but what are these scenes compared to the facts that these people could murder their own parents, brothers, sisters and even children? In such circumstances perverted orgies seem quite acceptable and realistic to me.Acting is fair and the choice of music is great (Khachaturyan and Prokofiev). The historical surroundings are adequate, but the camera work is terrible. Some scenes also obviously attempt to shock you at the cost of historical credibility. Even if the overall picture of the movie is positive, you easily start to fantasize what an unforgettable masterpiece you could made using such dramatic ingredients. Ancient Rome is such a fascinating subject, especially from a moral perspective. Some day they'll maybe make a movie of emperor Nero, in which the characters talk Latin and the city of Rome is recreated with computer graphics. The more realistic the would try to make it, the more shocking it would be. Or why not use renaissance Italy? They could be quite cynical too.I don't regret buying this film at all. The first and last ten minutes of this film are great. The way to approach the movie is also far more correct than the melodramas of the 50s and the 60s. Give it a chance.",Caligula

I'm a history major needless to say, and unless something is pretty much dead on accurate, then it makes my face hurt and I bore everyone around me into a stupor due to that fact that I have to point every flaw out individually. Gladiator? Garbage! That movie was pure FILTH compared to Caligula. Malcolm McDowall gives probably his best performance ever as the eccentric, narcissitic, and downright crazy emperor Caligula. Every time I read a history text dealing with Caligula or his uncle Tiberius I picture Malcolm. He's just that good in this movie, he's completely insane and creepy. What's funny is the fact that this was supposed to be a ""porno"" and it isn't. Nothing in this film is masturbation worthy, as it is too...gritty and creepy. It makes me itch all over. The first time I saw this film, I borrowed it from a friend on dvd (unedited of course) and my girlfriend and I watched it. Needless to say, we were amazed, and she needed to turn it off at the um....""Glory of Rome"" scene in the kitchen. This from the girl who owns every ""Faces of Death"" and ""Mondo Caine"" ever made, not to mention the Ilsa series of movies!

But after some time he became insane and he did some unrighteous deeds. But this movie is too exaggerative. Excessive insist on sex (which most of them were not based on truth) harmed the drama and lowered it to a B-movie, in spite of famous actors. For me, it was a waste of time. I don't recommend it to anyone. But be careful! The sex scenes are really done and explicitly shown. Porn offenders must not watch this. Instead they can watch the R-rated 90-min version and you miss nothing, because sexual scenes have nothing to do with the main plot.",Caligula

There is a tremendous cast and great performances by Malcolm Macdowel, Helen Mirren, etc side by side with a porn flick, with close ups of vaginas and penises and lousy porn actresses! I am not exactly shocked about the nudity, explicit sex, orgies, that is all part of the story. That's how roman emperors lived according to historical records. What's wrong is that there is no fluidity in the way the images are shown. OK, I am finding the plot interesting, but then all of the sudden, there's a vagina. What am I suppose to do with that? Get aroused? I get distracted from the plot right? On the other hand, I am jerking off like nuts with the sex images, but then, all of the sudden here comes John Gielgud with one of his speeches, what a turn off!!! It looks like there were two different people directing this. Could have been a great flick if they showed it realistically, but they completely screwed up. Total mess!",Caligula
170,fromwithin,Beyond the controversy lies a good film,7,6 February 2000,"This film, as with all, has good points and bad points.In general, I feel that the good ones far outweigh the bad.The film simply gives the story of the rise and death of Emperor Caligula in a very straight-forward manner. Indeed, it can be seen as shocking, but I think that this is a side-effect of it's desire to be realistic, rather than a deliberate act on the part of the film-makers.The cinematography and camera work is awful. The huge sets seem at times almost claustrophobic which is an absolute crime considering the magnificence of them. There is also too much emphasis on Caligula himself, to the detriment of revealing some important traits in other characters, making them seem somewhat shallow at times.The sex scenes are very well placed within the context of the film. I thought that only two scenes stood out as being unnecessarily overt, but for the most part, the explicitness is on the fringe of the focus of each scene, while also playing a major part in the atmosphere.Never once did I feel that any dialogue was out of place, nor did the acting strike me as being bad.By far the biggest problem with this film is the fact that the sexual content is widely advertised and therefore anticipated before viewing. This may cause people to focus dominantly on those scenes without really looking at the film as a whole. For me, it enhanced the film. Not in a particularly titillating way, but in the fact that there was no compromise during scenes of sexual acts. Roman orgies are regarded to have been extremely opulent and promiscuous - I found it refreshing to see one as it may have actually been rather than lots of fully-clothed laughing fat men pouring red wine over their faces and eating grapes while draped with female automatons.In summary, Caligula definitely has it's place in film history due to it's controversy, but if you look beyond that controversy, you should find a rather good film which neatly tells the story of how power can turn someone into a madman.",Caligula

Both have in essence the right to exist. I am speaking of course of the high budget, main audience, majorfeature film; in the likes of 90% of the movies we regularly see...And of the, low-budget, mass-produced, pornographic flics of theanonymous masses. --  I have NEVER seen a film in which these two were united; untilthis ONE exceptional movie.Let there be no doubt about it: This is one hell of an EXPLICITmovie.

What it is is a no-holds-barred-in-your-face-boot-to-the-head glimpse at the Roman empire during the rule of the most infamous Caesar in history. Most of the negative comments I've read deal with the movie's excessive violence and sexual depravity, and certainly there are mass amounts of both. But that's what the movie is about.You think it was too violent, too disgusting? It's gratuitous sex and sadistic violence made you sick to your stomach? That was exactly the point. Caligula is no fairy tale story of the glory of Rome. It is an examination of the debauchery that pervaded everyday life. Many condemn Bob Guccione for turning the film into a cornucopia of sex and violence. I believe that someone like Guccione *had* to be involved. To use a more reserved filmmaker would lessen the impact, and therefore cheapen the message.Caligula is not for everyone. If you are disturbed by strong visual images, then steer clear.

I suppose it has to do with the person watching the film.I also have to give Malcom McDowell a round of applause.  He is truly one of the most under-rated actors of the 20th century.

176,ridge-m-1,A Misunderstood Classic,8,10 March 2020,"Movie-goers tend to have strong, divergent thoughts and feelings regarding this misunderstood classic that its own producer tried to destroy. First and foremost, ""Caligula"" is actually a film shot by the famous Italian director Tinto Brass from a screenplay by Gore Vidal interspersed with Bob Guccione inspired mostly softcore adult movie scenes using his ""Penthouse"" Pets. The vast majority of the adult movie is superfluous and detracts immensely from what Brass had envisioned. So much so that upon completion of the project, Brass renounced the film and did his best to separate himself from the picture entirely which is unfortunate since it was he and his crew which makes the film a classic.The plot is simple, the rise and fall of the Roman ruler Gaius Caesar nicknamed ""Caligula"" (Little Boots) by his father's soldiers. Oh but what a tale of depravity and wickedness when a mere mortal has been provided with the powers of a God. The role seems tailor made for Malcolm McDowell and he does not disappoint with a much nuanced performance as he increasingly sinks into complete madness.Only known in the U.S. for her appearance in this film is the English born Italian actress Teresa Ann Savoy at the very height of her bewitching green-eyed beauty and appeal. As a 16 year old she ran away to an Italian commune and was discovered by a fashion photographer. Eventually she made it to the silver screen and is known for the Tinto Brass directed ""Salon Kitty"" and ""Private Vices, Public Pleasures"" directed by Miklos Jancso, both available on Blu-ray in the States. She plays Drusilla, the beloved sister of Caligula. Although she cannot be described as a good person by today's standards she is instrumental in providing moving pathos in an incredible scene involving McDowell and herself. Perhaps the surest way to judge her performance is that the famous English actress Lady Helen Mirren also co-stars as a prostitute. Whenever the two actresses appear in the same scene, one cannot take their eyes off Miss Savoy. She had that special sort of charisma that only true starlets possess.In a rather small but important role the great Peter O'Toole gives an appropriately over-the-top performance as the hideous looking Tiberius. Caligula is his adopted grandson. O'Toole gives a bravura rendition of the character cementing the brilliance of the A-list cast. In an even smaller role, Sir John Gielgud as Nerva, Tiberius' trusted advisor, provides an element of class and sanity in this otherwise totally hedonistic representation of the Roman plutocracy.No review would be complete without commenting on the original score provided by Paul Clemente and the art direction of Danilo Donati. Throughout the film, the music augments and dramatizes the on screen activities. There is a special piece that is played intermittently throughout the film which is achingly beautiful. This critic has dubbed it ""Drusilla's Theme"". It is played at the very beginning of the film during the idyllic scene of romance and incestuous love.The sets, though not gargantuan, are completely believable when considering the lifestyle these characters engaged in.The luxury experienced by Caligula and Drusilla is portrayed with dramatic effect. The complete degeneracy is also visually attested to by the sheer imagination and authentic look of the set pieces.Unfortunately, the film has only been available on Blu-ray in the States for the last several years on a pressing called ""Caligula the Imperial Edition"" from ""Image Entertainment"" and released in 2009. The BD contains bad video and bad audio. Fortunately, for us aficionados of the picture, ""Arrow"" in the UK to the rescue. They released a Limited Edition in 2010 followed with a release still available today from 2012 that features gorgeous video and high fidelity audio. The great news is that these releases are Region Free. The ""Arrow"" pressing is likely to remain the definitive pressing of the picture.Hopefully, this review will prepare one to properly enjoy this maligned gem.",Caligula

I saw the r-rated VHS version and it stunk, and now, I dumbly rented the ""unrated"" DVD and it was, I believe very much longer, but stunk just as much. I thought perhaps over a quarter century, I would have grown to appreciate this film more. I do not. Please understand that I have nothing against sex on screen, or nudity on screen or just about anything else on screen, as long as it all comes together and makes a good film. This film is not a good film. It is a real, first class stinkeroo. If I had to pick one film to show to a class (an adult class) as an example of how to make a terrible film, this would be it. I wonder, did John Gielgud or Peter O'Toole ever publish any comments on this film? It would be interesting, I think, to hear their comments. If you have a chance to rent this film, rent the R-rated version, because I think (at least if memory serves me) that it is mercifully, shorter.If you want to watch a low budget film along similar lines, that is not quite as bad as this one, (but still very bad indeed) you might try the less awful ""Warrior Queen"", which is also, mercifully, shorter. It has lots of nudity and death, but no Gielguds or O'Tooles to waste in its making. They claim that ""Caligula"" is historically accurate.

This is, without a doubt, the most malignant and repulsive film i've ever seen; a sadistic blend of hardcore pornography -both straight and gay- and extreme violence. It's really a visual attack, and the only thing I find ironic is that highly respected actors like O'Toole and Gielgud accepted to have a role in this monstrosity. This film has nothing: no plot, no story, nor good acting; it's just a series of vignettes showing the most shocking images you could ever imagine.

179,atomic-cocktail-ent,Cinematic Car Wreck,6,23 April 2016,"Early this morning I started watching one of the most notorious cult films ever made, Caligula (1979). The full uncut version is available on YouTube (without an 18 and over warning! Kids, do NOT watch this! Seriously!!!). I saw the first half hour of it, tried to go to sleep afterward, and I couldn't (it disturbed me that much). Then I finally went to sleep and resumed the rest of the film when I woke up. It is disturbingly pornographic and violent, and shows the basest of human nature. The back story behind the film is even more interesting than the film itself since it had a lot of big names and blurred the line between mainstream and adult. The 70s were a time of experimentation, but this went way beyond that and it is truly decadent and over the top, showing the licentiousness and depravity of Imperial Rome. There are gruesome things in it that will turn your stomach and wall to wall sex that was thrown in without the actors' knowledge after principal photography was completed. So many of the people involved disavowed this film because it devolved into a different kind of animal than what the screenwriter (Gore Vidal, of all people) envisioned. It's like a car wreck, so horrible, but at the same time, you can't help but crane your neck to look at it. It was done with a lot of style, impressive sets and costumes, and even had a bit of dark humor. It is a fascinating yet bizarre and shocking picture, one of the darkest I've ever seen, despite it being a big uneven mess. The only good people in the film get killed off and the rest are so corrupt and evil. However, you have to consider the time it was made and the time period that it depicts. In a way I have to admire the balls of the filmmakers. Very few filmmakers today take those kinds of risks, to shatter taboos, and dare to show the ugliness of humanity. It is mainly cult filmmakers that make midnight movies such as these that do.I draw the line at this film. It's one of those that you see once and once is enough.

181,MermanSam,"Beyond Taste and Decency, Beyond Even Entertainment Value",1,27 June 2005,"I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like ""sin"" and ""depravity"" used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not.

Those scenes had no business being in that film and A-list English actors Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole would never have agreed to participate if they knew what was going to happen. Besides those trashy scenes, which warrant the fast forward button, the film just isn't good at all. Malcolm McDowell does show a strong effort in his performance, but that is not enough to save it.

After running the might empire into the ground, a conspiracy conspires against him and he is assasinated (along with his family). Another page in Roman history is turned. I feel it's ""king of bad cinema"" reputation is highly overrated and incorrect. Is it revolutionary in idea? Not really. Is it the worst film I've ever seen? No way. This type of period piece has been done many times before. The 'power corrupts' story and the 'decadent portrait of the pagan Romans' theme is pretty much a universal theme in the sword and sandal epics of American Cinema (see Ben Hur,Gladiator,etc.) But the Excesses of Rome were never quite as in your face as they are here. Although many would disagree, I feel I can take this film's plot line somewhat seriously. It has a story-structure in which I must admit, does grow dimmer by the end of the film, but has wonderful actors, all giving a very serious and credible performance. It appears to have a budget, with gigantic sets, hundreds of extras (mostly Italian I believe)and it has a heart, of sorts, in the caligula character, and his control over Rome and it's plight. This alone is more than most Arnold Schwartzenegger(sp?) movies have, but nobody seems to spend a lot of time bashing these flicks. Although Caligula the character, is despicable, and does some pretty terrible things, I felt as though, in the film, he was only the product of the society that gave him that position. Malcom Mcdowell(sp?) portrays an eagerness, to his soon coming of power, at the beginning of the film and then lets his grasp on reality immediately start slipping when he takes the throne. I enjoyed seeing the softer side of Caligula at the beginning (when he is shown frolicking in the forest with his lover).Much of what you heard about the sex in this movie is true. The sex is real and all of it seems to be shot as though the director (Bob G.)wasn't even aware of censorship laws. In terms of intensity, you won't find anything here that you didn't see in ""In the Realm of the Senses"", in which many, including myself, deem as an artistic classic. For those of you who haven't seen that film, this means real penetration, real mouth to genital contact etc. In terms of content, I saw a lot of shots that by themselves, look like they were shot by someone who deals in the business of sex (and fetishisms; the urination scene for instance). Personally I did not even really feel the excess of sex scenes in the film until the final orgy scene, where I admit, it did seem slightly gratuitus. Sometimes I felt the director was trying to use the sex scenes as metaphors for the story line as we realized the full excesses of Caligula's corrupted reign. And that we the viewer were also indulging in Rome's excesses with Caligula, and we were supposed to feel uncomfortable about that. There seems to be myths about the film that go unchallenged; First, there is no 210 min. print in commercial existence. Only the ""unrated cut"" (which is the one I have seen), and the ""R"" rated cut. Second, contrary to many user-posts on IMDb, there are no scenes of bestiality (although he's uncomfortably fond of his horse), there are no scenes of pedophilia (child-sex)(although there is a verbal reference to it in the line: ""do you like little boys?"" ""No, big boys-my soldiers"")and there are NO scenes of necrophilia (although it is perhaps suggested with Drusilla). All in all, Caligula's flaw seems to be excess, and a lack of control over something that was too big for anyone to hang onto. But then again, that could be said of the Roman Empire... And whether the film is historically accurate or not, there certainly were rulers of ancient Rome who were capable of this kind of behavior and probably did act this way. Not for the squeamish, but for those who are used to contemporary sex and violence, give it a shot. Also check out ""Queen Margot"" for another view of a different corrupted empire.",Caligula
186,aglasse,"A classic story told with no holds barred, history revealed.",8,2 March 2001,"Caligula is a very neat movie from many points. First, that someone like the people from Penthouse really being interested in history, and this film is very historically accurate. As well having big name actors baring thier souls and bodies for a film like this. Also, sex seems to be a point that other reveiwers bring up, but in this film the sex is actually dirty and not a turn on. Even in the graphic lesbian scene, while the girls enjoy each other, the music is actually very sombre and dark. This is not a hard core sex flick, and I hate it being described that way. There is excellent acting, a good story, and great sets. It's a little dated from 1980, but still holds up well 20 years later. It's also obvious that the actors loved what they were doing, and believed in the over all project. This was a labour of love, and a very important movie. Hats off to all involved in this movie, I'm glad you all had the guts to make it, and put your reputations on the line.

I have to admit that some porn scenes don't really fit in the movie very well and they are needless. If you just ignore that, you'll find an average and in one way very interesting movie.
It's unusual to make this kind of movies of Rome and I have already seen enough great hero and happy end movies of Roman Emperors etc. The story itself is quite good and the actors do their job ok. Malcom McDowell really looks like mad.This movie is already some kind of a legend and I recommend it to all people who want to see a different movie. Of course if you think seeing blood is disgusting this one isn't for you. I thought giving a 6 to this but ignoring those useless porn scenes it's a 7. I have only seen the longer ""original"" version so it might have been interesting to see the short version too.

I look at Caligula as a blowout-budget b-movie. It allows me to laugh at the effluvia on the screen while simultaneously looking at boobies, and heaven forbid, actual copulation (depending on the version).

189,Snoggett,Caligula - misunderstood classic or porno travesty?,10,16 September 2003,"`I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula I am all men as I am no man, and so - I am a God!'
Bob Guccione's Penthouse International invested 17.5 million dollars into the production of Caligula, and in doing so created one of the wildest exploitation films ever made.The film, which chronicles the terrifying reign of the tyrant Gaius Caligula Caesar, Rome's fourth and most notorious emperor, who ruled from A.D. 37 to A.D. 41, took eleven months to film and attracted a multitude of talented artists into its creative team. These included renowned novelist, essayist, playwright and historian Gore Vidal, who wrote the initial screenplay the final film was based on, and Danilo Donati, four time Academy award winning designer, and frequent Fellini collaborator, who created the lavish sets, 64 all up, and costumes. The Emperor himself had 26 costume changes alone. 3,592 costumes in all were created. Actors of the calibre and stature of Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole flew to Rome for what promised to be one hell of an experience, and it proved to be just that.Ever since its release in 1979 Caligula has been resoundly lambasted by not only the critics but by most of the participants in the production. It is well known that the production of the film degenerated into a huge slagging match between the main talents and the money men and that the director, Tinto Brass, was removed from the production after he had edited the first twenty minutes of the film. The rest of the film was edited by Guccione and a freelance editor, and if you look at the film from the moment when dawn arrives and all the freaks awake in Tiberius' grotto, they had no idea what they were doing. They probably even used the wrong takes most of the time. The blame for the films failure has been placed mainly at the feet of Brass. Brass reportedly used three to five cameras all rolling at the same time to capture the action. This was one of the reasons used by Penthouse to fire him. They claimed that he wasted film shooting this way. Yet, if you look at the first twenty minutes the film is a sharply edited piece of work, excluding the opening sequence in the forest, which is pretty dire, and which probably was never shot to open the film anyway. It's a shame Brass wasn't left in control, as I believe he would have produced an intelligent movie. Sure, it wasn't going to be the erotic/todger pulling classic Guccione wanted, but who cares. One of the really bad aspects of the film are the stupid porno inserts featuring the pets. I believe Brass was on his way to creating a masterpiece, well, maybe not, but certainly a film of much merit. Piernico Solinas, author of The Ultimate Porno: The Making of a sex Colossal, certainly believed this to be true. It would be interesting to see the film totally re-edited from start to finish again. There is certainly a lot of footage that was shot that never ended up in the final cut.
Caligula is an easy film to knock. People don't like it because of its frankness. People claim it is badly acted. People claim it is badly written. People claim it is badly photographed. People claim it is just bad. Well they are wrong. What it is is a prime example of how to ruin a film in the editing stage. Anyone claiming it to be badly photographed need look no further than the Dutch Filmworks release of it on DVD. This is a beautiful, not completely blemish free, print that shows just how well filmed Caligula was. It is far superior to the Penthouse DVD. Sure, Caligula is not a perfect film, and sure it is in your face filmmaking, but at least the filmmakers had the guts to make something different, something challenging. What went wrong with Caligula was that there were too many chiefs. What Caligula was was a brave and interesting experiment that didn't quite come off. Caligula could have been powerful, intelligent and stunning. Instead, it is one of the best exploitation films ever made. And, anyway, who could hate a movie that has a giant head lopping machine in it.",Caligula
190,talkinhorse,The Worst Film Ever Made,1,15 January 2007,"Let me clarify that. This is the worst film ever made that isn't in the category of being so bad it's good. It falls into the class of execrable films that you don't want to see. Trust me on this, or you'll be very sorry later.I saw ""Caligula"" in its theatrical release in 1979. Coming off the high of the superb BBC mini-series, ""I, Claudius"", I thought ""Caligula"" might be in the same spirit. What a horrific mistake! ""Caligula"" was entirely lacking in dramatic merit. There's no dramatic progress, there's no lesson, there are no surprises, there's nothing except base depravity in scene after scene after scene. And the scenes that aren't disgusting are boring. The titular Caligula is a reptile at the beginning, and he's the identical reptile at the end. He lives, he stinks, he dies. The end.I'll close by noting that, as far as I know, this is the only film the erudite Roger Ebert summed up by invoking the word ""sh**"". You can find his review by searching at his website, RogerEbert dot com.",Caligula
191,rosanna_rosannadanna,Adultery wasn't exactly punishable by death,3,15 August 2006,"In the review on the main page, it is noted that, ""adultery was an offense punishable by death."" This is mainly misleading, but also wrong.Adultery really was an offense punishable by death but certain conditions needed to be met. First, though not a condition, was that adultery was an argument by a citizen used as a defense of murder, not to bring someone to trial. The most important condition that was that adultery was defined as sexual relations between a married woman and a man not her husband. The marriage had to be recognized by the state, which required citizenship. Women were rarely granted full citizenship, almost never to any woman born outside the highest levels of the nobility. Finally (not actually finally but enough to make the point) full citizenship was pretty uncommon in ancient Rome--Rome is estimated to have had at it's height a population of over 1 million people (around 450,000 by some estimates) but no more than 60,000 citizens (by any estimate). Foreigners and slaves had no citizenship, and residents of allied cities could be granted various rights below full citizenship with marriages that weren't always recognized.So, you might ask, what does all this mean? Adulterers weren't put to trial, they were killed on the spot, which provided both vengeance to the one whose rights were violated (the spouse of the adulterer) and proof of the crime. It was nearly impossible for women to charge for adultery since they were granted full citizenship so rarely. It was almost as difficult for male Roman citizens to be charged with adultery since no more than 60,000 of 600,000 women in Rome could be married to Roman citizens (military service and a frequent state of war created a tremendous imbalance in population balance between the sexes, and while the 60,000 is a fair estimate, the 600,000 could be quite low). Last (again not last, just the same as above) is that there was a massive women's population available for the act of adultery where the crime didn't apply.If you were a female in Rome the crime only mattered to you, except in rare cases, if you married to a citizen and you were guilty of the crime. If you were a male and noble-born, it was a defense for the murder of your wife and her lover, except in rare cases. If you were male and not noble-born, it was a crime that you could be involved in and for which you would be killed on the spot (again, except in rare cases).It's more accurate to say that 'adultery was an offense against noble-born males which gave them an excuse to kill their wives and lovers.'Oh yeah-the only reason to watch Caligula is to see what all the fuss was about. Without the fuss it would have been forgotten long ago.",Caligula
192,Paladinlover,Interesting to watch once.,4,22 December 2008,"Caligula was, without question, one of the single most insane emperors (along with Nero and Commodus) to have ever ruled the Roman Empire. This movie, at it's heart, intends to capture the full extent of his insanity and just how much debauchery, sexual deviancy, and all round nuttiness of his brief, yet notable reign.The good sides to this film that is it's setting, costume, and realism in a lot of situations. But on the down side, there ARE a lot of historic errors. For example, in some cases they show Caligula's insanity as it was, but in others they seem far off the mark. The real Caligula didn't start out a complete nutjob, and during the first two years of his reign, he was actually quite popular, having removed a lot of unpopular laws that were set up by Tiberius, and people described him as a noble and good ruler... but it was in the last two years (he only ruled four years total) is when all the crazy stuff started to happen in the film.For one thing, Macro was not executed by having his head chopped off in a dramatic manner (as cool as it looked), he committed suicide. Caligula's famous 'I wish all Rome had just one neck' quote resulted from when he got ticked off by the complaining of the people when he couldn't constantly outperform his performance at showing off chariot and gladiator games every single day, not a random thing he said after having a lot of people put to death. Also Caligula really did try to conquer Britain (though his successor was the one who fully pulled it off), and annexed Mauritania. The battle shown of him attacking a river to simulate an invasion of Britain was really simply an act of 'revenge' against Neptune (he once built a giant 'bridge' from Italy to Sicily that was made in faux city style with fake taverns and such, and it was destroyed by a hurricane, so Caligula swore revenge against Neptune). And finally, the password he spoke to Cassius Chaerea before being killed by him was not 'scrotum', some sources say it was 'old man's petticoat' or such. During his final days, Caligula gave stupid and humiliating words to be used as passwords such as 'kiss me soldier' and the like.I understand the intention of the filmmakers to really show off his insanity by exaggerating some of the issues involved. Overall, the film was not really that much of movie. It's no epic, and definitely not a documentary. The story really wasn't all too captivating, the characters aren't spectacularly done, and other than seeing the costumes, architecture, and other interesting and thought provoking sets and concepts being put up (not to mention the fact that they didn't hide the Roman's pro-homosexual/bisexual tendencies or even tone them down. Points for that!), this movie has no real redeeming factor other than seeing the depravity of some of Ancient Rome's most insane and whacked out emperors.",Caligula
193,MENTOR-3,Porn for Thought..,7,22 September 1998,"What is power if man must give up his soul to acquire it?What would you do if you had control over an entire Roman empire?This movie asks just these question and even more so shows you what did happen at the extreme when a man named Caligula loses his soul to power. With a trilogy of orgies and foul and strange bizzare incest that Caligula shows one tends to ask why? Caligula does not glamorize any of the foul things it displays but simply puts them there for you to see and make your own decision.  Perhaps it's a moral story?  Perhaps it's porn for thought?The acting is very good for both Peter O'Toole who plays Tiberious and Malcom Mcdowell who plays Caligula.  If you liked Mcdowell in ""A Clockwork Orange"" you will definitely enjoy this movie.  Something about Mcdowell playing crazed lunatics that makes his movies he is in all the more interesting.So let the kiddies go to bed and rent this with a close friend or with your husband or wife.  If any of you are squirmish.  I would recommend not watching this film.  Watch Caligula with an open mind and I promise you will not be disappointed.

196,diurnalemissions,Must have something.....,5,28 November 2007,"How many movies with a rating of 4.7, from nearly 30 years ago, have such robust commentary and message boarding? Right there the movie's got something very few, if any, movies have.I saw it (the uncut version) for the first time last night, and it's not that bad. Of course Guccione did some mangling of the continuity, but really, who watches it for continuity? And I'm not just talking about the nasty bits, it's just surreal all around. Now setting aside debates of just how promiscuous ancient Rome would have been, it certainly captures realistically how it would have been if those who decry the times as decadent were right. IF there were huge orgies taking place, wouldn't they looked mostly like it was portrayed in the film? Granted it was staged, and true reality likely would have had much more awkwardness and less grace in the execution, it stands that various thrustings and what not would have been the order of the day.I have not seen any of the commentary included with the disks, so perhaps some of the conjectures I have are answered, but one has to wonder if those who ultimately distanced themselves from the film felt that they had to in order to stay respectable (and employable). One also would like to know if Guccione was simply trying to be a peddler of his wares or was he REALLY trying to make an artistic statement and wasn't going to let ""the suits"" detract him from his goal. Who could really know, even with commentary. Did Guccione ruin an artistic creation to make it high class porn, or did he really have a unique vision and dared to do what no one else would dare? Regardless, the output it singular, and that in itself goes a long way toward making art Art.IF Rome was like this and not just some revisionists puritan views of the time as a cautionary tale for their modern era, this is how I imagine it looked and sounded. It's like you are there, and if groups of people were getting busy, this is how you'd expect it to look. As someone else commented, it was much more realistic than what safely filmed ""depravity"" looked like in films up to that point.Also, one would need to put the movie in a modern context too. The movie came out well before the internet became fixed in most people's lives. One can surf the net and pretty much see whatever they want in a minute's time (to a point where it quickly becomes dull). The hardcore elements of the movie are therefore much less shocking to modern sensibilities. Softcore sexuality permeates the airwaves every day. Anything hardcore is available at the snap of the fingers on the internet. Seeing such scenes in a modern, and the relatively near future, seem almost TAME and have more artistic merit than the average smut out on the internet. I can see a time in the not too distant future, as the younger set become the middle age set, and barriers fall, that the uncut version will be broadcasted. People are simply becoming much less inhibited and the paradigms will shift enough where the uncut version will not be seen as horrific.In the end, I can see that many of the name people involved had some rarefied sensibility about what the movie should be. Meanwhile Guccione made an earthier epic that sucks the viewer in (no pun intended) versus previous Historical Epics that have great costumes and blowing horns and big sets and clattering horses etc etc, that are staged and bereft realism of any kind. This was a unique experience without a doubt. The viewer had a human's eye view of antiquity versus the bird's eye view common to most movies.I gave it a 5 simply so as not to skew the existing rating.",Caligula
197,westhead-t,Malcolm McDowell is breathtaking!!!!!!,10,10 March 2005,"I was eager to see this film because I am a huge fan of Malcolm McDowell(even though I have seen very little of his work) and I saw some positive reviews on his performance. I first became familiar with his work when I saw A Clockwork Orange and after seeing him in that film I immediately rated him 3rd in my all time favourite movie stars. I then saw him in Cyborg 3 which was disappointing but his short appearance was legendary acting. Very recently I have seen Caligula and McDowells performance touched me. Usually my top 2 favourite actors were Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro but after seeing McDowells performance in this film I have to say in my opinion he puts them both to shame.Caligula is about a prince (who has the same name as the title of the film)who's grandfather is the lord of the world, Caligula then sees the opportunity to take it all away from the King and he does not let the opportunity pass. Caligula becomes a man of true power and this power turns him into someone evil! with outstanding performances from not only McDowell but also from Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren Caligula is a great experience.If you ARE AGAINST STRONG Violence AND STRONG SEXUAL PREFRENCES THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU, but if you don't mind all that and you are a fan of Malcolm McDowell then you must see this movie!!!!!!!!!!",Caligula
198,aaronmhardy,"A surreal and entertaining oddity, far from bad but could have been so much better.",7,12 August 2018,"You could certainly argue that Caligula (1979) is effectively a shallow piece of pornography with a large budget and extensive script, and indeed the dwelling on graphic sex and nudity does cheapen the filmmaking somewhat. However, to my surprise, Caligula turned out to be a compelling and highly entertaining character study set among the ridiculous excess of the early Roman Empire. Malcom McDowell is excellent as Gaius Caligula, he is prone to overacting at points but overall is performance is hypnotic and oddly charming. The rest of the cast are also great, Peter O'Tool for example is excellent as Tiberius. The photography and set design is incredibly impressive and adds a sense of surreal beauty to what could be described as an otherwise ugly film. Indeed the film does not shy away from the grusome cruelty that characterised the emperor's reign, but this works to its advantage, along with the numerous orgies, the inclusion of bloody violence makes this film an unflinching and mostly realistic portrayal of the aristocracy of ancient Rome.The issues here come mainly from a confused script. The writing leaps from mature historical epic to cheap 70s exploitation on a whim and as such the film is tonally confused. The dialogue also varies from adequate to quite compelling to downright terrible. Also the insertion of hardcore sex scenes often distracts from the story and it oftentimes dictates the story, situations are created just so that more nudity can be thrown in. Overall, there is certainly an impressive historical film in here somewhere, perhaps with a stronger script and less of a focus on sex it could have been a masterpieces. Alas, as it stands Caligula remains an oddity, I found in throughly entertaining and it survives a lengthy runtime without ever becoming dull, it has a great cast and looks and sounds fantastic, however it feels like a piece is missing or maybe there are too many pieces already in place.",Caligula

Anyway it is not a home made made porno video, but simply represents what has been happening in 37 - 41 years after Jesus Christ, what should be accepted without freaking out.Generally it has very great acting, costumes and music, only may be the direction and camera is shitty, cause the director is a porno master, and the movie should was too much pornoficated when it should have been remembered as one of the greatest dram in the history of cinema.",Caligula

When this is the case, then I'm left with a couple of basic thoughts: if this is to be about Caligula and I leave this film with no better insight into his nature as a ruler or the atmosphere he functioned in, then it doesn't function as drama. Secondly, if I were to sit the multitude of graphic sex scenes only to be repelled and mystified by their presence in the film, then it barely functions as good porn.In short, CALIGULA has provided me with two and one-half hours of cinema (if you wish to call it that) that I would never wish on anyone.",Caligula

Upon reflection I see I was wrong - its eminently worthy of contempt, if only to inform would-be viewers. I should point out that I can't help but compare it with the superb ""I, Claudius"" TV series and, also, I tend to see things in black or white, so if you want an objective review of this film you are advised to go elsewhere please.Well I don't quite know where to...this movie is historically inaccurate for starters, which wouldn't be so bad if the dramatisation wasn't so poor. The script is woeful. No wonder Gore Vidal dropped it like a rather molten kartoffel. The storyline is difficult to follow; if I weren't already fairly well acquainted with the events portrayed I'd be left with the impression that ancient Rome was to be viewed (on cut-rate pyschadelics) as some sort of palacial brothel peopled by thespians with pretensions to meglomania, fawned upon by a wearying succession of mincing yet determined dung-beetles and, surprisingly (well) fed, harlots. Well it was at times I guess but surely never with such a crude...limpness.The acting is hammy in the worst sense as if somehow it were being earnestly, even courageously, performed by a mental asylum's (oh so) amateur players. Caligula in particular, butchered by Malcolm MacDowell, flits about like a seasoned ponce presenting a tense spasticism where gravitas would be more appropriate and an impish schoolgirl facade in favour of genuine levity. John Hurt's portrayal (in I, Claudius) shows what a well-directed genius can do with such a character. Alas its no wonder the late lamented Sir(?)John Guilgud expressed a keen regret in having an, albeit truncated, association with this movie.I s'pose for forms sake I should mention the 'notorious' sex scenes. Well got that out of the way...At the end of the proverbial this movies' one success can be drawn from its similarity to its subject - all that wealth and talent in the hands of a select few...gormless shagnasties.

206,malamaryes,unimaginably awful,1,29 June 2006,"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.You've been warned",Caligula

Then, the anachronic items we can take from the film: If you're fair, you don't have place in Rome, which is to say ""in the world"" (Proculus).Please, try to get that the hard-core scenes and the grotesque argument is just the world we're in.

210,commerce-29,"Cheap Imitation, Cheap Porn",2,7 September 2006,"This film was made on the heels of BBC's ""I Claudius"" which featured the life and reign of the emperor Caligula. It is a historically rich and frightening tale. John Hurt's Caligula in ""I Claudus"" is among the most memorable performances on the screen.On it's own, this ""Caligula"" is not a bad film. Just because the horrors and excesses of the Caesars were obscene does not make them unfit subjects for cinema. But to me, the gratuitous sex poisons this film. Please note that I am NOT a prude AT ALL. I have not the tiniest complaint with porn. I consider ""The Gangbang Girl #33"" to be a superior film to ""Caligula"" because it is true to its purpose. Caligula tries to be historical epic and porn flick, and succeeds at neither.Consider the brothel scene. It is true that Caligula held a brothel in the palace. Film-making is the art of interpretation, imagery, and inflection. The BBC's version shows the brothel, with no explicit sex, and no diminution of the historical significance. Do we really need to see a woman performing oral sex on a man and see the man ejaculating to get the idea? While we're at it, why not show people actually being killed to demonstrate Caligula's capricious cruelty - a real decapitation, for example? Just as important as a real blow job, if you ask me.If you want Peter O'Toole in a historical epic, I recommend ""The Lion In Winter."" If you want stories of the Roman Empire, ""I Claudius"" and ""Ben-Hur"" stand out. If you want oral sex, try the ""Down The Hatch"" series. But not all genres are meant to mix in one film.",Caligula
211,usanettom,"Far from Awful, But Not for the Faint of Heart",8,6 October 2006,"I have to strongly disagree with the previous comments. Yes, this movie has inaccuracies - of course it does. Gore Vidal was not around in the time of Caligula. The point of this movie is not to portray a dead-on account of Caligula's rule. The point is to give you a glimpse of what life was probably like when he ruled, as well as to show what can happen in a society when one person is given absolute power. The point is also to shock you. This is a graphic movie, and not only the sex scenes. I think the acting all around was very good. Malcolm McDowell is downright scary as Caligula, and Helen Mirren is great (and sexy) as his wife.As for the sex scenes, there are really only two major ones in the movie. There is a lot of nudity and other sexual activity, and I can see how someone could say it's gratuitous - but, they didn't wear much for clothing in those days and it fit with the rest of the movie. Now, the two major sex scenes - they're a little misleading in the context of the movie. They were not filmed with any of the main actors present - they were done separately (yes, there are clips of the main actors during both of these scenes - but they're not involved directly in them). Malcolm McDowell has said he was upset that they were added and claimed he did not know they were being added. They are very graphic scenes, and certainly the term pornographic would fit. However, they are not like what you would see if you went out and rented a xxx movie today. There is no, or at least very little, direction in the scenes. The sex is passionate and unscripted - you can tell they're actually enjoying it. The two scenes are much more erotic than any porn made today.",Caligula

214,Alcazar_Bauglir,ROME it is not,6,4 March 2007,"Coming from the Netherlands, I'm not one to call something 'pornographic' quickly. Sadly, the influence of the Penthouse magazine producing this movie is pretty obvious.If you compare this movie to the hit-series ROME, nowadays this movie shocks people less with it's nudity and sex. Still, the focus of this movie is needlessly on sexual escapades and nudity. If you're offended or bored by gratuitous sex, thank God for fast-forward, you're going to need it. About the only sex-scenes that had much function in the story was the (historically fairly accurate) prostitution of the Senators' wives. Even so, this scene was overlong. The best aspects of this movie are the music and the art direction; they're not historically correct by a long-shot but have that Dr.Phibes-over the top thing going for it. Also, the basic premise of the movie (Caligula takes Tiberius' disdain for the Romans to heart and is anxious to see how far out his behaviour can be before someone shows some spine) is interesting. It would have been a much better movie if it left out most of the graphic sex scenes, and added more action/gore. Caligula was noted for having an obsession with gladiatorial fights so this would be accurate.If you want to see a more 'historically correct' version of Caligula, watch the splendid ""I, Claudius"" TV-series with Jacobi.",Caligula

217,teamgomez99,"unbelievably indulgent, however beautiful and captivating",7,10 November 2010,"Where to start..... First off, the sets are wonderful. They are lavish and look authentic of the time, except as if a madman on acid was given a gigantic budget and told to ""go at it!"" Peter O'Toole is wonderful as the aging Tiberius. Malcolm McDowell gives a great performance as the young Caligula who kills his way to the throne of the Roman Emperor and then soon leads a legacy of terror. The supporting actors do a fine job yet, most of the young ladies were actually Penthouse Pets and were there for eye candy and irrelevant sex scenes. Depending on which film you are watching, the uncut or the R-version, some scenes are extremely graphic. I would usually always recommend the uncut version as opposed to the chopped one, but in this instance, the full length film is purely indulgent. Scenes of sex and gore were added to satisfy the producers (Penthouse) and the expected audience, not to add anything to the story. However, I am and will always be a fan of excess, so get the full version! The story is strong and keeps you interested. McDowell is charming throughout, which is quite the feat considering he murders family members, rapes and molests men and women, and sleeps with his sister. For fans of excess and sleaze, i highly recommend. Viewers who are purely interested in the reign of the notorious ruler might want to skip this one.",Caligula
218,dj_hottie-910-458400,a film that rips the guts out of humanity,10,25 March 2011,"Caligula, without a doubt, is one of the most filthiest, most disgusting, vile films I have ever watched. No duh. That's the collective opinion of many people who've seen it. ""It's disgusting! It's sooo nasty! Yuck!"" But it's much more than filth and sleaze. It's a masterpiece.It's a masterpiece of gore and sex and history, rolled into one weird package. Though not historically accurate in all respects, it is pretty literal when it comes to bringing the horrors of Caligula to life on screen. Those who aren't familiar with the emperor Caligula, or any of the Julio-Claudian emperors for that matter, won't notice much but the Roman history buffs will be annoyed that this film focuses less on the story of Caligula's life, and more on his perverse and strange acts of tyranny and sex. There is castration, fellatio, decapitation, fisting, anal, oral, the list goes on and on. He makes his horse consul, screws his sister, leads the armies on useless expeditions, violently massacres people, rapes a bride and groom, turns his palace into a brothel and does many other stupid things. But hey, Guccione and Brass never intended to flatter Caligula. The film starts off with a biblical passage, For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul. - Mark 8:36 How very scary. The beginning is ominous, a pulsing rhythm pounding in the background, a sort of odd Pagan music. Then we see Caligula frolicking (to say the least) in the woods with his sister, Julia Drusilla. From there on starts a bizarre two and a half hour odyssey of absurdity.You might ask, what the hell is good, much less great, about this movie? There are many reasons why I consider Caligula brilliant.The acting, for one. Malcolm McDowell was born to play the role of the mad emperor. He portrays Caligula as a cheeky bastard, a real son of a bitch who's a pervert and a madman. Malcolm gives the performance of a lifetime, outshadowing even his roles as Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange and Mick Travis in If...Quite simply one of the best performances I've ever seen. Malcolm becomes Caligula, he descends deeply into the character and becomes insane himself.Peter O Toole is amazing as the sick and volatile Tiberius. You can see him laughing during the elevator scene, laughing at the stupid absurd role he was playing and how his career was going down the drain, laughing at himself because he was surrounded by a bunch of naked Italian B-movie actors and Penthouse pets. Even he couldn't take the whole damn thing seriously. John Gielgud as the suicidal Nerva and Helen Mirren as the faithful but skanky Caesonia were a nice addition. The music, is another thing. Aram Ilyich Khachaturian's Spartacus is haunting and beautiful. Prokofiev's Dance of The Knights (AKA Montagues and Capulets) is simply stunning. It's played during the beginning credits and it sets the tone for the entire movie. Intense and atmospheric and powerful.The dialogue is also great. During the credits we hear Caligula say ""I have existed from the morning of the world, and shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens. Although I have taken the name of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man, and so, I am a god."" Gore Vidal at his best. Some people say the script is cheezy or stupid, but I think it's great. Caligula is Roman decadence, personified. The horror and indulgence of the Romans is portrayed wonderfully in this film. It's the best representation of Rome, along with the miniseries I Claudius and Fellini's masterpiece Satyricon. The nudity and violence are excessive, but most Romans were indulgent and depraved by this time period. Gone were the days of art and poetry, the days of bloodshed and the abuse of power had begun. Besides, you can't exactly make a PG Disney movie on the life of Caligula.This movie also made me obsessed with Roman history, especially Caligula himself. Rarely has a film gripped me so powerfully.Although I do think Caligula is an outstanding film, it obviously could've been better. Tinto Brass had something, he was making something different, maybe not Citizen Kane, but still, he'd got something special. Then Bob the perv Guccione came along and was angry that his money was being wasted, so he and his buddy edited Caligula and tore it apart and replaced key moments with porno scenes. Oh, what could've been! Well too bad. This is the result of serious miscommunication between producer and director. People think that Caligula lacks artists merit because they assume that it's a porno because it was produced by Penthouse. If Salo is a masterpiece, why can't Caligula be a masterpiece? Why the hell not? Just because Salo was directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. If Bob Guccione had decided to make a movie version of Salo, it'd be panned, but if Pasolini made Caligula, it'd be praised to the skies. I give Caligula a 10, just for the pure shock value of it. What a brave and bold film. You'll never see a movie like this again, ever. People compromise nowadays, censorship prevails. Who would have the guts to make such filthy mainstream movie? No one.In conclusion, Caligula is a powerful, amazing film that is horrific and magnificent at the same time. Throughout the whole time I watched it, I was filled with dread, terrified at what would happen next. At times it was hard to swallow (get the pun?). The rating of 4.9 is ridiculous. Some people couldn't handle the nastiness, apparently. Watch it....if you have the guts to. They'll probably be torn out by the end.",Caligula

The only thing that keeps this from being a masterpiece is the straight porn shots put in by the incompatent producers.

With disembowelment,  beheadings,  beastiality,  incest,  fisting, rape,  sodomy,  genital consumption,  bowls of semen,  sex with midgets, and all other sorts of mutant sex in a wide range of deformaties Caligula is the supreme ruler.

220,greg_machlin,ought to be a cult classic,9,17 October 2005,"The cinematography is gorgeous, along with the scoring. The production captures both the glory and barbarity of mankind in Rome. MacDowell's portrayal of the mad Emperor is convincing and O'Toole never disappoints. For a movie so controversial to be made in it's time, only Penthouse would have supplied the budget, and, so there was gratuitous sex. So what? Truthfully, it was a small price to pay for such funding. The nudity was certainly well within reason in the costuming. The dialogue covering the orgy scenes was very insightful into the dramatic viewpoints of the characters. Bizarre, but true. Much of the movie is to tear either at your stomach or your heart. No. It is not bad. It makes everyone who watches it feel too much and think too many things to be bad. I agree, it is difficult to take. I do, however, highly recommend this film to anyone who has a strong stomach for mankind and likes a challenge.",Caligula
221,frontal_dysfunction,"Worst movie ever made? Probably not, but it comes pretty close.",5,8 December 2009,"I took it upon myself to watch Caligula (the unrated version) last night, mostly because I'm a Malcolm McDowell fan. I'd been excited to see it all day, kept mentioning random trivia about it I had read to anyone who would listen, but I knew this movie had not been well received. However, being 19, a girl, and usually of a pretty open mind, I figured it would be right up my alley anyway, but about twenty-two minutes in I had to accept that this may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. I think what earns it this title is not the useless nudity and violence (I'm a huge Tarantino fan and on occasion enjoy some actual porn, so I don't think this is biased because I 'can't handle the reality of sex and gore'), but really it's that this COULD have been a GREAT film. A screenplay by Gore Vidal, great actors, and I mean, who doesn't love hearing about the decadence of the roman empire at the hands of an insane despot? I now wish I could have those two and a half hours of my life back, but I also wish I could go back in time and help make this movie the masterpiece it could have been. At first I thought the worst part of the movie would be that McDowell might slip too easily into a reprise of his role as Alexander De Large (except with a toga), but no. The decapitator wall, the freaks of nature in Tiberius' cave, Teresa Ann Savoy, that girl who peed on Proculus' corpse, and that lesbian sex scene are what stand out as I write this. I had a gum graft earlier this morning, and it's harder to recover from this film than from the procedure. Don't watch this movie if you want to retain any kind of respect for the real talent involved in this production, but if you do anyway, it helps to read about how most of them were as disappointed with the movie as I was. I give it a five out of ten for potential, McDowell in those short togas, and kick-ass opening credits music.",Caligula

223,bighelsinki,A misunderstood classic.,10,8 March 2000,"CALIGULA is a terribly misunderstood film. I believe too many people think of it as a cheap porno,  and bash it due to that. ""All porn is bad,"" right?
CALIGULA was a daring film experiment incorporating big-name, established talent, and the raw energy of under ground film techniques. What results is nothing short of a fascinating product.All of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can't help but think he's like that in real life. His portrayal of Gaius Caligula just drips with maniacal megalomania. The little-known Teresa Ann Savoy is convincing as Drusilla, Caligula's sister. And Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar, whose diseased face is rotting away, is truly an oddity to behold...put he pulls it off well. The acting in general is all very good.The use of music is also to be noted. There are original, evocative pieces written for the film by Paul Clemente, no doubt a talented composer.While some of the photography is stilted in this film, for the most part it's gorgeous. A lot of people say the colors are ""dark"" and ""washed out"", but I think that lends to the grittiness of the film.Danilo Donati's sets are big and well designed, it kind of shocks you to see someone getting a blow job in them. They look like they belong in a run-of-the-mill Hollywood produced film. Aren't all pornos supposed to be filmed in the director's back yard?And that right there is the point of the film. To shock you; you can't believe you're seeing what you're seeing. Beyond the violence and the sex is a well written, acted, and photographed film.I have spoken!",Caligula
224,gleef,"Good, but marred",7,31 March 2004,"From what I understand of the history of this film, Franco Rosellini started to make the film, but needed more money.  He went to Bob Guccione (among other things, editor in chief of Penthouse magazine), who agreed, but at a cost.  The cost is the addition of more sex, including some scenes directed by Guccione himself.The result is a mixed bag, the scenes with story, presumably directed by Tinto Brass, are wonderful.  Then there are scenes that have no story, appear to be filmed with a different grade of film, and add nothing to the movie except skin; I assume that these were done by Guccione.  I would love to see a reedited version, without Bob Guccione's scenes, but it will never happen, since Penthouse is the one holding the rights to the movie.Note: I'm not saying ""take out all the sex, and the movie would be good"", I'm saying take out Guccione's sex, and leave in Brass's.  Some of the scenes I attribute to Brass are quite graphic, such as Tiberius's living sculpture and the Ship of Noble Prostitutes.  These scenes are not only interestingly filmed, but are important parts of the story.  Guccione shows me nothing I can't find better by getting a porn flick.So with that caveat, and with the warning that people offended by explicit sexuality or graphic violence should not watch this film (and that's graphic violence in the disturbing, matter-of-fact way that Italian Cinema seems to do so well), I'd recommend this film.

The point though is decadence and nothing else. No insight, no exploration of character or theme.So, it's a very badly made film, but still interesting. It holds your attention.

229,earbarotrauma,A Misunderstood Masterpiece,10,5 May 2006,"After reading the few positive reviews for Caligula (which generally run along the ""so bad it's good"" line) I feel compelled to add my own critique. Caligula is a tour de force of powerful, visceral film-making. Many of the films deriders seem to be confused by the explicit sexual content and approach it as pornography, criticising the unattractiveness of the cast for spoiling their experience. (I'm reviewing, of course, the 1h55m unrated cut of the film) If you're looking for a bit of porn there are far better places to go. Likewise if searching for historical accuracy, this is not what the film is about. A taste for the sophisticated discourses on power and desire found in Passolini's Salò, the gaudy theatrics of Ken Russell's The Devils, or the humour and obsessive gratuity of William S. Burroughs will help you to fully appreciate the experience. Sex, mortality and addiction to power are the overriding themes presented in such a way as to implicate the viewer in this daring and unique cinematic experiment. The cuts switch between images of arousal and disgust with a balletic beauty climaxing in the beatific portrayal of Caligula's inevitable demise. O'Tool is a particular treat in the role of Tiberius and one cannot help seeing McDowell's Caligula as a matured Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer, filmmaker or cultural theorist, and a good conversation piece for everyone else.",Caligula

233,heylo,"Porn, violence and boredom.",1,3 August 2001,"FAR TOO MUCH DISGUSTING PORN!!!! It didn't even say on the back of the video that it was going to be this vicious, sickening disgusting. It wasn't even ""normal"" porn but you could watch people be punished and tortured, and it was all supposed to be normal and ""artistic"". Yuk I say, yuk! Besides, apart from all the porn and unnecessary violence, you could hardly understand what the bloody film was about. Of course, you could make it out, but it felt like I was tricked and wrongly led into watching it after I was done. All the time I just wanted to turn it off because it was, exactly what the director didn't want it to be,  boring, boring boring.  Terrible don't see it.",Caligula
234,stevenbrodziak,Any bad reviews of this movie should be ashamed and are only being politically correct.,10,8 May 2021,"I think that these bad reviews are forced to denounce sex in cinema even when the story is true. So prudish is America that they are almost as bad as the British are with embarrassment. Want fantastic acting? When Peter O'toole says ""Caligula, give me my ring"", chills go up the spine and the music with it is just fantastic to the scene. Malcolm McDowell is perfect with Theresa Ann Savoy from her saying ""you amatuer"" to her death scene. This movie shows exactly how cruel Caligula was. I highly recommend only the full uncut version.",Caligula
235,ronasia,All the genres in one movie,10,21 September 2001,"This is a typical movie, that you or love or hate. Personally I love it, it has really all the genres in one movie, from drama to thriller and from romance to porno. I think it is one of the very few movies that picture the atmosphere of Roman times in a realistic way. The camera work is the perfect mixture between very romantic and explicit shots. Malcolm mc Dowell is perfectly casted as Caligula. He runs around like a true madman. The only small minus, is the performance of some of the Italian actors. Extra note: The scene with Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner is one of the most sexual in a non porno movie. Overall is this one of the best movies i have ever seen.",Caligula
236,peachypattycake,"Fantastic Preview of Daily Roman Life; Also Great ""Thinker""",10,4 January 2007,"Caligula is one of the most fantastic films I have seen, and yet I do not feel comfortable forwarding it to the ""immature"" of mind. Because the movie touches on some very 'controversial' issues, such as nudity, violence, and sex, the film is immediately labeled as some sort of a historical-pornographic film.I believe that ""Caligula"" accurately depicts what daily life was like during the reign of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (Caligula). Malcolm McDowell brought Caligula to life in his role as the crazed emperor, showing his many mood swings, and even sincere emotions.I popped in the film not knowing what to expect--some sort of cheesy play-off of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.It is anything but.The music fit the mood perfectly, giving an ""eerie"" sense; but perfection arrived with the fade-in of Mark 8.36 ""What shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul."" Even before the opening credits began rolling, the movie had my full attention, because of that first verse.Caligula is a movie profound on many different levels: not only does it accurately depict daily Roman life; it humanized Emperor Caligula, bringing to realization the fact that he also was human.**If you perhaps enjoyed ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", I believe you would also enjoy Caligula, only Caligula is very explicit.",Caligula
237,guedu50,What a sick movie!,1,11 July 2002,"I watched this movie last night, and I have to say, it is one of the sickest movies I've ever seen. I own a quite large number of movies myself, and I have seen many things. I have heard the argument ""this is what it must have been like, it only shows the reality"" quite often in connection with this movie, but this... First of all, the movie is full of hardcore sex scenes. Second, it's soaked with graphic violence, up to a point where I just wanted to turn it off. I can't understand all the positive reviews I read, it seems unimaginable to me that a person with a normal sense for moral and beauty could actually enjoy this piece of crap, even if you like nudity/erotic! This movie is full of everything I don't want to see: too graphic violence, sick characters, disgusting hardcore sex (incest,sadomaso),and an overall appearence of total darkness and evil! As for me personally, i destroyed my copy...",Caligula
238,demon-hellcat,What this movie is really about,5,17 November 2007,"I don't care what the other person said about it being a really good movie once you get past the gore. Its not even really that gory. But it is most definitely porn. I know that he was supposed to be nuts and that all the sex was supposed to be part of that, but unlike most movies it went above and beyond showing this point. I'm not a prude by any means, but trying to watch a supposedly good movie is a little hard when there are 15 minute sex scenes. I'm not talking about the sex scenes that are in most movies, I mean stuff you'd actually see in porn. Like close up shots of oral sex that leaves nothing and I mean nothing to the imagination and well close up shots of everything you could possibly imagine. Now I know that this is part of his madness, like where he made all the senators wives part of his brothel, but to get this point across you really don't need to show the sex scenes for 15, 20 or more minutes. So I rate this move as just porn, not a misunderstood classic. I don't care if it is to prove a point, its just ridiculous and then redundant after 20 minutes. So if you like porn, it is a pretty good show, lol, lots of variety.",Caligula
239,stevieboi-k7,High Hopes,5,26 March 2008,"Disappointed is not the world. I first heard of Caligula on wikipedia when I was researching Ancient Rome. I looked at the image of the poster and the brilliant tagline: What would you have done if you had been given absolute power of life and death over everybody else in the whole world?. Without even reading a review of the film, I ordered the glorious-sounding ""Imperial Edition"" and got the shock of my life watching it. I expected an epic showing of the rise and downfall of Rome's most monstrous Emperour and instead I received a combination of a great film and hardcore porno. The actual sex footage and some of the suggested actions like the anal fisting, oral sex etc is so repulsive that it actually put me off the brilliant scenes which also happened such as Nerva's suicide in the glass bathtub and the brilliant ""If only all Rome had one neck"" line which blew me away. I give the film a 5-star rating because it was a good film, a brilliant film but I give it a 5-star rating also because it was filthy, queer and brutal piece of trash which doesn't deserve a showing anywhere,",Caligula

242,adalheidurbj,Not porn... brutal truth!,7,9 January 2009,"I found this film and decided to watch it because Malcolm McDowell is in it. The fact that some described it as a ""semi porno"" gave me a bit of a shock, since McDowell was a well known and successful actor around that time. Why could they get him for such a movie? But I looked aside from that and took the chance because I adore his acting.The movie starts with nudity, and it's beautiful. Two people in love. Young, careless! Nothing like what you're about to see later in the movie. So you get something sweet and pretty that plays with your mind. Having said that, I love the costumes! They are so simple, yet so perfect, that they make you believe this movie.Tiberius played by Peter O'Toole, shows the madness that Rome stood for! A man with all that power. Of course he makes a ""whore house""! For all the wealthy men of Rome to have endless pleasures for the money they own! It wouldn't surprise me if people in that time did have this much sex, nothing to do except war over power. But in this movie, it shows what women had no power at all, over themselves or their body. Which is so tragically displayed. These brutal sex scenes, you should not feel pleasure but disgust. Because they show nothing else but discrimination against women in that time.But one woman in this movie comes close to having power, even power over Caligula. His ""sister"" Drusilla. You can see how much she loves him and knows him. The look she gives him every time she sees him losing it more and more, is outstanding. He just drifts away and loses interests in what really matters. She's like an angel. You can see in a heartbeat that Caligula doesn't care for his wife as much as Drusilla. Which is sad, oh so sad. I love the scene where Drusilla doesn't wake up. When Galigula takes off all her clothes and starts kissing her all over, trying to give her a reason to wake up... heartbreaking. He realizes then, how much she meant to him, and falls apart. Completely. Although Caligula got the power over Rome with the death of Tiberius, you can see that no one respects him. Everyone looks at him like a child with a golden ring, and nothing more. It's only his name that gives him the time he got in the thrown. They know he knows nothing of his doings. And their right all along. People on the streets don't even know his face, because he's so self loving and does nothing for his country! Just stays in his palace, fulfilling his own pleasures. And then suddenly he thinks he can satisfy the people of Rome with yet another ""whore house""... great idea? that scene I find a bit silly. But the idea behind it is OK.I made it through this movie because of the beautiful acting of Malcolm McDowell, Terresa Ann Savoy and Helen Mirren. This is truly a sad and tragic story, but it all fades away with these hardcore sex scenes! If they hadn't been so long, detailed and wet, the movie would have been much better to watch. But STILL I think the movie wouldn't have had such affect if the scenes weren't as shocking. I think it only shows the brutal truth!",Caligula
243,travisblair,Why the low rating???,10,12 November 2010,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I mean it was memorable. I think it would have been better if the PORN wasn't spliced into it, and at the same time it wouldn't be the movie I loved. It is HONEST, this is humanity and instinct. History and honesty. The mood is there at least even if it isn't 100% factual...it accomplished unintentionally what it was going for in one respect. I have seen HUNDREDS of movies from silent film to modern cgi/hi-def. I..LOVE..MOVIES. I think this one stands out from SO many I have seen, that alone is worth it. Check out ""The Room"", because it stands out too but because of how inept and lame it is...it is like art. Caligula is like a trainwreck and pure GENIUS...so it is pure art to me. If you LOVE it it accomplished something, if you HATE it same. If you feel nothing then I guess it isn't your cup of tea and that is cool. I just hate those ""hallmark"" kind of movies my parents love so much.",Caligula
244,javiergodar,masterpiece,10,3 November 2012,"That this movie got a rating of 5 is outrageous. Great cast, script, photography...Obviously it is not porn, it is realistic and one could watch the movie again and again without intending to watch an erotic or porn movie.I am glad that Guccione put his hands on it, it makes it even more special.Caligula is in a class of its own, and sadly I am afraid that no more movies like this will be filmed. There is no money, freedom and open-minded audiences to support such effort again in this World of political correctness, homogeneity and vulgarity.Make yourself a favor and watch the uncut version, it is much better.",Caligula
245,mikepage5,Borderline Porno,2,26 January 2005,"I was greatly disappointed watching this film. I wanted to watch a movie on Caligula and got a porno instead. I am aware that there were Greek orgies and that this sort of thing may have went on however I was very appalled to see such great talented actors acting in such horrendous rubbish.Many of the scenes though possibly viewed by the some as interesting and entertaining such as the oral scene on the boat and the penetration scenes could have been left out. A good director can bring the idea to the minds eye without the eyes having to see the acts in full color.I would not recommend this film to anyone who has any desire to keep a good impression of the actors involved or not wishing to watch an expensively made adult type film. This title should not be sold in regular stores, it should be available only in adult stores.",Caligula
246,m_puddister,DO NOT get the R-rated version!,3,8 January 2007,"If you see this movie, you have to watch the unrated version to get the whole experience. I got stuck with the R-rated version and it sucks balls...they cut so much out, you can tell it was butchered. Going into this movie you know it's half porno, and you want plenty of violence and gore as well. You need that to compensate for what really is a terrible movie. It's enjoyable in that you get to see Caligula go completely power mad, but all I could think while I watched it was how much more fun it would be to watch the uncensored version. If you're going to watch ""Caligula"", you have to go to the true depths of depravity!",Caligula
247,acgogo57,Awful not in a good way,1,10 June 2016,"I think John Waters could have taken this material and done a much better job with Divine as Caligula, of course. Now THAT would have been edgy and outre entertainment.Most of the talent associated with this movie washed their hands (probably literally) after the fist ""f"" scene. I wanted to take a shower after watching it. I know Gore Vidal, always a good sport, had his name struck from the writing credits, but thought the film was hilarious anyway. And it really is a big joke. I think Guccione was just astonished that he got the money to do it and attracted so many big names. I believe only McDowall approved of the final cut.",Caligula
248,TravellinSoldier,Trouble from the start,4,11 November 2005,"When Gore Vidal saw what Bob Guccione was turning out from the novel he had written, he demanded that his name be removed from the project. I guess that Mr. Vidal knew that even if they spell your name correct, there is still bad publicity. The movie starts with some promise. And if you enjoy the acting talents of Malcolm McDowell, then it is a good way to kill a few hours. McDowell does portray the insanity of Caligula quite well. As the movie progresses his acting talents are stronger as he shows the depravity that Caligula sank to. He does a great job in carrying the film. And his performance is as dark as ever. Not quite as dark and foreboding as Alex from A Clockwork Orange though.",Caligula
