0,Leofwine_draca,"A massive, massive mistake",2,29 April 2015,"THE IMPOSSIBLE is a terrible film supposedly dealing with the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004. Needless to say as a western film this almost entirely ignores the suffering of the Thai people, choosing instead to focus on the plight of a rich, middle class British (in real life, Spanish) family who find themselves caught up in the catastrophe. I don't know what's more shocking, the level of smug, casual racism on display in the premise and execution, or the fact that the guy who directed this also made THE ORPHANAGE.In any case it's a crashing bore of a film. The only good thing about it is the opening tsunami, which is a masterclass in special effects work; you really believe it's happening so authenticity is second to none. Unfortunately as soon as the tsunami is over the characters begin to act in stupid ways, repeatedly splitting up when they should be together, and overacting for all their worth.We're saddled with the overrated, ever-worthy Naomi Watts as the mother character, who whines and screams for much of the running time, while the smug Ewan McGregor is just, well, Ewan McGregor. The child actors are particularly irritating here, acting in the stupidest ways imaginable. I hate the way each person acts in respect of the subject matter, the so-called ""worthiness"" they think they're involved in. The second half of the film consists entirely of people shouting and crying at each other until the predictably sappy and sentimental conclusion, which incredibly offers a happy ending and closes a barely-opened door on the real suffering that went on.",The Impossible
1,SnoopyStyle,Naomi Watts superior performance,8,16 August 2013,Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are on vacation with their three young kids in Thailand. It's a picture perfect trip at a coastal hotel. Suddenly a tsunami hits and the family is scattered.Naomi Watts gives a harrowing performance. It's a true life story of a family dealing with the 2004 Christmas Indian Ocean tsunami. The action scenes are unbelievable. The scale of it all and the danger it depicts is truly realistic. The performance that Naomi gives is absolutely Oscar worthy. She is truly believable as a mother fighting for her life as she loses track of her family. There are a lot of tear jerking moments here. Some of them pushes a little too far. But it never gets completely fake. Ewan McGregor plays the father who has an incredible scene with a cell phone. Highly recommended.,The Impossible
2,Horst_In_Translation,Every tragedy has its movie,6,27 June 2015,"And this one here is probably the most famous film about the 2004 Tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The director is Juan Antonio Bayona and the film is written by Sergio G. Sánchez based on María Belón's story. She is the character that Naomi Watts' main character is based on. The only other famous actor in here is Ewan McGregor. But that is going to change soon as Tom Holland's performance in here is probably the main reason why he will be the next Spider Man. Bayona and Sanchez already worked together on ""The Orphanage"" and given the fact that both are still pretty young, it will be interesting to see what they can come up with in the coming years.The film can basically split into two halves. The first 55 minutes are about Watts' and Holland's characters and their fights for survival in the chaotic post-catastrophe Thailand. The second half is initially about McGregor's character and the other two sons, but quickly becomes a family affair. The first half we don't know if McGregor's character, Thomas and Simon will live or what happened to them in general. Afterward, it's all about the declining health of Watts' character and the question if she will survive with all her severe injuries. Watts got her second Oscar nomination for her portrayal here. I am not sure if I would have nominated her, but I can see why. She really carries the first half and the only thing I did not really like was the over-the-top altruist approach when she tells her son to help other people in the hospital. At least, this resulted in one of the finest scenes of the film, namely when Holland's character manages to reunite the Swedish father with his son. Holland has a couple well-written (and baity) scenes in general. Another one would be when he meets his two brothers again.The supporting cast is strong as well. Geraldine Chaplin has one very nice scene about dead stars and I always thought Sönke Möhring was the more talented of the Möhring brothers, even if the general public in Germany thinks otherwise. He totally nailed his scene when he meets McGregor. All in all, this is a decent film. It's very good in the first hour, but gets a bit worse afterward. Still, it is never bad. It is basically what you would expect a nature catastrophe movie to look like. With that comes a good story about survival. Decent effort from everybody involved. Recommended.",The Impossible
3,Prismark10,The savage force,6,26 January 2019,"I was in the Far East a few months after the 2004 Tsunami. I stayed in an island that was relatively only mildly touched by the disaster. The locals would not go to the beach and it was largely deserted.The Impossible is based on true events. The family concerned were actually Spanish.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three young children are holidaying in Khao Lak, Thailand for Christmas. Suddenly the hotel is hit by a Tsunami. The family are seperated. Maria and eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) are on their own. Maria is badly injured but they need to get to safety and they do not know what happened to the rest of the family.The film spends no time in scene setting. The disaster happens straight away and it is well staged. The movie is split into two. You really do wonder what happened to Henry and the other two children as the focus is on Maria and Henry.Only later do we see Henry and the other children survive as he tries to search for Maria and Lucas. By this time she is desperately ill in hospital.The film has a harrowing performance from Watts. Holland rises to the challenge as a boy who tries to make himself useful in reuniting other families. His performance reminded me of the young Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun.If there is a criticism. It actually pulls back on the chaotic destruction and panic that existed in the region at the time. Villages and local families were destroyed. Many people were split up. The feel good factor just felt a little jarring and also appropriate.",The Impossible
4,claudio_carvalho,Realistic Movie about a Tragedy with Fantastic Performances of Tom Holland and Naomi Watts,8,9 June 2013,"In 2004, the middle-class family Barrett travels to Thailand to spend the holidays in a seaside resort. Henry Barrett (Ewan McGregor) is a family man that works in Japan and Maria (Naomi Watts) is a doctor but she does not work to raise their sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast).They are surprised by the South Asian tsunami and Maria and Lucas help each other and survive. However, Maria is seriously wounded and there is a total lack of resources in the crowded hospital. Meanwhile Henry finds his two younger sons in a palm tree, leaves them is a shelter to seek out Lucas and Maria throughout a devastated country. ""Lo impossible"" is a realistic Spanish movie about the fate of a family in the tragic 2004 South Asian tsunami with fantastic performances of Tom Holland and Naomi Watts that deserved the nomination not only to the Oscar, but to other Cinema Festivals. The special effects are amazing and give the sensation that the Naomi Watts and Tom Holland have been really caught by the waters. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Impossível"" (""The Impossible"")",The Impossible
5,kosmasp,Disaster,8,5 August 2014,"This is based on a true event, but all from the perspective of one family. You may call this predictable and you won't be wrong about it, but it's not so much where it goes (or where the character go), but the journey itself. The visual effects are amazing, making it look and feel as if you were actually there. And all this is achieved without 3D (well at the time of writing, I haven't seen any production company making a 3D conversion on the movie).The acting is really good, but you could and should expect this. It's the bigger picture that counts anyway. The drama is heightened as much as the waves (or even more) and the conclusion will either leave you agitated or pleased. But it will not leave you without a feeling, that's for sure ...",The Impossible
6,gavin6942,"Lots of Suspense, Not a Complete Success",7,3 February 2013,"An account of a family caught, with tens of thousands of strangers, in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time.First, let us talk about the Oscar nomination for Naomi Watts. I get it. She did a fine job here looking beat up and nearly dead. That probably deserves a nomination. But her performance is overshadowed by that of the young Tom Holland, who received no such nomination. So, to me, if he is not eligible, she should not win. Is that fair? Maybe, maybe not. But that is how I feel -- Tom Holland carried this picture.Beyond that, I have mixed feelings. The tsunami effects were incredible and I really felt the panic involved. But we have here an English family that gets separated -- and they all survive and become reunited within one or two days (I am a bit fuzzy on the timeline). Sure, this really happened (although the family was Spanish -- and I find it odd that a Spanish production company did not use Spanish actors). But it seems too clean, even with all the danger and death.Sure, the film is ""the impossible"", which would imply that this should not have happened but did. Yet, to put a basically happy ending on a tragedy that killed 230,000 people seems insulting to me. Apparently others have called it ""whitewashed"". I do not think that is the case -- that term is too extreme -- but I have to wonder why we have to focus on a family who seemingly came out unscathed. Where is a family that did not? Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect rating and called it ""one of the best films of the year"". This to me signals Ebert's growing disconnect with reality. If he means ""one of the 50 best"", then yes. But I assume he means more like ten best, and that is just plain wrong.",The Impossible
7,jboothmillard,The Impossible,8,7 July 2013,"The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the worst natural disasters in history, and like 9/11 it was a subject that had to be tackled in a film at some point, and it was with this film released during the awards season, from director J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage). Based on a true story, British family the Bennets, English wife/mother and physician Maria (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Naomi Watts), Scottish husband/father Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their sons, Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast), are going on a 2004 Christmas holiday to Khao Lak, Thailand. The first couple days are fun as the family enjoy the resort, but on Boxing Day (Decemember 26th) this happy time together is cut short by the oncoming destructive power of an earthquake triggered tsunami, a giant tidal wave sweeps through, separating the family and various other people. Maria is severely injured and desperately searches for her family, she finds Lucas and together they swim to find safety, and along the way the rescue a stranded toddler named Daniel (Johan Sundberg) from wreckage, until they are eventually found by locals and taken to the nearest hospital. Maria encourages Lucas that he should occupy himself by helping other people in the hospital, so he goes to various strangers as they ask him to help them find their relatives, which he notes down, and soon enough he does help a father and son reunite in the facility. There is a mix up when Maria has been taken away by the staff, thought to be dead, so Lucas is taken to a tent with other children without families, but she is found and needs chest surgery to help her injury, she is fragile and waiting to be confirmed fit for surgery on her wounded leg. Meanwhile, Henry has also survived the devastation with Thomas and Simon, the father is also injured, but the children are put on a vehicle with other children supposedly going to a safety point, while he stays behind to search for his wife and other son. Finding out his two sons have not gone to the evacuation point, being taken elsewhere, he is desperate to call home, communication facilities are limited, but tourist Karl (Sönke Möhring) allows him to use his cell to make an emotional call, and he volunteers to come with him and help find his wife and son. Henry and Karl search the various places where people are gathering for safety and support, they stop not far from the hospital where Lucas and Maria are resting, and the vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also arrives at the site, after some near glimpses and passes the family are eventually emotionally reunited. Maria is deemed fit for surgery and survives her operation, and the following day the whole family, with insurance arrangements, board an ambulance plane heading for Singapore for further treatment on the mother/wife, and she, Henry and Lucas smile at each other in relief and happiness. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as Old Woman. Watts certainly her award nominations as she is the character who goes through the most trauma, she was in fact chosen by the real survivor María Belón to play the part, being her favourite actress as well, and McGregor is also terrific as the father willing himself to find his family, and young Holland is surprisingly good as well as the eldest son desperate to help his mother and other people. The real life story is really compelling, how the family are drifted apart and eventually come back together, the catastrophe with rushing water and bad injuries is harrowing to watch but makes it all the more authentic, this film with really grip you and has a brilliant emotional charge, it is a fantastic disaster film based on a true story. Very good!",The Impossible
8,Woodyanders,Harrowing and touching film,9,11 September 2019,"2004. A family spending Christmas vacation in Thailand are split apart after a tsunami hits the place.Director J.A. Bayona relates the gripping and gut-wrenching story at a constant pace, maintains a stark serious tone throughout, and astutely captures both the staggering beauty and brutality of nature as well as the equally startling chaos and damage wrought by a sudden catastrophe. The ace acting by the top-rate cast rates as another substantial asset: Naomi Watts totally deserved her Oscar nomination for being put through the ringer both physically and emotionally as a wounded, yet resilient mother, Ewan McGregor does terrific work as the father determined to reunite his family, Tom Holland impresses in a difficult role as the oldest son who must stay strong for his mom, and Geraldine Chaplin has a nice cameo as a kindly old woman.Most importantly, director Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez wisely keep the narrative grounded in a very intimate and hence easily relatable level by putting the key emphasis on the tourist family, which in turn gives this film a considerable amount of poignancy and resonance as a moving tribute to the durable human spirit in the absolute worst of circumstances. The special effects are frightfully convincing. Kudos are also in order for Fernando Velazquez's spare score and Oscar Faura's sumptuous widescreen cinematography. The sequence with the big one occurring is downright terrifying in its ferocity. An excellent and affecting film.",The Impossible
9,Tweekums,One families struggle to survive the Boxing Day tsunami of 2006,8,26 July 2013,When a family go to Thailand for Christmas in 2006 they expect to have a relaxing time in a tropical paradise; they don't expect to get caught up in the worst natural disaster of modern times. When the tsunami hits mother Maria and eldest son Lucas are swept away and can only believe that father Henry and younger sons Thomas and Simon must have perished. The two of them struggle though the water and manage to get to safety although Maria is badly injured; even though they get to a hospital it is by no means certain that she will not die of her injuries. Meanwhile it becomes apparent that the rest of the family has survived and Henry is desperate to find his wife and son amongst the ruins.This isn't like most disaster films; mostly because it is based on real events but also because little time is wasted introducing the characters instead the disaster strikes in early on and the rest of the film follows their struggle to survive. The tsunami itself was shot in a way that made it look terrifying and there were many wince inducing moments were we see how Maria sustains her injuries. The sense of realism was increased by the lack of dramatic music during these scenes; we just hear the water and the screams of the survivors. I feared the tension would be lowered by knowing the outcome but it managed to be exciting though out. Stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor were great as Maria and Henry as was young Tom Holland who had a substantial role as Lucas.There are some pleasantly uplifting moments when we see families reunited but the film doesn't shy away from showing the impact of the tragedy as we see many bodies as they travel through the country and search for each other. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching although it is quite gruelling at times so probably isn't suitable for younger viewers.,The Impossible
10,ma-cortes,Spectacular as well dramatic story based on facts and masterfully directed by Juan Antonio Bayona,8,25 November 2013,"In 2004 , a devastating tsunami hit southeast Asia , this is one family's true story of survival . The story of a tourist family (the family on which this story is based upon were present during the whole shooting process) in Thailand , they are an ordinary family called Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts previously had an on-screen relationship in ¨Stay¨, 2005) and their three kids travel to Thailand to spend Christmas . Then they are caught in the destruction and chaotic aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami . It follows Maria and her son Lucas (Tom Holland) , not knowing where is the father and if two younger sons are dead or alive . However , nothing is more powerful than the human spirit. Who will survive ? It's a grade A picture , a gem , absorbing , riveting , highly moving , incredibly tense . This is a psychological/survival/thrilling drama in which a family enjoying their holiday become involved into a terrible tragedy . It is a smart and sensitive thriller filled with intense drama , thrills , emotion , tear-jerker and pretty entertaining though overlong . This nail-biter is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless survival-fight , as it follows the seriously wounded Maria/Naomi Watts and her eldest son Lucas/Tom Holland , as they struggle to safety . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear . Everything in Juan Antonio Bayona 's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a high resolution videotape of a tsunami . The crew filmed partially on location at the actual resort, since rebuilt, where the Belon family was vacationing when the tsunami hit ; for the tsunami destruction scenes, a scaled model of the resort was used . Interesting screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez from a story by María Belón and being based upon on true events , as the real family that the main characters are based on are in fact Spanish but living in Japan at the time of the Tsunami and many of the extras are actual survivors of the tsunami . Lavishly produced by Enrique López Lavigne , Jaime Ortiz de Artiñano , Javier Ugarte and Belen Atienza, in fact , the producers of the film heard an interview on Spanish radio where the family told their story of surviving the Tsunami and decided to make a film based on it. Top-notch acting by Naomi Watts , for the underwater scenes, Naomi was strapped in a rotating chair , while filming, Watts couldn't hold her breath any longer and she gave the 'stop' sign. Instead of stopping, the chair started spinning the other way around . Later it was revealed that it was a technical error and Watts stated the she felt very scared and hated the chair for that reason. There is the urgent hand-held camera-work, a trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Oscar Faura , which lends an air of pseudo-documentary authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Furthermore , an emotive as well as enjoyable musical score by Fernando Velazquez .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona who proved his usual aesthetics and nail-biting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in ¨the orphanage¨ . In this excellent film of 2013 , Bayona has directed 1 actress to an Academy Award-nominated performance: Naomi Watts (Best Actress, Lo impossible or the impossible (2012). Rating : Above average , a magnificent film . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor fans .",The Impossible
11,paul_haakonsen,Cashing in on tragedies...,4,31 December 2015,"This movie was told from the wrong point of view. It was sort of an insult in a way that director J.A. Bayona decided to focus on a rich white tourist family and not on a local Thai family. It just made the movie tacky and somewhat distasteful.This is my first, and last, time to watch ""The Impossible"" because it left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. The movie was a rather bitter pill to swallow.The movie did have a good cast, although I am no normally fond of Naomi Watts. But she did a good job in ""The Impossible"". And Evan McGregor is, of course, always great.Director J.A. Bayona played on some very cheap tricks in order to set up the audience, such as will the family see each other at the hospital even when they are within mere meters of each other.The visual effects in the movie were good and served their purpose quite well.All in all, this is a movie that tries to push the humane and emotional buttons of the audience. But it just came off as too racial, putting rich white tourists at the core of the story, when it should have been focused on the Thai as it was their homes, their livelihoods and their country that was struck the hardest by the tsunami tragedy.",The Impossible
12,tavm,The Impossible was a truly well made drama about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami,9,6 July 2013,"Just watched this movie on Netflix disc with my mom. This was a real intense movie about one family's survival of the 2004 tsunami but ultimately touching story as well especially that of the oldest son and mother's sticking together during the whole ordeal. Naomi Watts truly deserved her Oscar nomination as that mom who suffers some pain but perseveres with the support of that son and eventually the whole family. There might have been some scenes that may have been a bit standoffish but, really, for the most part, this was a really well made drama with great performances by all involved and mostly well made direction as well. So on that note, I highly recommend The Impossible.",The Impossible

14,Theo Robertson,Could Have Been Told A Lot Better,6,20 June 2013,"This telling about the 2004 tsunami that killed in excess of 250,000 people hit both critical acclaim and controversy when it was released . Naomi Watts was Oscar nominated as best actress but there were some outcries that the characters had been changed from Spanairds to Anglo-Saxons for no good reason . This wasn't a case of arrogant Hollywood changing characters in order to bring audience identification to a true life story because THE IMPOSSIBLE is in fact a Spanish film with a Spanish production team and one wonders why the producers couldn't have put some native Spanairds in front of the camera ? Would the film have suffered if we had Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz playing Henry and Maria ? There wouldn't have even needed to speak in their native tongues Where THE IMPOSSIBLE does succeed is in the devastating spectacle of the tsunami itself which has to be seen to be believed and is a technical miracle in film making . The fall out from this tidal wave which ended hundreds of thousands of human lives is well realised but from a dramatic point of view is very flawed . You see both Maria and her son Lucas both survive the disaster and are separated from Henry and the two other sons Tomas and Simon who believe Maria and Lucas are dead . Of course the audience know they aren't which means we're one step ahead of Henry . Put it like this - the story would have worked much , much better if the story had been told entirely through Henry's eyes where the audience are put through his point of view where he believes his wife and son are dead only to have to the audience to experience great joy at the end when he finds out Maria and Lucas have survived . It might have meant Naomi Watts missing out on an Oscar nomination but would have made for a more dramatic film . As it stands Watts performance and the tsunami scene are by far the best things about a film that's not as good as it could have been",The Impossible
15,grantss,OKish disaster movie,6,20 June 2014,"OKish disaster movie. Better than Hereafter, which dealt with the same event (but then took on deeper subjects and lost its way), but that does not say much.Interesting in that it shows how people survive the disaster and deal with it. Special effects are particularly good, especially those of the tsunami and of the people in it.However, is quite padded, especially towards the end. The director just seemed intent on drawing the movie out and it ends up a few scenes too long. And these scenes are overly long...Performances by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are fine, though Watts' performance should not have gotten her an Oscar nomination - it wasn't THAT good. The kids' performances are mostly irritating.",The Impossible

17,neil-476,"Good, but not always easy to watch",8,10 January 2013,"A couple and their three young sons are on holiday on the Thai coast when the 2004 tsunami hits. Although they survive, they are separated, and the mother is badly injured.This film is based on the true survival story of a Spanish family. It starts with a sequence which puts you right with the mother and oldest son, swept along in the wave itself (truly terrifying, and brilliantly realised), and then switches back and forth.Much of this film is pretty harrowing stuff. I was aware of frequent sniffling in the cinema, because there is some solidly emotional stuff on offer here. Standout is Tom Holland (then 14 but playing younger) as oldest son Lucas, but all the kids give great naturalistic performances and make me wonder why the Harry Potter kids weren't better. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor as Mum and Dad also have some very moving moments.I can't say that this is an enjoyable film - it is more an experience, and a worthwhile one - but it is well worth watching, and a terrific directing job by Juan Antonio Bayona.",The Impossible
18,evanston_dad,A Family Swept Away and Apart,6,8 July 2013,"Naomi Watts, an actress who I adore, is responsible for getting my butt in the seat for this fictionalized drama about a vacationing family who get swept away by the Asian tsunami of 2004.The real family upon which this film is based was not British, as they are in this film, but rather Spanish, Mexican or Portugese, I forget which. The movie has as a result taken on criticism for its ""anglicanization"" of a tragedy that affected more Asians than anyone else, but here becomes something that befalls privileged Western Europeans on holiday. No matter -- I think the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place, and that the family in the film are representative of everyone who was affected. After all, as characters, they're flat as cardboard cutouts, so it's easy for them to be stand-ins for anyone.The film isn't nearly as grueling and gripping as I thought it would be. We don't know these people at all, and the movie takes very little time to introduce them to us, so that when bad things do happen to them, I felt the abstract sympathy I would feel for anyone in the same situation, but no real investment in their story or its outcome. The kids aren't very good actors, so it's hard to really believe the emotions they're asked to convey. Watts gives a physically brutal performance, but isn't asked to develop much of a character, and spends most of the film's running time lying prone on a hospital bed. Ewan McGregor plays the dad, and his character makes so many bone-headed decisions that only through sheer luck don't make a bad situation even worse, that I spent more time being annoyed with him than I did caring about his plight.The visual effects are fairly impressive, and feel much more like the old school effects of yesteryear than the anonymous CGI effects of today.Grade: B",The Impossible
19,ferguson-6,Cry Me a Tsunami,7,5 January 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio C Sanchez reunite for their follow-up to The Orphanage (2007). What separates this from the long list of disaster films is that it's exceedingly well made, it's based on a true story, and it puts a young actor in a role vital to the connection with audience.The real life Belon family from Spain have for some reason been presented here (by Spanish filmmakers) as the British Bennett's with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts (as Henry and Maria). They are on vacation at a beach resort with their three boys Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). In the beginning the resort plays like paradise. Unfortunately, this is Thailand in 2004 when one of the worst natural disasters of all-time hits ... a Tsunami with enormous force and monstrous waves.Filmed with remarkable intensity, we see Maria and Lucas (separated from the others) struggle mightily to survive and stay together. This 10 minute sequence leaves the audience spent and gasping for air. Rarely do we witness such realistic near-drownings on screen. The film soon breaks into two simultaneous acts: the fight for survival by Maria and Lucas; and the quest to find them by Henry, Thomas and Simon.The first half of the film is the strongest portion and it deals with the storm and it's aftermath. The second half is very emotional and focuses on the courage of Lucas and the strength of Maria. It's one of the most unique combination tales of survival and family love that we've seen. The filmmakers wisely choose to let the story follow the family and not throw in cheap parlor tricks like TV newscasts. We all remember those reports, and the actual film does a terrific job of recreating those images.Acting by the leads take this to elite status. Ewan McGregor turns in what is his best performance in quite some time. His phone call home scene is excruciating to watch. Naomi Watts delivers what is likely an Oscar nominated performance, despite being almost unrecognizable while laying in a hospital bed during much of the film. The real star and soul of the film is Tom Holland as the youngest son. His performance recalls that of Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit and Shailene Woodley in The Descendants ... two of the best ever child performances.Be forewarned. This one is a true tearjerker ... especially if you are a parent or grandparent.

20,morrison-dylan-fan,Aftershock.,9,10 January 2013,"Deciding to go out on New Years Day to my town centre,I quickly realised that the only place open was the cinema.Queing up in a pretty long line,I found out when I got to the font,that due to the Christopher McQuarrie film Jack Reacher having already been playing for 20 minutes,there was only going to be one movie,which was going to start in the next 30 minutes.With having read some very interesting material about the filming for Juan Antonio Bayona follow-up to his 2007 Horror film The Orphanage,I decided that it would be a good idea to see Bayona show the impossible.The Plot:December 24 2004:Feeling in need of a relaxing holiday after both having had a hectic and busy working year,Maria and Henry Belon decide to take their children Lucas,Thomas and Simon to a luxury resort in Thailand,so that they can all have a wonderful Christmas holiday.December 26 2004:Continuing their celebrations,the family join all of the other residents in the resort,by relaxing next to the resorts huge swimming pool.As all of the residents continue their celebration's by the pool,a huge tsunami hits the building,which quickly destroys the resort and all of the surrounding area.Pulling herself out of the wreckage,Maria quickly discovers Lucas holding on for his life as the tsunami destroys everything in its path,franticly searching round for the rest of her family,Maria begins to fear that the tsunami may have ripped her family apart,when she finds no sign at all of Henry,Thomas and Simon being alive.View on the film:Going against the grain of the typical Disaster movie outline,where the first half of the film is used to build anticipation for ""the big bang"" of the second half,the screenplay by Sergio G. Sanchez and Maria Belon instead opens the movie at full force.Along with putting first time viewers of the film in the disorientated state of the survivors as they find themselves caught up in a terrible event,also allows for the writers to quickly change the audiences focus from anticipation of seeing ""the big bang"" scenes on the screen,to being caught up in the intimate drama taking place between the Belon family and other people,in their attempt to make sense of what has happened in the aftershock of the event.Closely working with sound effects editor Marc Bech,director Juan Antonio Bayona displays an ear for chilling sounds that reverberate to his Horror past,from drowning sounds in & out so that the viewer hears the disorientated sounds noises the characters hear as their ears get filled with water,to isolating each of the rip,tears and snaps (relalisticly done by prosthetic designer Floris Schuller) that the Belon's and the other survivors have to try and deal with in the aftermath,that lead to a large number of winces and gasping sounds being made from the audience in the screening that I went to.Along with his expert skills at sound design,Bayona also shows that he is able to mix a number of well handled wide shots that show the astonishingly non-CGI tsunami destroying the location,with a raw,rough and jittery (not shaky cam!) extreme close-up style,which pulls the viewer away from focusing on the tsunami itself,to instead focus on the confused,terrified and jittery survivors of the tragedy.Whilst the way that Maria finds her son Lucas (played by Tom Holland) and other similar events in the movie do have a whiff of Hollywood serendipity,the lead cast are able to make the flaw one that is easily forgivable,thanks to giving non-ego driven performances that feels strongly connected to the tragic events that they and millions of other people are a part of.Tearing any hints of Hollywood glamour apart,Naomi Watts gives an excellent,gritty performance as Maria Belon,with Watts display of fear,confusion and desperation hitting the audience with maximum impact,as she shows Maria trying to hold onto anything to stop her from being pulled deeper into the chaos taking place.Checking up the casts list of credits on Wikipedia after seeing the movie,I was shocked to discover that The Impossible was 16 year old Tom Holland's film debut!.Being featured in 90% of the film,and also acting opposite Watts and a very good Ewan McGregor,Tom Holland shows that he is more than able to hold his own by giving an extraordinary performance that shows Lucas attempting to remain strong in the harsh aftershock,whilst also showing subtle signs of doubt,as Lucas begins to fear that the impossibility of losing all of his family,may have just become possible.",The Impossible
21,FlashCallahan,hard to recommend....,7,20 January 2013,"A British family on Christmas holiday at a beach resort in Thailand is torn apart when a deadly tsunami devastates the area. We follow the seriously wounded Maria and her eldest son Lucas as they struggle to safety, not knowing whether Maria's husband and their two younger sons are dead or alive....First off, kudos to the sound editors on this, it makes the film ever the more distressing and harrowing.The two leads are good, but are overshadowed by Tom Holland who just acts his heart out and acts everyone off the screen.His journey from child to adulthood due to tragedy is the reason this film is worth watching.The actual carnage, is very distressing and so well done, it's very hard to sit through.In fact, the whole movie is hard to sit through, and if you don't know the story of the family, the film will have more of an impact come the end.As the summary says, it's almost 'Impossible' to recommend, but it's a very well made film, that will definitely upset a lot of people.",The Impossible
22,phd_travel,Impossibly good,10,17 January 2013,"The impact of this movie is truly devastating. Even though you know the outcome that the family lived, it is still no less tense throughout and I felt stricken after watching it. See it on the big screen if you can. Much more compelling than those large scale over the top CGI disaster movies of recent years because it's a true story. The tsunami scenes are so well done it makes the viewer feel like they are immersed in the disaster. Felt every sweeping wave, every gasp for air, impact with objects, footstep on debris etc. The Spanish director Bayona did an excellent job. The on location shooting in Thailand gives an authentic feel even though some filming was done in Spain.The story is good with a balance of the disaster itself and the aftermath including the search and overwhelmed hospital. The screenwriters avoided sentimentality yet achieved an emotionally powerful reunion. I didn't get a Hollywood feeling from the film. The emotional scenes are done quite matter of factly and the movie is better of for that. Those who criticise the scope (just one European family) can watch the miniseries 'Tsunami the Aftermath' instead. Naomi does a terrific job looking anguished, caring and injured in a totally convincing way. The young actor who plays her son Tom Holland is equally good not overdoing it but conveying the right amount of confusion, bravery and terror. A must watch.",The Impossible
23,gradyharp,'Nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.',8,24 April 2013,"There are times when it takes the making visual of the devastation that occurs in nature to drive home the need for our being more aware of the suffering of our fellowmen at the hands of natural disasters around the world. Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO Impossible: María Belón shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by Óscar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Velázquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by Sönke Möhring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing. But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him. Watch for his career to ascend. Grady Harp",The Impossible
24,zetes,"Starts great, but the resolution is perhaps too easy",6,13 January 2013,"This film starts off outstandingly, but kind of falls apart as it goes on. It's about a family vacationing in Thailand in Christmas of 2004. When the tsunami hits on Boxing Day, the family is separated. The mother (Naomi Watts) is gravely harmed. Her eldest son (Tom Holland) is with her. The father (Ewan MacGregor) is with the other two, younger sons, but he decides he must leave them with strangers while he searches for his wife and other son. The tsunami part is so harrowing that the rest of the film is bound to be at least a bit less interesting. At first, the fight for survival and frenzied searching is involving. Unfortunately, the final few sequences are fairly poor. First, for a father to leave his two youngest children, ages 7 and 5, with total strangers in a foreign country that has been devastated by absolute chaos seems truly bonkers. I sincerely hope that the film was just simplifying things and this guy in real life wasn't this stupid. Second, the big sequence where all separated members of the family find themselves at (or around) the same hospital and almost miss each other. The whole thing seems too cutesy, and also, in the end, way too easy. We're constantly reminded that everyone around this family is still desperately seeking their loved ones, many of whom we know have died, and these people find each other out of pure luck in what seems like less than 24 hours. In the end, it doesn't feel like these people suffered more than a minor inconvenience, especially when compared to what everyone else around them is going for. Really, this is the story of the luckiest family on the entire planet. There are plenty of good bits, though, even after the tsunami. I loved the long sequence where Tom Holland is trying to help other people who have lost their loved ones. Holland is really the MVP of the cast here. MacGregor and Watts are both good, but neither are award-worthy (Watts in particular is incapacitated through a large portion of the film, so I don't know why she got an Oscar nom for it).",The Impossible
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Impossible,10,17 January 2013,"One of the largest earthquakes in the region sparked off one of the worst ever tsunamis to hit our planet at multiple geographies, I still remember the relative calm back in that December of 2004 just after Christmas, until reality set in with the first images of the chaos that's to come through. Disasters have always proved to be fodder for filmmakers, and the challenge here is not to make them overly sentimental, or worse, seem exploitative in treatment. Clint Eastwood's Hereafter had the same disaster form the premise of his film, but in this Spanish production, we get the narrative centered around the incident proper in Phuket, where a holidaying family get caught up in this unfortunate moment in history, and we go through their respective struggles to battle fear, confusion, shock, loss and root for their reconciliation, forming just but a snapshot of most of the emotions that survivors would likely have gone through. With a true story of a family's experience forming the inspiration behind Maria Belon and Sergio G. Sanchez's story and screenplay, The Impossible boasts both technical brilliance as well as wonderful acting by its leading cast to draw you into those fateful days, putting you smack where the action is.Husband and wife Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts), and their three kids Lucas (Tom Holland), Simon (OAklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) are spending their Christmas week in Phuket, only for the ocean to come up and swallow a lot of land. And by now we would know the devastating effects a tsunami would have as waters sweep inward, gets drawn outward back to the sea, before the next wave comes in again. This gets repeated, with each cycle having the waves becoming smaller, but still bringing about plenty of debris and whatever it had uprooted and moved, making the undercurrents extremely fraught with danger.While Hereafter had some cheap special effects for sequences of the disaster proper, director Juan Antonio Bayona had a more incredible design and experience for the audience, with models being key to his presentation, and knowing exactly just how to keep tension, and the transmission of fear, vivid through the survive, sink or swim perspective of Maria and Lucas. This goes on for minutes, and it's extremely harrowing. Sound design is also excellent, with the roar of waters overhead perfectly contrasting the muted underwater scenes, which in itself is in ironic sync given its busy undercurrents with debris smashing into one's body, and the need to get onto higher ground, dry land, or just about any flotation device or tree up above. And Bayona doesn't just end it here, knowing that his money shots in this sequence becomes yet another perfect metaphor for Maria later on as well.It's a tale told in two parts, with Maria and Lucas' storyline highlighting the chaos that ensued after the waters subside, and the assistance rendered by good Samaritan villagers who do what they could in order to save lives. Bayona doesn't shy away from the more difficult shots of both showing the devastation of property, and the loss of human lives, and with an excellent make up team to bring about a vivid portrayal of those injured, or at the brink of death. Whatever they put on Naomi Watts made her look genuinely sick, and undoubtedly helped in her performance, nominated for various awards to date. But it's Tom Holland whom I thought stole the show in their arc, as the young boy faced with fear and uncertainty, both on the condition of his mom, as well as that in the chaos in hospital, with a little bit of humanity weaved in as he goes about reuniting strangers, albeit treated quite lightly, and coincidentally, given the more perplexing and frustrating time where the lack of records for obvious reasons hindered, and sapped emotional strength as hope faded with each passing day.The other storyline deals with Henry, his other two boys and a family's search for their remaining members, expanding upon Lucas' experience in one location, to that of hitting multiple hospitals and shelter locations, in addition to the difficulties of moving forward and ahead to abandon places already searched. Bayona kept it rather safe here with only fleeting shots of bodies and body bags, never lingering more than necessary. McGregor's character moves with survivors in their respective searches for family, which gives rise to opportunities to showcase how strangers come together, pulling resources and lending morale support, with some who had to hardened their hearts and understandably seeking to consolidate whatever they have in a me-first situation. Again the children Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast, while not having as big a role as Tom Holland, were the highlight here, stealing McGregor's thunder easily, and you'll be hard pressed not to find your eyes a little damp from time to time.Some may find fault with its convenient wrap, or take issue with the family's resources at the finale, but these happen to be what's available as resources at the time, and it's not too far fetched to finish rather strongly. After all, this is a film about the human spirit in times of disaster, and an account of their experiences in pulling through their ordeal. For sure there are countless of stories centered around the same event, but I suppose these are stories that would be told by other filmmakers. For now, Juan Antonio Bayona's film stands out as one of the best efforts both technically and creatively, capturing the horror and celebrating triumph in the smallest of ways, with all round fine delivery by its cast both well known, and young. A definite recommend!",The Impossible
26,siderite,A family in the midst of dramatic events,8,20 January 2013,"This is a good film, with good direction and acting. Even the script, the usual weakness of American movies is quite good. Not everything that is said is a plot device and most of the stuff that is shown in the film is based on actual facts.The problem that I had with the film was the way the tsunami was really something in the background, as were the actions of other people. There was so much focus on what do and feel the five members of the family that anything else felt blurry. It has to do with my own expectations, which were to gain insight in the disaster itself, rather than the emotional hardships of a single family caught in it.The action scenes were spectacular, I grant you that. To see in detail what happens to a human body caught in a massive wave filled with debris is shocking. The emotional scenes were OK, mostly. The soundtrack was appropriate, but it annoyed me to no end. Really, I can feel for myself, chill with the violins already!Bottom line: There are some gruesome scenes in the film, but it is mostly character acting and dialogue. The focus is only on one five member family and, after quite an emotional journey, the movie ends. It is a good movie, something that I would recommend, but I didn't feel it was out of the ordinary.",The Impossible
27,StevePulaski,A challenge for everyone involved that was beautifully and maturely handled,9,13 January 2013,"The one thing consistent with all disaster films is you can never sit comfortably within the opening scenes because you often know what is coming and you just can bear the thought of it. J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is a picture that captures a disaster all too realistically, as it depicts the tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia in 2004, killing an upwards of 300,000, destroying homes, soiling towns, and leaving families and memories in drenched and irreplaceable shambles. The thought of the last thing one sees is a wall of filthy, rushing water coming towards you at a breakneck speed is unthinkable.We center on Henry and Maria Bennett (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) and their three children Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) who are on holiday in Thailand at a gorgeous resort when a tsunami from the Indian Ocean rushes into the mainland, destroying every thing in its path. Trees are taken right out of the ground, cars are trampled, houses are destroyed, people are taken for a ride underwater that they may not come out of, etc.During the scenes of the tsunami, we are provided with harrowing images of bodies being flung and tossed underwater. Maria, herself, is thrown into numerous items of debris, including impaling her leg on a tree branch and almost having her breast taken off. When the water finally ceases, Maria and Lucas wind up reconnecting and venture to find some sort of relief and hopefully find the rest of their family. In the process, they take a young boy named Daniel along, who was almost crushed by failing rubble. He is a sweet little tyke, whose innocence is captured beautifully, including a scene where he comforts Maria (who keep in mind is still a stranger) by softly rubbing her hair in the face of tragedy. The scene itself is absolutely adorable, evoking the beauty of human sympathy.Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas, and Simon are still at the resort, with Henry being scratched and bloodied, but still able-bodied unlike his wife. He tells his children to stick with a larger group while he searches for mom and Lucas, and the story of a family hoping to reunite with each other ventures on.I've often discussed emotional manipulation and how much I dislike it. I feel it's a road filmmakers go down to achieve an undeserved sentimental reaction. Instead of using tactics of the screenwriter, films often use unnecessary events that evoke sadness and usually buoys them with an obvious soundtrack. The Impossible uses some of that, mainly along the lines of musical manipulation, yet there's so much detail, humanity, and life that comes along with this tragedy that one could easily forget about all that. Films like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and the more recent Les Misérables are more to an advantage in the idea of emotional manipulation because they can simply say something like, ""look at these very depressing people."" They emptily showcase depression, where The Impossible almost forces you to put yourself in the shoes of this family and think what you would do.I think my biggest problem with The Impossible, even though it does so much right, is the fact that the film takes place in Thailand, the story we're given is based off the true events of a Spanish family, and the cast is almost unanimously white. It's a subtle feature, that isn't a complete turn off unless you make it one, but it's a little disconcerting and questionable that the characters the film primarily focuses on are white in a country that is certainly complete in its Asian and Spanish demographic.Yet I'll stop there before I start some race war I do not plan to fight. It's a petty feature that shouldn't distract from the film at hand. I stated in my review of Life of Pi that it was the most emotional movie event of the year, and that I found Les Misérables underwhelming emotionally. This film reassured that I could still be greatly effected by a film in strong, moving ways. There are several scenes in The Impossible that evoke tears, so many actually that I left the theater physically and mentally exhausted. One scene in particular is when Henry is with many other people in the dead of night, with a man passing around a cell phone urging them to call their loved ones. Henry calls his close friend, and through tears explains vaguely what happened before assuring he'll reconnect with his wife and son before hanging up. The man tells Henry that he can not end a conversation like that and gives the phone back to Henry, who elaborates more clearly the second time around. It's a simple scene, likely to go unnoticed by many viewers of the film, but it shows the magnitude of the situation to such a degree that you can't even coherently explain it without sobbing or simply questioning it to certain extremes.Naomi Watts has just been nominated for Best Actress in the 85th Academy Awards, and her role deserves it. While she spends much of the film barely conscious and clinging on to life on a hospital bed, she is given a very physically demanding role that challenges a performer to provide the audience members with believability and sentiment and she achieves it through a heart-wrenching, motherly performance. McGregor does fine work as a conflicted father, and the children, mainly Tom Holland, are quite capable here, expressing their innocence in several sequences, including the fear of seeing your mother in great pain when you're used to seeing it the other way around. The Impossible is one of the most affecting disaster films in quite sometime, and one of the saddest dramas of the 2012 year.",The Impossible
28,lasttimeisaw,The Impossible,7,27 February 2013,"Naomi Watts just seized her second Oscar nomination (ended with an inevitable lose though) in this tsunami catastrophe survival drama which happened in South Asia 2004. Directed by Spanish young director Juan Antonio Bayona (yes, it is a Spanish production in spite of its mainly English-speaking cast), which marks his comeback after the internationally-accoladed debut THE ORPHANAGE (2007, 8/10), an ingeniously orchestrated horror-fest. The film's first half is a lip-smacking triumph not only for the special visual effects simulating the walls of water and its overwhelming impact, it's like HEREAFTER (2010, 6/10) meets 127 HOURS (2010, 8/10), vividly renders a kindness of faithful vicariousness on viewers through the white-knuckle self-salvage from the mother-son dyad. And if HEREAFTER could nab an Oscar nomination for BEST VISUAL EFFECTS, THE IMPOSSIBLE easily trumps it. But for the second half, the storytelling adopts a middle-of-the-road sentimentality, it is all about the reunion, still, there is a remarkable achievement for the editing team (and the cinematography group as well) to interlace Watts' flashbacks under the water with the operation she is undergoing, which is done with an eye-opening flourish. Adapted from a true event, from one hand, it affirmatively obviates the barbs like what's the odds the entire family (one couple with 3 son, age 12, 7 and 5 respectively) could pull through the calamity, it is a genuine miracle literally had happened (as far as the denouement concerned), so just deal with it! But from the other hand, the film shamefully sacrifices the accuracy for the sake of the emotional climax, which is a prerequisite for selling the tickets I suppose, and it worked (my eyes swelled with tears for many occasions), even simultaneously there is a tint of bathos ascending when the five of them finally find each other altogether at one place one time, it is so lame! Anyway, the film is also a victory for the cast, although Watts is bedridden for half of her time on screen, her hard-earned Oscar nomination is well-deserved, an impeccable endeavor out of the mundanity of her character (a woman try to survive under a dire circumstance). Tom Holland, the true leading man and great discovery from the film as the eldest son, has a stunning resemblance of a young Jamie Bell (what a coincidence, Tom was actually had a stint in BILLY ELLIOTS the musical to play the titular role in 2008, and call it sexism, academy never nominates teenage actors for their leading roles), most of the time he is the audience's proxy, we see through his eyes, his precocity and gallantry dominates the most chunk of the film's narrative and it has been executed unimpeachably. Ewan McGregor, absent for a disturbingly long time in the film, can only descend himself in a supporting part, he is a consistent great player in the race who is unfortunately always falling under the Oscar radar by only a notch, his cellphone-calling scene should be inscribed in every Oscar voter's mind, so next time, his glory will be duly justified. Also, the great Geraldine Chaplin, delivers the punchline ""the impossibility of death stars"" in her unforgettable cameo.Juan Antonio Bayona has warranted his craftsmanship in dealing with spectacular sensations, so Hollywood might beckon him to their wonderland, even if not, I daresay the next big thing is on the rising. ps, I guess Seth MacFarlane did see this film since apart from MULHOLLAND DR. (2001, 9/10) we also saw your boobs here, Naomi, but this time we are in a rueful mood.",The Impossible
29,KineticSeoul,Emotional disaster movie,7,25 August 2013,"Not quite sure about the title. But you know the saying that when people face struggles and hardships together. They will build a greater bond. Well that is the epitome of what this movie is. This is a realistic disaster film that is based on a true story about the 2004 South-East Asian Tsunami. Which killed and devastated the lives of many families. The primary focus of this movie however is on one British family on vacation. Although some people seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't know what all the fuss is about to that level. There is plenty disaster movies that focus on just handful of characters. Plus if this movie focused in on a lot of characters, there just wouldn't be as much of a attachment. But yes, this movie just seem to focus way to much on one British family sometimes while not showing much space as whole. However it didn't really take away a lot from the experience. Sure this might be somewhat of a feel good movie. But it's also goes in a very realistic direction that brings out the conscience and will power of humanity. And how precious life really is. The realism when it comes to the effects and the people, is what really brings this film to life. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor really did a great job of playing a couple that goes through pain and anguish. Even the kid actors put on a believable performance. Which is actually important for a film such as this. Usually on the news it shows the aftermath or far away discretion on what went down. This movie actually makes you feel for the victims more. Although I felt more sympathetic to the other more unfortunate victims. Because it shows visual imagery of what a lot of them went through. In a raw and brutal way, instead of sugarcoating it. It's a simple story that goes in a very emotional direction. This isn't really a inspiring or moving film in my opinion. But it does bring about a lot of emotions and is touching sometimes. Mainly because I felt that I might go in a similar direction and the connections between the loved ones seemed somewhat relatable.7/10",The Impossible
30,sddavis63,A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Horrible Disaster,10,8 June 2013,"Yes. The movie was ""anglicized."" The ""true"" story on which this is based was actually the story of a Spanish family and not an English family. That bothers some people. I have to say that it didn't really bother me. Whenever I come across the ""true"" story tag on a movie, I always assume that the term should be interpreted loosely. The point of this particular ""true"" story didn't depend on the identity of the family. To me, at least, who admittedly watched this tragedy unfold on television in the safety of my home in Canada, the story was ""true"" in the sense that it gave a harrowingly realistic depiction of what it might have been like to have been on the coast of Thailand on December 26, 2004, when the massive tsunami struck.This film moves quickly into the story. There's a very brief depiction of the family on the plane, and a very brief depiction of Christmas, and then - suddenly and without any warning - the tsunami strikes, as the family are playing at a pool at a resort. The depiction of the tsunami is quite terrifying. It was an excellent job of recreating the disaster and giving those of us watching as much of a feel as we possibly could have. The immediate aftermath of the tsumani follows mother Maria and son Lucas, who struggle together with the raging waters and finally manage to get to a hospital. All the while father Henry, and sons Thomas and Simon are desperately trying to find them. You can feel the chaos of the situation, and the movie goes from one emotionally gut wrenching scene to another almost all the way through. The performances from the cast who played the family were brilliant. All were totally and completely believable in their depiction of their terror and their utter lostness.There are a few minor quibbles one can make about this aspect of the story or that aspect of the story having been changed. I daresay those types of quibbles are always possible when dealing with a movie based on a ""true"" story. But this movie succeeded in what I believe its purpose was: to use the experience of one family to give the viewer just a taste of what had happened in Thailand on December 26, 2004 and its aftermath. In fact, it succeeded brilliantly. (10/10)",The Impossible
31,Hellmant,A true nightmare depicted on screen; definitely worth the watch if you can handle it!,9,10 January 2013,"'THE IMPOSSIBLE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A Spanish dramatic thriller (presented in English) recounting one family's true experiences during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It stars Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor both in highly critically praised performances (and reuniting after starring together in the 2005 thriller 'STAY'). It also stars Tom Holland as their 12-year-old son and he makes an amazing debut performance. It was directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sanchez (based on a story by Maria Belon). The same team made the 2007 critically acclaimed Spanish thriller 'THE ORPHANAGE'; which was a little more of a spooky supernatural thriller type (produced by Guillermo del Toro), where as this is definitely more of a disaster/drama film. The movie has been praised and condemned for it's believable and shockingly realistic depiction of one of the most disastrous natural catastrophes in history. It's a true nightmare depicted on screen and is definitely worth the watch if you can handle it.The film focuses on Maria (Watts) and Henry Belon (McGregor) as they vacation in Thailand for Christmas with their three sons: Lucas (Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). On December 26, 2004 they're all enjoying their time in a swimming pool, at the resort they're staying at, when the tsunami hits the coast and wipes them all out. Maria and Lucas are swept away but manage to find each other (although Maria is severely injured) as Henry recovers his other two sons. The rest of the movie is spent following Henry as he searches aimlessly for his wife and eldest son and Lucas as he looks after his mother at a emergency hospital.The film is truly nightmarish to watch as the opening tsunami scene is probably the most believable natural disaster scene ever depicted on film. The rest of the movie is just as haunting though as we watch this family in utter despair struggling to survive and find each other (while also watching thousands of other strangers experience the horror as well). The movie almost plays out like a horror film at times (which is probably due to the director and writer's brilliant touches) but it does pay off with a heartfelt and tear soaked conclusion. The film is inspirational in the way it depicts this real life family's strength, love and determination but it also leaves a somewhat depressing and eerie feeling after it's over. This is not a movie you watch to have fun (despite how spectacular the visuals are and Bayona's direction is very beautiful at times as well). Watts does deliver one of the most powerful performances of the year, as well as her career, and McGregor does some of his best work as well. When you think you feel up to sitting through a movie like this it's definitely worth the watch.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk",The Impossible
32,thesar-2,Impossible Missions,5,26 February 2013,"Aside from all I read about the changes to the ""real"" true story of the family portrayed in The Impossible, the movie did manage to move me in spots. Of course, that was the main reason for the movie, I believe.The movie is a real straight forward account of a family of Christmas breakers at a holiday resort swept away, literally, by a tsunami they had absolutely no chance of escaping or could possibly know was on its way. Not only must that be scary, but they surely showed how caught off guard they were and what anyone of us would experience.The remaining story is the family either staying together or separating and trying to get back together in one Hallmark moment after the next. Really, I'm not trying to downplay their plight, and again, the movie truly got me going at a few scenes. But, then that seemed more its mission than to tell a great story.To me, it might have been even more moving had a story been told about a completely less fortunate family or islander's struggles. This family was wealthy and had the grand fortune of the mother being a doctor. And I don't want to spoil the ending, but damn, I felt incredibly less sorry for these folks once you see the privilege they had compared to all the less financially backed families ""our heroes"" left behind.(Just the next paragraph is a spoiler. If you object, skip just one paragraph.)Example: with so many either dying, infected, in agony or had dead family members, this family of 5 take up an entire plane to go get ""top medical"" help in another country, when so many seats could've been used to help those left behind to rot or die. If that ending doesn't p|ss you off on how little they did or what could've been done to aid even just a few dozen more victims, then your heart is in the wrong place.SPOILER OVER. Okay, the movie wasn't too bad, and mercifully, very quick. That was probably because there was so little build up, and even less plot during. But, if you're looking for an intentional tear-jerker, this is your Lifetime movie for a Saturday night.",The Impossible
33,Robert_duder,"Powerful, effective, emotional and thriller",8,11 March 2013,"I really didn't know what to expect from The Impossible. I sort of thought it might end up being more of an art-house film with a lot of symbolism and bizarre cinematography. I really only thought this because of Naomi Watt's Oscar nomination in the role. I didn't think a typical ""disaster"" flick would get a nomination. I was incorrect. The Impossible actually is more of straight up disaster flick but with more power and emotion and the basis on real life factored with how fresh this is in everyone's mind makes it even more powerful. I don't mean to downplay it by calling it ""just a disaster flick"", but it doesn't have any of the symbolism or art-house qualities I was worried it would have because I really believed that would have ruined it. There were two scenes in the film that I thought tried to channel that and they seemed odd and out of place. Also Naomi Watt's nudity in the film is completely pointless and blatant. It seems as though because Watt's does nudity they felt it necessary to force it in there. It distracts from the point of the movie. Those two scenes and the brief nudity aside the film is brilliantly done and incredibly powerful pulling on your heartstrings nearly from beginning to end.The cast is really quite amazing. Naomi Watts does an amazing job at making you feel everything her and her family is going through and you will ache for her and feel her pain. She plays the part flawlessly and proves what a great actor she is. She deserved her nomination which went mostly overlooked. Ewan McGregor does a great job as well, playing the relentless father and husband desperately searching for his family. McGregor doesn't give the strongest performance in the film but I know he's a great actor and he is still great in his role. Their three kids played by Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin, and Oaklee Pendergast went completely under-appreciated. If anyone deserved an Oscar nomination it should have been Tom Holland who was simply breathtaking in his role as the eldest son dealing with losing his family and caring for his dying mother. He had several scenes that were awe inspiring for a young actor. Same could be said for Joslin and Pendergast who are so young and yet brilliant in their roles. The five of them have such incredible chemistry and you will completely believe their family bond which is so important for this movie.The only other film I recognize from Juan Antonio Bayona is The Orphanage and I have not seen that yet. Still, from this movie alone I am inclined to believe he is a truly talented director. He takes on a very fresh wound in making a film about the Asian Tsunami but it never once feels like its taking advantage of its victims, minimizing what happened or exploiting the situation. The cinematography is stunning and the initial scene of the Tsunami is literally gut wrenching. Your stomach sinks and you feel terror seeing that incredible wave coming towards them. Of course nothing compares to the real situation which was devastating and horrifying but this really does put it into a perspective we might not have seen before. I felt the film really did chase the good cry angle meaning they really play up the tearful reunions by saturating the latter half of the film with it but it works so what can I say about that. You won't be disappointed at all, but be warned that its not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. It certainly goes for the jugular when trying to shock you with certain scenes of violence and gore and Tsunami torn countryside but once again, it works. 8.5/10",The Impossible
34,Lejink,Underwhelming production of overwhelming tragedy,3,15 October 2013,"I'm sorry, I understand this movie is based on the remarkable true story of a family's heroism in the wake of the devastating tsunami which hit Thailand (and other countries) on Boxing Day 2004, killing thousands, but I just wasn't moved by what I saw on the screen.Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are barely together on screen long enough to project for the viewer any kind of meaningful relationship between them, their family of three young boys act stiltedly and unnaturally, while the dialogue is clichéd, ditto the dramatic sequences, the latter on innumerable occasions. The director isn't above cross-cutting between scenes at key moments for dramatic effect, a Hollywood M.O. from the year dot, but the manipulation here is so blatant and ham-fisted that the film somehow failed to draw me into the human drama here.The special effects for the tsunami and Watts and her oldest boy's subsequent odyssey in the aftermath of the disaster, I found only passable, at best while McGregor's acting in particular leaves a lot to be desired, being shallow and showy by turns. Watts has less to do, being wrapped up badly injured in a hospital bed for a large part of the running time, in fact any number of the extras were more watchable in my opinion.While I have nothing but admiration for the real-life family who somehow came through such a terrible ordeal, this formulaic, clichéd disaster movie didn't, I think, serve them well and rather ill-served its noble subject.",The Impossible
35,bowmanblue,A drama over a thriller,7,8 June 2014,"If, like me, you've become accustomed to Hollywood's recent obsession with disaster movies, then you might have expected The Impossible to be more of a fast-paced, tension-driven thriller about people trying to survive against the elements. However, this is actually more of a thoughtful, uplifting piece. Yes, we have some special effects near the beginning where a huge tidal wave decimates a holiday resort in Thailand, leaving numerous dead or missing, but the rest of the film is about a family who have become separated with each other, undertaking the monumental task of trying to find each other again in the midst of the aftermath.With Ewan McGreggor and Naomi Watts as leads, you can expect decent performances, but the stand-out character who steals many of the scenes is the young boy who plays their son and shows how he was forced to cope with growing up far sooner than he ever should have.It's a good film, if you're looking for drama and a real story of survival against the odds.

It is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie says it is a true story and if all of it is true and not embellished for Hollywood, it really seems impossible. It's about a couple and their 3 kids whom are in the tsunami in Thailand and their survival. First, I thought the special effects showing the rushing water and waves hitting were really good. I have no idea how they made it look so realistic. I don't know how anyone could not have drowned being in the rushing water with objects flying around.Then the rest of the movie is about the family coming together and finding each other in chaos.

37,g-bodyl,"Gut-Wrenching, Emotional Film!",9,28 May 2014,"The Impossible is one of the best films of 2012 and one that will stick with me for the ages. It's a powerhouse when it comes to acting and the story itself. The screenplay is not the greatest, but it does work for the most part. This is based off one of the most horrific natural disasters in world history and I won't be ashamed to say that my eyes were often moist during the film.J.A Bayona directs a film based one family's account of the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. With Maria, her husband, and he three sons separated from each other, we see how they struggle to survive as they try to find each other.The acting is terrific especially by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. Watts best scenes were in the beginning but she deserves her Oscar nomination. McGregor has many powerful scenes as well. It's safe to say that both give their best performances of their career. I also must give a special mention to Tom Holland because it choked up during the scenes when he becomes the caretaker and the protector of his mother during most of the film.Overall, this is one incredible film about how one family achieved the impossible. It's powerful and often very shocking. I remember this event clearly and it's one that I can never forget. The VFX was great as they recreated the deadly wave that killed many, many people. I felt like it was the actual wave, so the special effects team did a great job. Other than a so-so script, this is one of the best films of 2012. I rate this film 9/10.",The Impossible

39,secondtake,Brilliant depiction of a huge catastrophe--but the plot is linear and limited,7,13 November 2013,"The Impossible (2012)I'll start by explaining the big basics: this is extremely well done, but it only does what the facts tell it to do.So, it's amazing. It shows the effects of the epic 2004 tsunami on a group of British tourists. It shows the unexpected before scenes (life is gorgeous, nothing will intrude) and it shows the flooding huge wash of ocean itself (the rush of destruction). In a way, that's enough for a great movie right there. Maybe the before stuff is generic—rich Europeans enjoying Thailand for its beauty and beachfront motel. Great. But the incoming waters and their pure terror are presented beautifully, incredibly. It's not just the spectacular crash of the wave on the upscale motel and palm trees, but the many minutes (it seems like hours) afterwards as our heroes get pushed inland with all the debris. It's quite astonishing, and for this alone I think the movie is worth the time—at the very least.There is another half of the movie that is about the core family trying to find all its members, one of whom is trying to simply stay alive in the makeshift hospital amidst all the other victims. This part of the movie is also well done, and very believable. Someone has taken the time to get the facts more or less correct. If you watch this you will be there. You'll understand at least what a rich foreigner might have experienced in the disaster.However (and you knew a however was coming, I hope): that's all there is. Yes, you might think it's enough. All the heartbreak and celebration all the struggle for meaning and life and family, keeping sanity and the basics of food and heartbeat, all of this seems like it's self-sufficient. But really, as a movie, as a development and investigation into character and meaning, I'm not seeing what it boils down to.For lovers of the movie this will seem petty, I'm sure. But really, as a piece, as a work of ""art"" or ""moviemaking"" or whatever we expect from a film, it does often seem like a simple portrayal of a disaster. It's not that we don't empathize—I was in the grip of the problem for the main two actors. It's more that it's really not quite enough for a cinematic project. It's almost like a docudrama, a re-enactment. Well done, but that's as far as it goes.To put it another way, if you like documentaries, and you have some feeling for the colossal tragedy of the earthquake and tsunami, you might like this purely and simply. If you want a movie-like development and some kind of moral and narrative complexity, this isn't quite up to snuff. Which leaves it in your hands. See it, for sure.

Also I know Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for this but the kid that played Lucas should have been the one who was nominated. As far as the movie goes it was good, and I know it is a true story but it was really just too unbelievable for me to really get into.

That is just me and maybe I am heartless but I couldn't get past the totally ""impossible"" aspects of the movie.

43,ironhorse_iv,It's nearly impossible not to like this movie. It's a really good movie!!!,8,10 August 2013,"It's impossible to know during the first moments of a disaster, if you're even going to survive, or not. It's impossible to know if your love ones will end up dead or alive. Yet, there is a chance of possible results. It's call hope. Every living man wishes that them, and their love ones would never be harm by any tragic event. Hope is needed for surviving. This movie teaches people to believe in hope. The Impossible is an English-language Spanish disaster drama directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sánchez. It is based on María Belón's and her family's experience of the real life event of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The movie says it's a true story, but the movie changes a lot about Maria Belon's experience to the point, it seems less like a true story, and more like Hollywood trying to exploit a real life tragedy event to make money. The 2004 Tsunami is still in recent memory to a lot of victims when the movie was created in 2012. It's not like making a film about 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, where most of the victims are now dead. This only happen a few years ago. It still fresh in people's mind. So to see a Hollywood movie about it, is a bit too soon in my opinion. Still, at less, they produce a film with respect to all the victims, rather than offending most of them with a silly plot. The plot mostly stay with the source material. The biggest different is that the real life family were Spanish. In the film, they are played by English actors. While all the English actors did a swell job, in my opinion. Spanish actors would have made this movie more realistic. It's not like they couldn't find good Spanish actors. There are so many Spanish actors that I can think off my head to play these roles. I felt it was Spain's movie industry copping out, to appeal to with a broader audience, since most films industry shows white people as the main parts. Even some of the most Hispanic actors are chosen for roles because how light skin they are. It's rare to see dark skin actors in main role parts, and often they play second fiddle to those actors who are light-skin. I just don't like the concept of whitewashing. For a movie about, the Indian Tsunami disaster, there is a very few dark side Thais in this film. Most of them have little to no speaking parts, and just add in the background, so we know we're in Thailand. I know 5,000 people died in Thailand and half of those were mainly white Europeans. In Khao Lak where the film was located, almost all who died were foreign white tourists, most Thai deaths were in Phang Nga, Phuket and Krabi almost 50km away. I know it's not a documentary about the Tsunami, it is the story of one family, but I just thought as less, they can at less do, is give the Thais a voice in the film mentioning the struggle of the native people after this disaster, too. I heard that nearly all the foreign and Thai extras where actual survivors of this tragic event so why not. Any ways, the movie has English physician Maria Bennet (Naomi Watts), her Scottish husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Tomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oakley Pendergrast), are on Christmas holiday in Khao Lak, Thailand, in 2004. The tsunami triggered by an earthquake floods the area with overwhelming destructive power and all of them are separate from each other, not knowing if they are alive or dead. Naomi Watts spent most of the movie, injury, and barely alive. She does a great job in this role. I was happy to hear that she was nominated for Oscar for Best Actress award. I have to also give big props to Tom Holland, who really gave this movie, the heart it needed. There was a commanding scene where he can't find his mother at the hospital. Ewan McGregor give one great powerful scene with the cell phone sequence. It nearly had me in tears. The ending was a bit disappointing as they make themselves seem like they don't care about Thailand, and look like rich snobs. The movie should had ended at the hospital, not there on the plane. I know its air ambulance, but gees, it looks awkward as they look like they were escaping on a private jet first class. I have to say the disaster effects were astounding. The tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave created in a water tank in Spain. I like how the director was committed to working with real water, rather than a computer generated wave, because he wanted the story to be authentic. Seeing Naomi Watts, and Tom Holland in the massive water tanks gave the movie, its realistic point. The whole Tsunami sequence was just too damn scary! The parts where Maria was being cut up by sharp items was tough to get through. The shot of her leg wound, and the follow up shot of her breasts that looked like they were hanging from her skin was just hard to watch. It is one of the most frightening re-creation of a real life disaster, I have ever seen. Overall: It's nice to see a movie with a lot of hope, rather than watching a depressing film of lost. It's one of the few disaster films that make you care for all the main characters in the film. I have to say, go watch it indeed. You will believe in hope after seeing this film",The Impossible

One of the problems is the singular focus on a tourist family. With all the devastation to the locals, it is hard to sympathize with the plight of an affluent white family.

That's nothing even near what happened in real life. Well, let's forget about that flaw for a minute and let's focus on the story as it is presented.The fact that this movie is totally fixated on 1 family is rather narrowminded. Tens of thousands of other people have died, but we dont get to see them much. This tsunami disaster was only used as a plot for a sentimental tearjerker movie, in which 2 parents and their 3 children are constantly moaning and crying in a hospital. All being depicted in such a sentimental (violins!) way, that it soon becomes rather tedious to watch.Just a bland hollywood movie that has used the biggest natural disaster to milk out a sentimental script.

As its pace and running are very Spanish, hence the different running and longer focusing on reiterations and longer scenes. I am not very much into statics and several times I found myself in using (fast) forward function. Due to my imperfection, I guess... :) The cast is, however, brilliant, especially Naomi Watts as Maria Bennett and Tom Holland as Lucas Bennett; Ewan McGregor as Henry Bennett is great as well, but he spends less time on screen. On the other hand, because of the use of known actors, the viewers can shortly guess the outcome even if without prior knowledge of the story.

49,freemantle_uk,An Emotional Drama,8,25 April 2013,"The 2004 Tsunami was one of the biggest and most destructive natural disasters in recent memory, creating damage from India to Indonesia and causing at least 230,000 deaths. One of the worst affected countries was Thailand and thus was born The Impossible, a film from the creative team behind the horror film The Orphanage, director J.A. Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sánchez set out to show both a personal story as well as tell a wider tale about the Tsunami affecting that area.Henry and Maria Bennett (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) and their children Lucas, Tomas and Simon (Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast) are a British family who go to Thailand for a Christmas vacation. But they are separated when the Tsunami hits, with Naomi and Lucas caught in the wave and ending up seeing the chaos and the confusion that the disaster caused. As Lucas battles in a hospital to get his mother the medical attention she needs, Henry sets out to find Maria and Lucas, something that seems to be a hopeless cause.One of the best features of The Impossible is Bayona's great ability to show both the scale of the disaster and impact it has on the landscape and people whilst still showing a personal story. Bayona recreates this with his wide shots and helicopter shots, that recreate the massive devastation the wave caused to both to manmade structures and the natural landscape, showing the large death toll and he is able to immerse you into the chaos of the aftermath of the tight hospital area with vivid detail. For a film with a PG-13 rating, it is surprisingly gory and Bayona does not put his punches when showing the extent of Maria's injuries. Bayona also gives us an instance sequence when the Tsunami waves hit as Maria and Lucas struggle to reach each with all the dirt and debris in the water. It is feat of special effects, drama and action. Bayona knew the impact of the Tsunami and brought out the harrowing nature of the disaster in its fullest.McGregor, Watts and Holland all give very emotional performance and the trio are excellent bring out their characters in the themes of parenthood and the child-parent relationship and bond. Despite the subject manner of The Impossible the actors and the director bring out the theme of hope and how they either must keep it or how they can provide it to others.The Impossible is a weepy of a film and it wants to brings its audience on an emotional roller-coaster, but it can be a bit manipulative at times. Bayona does this a number of times with children being put in peril and families being reunited in slow motion and sentimental music to match. This is an obvious attempt to tug at the audiences heart strings; but it is at times over done and over played as it tries to elicit as much emotion as it can muster.The Impossible is a very actuate film that excels that showing both a personal story and the wider situation of the disaster. It is more then a simple weepy because of its themes and how it shows impact of the Tsunami. The Impossible is an excellently acted film and Bayona's direction is high hitting, even if it's occasionally a little too heavy handed.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",The Impossible
50,meeza,Natural-Disaster Movie Mission Accomplished!,8,24 February 2013,"It is a mission impossible if I don't include puns in my movie reviews. And that is the case also in my review for the tsunami–themed film ""The Impossible"". One of the worst global catastrophes happened when I inadvertently put a ""new wave"" spin to movie reviews by pestering them with puns. OK, I am kidding, even though some of you might concur with that sentiment. In reality, one of the worst global catastrophes ever was the 2004 Thailand tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. ""The Impossible"" is based on a true story of one family that miraculously survived the Thaliand tsunami disaster. Naomi Watts stars as the mother of the family named Maria; she is a doctor who visits Thailand for a Christmas vacation with her husband Henry and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon. Maria gets seriously injured in the tsunami and separates from Henry, Thomas, and Simon. Maria does find the eldest son Lucas in the rapid tsunami waters. Therefore, Lucas' mission is to get help for her profoundly injured mother; while Henry, Thomas, and Simon's mission is to find Maria and Lucas. Director Juan Antonio Bayona's impressive reenactment of the Thailand tsunami on film was quite a feat for this aspiring filmmaker. His directorial future is nowhere close to being a disaster. Now, I did have some minor complaints with Sergio Sanchez' screenplay; even though it proficiently verbalized the power of the human spirit, it was lacking a bit of character development, so I was not entirely swept away with Sanchez' scribe. Naomi Watts was outstanding in her Oscar-nominated leading performance as Maria. The underrated Ewan McGregor was also exceptional as Henry. And child actor Tom Holland is headed to Hollandwood, I mean Hollywood child stardom with his stirring performance as Lucas. What I found to be the most disastrous in the aftermath of ""The Impossible"" was the disheartening omission of a Best Production Design Oscar nomination for ""The Impossible""; I guess the ""old wave"" of geriatric Academy members did not catch the brilliance of Production Designer Eugenio Caballero's work in the movie. I do think ""The Impossible"" is an emotionally-charged movie that will make it impossible for you not to shed a watering tear. So make it possible to catch ""The Impossible"". **** Good",The Impossible
51,estebangonzalez10,An uplifting movie with great performances,8,14 January 2013,"¨The most scary bit for me was when I came up and I was all on my own.¨The Impossible is Spanish director, Juan Antonio Bayona's, follow up to his 2007 hit El Orfanato (The Orphanage). He has decided to change the genre, but still manages to direct a great film. This is a very powerful and emotional family drama about the true story of the tsunami that hit the coast of Asia in 2004 and a family's struggle for survival. The film is based on the main character's story: Maria Belon and the screenplay was adapted by Sergio Sanchez who had previously worked with Bayona in The Orphanage as well. The story was really well developed although sometimes the film felt a little over the top with the melodrama. Films always add a few elements to spice up the story a bit so I can't say how true this movie is to what actually happened in real life, but what I can say is that the Spanish family this film is based on is played here by a British one so there are some changes. Anyway, The Impossible works really well as a family drama and many people left the theater with tears in their eyes. This is a tear-jerker, so if you're an emotional person this film will pull your strings, especially through Naomi Watts's performance who gives a powerful and a very physically challenging one. Her Oscar nomination was very well earned although she probably won't be the winner. The film also succeeds in the technical aspect as the tsunami is beautifully shot and one of the greatest scenes in the movie considering it is one of the worst national catastrophes of our time. The imagery will remain in your head.Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts) travel to Thailand for their Christmas holidays alongside their three children: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). They are having the perfect family vacation in the beautiful coastline of Thailand in a lovely villa. Along with several other tourists they spend Christmas Eve together and the next morning the kids open their gifts. Everything seems to be going lovely, and then all of a sudden out of the blue a giant wave comes roaring across the entire coastline taking everything along its path. We follow the wave as it washes over the entire place, then the camera follows Maria and Lucas as the current has washed them far away from the villa. Maria is badly injured, but she is glad to have Lucas by her side. This is the story of their fight for survival and struggle to reunite with the rest of their family. The tsunami scene is terrifying as we see the terrible effects it had on the population, and isn't an easy watch, but it is worth it because it has an uplifting story.Naomi Watts has been receiving a lot of recognition for her work in this film, and she is truly amazing, but I thought Ewan McGregor also delivers a great performance as well and many people have ignored him. The children in this film are also great here, especially Tom Holland who should have received a nomination for his work in this film. He shares a great chemistry with Naomi Watts and holds up his performance to hers. My only complaint for this movie is that it goes overboard with the melodrama and intends to have everyone leave the theater with tears in their eyes, but it truly is an uplifting story. It is worth the watch and I recommend it because it reminds us that with faith we can achieve impossible things, and that we shouldn't take things for granted because things can change drastically from one moment to the next. Life is fragile, but love can conquer all. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Impossible
52,arthur_tafero,Harrowing and Rewarding - The Impossible,8,4 November 2020,"There were many ways this film could have been mediocre or worse. But directero Bayona does a very skillful job of creating scenes that are both truly dramatic and believable; a difficult combination to achieve. You will be hard-pressed not to become emotionally involved (as in a tearjerker) as the film evolves, but the harrowing special effects combine well with the actual unfolding events as we see the horrific endurance of the mother (Naomi Watts) and the premature coming of age of her eldest son. A very worthwhile film to view.",The Impossible

I actually watched it twice with the rental, picking up little bits I'd missed the first time through. In my re-watch it was interesting to see the family 'before' after witnessing their 'after'. All clean and uninjured, careless and happy.The actual tsunami scenes are fantastic, very well shot or CGI'd(?), but its the aftermath with all the bloody (realistic) injuries, the hospital scenes and the chaos going on around the separated family as they try to find each other that really drew me in.More than once I questioned the decisions made by the adults (I'm pretty sure I'm not leaving my kids anywhere) but that's another reason I liked this so much, -what would you do? Outstanding performances from Naomi Watts, you can feel her pain and fear and also Ewan McGregor and the boy playing their oldest son Lucas.A couple of events towards the end had me thinking really!? That's convenient, but still a great film.

56,3xHCCH,Young Tom Holland Carries This Film!,6,10 January 2013,"""The Impossible"" was about the disastrous 2004 tsunami in Thailand. It was heart-pounding to see the devastating wave rise up so unexpectedly and heart-wrenching to see it completely destroy an entire unsuspecting town. The director did not spare us from the gory things that happen under the rampaging waters, where the humans (particularly, Naomi Watts) get seriously wounded with the various debris that hit them underwater.We follow a family of five who miraculously survives the disaster. At first we only see the mom Maria (Naomi Watts), then her eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland). As Maria was taken to the hospital to treat her serious leg injury and Lucas looks after her, we see that her husband Henry and two younger sons also survive with minor injuries. Following a suspenseful series of near misses in the hospital, the family, and the audience, were rewarded with a gloriously touching, inevitably tear-jerking reunion scene.I do not really understand why Naomi Watts is getting the lions' share of the awards buzz, even getting an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. In fact, young Tom Holland deserves it more with numerous difficult scenes he had to do when Naomi was already rendered bedridden by her severe injuries. Ewan McGregor was no slouch as well, but he had limited screen time compared to Naomi and Tom.I thought that this film was too long, despite the fact that the tidal wave already struck within the first 10 minutes of the running time. We do not really know the central family that well. There were several scenes that seemed repetitive and just added on to prolong the basic story, or to heighten drama, like Naomi's slow-motion surfacing from the water scene. Apart from a few winning scenes, as a whole the film is, unfortunately, also water-logged.",The Impossible

58,aharmas,Best Film of 2012 Without a Doubt,10,28 December 2012,"Based on a true story, ""The Impossible"" works at every possible level. Its portrayal of a family in distress after the tsunami devastates the island where they are vacationing is terrifying and moving. The audience will feel the horrors of being in the middle of the natural catastrophe and the heartbreak and pain the characters feel when they face death, the possible loss of a child or partner, and the unbelievable journey trying to find each other.Naomi Watts plays Maria, a mother who is suddenly separated from her husband and two children and must now deal with wounds that threaten her life while trying to provide some emotional support for her oldest child. She gives probably her best performance ever, as we see her dying in front of our eyes, and her eyes convey the helplessness she feels as she begins to realize she might never see her family again. Her spirit is a fighter and she never stops helping others, but it's devastating to see how she is losing her battles in front of our eyes. Thank God for Lucas, her boy, as he keeps giving her hope and now becomes her anchor to life.Ewan McGregor plays her husband, and he's in the midst of despair, not knowing what has happened to the rest of his family. He, like his wife, must now depend on the kindness of strangers. One amazing scene has him on the phone, breaking down, expressing his deepest fears. It's one of the most heartbreaking scenes I have ever seen in the movies.The film doesn't hide any of the emotions in any character. There is pain, horror, desperation, and plenty of kindness and love. In fact, the film wouldn't work if this wasn't the heart of the movie. In the darkest of time, strangers can surprise you. There is Daniel, who appears like a little angel and brings a tear and a smile in the middle of the worst of times. We see parents reuniting with their children, and hope is alive again. People reaching out and proving that life is worth living and one must never give up.Geraldine Chaplin has a small but beautiful scene as she gives comfort to one of the family's children. They look at the stars, using them as metaphors for the beauty and light they give us. They're still with us, even though they might physically be long gone.There are incredible special effects, transporting us to the middle of the disaster, allowing us to understand the horrors of the tragedy. The make up crew does wonderful work, bringing incredible detail to the hell the hospitals were, and much credit should be given to the music, never overpowering the rest of the film but giving it much soul and atmosphere, keeping up with the best ensemble work of the year.Where is that Best Picture trophy?

A very realistic picture about the devastating force that a tsunami can cause and it demonstrates how tiny we human beings are despite our high-tech knowledge when facing natural phenomena .The title of the movie on its own is already a whopper of a spoiler, but personally I would rather just see this small miracle about a whole family surviving this disaster instead of seeing a movie about the thousands who didn't survive. ""Youtube"" is full of tragic films,pictures and photos of victims. That this movie was overflown (sorry...) with a Hollywood sauce is perfectly normal. Had they filmed it as realistic as in reality, this would have been the most sickening movie nobody is waiting for. That's why they left out half of the real story.You could predict it would be a very emotional movie. I'm not a sensitive person, but at times I found it pretty difficult to keep it dry (How appropriate).Nevertheless, some annoying things for me personally:They could have shown how the father and his 2 little sons managed to survive it - The moment they missed out on each other at the hospital was a bit exaggerated - Maybe the father really did this, but I can't understand how he could leave those two little toddlers behind. I am a father and I would never leave my 2 little kids behind after surviving a calamity like this.Watts and McGregor did some superb acting. But the biggest achievement was made by the three sons. Especially Tom Holland. Admirable performance.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Impossible
60,dalydj-918-255175,The Impossible is truly horrifying in a good way,8,4 January 2013,"""Watts and Holland are two of the most important parts of the film and them plus everything else going on in the film is what makes the film as great as it could have been based on a true story"" Just over 8 years ago the world was shaken when off the coast of Thailand a massive tsunami hit that ruined the lives of millions of people. This film focuses on the Belon family went on a Christimas holiday to Thailand. On the day after Christmas the coast was rocked by a massive tsunami. The rest of the film shows the tragedy that came from the disaster and in the main family we see Maria (Naomi Watts) and her son Lucas (Tom Holland) be separated together from Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their two other children Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast).No one who was caught in this disaster could really know how it felt to be pushed and pulled by the giant waves but I believe this film does a good job at recreating what it might have been like. Juan Antonio Bayona's direction of the film is great especially in the scenes where Lucas and Maria are pushing and pulled by the waves because it looks so real and is heart breaking. Bayona's choice to film those wave scenes in a big water tank was smart because without using a green screen the actors look more like they are really struggling. The story throughout is heartfelt but some scenes do not seem believable but when the film shows us the relationships between the characters that is where the film shows how great it is.Naomi Watts plays Maria Belon and she was as amazing as she always seems to be. She is so great throughout the film and really is the heart and soul of the film for me because she made me feel emotional through her performance. Her character goes through the worst tragedy that we mainly focus on and by the end of the film when she must be physically hurt and lie down on beds she plays those just scenes just as well as her early scenes. Ewan McGregor plays Henry Belon and even though he is the film less then Watts he does get some scenes that show off his acting skills very well. In one of his particular scenes when he rings home he just makes you cry as his character finally breaks down. Tom Holland plays Lucas and he is just as great as Watts and while he does not have to go through such physical acting as Watts he is just as great as she is.The film was very moving for me overall through the performances and stories told. Even if the film is tragic throughout when the family have their reunion at the end it is earned but also uplifting this this horrific true story.MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Naomi Watts)",The Impossible

62,jadepietro,An Improbable Truth,8,19 January 2013,"This film is recommended.The Impossible could have easily been retitled The Improbable with all the changes that director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez stuffed into their disaster drama, foremost being the nationality of the real Spanish family becoming Anglo-Saxon embodiment of Naomi Watt and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles of Maria and Enrique Belón a.k.a. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett in the film. The Impossible tells of their harrowing survival during their 2004 Christmas holiday at a tropical resort in Thailand when they became victims during a devastating tsunami that killed and injured over 200,000 people.The film almost immediately begins with its realistic depiction of these horrific events. The CGI sequence of the tsunami is frightening in its power and effectively chilling, even more skillfully done than in Clint Eastwood's film, Hereafter. ( It really deserved to be an Oscar contender in that category, yet it was inexplicably overlooked. )After that disturbing sequence, the film settles in for scenes of destruction and suffering, as seen through the eyes of the Bennett family members. Images of the dead or dying, the wreckage of property and human lives, everything surrounding them...in turmoil. With each new day comes an insurmountable obstacle, a sense of hopelessness and further despair. Whenever the film stays with those hardships and keeps its realistic edge, the film excels in its unflinching point of view. Where the film comes a bit undone is in its eagerness to overstate its uplifting and life- affirming message. There are some fine moments of genuine drama in The Impossible before it becomes awash with needless melodramatic lapses and enough sentimentality to get those tear ducts flowing in overdrive, not only for the film's actors, but more so, for every movie-going audience members.Perhaps the film's finest asset is the exemplary acting by Naomi Watts and newcomer Tom Holland who plays Lucas, the oldest son. Their unique emotional bond as mother and child is convincingly natural. Both actors seem to convey the courage and stamina that was needed for the real-life tragedy and encompass the human spirit and compassion that prevailed over difficult and grueling times. ( which probably could include the endless submerged filming and physical demands of their roles in this movie ). Also strong in a supporting role is McGregor. With less screen time, he efficiently captures the sense of loss and frustration as he tries to piece together his family. All in all, the acting in this film is outstanding in so many subtle ways and helps to make the film even more compelling.But ultimately, The Impossible seems to suffer more from a lack of conviction by its filmmakers in telling the so-called true story. They have undoubtedly created a well-made film. Yet they can't resist the urge to embellish the real events. Rather than believe in the essential truth in this tale of survival, Bayona and Sanchez play fast and loose with the facts. ( Yet another example: The real survivor lost half of her leg, but obviously the filmmakers thought that aspect is a tad too depressing for today's moviegoers. Instead, more family hugs and tearful embraces will suffice. ) After all, who needs the truth when half of that will get you that false feeling of hope and happiness, plus maybe a little more profit at the box office! Oh, if only the filmmakers had as much courage as their real-life inspiration. Then, and only then, would The Impossible have truly become The Impressive.

63,Seraphion,Great job on the effects and story dramatization,7,28 September 2014,"The movie opens up with the terribly horrifying sound effect, promising some sort of suspense thriller. The story then builds upon the characters and their time there for a while. The center theme of the tsunami comes quite unexpectedly in this movie, just like the real thing did. It's especially so if you're not counting the days and nights since the first time marker at the start of the movie. The effects really nicely grasped what the tsunami did. The makeup on the wounds are also quite exceptional that the close up shots of the wounds make me twitch my eye brows a bit. Yet the real thing is that if you think Thailand was the worst hit place, you should really see Aceh back then. Aceh now have a tsunami memorial monument, a tanker that got carried so far into the land. Naomi Watts really showed that her experience made her into a great actress, especially in acting out the pains. It's just quite strange that she didn't put in any extra weight on her to better depict a mother with three kids.

65,RainDogJr,"Comforting, but brutal too",7,23 February 2013,"Two weeks ago my girlfriend and I went to the movies and decided to watch two movies instead of the usual one; we didn't think much in our double-feature, I mean in the selection which certainly needs always to be featuring two similar films but not for the obvious reasons (like for instance just because both were directed by the same dude, as Tarantino once remarked), but we just based our selection in the show times: FLIGHT at 17:00 hrs. and THE IMPOSSIBLE at 19:30 hrs. We knew both were not feel-good experiences, but the similarities we found between them were more than we expected and luckily the double-feature was just damn right, with those magic movie moments – going out from a film that shows and is based upon an air crash to enter to one that begins with a sequence inside of a plane (not to mention that only a couple of a weeks ago I had enter a plane for the first time in years!). FLIGHT (Robert Zemecki's comeback from ""motion capture"") and THE IMPOSSIBLE (Juan Antonio Bayona's first feature since 2007's EL ORFANATO) are about the consequences of, respectively, an air crash and a natural disaster. The structure in both is quite similar and none takes much time to show us the disaster (the big, important sequence we all know exists and therefore are waiting); in fact, both do it in a not very different way and at the moment of the impact (of both the plane with the surface and the tsunami) everything gets confused, the lose sound, certainly they are trying to put us in the victims' perspective. Both films bring us hard and sad issues during almost the whole time to end in an optimistic note (the characters that suffered find some light). ""Classic Hollywood style"" you might be thinking, and yes, both are comforting for the average viewer (especially THE IMPOSSIBLE) but at the same time never forget that their subject is a tragic one – in FLIGHT the main character doesn't have the best ending (even if he finally finds some peace) and in THE IMPOSSIBLE the horror of the 2004 tsunami is always well exposed. The great Terry Gilliam once criticized Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, saying that ""they save those few people, happy ending but that's not what the holocaust is about, it was about complete failure of civilization to allow 6 million people to die"". Also, Gilliam compared the Spielbergs of this world with the Kubricks (it was Kubrick actually who first said that ""SCHINDLER'S LIST is about success and the holocaust was about failure""); the first ones give you answers (""even if the answers are stupid"") and comfort the audience, while the second ones leave you always intrigued, make you think and provoke ideas and discussions. When you make a film about a human tragedy, namely the holocaust or one natural like the 2004 tsunami (which caused the death of approximately 280,000 persons), you're taking some important risks. When you decide to place a story about hope in any of those tragic scenarios, well, you're taking even more risks. THE IMPOSSIBLE begins with the words ""based on a true story"", and in fact this is remarked when the screen only shows ""true story"". Juan Antonio Bayona had to do that for obvious reasons, as the main story of his film is the one that comes for every 10 thousand tragedies of the tsunami. Some images are simply brutal (a truck full of dead bodies, for instance). THE IMPOSSIBLE could be thought as a movie with a completely different horror to the one of EL ORFANATO – a graphic horror, which requires a daring work especially from its main actress Naomi Watts. And Watts is indeed daring, great and leaves no doubts why she got nominated for the Academy Award. It would be easy to ""destroy"" THE IMPOSSIBLE as Gilliam did with SCHINDLER'S LIST, because and as I already said, Bayona's film turns to be comforting, with a climax that's totally a ""movie thing"" (even when it's based on facts), and since it constantly shows the good side of things (the protagonists helping other victims and vice versa). However, Bayona perfectly understands what this tragedy is all about – yes, the protagonists' ending is a happy one, yet in the same scene we can see the other people that weren't as lucky still suffering the consequences. For this I would say that in this film Bayona has aspects of both, the Spielbergs but also of the Kubricks of this world. *Watched it on 08 February, 2013",The Impossible
66,p-stepien,Tragically empty,3,10 February 2013,"Boxing Day. 2004. After an underwater earthquake a tsunami hits the shores of East Asia. A family of five Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three kids: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) are blissfully spending time on the shores of a Thai luxury hotel. Unexpectedly the wave hits them unawares while having fun in the pool. Soon the family is torn apart with Maria and Lucas swept away and Henry holding the two youngest sons disappearing in the undertow.Juan Antonio Bayona delivers a spectacular recreation of the tsunami with its destructive currents leaving a destitute landscape in its wake. Given this ordeal and its scale it seems obvious that when the water settles the ensuing drama of dealing with the aftermath will take over. At first we follow Maria and Lucas, who stick together even with the risk of life, thankfully manage to come out alive, holding each other in embrace. Grateful at least to have each other, and as they fully realise the miracle of surviving the incident the obvious dawns on them - the inevitability that the remainder of the family is most probably dead. Naturally anyone privy to seeing a trailer or even knowledgeable that killing the only recognisable star (apart from Watts) five minutes into the movie is highly unlikely knows that Henry is bound to reappear. Couple that together with the all-telling title ""Impossible"" and soon the obviousness is obvious: The whole family will impossibly survive. Thus making the whole rabbit run around the devastation in search of family members a prolonged path to the inevitable conclusion, which makes the tidal wave seem nothing more than a minor time-consuming inconvenience. Unfortunately this search for family constitutes the remainder of the story, albeit it also offers sights of all-engulfing chaos and scenes or glimpses of families not as lucky. The whole plodding certainty as to the finale is finally put to ridicule during a comedic runaround at a Thai hospital with family members 'just missing each other' for five or so minutes, which - despite the sombre music - invoked some badly placed laughter.""Impossible"" proved somewhat of a conundrum. The whole event itself is so dramatic, that it is hard to denigrate a heart-warming story connected to it. But the shock factor and then layered sentimentality on offer by Bayona is just so overwhelming, that I never really felt for any of the main characters, even more so that the conclusion was apparent once the waves rescinded. Given how emotional the premise, I found myself astounded that I just didn't empathise despite Bayona's obvious attempt to milk the audience (and I am easy person to jerk a few tears out of). But maybe that was the problem? The manipulation of tear glands is just too forced. All in all a bloated cutesy waste of a spectacularly well made catastrophe with an overbearing message: that in such a deadly calamity it's good to be rich and white... As soon as the family reunites they are whisked off in an empty private jet to the safety of first class hospital care. Shame the movie didn't end immediately after the tsunami...",The Impossible

He's pulled his best visual punches with still 2/3rds of the runtime left. This might be solvable for other directors, but Bayona is unfortunately lured or becomes reliant on substituting dramatic music into way too many scenes to try to instill emotion. What ends up happening is a complete over-saturation of the music, and in effect a cheapening of the event. Family-members are re-united with triumphant strings and grand score over and over and over. It starts to seem phony and tedious. To top it off, Bayona likewise relies much too heavily on focusing on the gore of the injuries. Too much dripping blood, cuts, or lacerations do we need to witness through close-ups.

However, if done well, you get something magnificent like ""The Impossible.""Yeah, I cried. I felt empathy for the characters because they felt like genuine people. I felt like I was there with them through their tremendous struggle. As it is the case with sappy films like this, I'm sure some people won't buy into the film's melodrama. But I did.

71,Sergeant_Tibbs,The virtue of human kindness,8,28 January 2013,"The Impossible looked like a very sentimental, unnecessarily sprawling and messy contrived film where the white family saves the locals but in fact, it's the opposite, it's about community and saving your neighbour and features all kinds of nationalities in dire situations together. When our protagonist family is in trouble, they are helped and then when others are in trouble, our protagonist family help them. Human kindness is one of the most underrated virtues in cinema and how powerful it can be. The end of 127 Hours where Aron Ralston finally finds people after being isolated for so long drags me to tears every time I see it. The Impossible, while it's not as cathartic because of the quantity, features human kindness to this level in all of its sequences. It's a real emotional roller-coaster that's brought to life by its director as the script does show risks of being sentimental and contrived, it's played in exactly the right way. Although the characters are a little underdeveloped, they are more vehicles for archetypes, it still hits hard. And it's wonderfully overwhelming.As Juan Antonio Bayona is a director of horror, having directed the popular The Orphanage 6 years ago now, the terror of the soon-to-be-iconic tsunami scene is horrifying. There's a realism and a scale to it that pinches your gut. With the breath-taking sound design and precise editing, it's a masterwork in suspense despite knowing what's going to happen from the trailers. It's a truly immersive scene and every bump is felt. Although there is a hint of realism in this sequence with a surprising amount of gore, The Impossible is one of the most cinematic films I've seen in a long time, especially with its sweeping and near impossible cinematography, having all those cranes in the water. While I feared it would be too epic for its own good, it goes to a manageable and focused scale that it makes work and still manages to be intimate. Naomi Watts is astounding. She's probably the best actress today who can show pain and she marries the physical, emotional and psychological pain with the emotional core of her character incredibly well. She gives one of the best performances of the year for sure.Tom Holland is a welcome lead to the story and his bond with his mother is one of the most moving things about the film. Ewan McGregor is great in his role, despite not seeing him for the first half post-disaster, and highlights the value of compassion. Unfortunately, the film does lose some momentum after the reunion scene as there is little left to resolve for the last 20 minutes. I thought they were going to save it for the climax but it was just as cathartic as I hoped for. It does give it a brief feel of being procedural at that point as a mere retelling rather than storytelling, a factor that has been bugging me for 2012 when films have underwhelmed. But an ambiguous revisit to the tsunami brings things full circle and reminds us what an unforgettable moment that was. The Impossible is pure cinema and personally, finally brings scale to a traumatic event that I remember hearing about and not comprehending when I was 12. Maybe bad trailers are a blessing since it's the only way I can be surprised when they knock down my expectations. Maybe The Impossible grows on me.

This is the true story (so it's said) of a family of five (father, mother and three small children) that goes on what was intended to be relaxing holidays in a seaside resort in Thailand but is suddenly caught by a horrible tsunami that puts them on the verge of losing their lives in the question of a couple of hours or even less. The mother and the eldest son are swept miles away by the razing stream while the father and the other two children manage to keep themselves more or less unhurt by managing to climb to trees around the resort. The mother is however severely wounded by hitting herself to several heavy objects on her forced and violent course. Each of these two groups know nothing of what happened to the other and even suspect that the others could be dead. Although a tsunami is a rare phenomenon the story in its terms is a normal one I mean that in any similar circumstances it's normal that each member of a family who is separated from others by a catastrophe does all efforts to look for and find the others. But the great merit of the film resides not only on the dramatic scenes and episodes of the desperate father's search of his wife and eldest son but also on the intense emotional happenings and experiences in which the story is told and develops itself till in the end the five members of the family are again reunited due also to a few coincidences and incidental events (i. e. the difficulty in starting the engine of the small lorry where the father is to be carried away of the hospital where his wife and son were without having being able of finding them, which delays its departure and allows that father and son meet at last)which are nevertheless totally acceptable in terms of verisimilitude. And the images of the tsunami razing everything in its course and of the fight of mother and son against its violent and tumultuous stream are appalling and and overwhelming and filmed with unsurpassable realism. To end it up we must refer the acting which is very good mainly of the eldest boy (Lucas, performed by the young Tom Holland).",The Impossible
73,Muhammad_Rafeeq,Extremely captivating film about a family's true survival story during the 2004 tsunami ( Spanish A+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,9,2 March 2020,"Beautifully made movie. Most real life stories are turned into over dramatic Hollywood movies, but this movie was not that. It was genuine and heartfelt. Not over dramatic and fake. The acting was so amazing you will bawl your eyes out. Beautiful story of a beautiful family and their strength.",The Impossible
74,omendata,Shameful...,5,15 July 2018,"Although the film was well produced I just could not believe that it focused on the lives of a rich white family and although most of the maimed and dead were Thai there was virtually none shown as part of the movie which is a complete disgrace and how it could have been left out I really have not a clue - If I was Thai and had lost people I would have found this film to be very disrespectful and disingenous!Apart from the fact Ewan McGregor is one of the most over-rated actors and he is a fellow Scot I just cannot stand his poor acting skills and his attempts at various accents , in particular he cannot decided whether he is American or British in this film. Watts and the young boy give exemplary performances however so it does merit a fair few stars but would have been so much better if it had been a fairer representation of what the Thai people have experienced.One other thing that really gets my goat - if you check out all the real reviews on here you will notice they are around 1-6 stars then as soon as the real reviewers are posting along come the 9 and 10 star reviews in batches of between 5-10 - each profile having done only one review in their lifetime its so obvious the movie producers are paying people to ""big up"" the films ratings and its very sad that IMDB do not have a policy of monitoring and removing these shills.",The Impossible
75,rivertam26,Harrowing,9,4 January 2013,"What happened in Thailand was truly a nightmare. One that I didn't really think about until I saw this film. The Impossible is a harrowing sometimes too intense emotional journey that although flawed has a truly powerful impact. Naomi Watts in a stellar performance and Ewan McGregor solid as well star as the parents of 3 young boys on vacation in Thailand when the Tsunami hits. The initial impact when the terror happens is daunting to say the least and handled with a suspenseful hand akin to Spielberg's in Jaws. The film that follows that scene is at times emotionally manipulative and frustrating in some spots but the overall effect is successful. What happened there was awful but the fact that this family survived is truly a miracle. Visually the film is gorgeous with tracking shots of the event, slow motion sequences that are breathtaking and lighting that really illuminates the emotions behind the events being depicted. It's a strong film from Director Bayona who made his mark with the brilliant horror film The Orphanage you can see shadings of the genre here with some questionable but intriguing directorial touches. All in all it's a great first film of the year and I really hope it sets a benchmark for the films to come. 4/5",The Impossible

78,pyrocitor,The real disaster proceeds the wave,6,1 June 2016,"We've had our share of ""torture porn."" Now, we've evidently entered the age of ""disaster/survival porn."" And, although the latter is far more hopeful, less sadistic, and infinitely better Oscar bait (you're welcome, Leo), they have more in common than you'd think. And J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is all we need by way of explanation: a humbling, powerful story of tragedy and resilience transmuted into such tastelessly exploitative Hollywood schlock that the real feeling of survival comes from making it all the way through to the end credits. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was particularly horrific insofar as it was so unexpected, but it's a quality rarely evident in Bayona's account of it. Things start promising, as the initial scenes of inane banter of our posh family on Christmas vacation in Thailand are inoffensively credible, pleasant with just the right whiff of foreboding. Just when we start to let our guard down, we're blindsided by a tsunami that's as terrifyingly stunning a cinematic set piece as we could imagine. In terms of disaster spectacle, The Impossible excels, blending flawless CGI and practical effects to capture the horror of the wall of water and devastation it unleashed in a gruesomely engrossing fashion, shot so abruptly and breathlessly that it's wholly immersive, and bereft of distracting Hollywood affectations. The terror of the tsunami contrasting with the beauty of the panoramic Thailand scenery is poignant in itself, as the serenity of the beachside landscapes are strewn with fastidiously recreated apocalyptic wreckage and debris. Taken as a short film chronicling the experience of the tsunami itself, The Impossible is excellent. But this isn't enough. At the risk of clumsy non-sequitur, the only thing dancing through my head as The Impossible unfolded was Michael Caine in The Prestige musing ""It isn't enough to make something vanish; you have to bring it back,"" and how inappropriate such a Hollywood anthem can feel superimposed onto real tragedy. Granted, the real life story of the Álvarez/Belón family surviving and reuniting throughout the disaster is astonishing and inspiring, but it's done a disservice here, warped by dubious Hollywood social politics and gruesome emotional manhandling. Focusing on a single privileged white family over all the Thai locals (let alone the asinine recasting of the original Spanish source family) who were largely more ravaged and destroyed by the tsunami sits uncomfortably, and makes the film's increasingly broad scrabbling for a 'feel-good ending' distressingly tone-deaf. ""Based on a true story"" nullifies spoilers, so we know all five members of the central family are going to survive, and Bayona contriving cumbersome sequences of 'how will they find each other?!?' dramatic irony amidst a backdrop of all the broken families, Thai and tourist alike, who haven't been so lucky, grates increasingly. Fernando Velázquez's cloying musical score only makes it worse. There is some solace in some of the hopeful beats amidst the refugee medical evacuation procedure which breathe more genuinely (it's nigh impossible - ha - to repress a deluge of smiles witnessing Tom Holland reuniting separated survivor families in the hospital). Still, Bayona climaxing with a sequence of Naomi Watts' protagonist reliving a flashback fetishizing each individual debris wound while caught in the tsunami before clawing her way up to the surface in agonizing slow-mo, is so idiotically offensive and grossly manipulative that we have to continually remind ourselves that it's through no fault of Watts' work or her real-life equivalent that we'd almost rather she just stay under the water here. The cast, to their credit, are superbly committed to conveying the agony of their nightmarish scenario, even if most of their dialogue is calling out each other's names. Watts conveys the weight of her torment remarkably convincingly, while wisely weaving in subtle notes of irritable humour throughout, which helps stave off us getting tired of her howling and whimpering in pain for an hour and a half straight (she could have given a useful note or two to Leo in The Revenant in this regard). Ewan McGregor is as charismatic as ever, but he shoulders the worst of the film's melodramatic suffering and operatic screaming, and grows tiresome very quickly, particularly when his character makes the jaw-dropping decision to abandon two of his young sons to look for his wife and son #3. As such, it's 'soon- to-be-Spider-Man' Tom Holland who walks away with the show here. Embodying battered, weary resilience stupendously in his slight, springy frame, whether he's belligerently yelling at his mother to stop vomiting blood or breaking into an irrepressible grin at seeing other families reunited, there's never a moment he's not viscerally believable. He's the spark of life and hope that keeps the film afloat, and we miss him desperately when he's not on screen. While The Impossible has its moments, thanks largely to the power of its big- budget tsunami recreation and strong work from Watts and Holland, it's mostly useful as an illustration of Hollywood's general inability to appropriately do justice to events of large scale tragedy and suffering beyond the sensory onslaught of the spectacle itself. 2009's Tsunami: Caught On Camera tells the same story through compiled found footage and interviews with survivors, and captures the devastation and inspiration of the disaster and those who survived it in a far more honest fashion. Unless you're a CGI buff, or keen fan of the cast (or just scoping out a pre-Civil War Spider-Man), see that instead. -6/10",The Impossible
79,blumdeluxe,Impressive story with a lot of Hollywood,7,25 May 2019,"""Lo imposible"" tells the story of a family on vacation in Asia when a tsunami hits the coast, seperating them and leaving them on a desperate search for each other in a destroyed land.The film is based on historic happenings, in fact many viewers will still remember the terrible floods that hit South-East Asia around 15 years ago. It looks a bit clean in the beginning and paints a stereotypical Hollywood picture of a happy hard-working family but once the catastrophe starts to unroll, producers managed quite skilfully to catch and portray the emotions that such a dramatic series of events necessarily evokes. There are not huge twists or surprises, rather it's just what you would expect from a major production that deals with recent catastrophe. Which isn't always a bad thing because it means a professional production, decent acting and powerful images but it also has its downsides.All in all this is a more than solid approach to this topic that delivers a powerful story and makes you thankful for the life you have. It could have been a bit more rough and less Hollywood in my opinion but that's a question of taste.",The Impossible

The Impossible tells the true story of a family's suffering and how do they survive this natural disaster and unite in the end.The Impossible is a brave attempt by Juan Antonio Bayona(The Orphanage)and scripted by Sergio G Sanchez which is based on the horrific account written by Maria herself. Hats off to the director for dealing with the subject so sensitively and yet making it to the detailed level and what actually really happened on that unfateful day. The Tsunami attack was executed properly though the length could have been extended( The best Tsunami attack was captured in Hereafter). However, this movie tells aftermath of Tsunami attack. The scenes shot in the hospital and the chemistry between mother( Naomi Watts) and son(Tom Holland) is the highlight of the film. The screenplay will keep you intact. Editing is good. Cinematography was good but not great. I like the last scene where Naomi Watts was thinking about the underwater incident while actually getting operated. Story is well-written and captured on silver screen. Naomi has given her finest performance and shares a great on screen chemistry with Tom Holland. Both of them haven given stupendous performances.

The family whose experience is the basis of the film is Spanish but in the film, they are depicted as English. Possibly, this decision had the intention of drawing in more English-speaking viewers. Although this decision might reduce the authenticity of the film, the consolation is magnificent performances by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor as the parents and some great child performances - especially from Tom Holland.""The Impossible"" takes on the major challenge of dealing with one of the greatest natural disasters in history that is in recent memory for many. For the most part, it succeeds quite well.The family bonding at the beginning is well set up to connect the audience with the main characters but without getting overly sentimental. The tsunami itself was very powerfully filmed, creating a very gripping experience. Credit must go to director Juan Antonio Bayona and his special effects team.The aerial shots of the crowd scenes during the aftermath also showed great skill on Bayona's part. The only flaw is that the scenes seem to show little or no hardship of the local Thais; they seem to concentrate mainly on the tourists. Hopefully, another film can expose the plight of Asian residents during and after this disaster.

83,natashabowiepinky,Not the holiday they'd planned...,8,22 November 2013,"There is a word for this film, which is based around the great tsunami which killed so many people in Thailand at the end of 2004, and that would be 'harrowing'. If it's not the sight of graphic injuries infected by dirty water, there's also traumatised people looking for their loved ones, dead bodies being fished out by the score... BUT as a celebration of the human spirit, it is absolutely fantastic. If this story really is as true as they make us believe, the family involved are a true credit to society.

At the time of the tsunami I was in another part of Thailand about 1 hour by jet away from where it hit, yet I could still feel the after shock of it. The movie is superbly yet horrifically presented and the children in the picture give the stand out performances especially the actor Tom Holland.

85,gregsrants,Strong Emotional Journey,8,11 September 2012,"Another of the many World Premieres showcasing at the Toronto  International Film Festival with hopes of Oscar glory is, The  Impossible, the true story of a family's struggle to reunite after  being violently separated when the tsunami hit the beach of sun soaked  Thailand in 2004.  The film stars Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as the two parents of  three young boys that were vacationing in Thailand over Christmas when  the tsunami devastated the country and shocked the world.  With a prerequisite set-up of the main characters, the tsunami hits  early in The Impossible and packs an incredible punch. As the wave  crashes through the hotels pool area and sweeps away the five members  of the family, we watch in terror as Maria (Watts) and Lucas (Tom  Holland) struggle to stay above the raging water and within arms  lengths of each other.  Once the water settles, the badly injured Maria and Lucas begin a  journey of survival without knowledge as to the fate of the missing  three members of the family. Lucas is forced to mature beyond his years  and assist in getting his mother to a hospital for immediate emergency  attention and is the key to the more emotional scenes that conclude the  film.  The Impossible is only the second film made using new 3-D sound  technology (the film is in 2-D) and the crashing and fast flowing water  sequences can be heard, and almost felt, throughout the entire theatre.  When not fully engrossed in our characters' plights and emotionally  tied to their survival, we are thoroughly repulsed by the graphic  scenes of bodily destruction that blood soak the screen. Director J.A.  Bayona is no stranger to horrific make-up effects as he was the genius  behind the camera for The Orphanage (2007) and he pulls no punches  here. Some audience members were seen turning their heads unable to  ingest the graphic nature of effects and few were even seen exiting  while the scenes played out in long detail.  Thanks to the trailers, we know (generally) how the movie concludes.  But just like Ron Howard's masterful Apollo 13, J.A. Bayona still keeps  us at the edge of our seats even with an ending that is both clear and  true to the original story.  The Impossible does have its shot at some Awards glory. Watts and  McGregor pull off incredibly emotional and physical scenes and films  that deal with real life tragedy and the human spirit that overcomes  those tragedies usually find favour with award voters.  But whether or not The Impossible gets any gold plated hardware it does  not take away from the tiring and emotional journey that audiences will  take with their characters. The Impossible is the best depiction yet of  the Indian Ocean tsunami and the horrors that succeeded it. It is also  one of the best movies we have seen so far this year. Packed with equal  scenes of tearful drama and graphic horrors. And although the wave is  the catalyst that propels the plot, the characters are so strong that  the big wave that hits the resort will hardly be the thing you most  remember.",The Impossible

87,jdkraus,"It demands our surrender to its bold-stroking energy, its characters, its film-making, and above all its tear-jerking take of survival, humanity, and hope.",10,6 January 2013,"""The Impossible"" is one of those movies that will move you to tears. Not necessarily just from sadness, but for hope and humanity. Based upon a true story during the horrific disaster in Thailand eight years ago, this movie follows the journey of a family that is torn apart and forced to both survive and look for one another in the face of impossible odds. Naomi Watts plays the mother, Ewan McGregor the father, and their sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas), and Oakie Pendergast (Simon). Juan Antonio Bayona crafts this film intelligently and with confidence. For the first ten minutes, he creates an earthly paradise for this family—a nice hotel room with a view of the beach, a flying lantern contest at night, and a swell swimming pool to attend. Then, the wind starts to blow violently and the ground shakes. Thunderous sounds of water, people's heads turna tidal wave crashes through the hotel, tossing debris and people around like toys—ultimately separating this family. The next hour of the film centers on the mother and her eldest son Lucas as they try to survive through the elevated water and disaster. Fortune eventually seeks them at a hospital. The second half of the film focuses on the father's perspective as he tries to find and unite the rest of his family. The conclusion is predictable, yet the performances and the filmmaking quality not only puts us on the edge of our seats, but also draws us into the emotions and traumas of these characters. The actual disaster sequence is short, but told only from the character's viewpoint. There is no wide shot like in ""Hereafter"" where the film shows a flood washing away buildings and people alike. This does not mean that there aren't any visual effects. There are used sparingly and are very impressive—like ""Titanic,"" it is frightening to watch as water overwhelms the characters in a scene. No movie could ever fully capture what really happened, this movie certainly peers into the gates of this hell and devastation. The sound effect designers do a phenomenal job of emphasizing the terror of the tsunami as well as the more subtle scenes. I can close my eyes and picture exactly what is happening on the screen. What really succeeds in this movie is the cast. Each actor makes the character their own and they display a versatility range of emotions. Many people, especially fellow Hollywood actors have praised Naomi Watts' performance as Oscar-worthy. She is a true genius. When it comes to expressing pain look no further than her role in ""21 Grams."" Here, she combines both agony and hope into a solid mixture. One scene that particularly comes to mind is when her character is alone with her son Lucas. He goes on, ranting the rest of their family is dead. The look on her face in this moment is beyond words to describe. While Watts is worthy of a gold statue, Ewan McGregor gives an equally compelling performance. Unlike Watts, his character drove me to tears, especially when he makes a phone call to his folks at home. Tom Holland stands out the most. He starts as a typical preteen adolescent, but grows larger-than-life as he overcomes perilous obstacles and helps bring other people together. Some accolades for his performance would be amicably. Sam Joslin and Oakie Pendergast are adorable as the younger kids and they do a great job.After seeing this movie, it is safe to say that this is one of 2012's best movies. It demands our surrender to its bold-stroking energy, its characters, its film-making, and above all its tear- jerking take of survival, humanity, and hope.",The Impossible
88,MattyGibbs,Pretty disappointing,4,18 November 2013,I was looking forward to watching this film but unfortunately was left underwhelmed. It starts of very well and the cast is pretty strong apart from Ewan Macgregor who just sleepwalks his way through the film. I am a big fan of Naomi Watts and she does an excellent job in this good in this as does the lad who plays her eldest child. After a bright start and some decent CGI of the tidal wave the film loses steam very rapidly. The storyline is flimsy and I just didn't care enough for any of the supporting characters. It drags on and on with just the odd scene managing to elicit some interest. Personally I'd have rather they had concentrated on the build up to the Tsunami rather than focus more on the aftermath.It's not a bad film just a film that could have been so much more than it turned out to be. I can't say i'll be rushing to re-watch it anytime soon.,The Impossible
89,griffolyon12,It's All About the Actors,8,4 January 2013,"Director J.A. Bayona's survival film, The Impossible, tells the harrowing true story of one family on vacation in Thailand on December 26th 2004, when the historic tsunami hit and separated this family. The whole film follows two different stories: the oldest son (Tom Holland) with his injured mom (Naomi Watts), trying to get her to safety, while the other two sons and their dad (Ewan McGreggor), search for his wife and son.The Impossible's script never really fleshes out the backstories of these characters, but what makes the film so affecting are the in-the-moment performances by the actors and the tense direction from Bayona. The way Watts, McGreggor, Holland, and the other two child actors that make up the family, play their roles is where the film lives. They take the events that they're given, and even though there is nothing to their characters that inform how or why they'd make decisions, the actor's decide to make their decisions based upon primal instincts of what one would do if their loved ones were lost or in danger.All of the child actors are perfectly cast, and teenager Tom Holland actually has the largest role in the film, delivering a soulful performance showing an emotional maturity that few actors in his age range have. Then Watts and McGreggor both re-enforce why they're two of the premiere actors in the industry, with one close-up shot where Watts is being dragged to safety through the disaster area, being a moment worthy of Oscar contention.While The Impossible's script is lacking in depth of character, the raw nature of the performances and the directing, as well as the beautiful cinematography, makes The Impossible a film worth seeing, but be warned, the rawness of seeing such devastation and physical injury could be unsettling for some moviegoers.I give The Impossible an 8 out of 10!",The Impossible

92,meydiana-65242,Based on a true terrible event,10,18 October 2020,"A terrible event ... but a moving film
THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012)The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami's awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a ""true story,"" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family's three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami's effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn't try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.",The Impossible
93,WriterDave,A Near Perfect Tear-Jerk Thriller,9,31 December 2012,"The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is brought to shockingly realistic life in J. A. Bayona's ten minute sequence near the beginning of the harrowing true-life survival tale, ""The Impossible."" With little to no CGI and using mostly scale models and a giant water tank, Bayona throws the viewers into the wave along with stars Naomi Watts (astonishing) and young Tom Holland (revelatory as Watts' son). Told from the point of view of a family on holiday in Thailand, the story makes for a riveting family-centered emotional drama. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well, and there's a strong humanist approach applied to depicting this wide-spread multi-national disaster.It might pull on the heartstrings a bit ""too much"" in some sequences, but the manipulation is apt in telling this real-life drama.Overall - an unforgettable, draining but uplifting film experience.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com",The Impossible
94,Laakbaar,Not just a disaster flick,8,18 February 2013,"It's psychologically difficult to imagine the scale not just of the 2004 tsunami itself, but of the human suffering it caused. The only way to grasp it really is to focus on individual stories (remembering that millions of people each have a similar story).In this movie we follow what happened to an ordinary (British?) family, Maria, Henry and their three young sons. The depiction of the tsunami not long after the start is harrowing and at times difficult to watch. You cannot help but wonder how on earth they could have filmed those scenes (or created them using computer graphics, if that's what it was).Fortunately this is an intelligent, sensitive film that does not attempt to recast these events as a cheesy Hollywood disaster film.For the rest of the movie, we follow the family members to see whether they have all survived and, if so, whether they can find each other in the post-disaster confusion that followed.The performances here were all first rate. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are fine actors, and they deliver worthy performances in this film. The scene in which Ewan McGregor breaks down while calling his family moved me to tears. Some superb acting there. Tom Holland also shows much promise as a young actor.If this movie has a fault, it's in its unrelenting tugging at the heart strings. ""Suffering porn"" and ""shamless tear-jerking"" were the phrases that came to mind while I was watching parts of it, although in hindsight perhaps that is quite unfair. The director had to walk a fine line in creating a film like this. After all, a quarter million people died, and many, many others had far more devastating experiences than this family.The film succeeds magnificently in showing us a little what it must have been like to live through this tragedy. (However, I haven't read the other reviews so I don't know if the survivors feel that way about the film.) Ultimately, this is not so much a story about the tsunami as a story about a family's love for each other.",The Impossible
95,billygoat1071,A Family Survival Story,8,3 March 2013,"The Impossible is based on a true story about the devastating tsunami in Thailand. Many might wonder why is the film's focused victims are tourist families. Are they trying to let the audience relate to the characters since most moviegoers are probably like the leads of the film? That is my only theory, so far. At glance, it looks like a light sentimental family drama but it is surprisingly disturbingly tragic. It is surrounded by darkness and endless emotions, the overall experience is stirring and depressing. It serves an excellent direction and outstanding performances. The film can be heartwarming but it never avoids showing the most horrifying parts of the incident.It's intriguing to know about what happened to the other victims but the movie is really about one of the families who survived from the tsunami. They are the point of view that deals with their own situations, though they get to explore around and help other people. It is ought to be a life changing journey that would inspire many, but no matter what, it didn't gloss over the terrible aftermath. It still shows the violence and the disaster that can be pretty hard to stomach to watch. The film is generally about hope and love of family. Most of the victims they show are parents and children who are looking for their missing love ones and won't give up until they find them. I guess that's the whole point of it. It leaves being intriguing to what happened to the rest of the tragedy.The acting is exceptional enough to settle this journey. Naomi Watts gives such an endearing performance. She carries her character's pain and struggle which easily makes us care about her. Ewan McGregor also brings some real sympathy to his character. The rest keeps it compelling as well, especially young Tom Holland who shines in his role. In the filmmaking side, the direction is magnificent. The scene when they are trying to swim through the floods is amazingly crafted. It provides a lot of suspense and tension which enhances more to the experience than just showing off emotions. In other parts, it all looks decent.The Impossible didn't forget about the heartbreaking realities of the events. It's fortunately not one of those true stories that makes it all light for a safer family fare. This film is actually good for the family even if it gets pretty sad and violent. Well, that is what that incident really is, but even though everything may seem hopeless, there will always be that powerful love that will motivate someone to have the courage to reunite their love back. That is probably the only point of the story and we could deal with that. It still concerns about the land that was destroyed by the tsunami. Too bad there isn't enough information about it. Overall, The Impossible is a spectacularly compelling cinematic experience.",The Impossible
96,brett-76260,Great flick,9,3 February 2019,Much better than I expected it to be and I have to say the acting was first class. Man Ewan can put on a performance and thought he was outstanding. Even the kids pulled off some great and believable roles. Sad day in history but seeing this kind of story is quite moving and humbling. Well with a few hours of your time,The Impossible
97,christophe92300,Mediocre,4,1 December 2012,"The Impossible is visually very good: appealing photography, great special effects, good overall cinematography. And that is all one will remember about this movie, because it obviously lacks ambition and a strong script.Everything unfolds very (too) linearly and Bayona served up every cliché of the genre in a badly, clumsy manner: emphatic shots, slow motions, omnipresent violins... too much pathos kills. The director may be Spanish but it seems the movie comes straight out of the Hollywood emotions factory. Moreover, the dialogues seem bland and for the most part not that well written, one may even begin to question their credibility. The movie also looses a lot of dynamism after the hour mark, it then becomes very, very long until the final -and predictable- outcome.Disappointing.",The Impossible
98,TheSquiss,"Powerful, numbing film of one miracle amongst 227,898 tragedies.",8,7 January 2013,"On Boxing Day 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami devastated swathes of bordering landmasses. It wiped out entire communities, reportedly eradicated an entire race and amassed a death toll of 227,898 people in fourteen countries. From this horror emerged the story of a family who survived and found each other amongst the destruction. It was a story both fantastic and seemingly impossible. See what they did there? The Impossible opens with a couple of horrible scenes that scream ""You WILL love this perfect family!"" and demands we know exactly how wonderful and worthy of our crossed fingers they are. My heart sank and I slouched into my seat, resigned to a horribly saccharine experience. And then The Impossible caught its reflection in the mirror, shuddered and got on with being a very fine film indeed.It's not perfect. Firstly, the family is French. Last time I looked, Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and the boys were not. So why were they cast? Box office takings! I'm willing to bet the average British and American cinemagoer, the desired demographic at least, couldn't name more than one French actor (Gérard Depardieu) or a couple of French actresses (Audrey Tautou, Marion Cotillard) and they don't make a pretty couple or open a movie stateside. One suspects the final reuniting of the family is tidier than in reality and it dampens the emotional impact of all that has preceded, but running time constraints make that understandable.Less acceptably, while The Impossible understandably focuses on one family, the peripheral characters are almost entirely tourists. Tourists accounted for approximately 9,000 casualties but little attention is given to two hundred and twenty thousand (give or take) indigenous victims other than showing they helped the injured tourists. Hmmm.And the most frightening scene in the entire film is a truly horrible Carrie-like hand emerging (from the sea rather than a grave) to an endless violin explosion that is entirely nauseating when complete silence would have been infinitely more powerful.However, The Impossible is emotionally stirring and rather than simply tugging at heartstrings mawkishly, it draws us into the horrific situation. In a similar way to the Omaha Beach sequences of Saving Private Ryan, we feel the physical pain of Maria (Naomi Watts) as she is bounced, pounded and pierced by debris under water. Frequently the audience recoiled and inhaled sharply in unison as the utter destruction, to feeble bodies more so than landscape, was unavoidably apparent. As a toddler mewed like tortured kitten, the reality of the impact the tsunami had on so many people struck hard and doubt I was alone in imagining myself in the situation of losing those I care most about.The physical effects (apparently probative cost kept CGI to a minimum) are blisteringly good. To me they were shockingly realistic and more impactful than I had imagined and my thoughts have been echoed by some who were there. Forget cheesy Poseiden water effects, the unforgiving wave is breathtaking and you'll grimace as it smashes with its initial destruction and then withdraws and returns for another attack. And another.Director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) cleverly staggers the horror throughout the film so we aren't blasted with an hour of annihilation followed by endless schmaltz. He weaves it carefully throughout the story so that we cannot escape the reality or slip into carefree comfort but must endure the constant reminders of how truly horrific, how cataclysmic the tsunami was, not just on one Boxing Day but for the days, weeks, months after. Years later the land is still scarred and the dead still do not breath and Bayona takes care to show us this without taking us so far out of our comfort zones we cannot 'enjoy' The Impossible.The star names this is pinned on are superb throughout (overlooking the initial scenes). Both McGregor and Watts have their moments centre stage and their anguish is palpable. It's been a very long time since I cried in the cinema but I wiped moistened eyes more often than I'll admit and my throat felt larger than it should. When Henry borrows a phone to call home but crumples, it is not only McGregor's remarkable performance that induces tears, it is the way he drags us into his situation with him and we find ourselves thinking not 'Who would I call?' but 'Can I remember their phone number?' Once again, after Beasts of the Southern Wild and Jagten, the child actors astound in their ability to match their adult counterparts. Though the younger sons have little weight to carry, Tom Holland's performance as eldest son Lucas is remarkably mature and marks him as actor who just might have the depth and ability to sustain a career beyond puberty. There is such reality in his performance as a son desperate for his mum to hold and reassure him, but called upon to help her live. As she coughs blood uncontrollably, he yells at her ""Stop doing that!"" masking his terror with heartbreaking anger. At various times throughout The Impossible, I looked upon Lucas and his brothers and considered no child should be forced to grow up so quickly.The Impossible will surely be criticized for being sentimental but that is both harsh and unfair. This is no Titanic that we'll look back on with embarrassment. This is a remarkable true story of something close to a miracle that occurred in the midst of chaos and obliteration but, even in the moments of elation, Bayona remains grounded and one family's joy is cause for both celebration and damnation as less fortunate survivors wander past, watching in aloof desolation.The Impossible is a numbing experience that will sit with you on your journey home. One miracle does not erase 227,898 tragedies.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",The Impossible
99,davidgee,Best docu-drama since THE PERFECT STORM,8,10 January 2013,"After last week's LIFE OF PI, another film that relies for its impact on spectacular Special Effects. Based on the true story of a Spanish family who miraculously survived the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed over 200,000 people, THE IMPOSSIBLE makes them an English family, the Bennetts, who are in and around the swimming pool of their beach-side hotel on a Thai island when the great wave hits.The film has been criticised for concentrating on the fate of one white family when so many (mostly non-white ) people died in the disaster, but the director gives us glimpses of others caught up in this terrible event (some, we are told, played by people who were really there). And the dramatic focus on the Bennetts gives the viewer a sense of involvement: this could have been ME - and MY FAMILY. There are a couple of moments when the script seems to produce too many coincidences, and some of the scenes are unashamedly manipulative - tears are literally jerked out of the viewer.The film's 114 minutes fairly fly by. The family is very easy to ""identify with"". Naomi Watts and Tom Holland give vividly believable performances. The moment when the tsunami hits the resort has the most awesome impact since the sonically-induced disturbances in creaky old EARTHQUAKE (1974). This is the most exciting and most persuasive 'docu- drama' since THE PERFECT STORM. It's kind of awful to admit this, but I really enjoyed being taken back to the tsunami!",The Impossible
100,danielmanson,Meh,6,9 May 2020,"Okay okay. I know it's based on the tragic events of the tsunami, but I just had some issues with the film and plot.Pros: Tom Holland was fantastic in this, I typically don't like child actors in films, but I thought he nailed this role. No wonder he got picked up for Spider-Man! Acting from Naomi Watts was also great!
The first 15 minutes was fantastic, shot really well and it really illustrated the moments it all happened. Also enjoyed how it focused on one families story rather than adding loads of characters.Cons: Annoying cliches are a constant, turning around slowly etc but the one that bugged me the most was when they were all looking for each other and would keep missing them by second. Look, we know they are going to all meet up at the end stop teasing it's just really really annoying.
Didn't really see the point in the final 25 mins of the film, I won't go into detail but what you expect to happen, happens but then you have a further 25 mins of film to continue. Felt forced.
I read in a lot of reviews that people were angry with the portrayal of this rich white family who sodded off in the end on a private jet and I get where they are coming from. Just sayingOverall it's an okay watch, illustrated the events pretty well. Just could have been done better to be honest. 6/10 is still pretty good though",The Impossible
101,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Post Disaster Film,6,24 January 2013,"THE IMPOSSIBLE is not entirely a disaster film but one more centered on persistence and courage during the aftermath of a horrible real life tragedy.We begin with an American family on an airplane during a sort of busman's holiday to Thailand. The patriarch, Ewan McGregor's Henry, has business in Japan. Along with his wife and three kids, they're your typical family and not without problems.The oldest son Lucas, played by the talented newcomer Tom Holland, isn't very sympathetic of his little brothers, who aren't entirely comfortable flying. Some subtly tense moments have the plane undergoing turbulence as Director Juan Antonio Bayona plays with the character's built-up stress and fear for the unknown. That is, we know what's coming but they don't.When the family checks into a fancy hotel and settles poolside, the nature surrounding the hotel is poised and just too quiet, eerie. Cut to the chase: when the Tsunami arrives, thundering in from the ocean like a roaring beast, the special effects are pretty amazing but the characters don't get lost in the mix.Naomi Watt's Maria and Lucas are swept up and taken for a very jolting ride throughout the ravaged, water-filled countryside. The first act deals with surviving the thrust of the water and most important, remaining together throughout the harrowing, bone-crushing journey.When both mother and son wind up at a makeshift emergency hospital, and Maria is severely injured and must be operated on, the action centers entirely on Lucas frantically roaming the grounds, passing messages back and forth to other families. This becomes his story – kind of an EMPIRE OF THE SUN about a young man forced to think on his feet and grow up quickly.When we cut to Henry (McGregor), waking up within the ruins of the hotel and reunited with the two youngest sons, the movie becomes more of a searing art film than a struggle for survival. Not only is this segment not as interesting, it lacks the desperation of Lucas's plight, which is returned to sporadically.Although Ewan McGregor's intensity to rediscover his loved ones, and Naomi Watt's fight to survive her very severe injuries, are impressively acted and important to the overall story of a family reuniting, this is really the story of a young man caught in-between a tragic catastrophe and the determination to beat the impossible odds.",The Impossible
102,osj2507,"Strong, overwhelming and emotional film",8,12 September 2015,"This is a very strong, overwhelming and emotional film, I guess that the real family suffered more then they show on this film, based on real events, must have been a very difficult film to make in this case.Naomi Watts is very great at her part, a though one with physically demanding parts and a very hard role to make believable, but she definitely makes it work and gives a very fine presentation. Also the rest of the cast have strong roles and make the film both entertaining, dramatic, heart-warming and charismatic.There are some very fascinating scenes, the Tsunami itself, the wasteland they walk through and the endless masses of people in need of attention at the hospitals.Strong film, strong cast that tells the story of this strong family that unlike many others makes it through and survives the perils.",The Impossible
103,ClaytonDavis,Watts and Holland own it...One of the Best Pictures of the Year!,8,28 September 2012,"A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Starring Academy Award Nominee Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, the film tells the TRUE story about a family vacationing in Thailand when one of the worst natural disasters of our time separates them.In the opening credits of the film, Bayona tells the audience that the story is true, but what may bother viewers and critics is how coincidental and inflated the story can seem. If it weren't in fact true, the film would fail within the first few moments. It's the notion that this did occur that demonstrates and heightens the execution of Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez so brilliantly. The Impossible is the most emotional and devastating picture seen since Paul Greengrass' United 93 (2006). In the first several minutes, I was already in tears. Letting up only for short breaths, I feel like I didn't stop crying the entire time. I was invested, full body and soul, riding among the victims in a frightening state of mind. I could only imagine myself there, terrifyingly so and with appreciation now that I wasn't. The brave and committed performance by Naomi Watts is the miracle of the film and possibly the entire year. Watts falls into the role of ""Maria"" with perfect precision and accuracy. As a person who's only been a father for a year-and-a-half, Watts puts me right in the moment of unimaginable fear and pain. An Oscar-caliber turn as I've ever witnessed. The entire first half of the film is shared with Tom Holland, a child actor that can only be described as well beyond his years. Holland is motivated and equally as afflicting as Watts. A performance like his can only lead to more roles for him in the future. Ewan McGregor, who unbeknownst to me as gone this long without receiving any type of Oscar attention is pure magic. He shows an effortless approach as Henry, a father desperate to find his family. If there's one poor criticism about the film it's the first half of the film, where Holland and Watts dominate, is so gut-wrenching and brilliant that when McGregor and his story enter the screen, it unfortunately just pales by comparison. McGregor isn't given the most of character development to chew through but it's still an admirable work.Cinematographer Oscar Faura's orange and yellow camera work demands the utmost attention from the viewer, gaining a near first-person view of what could have been. It's a technical achievement of the highest levels. Fernando Velasquez's somber score will only build the tears even more as your catapulted through this reenactment of terror. J.A. Bayona's direction is simplistic but delivered with reverence. A fine directorial turn.This is a film that must be experienced by all. As you lay in your cozy beds tonight, take your loved ones for granted as they walk by you, and breath the air you so blindly feel entitled to, think about if at one moment, one single moment, from now, it was all gone. The Impossible dared me to be a better human being, a notion not many films will or attempt to convey. I'll try to listen.It's one of the best pictures of the year!Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",The Impossible
104,richieandsam,Excellently executed.,8,23 August 2013,"THE IMPOSSIBLEI remember watching the news at Christmas time in 2004 and thinking how bad the Tsunami hit the world. It made a very happy time of year a disaster there were over 200,000 deaths in numerous countries around the world. This film is about one families fight to survive and be reunited together.The film is shot so well. The whole thing is so realistic and scary. It brought back memories of watching the news. It is a sad story this film really does show how dangerous nature can be. Life is a precious thing and we should all cherish the time we have together, because all it takes is one natural disaster and it is all over.Anyway back to the movie. The direction of this film is brilliant and deserves praise. The film was directed by J. A. Bayona. He has a bright future ahead of him if he sticks to making films like this.The acting is really good from everyone. It was a very honest and heartfelt performance from the cast. Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin & Oaklee Pendergast star as the family. The children in the film also did a great job, which is hard seeing as all child actors are generally annoying and really bad at acting natural in front of a camera. But all 3 were brilliant.The only negative things I can say about this movie is it does not answer all the questions. You meet characters in the movie that are on a similar quest to find their family, but you never find out if they find them. I wanted to know I had to Google it afterwards and you can find the answers that way, but they should have included it in the movie.The other thing that I was a little bit disappointed about was the choice of actors yes, they did a brilliant job, but the family this film is based on is Spanish why do we need an actor from Scotland and an actress from Australia? Why couldn't they find decent Spanish actors and kept it more to the real story. I know all true stories have changes in them and made up bits, but this was one I thought was pointless.The emotions through this film is strong there are some very sad moments and some very happy moments. You really do get to connect with this family and the people they meet on the way. Not knowing if you family is dead or alive must be a horrible feeling and their search is so long. The film is a roller-coaster from beginning to end and it is a great ride to go on.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Possible the best natural disaster film ever made.""Go help people.

105,dfle3,Harrowing and emotional experience,8,29 January 2013,"After the tsunami hits in this true story, you really get a feel for the aftermath...I love the aesthetic of the holiday resort...it just looks really horrible and the cast and extras look suitably ragged. The special effects and effects are just great. In Hollywood movies when you saw a tsunami, it would be towering over a skyscraper, which just looked incredible. Seeing the news footage of the tsunami at the time, it was a different kettle of fish, but no less bleak. ""The impossible"" really captures that moment and what happens afterwards.In one of the news stories I read about the even, it was mentioned that tourists on the beach noticed how far the tide was out before the tsunami hit. That strikes me as being invaluable information, turning a ""That's weird!"" observation into - hopefully - a realisation that you need to run to the hills, so to speak, to save your life. However, this bit of crucial information is not mentioned in the movie, which I do feel was a pity...it could have been introduced somehow.Anyway, this movie is about one family's (the Bennetts) experiences of the tsunami and the aftermath...not knowing if they would live through the initial surge, worrying about further surges, and wondering if/how many of their immediate family have died in the initial surge.There are many scenes which establish how nice and good this family but the worth of this movie is in how raw emotion moves you. Naomi Watts as Maria, the mother of 3 young boys does just that, and is deserving of her acting award nominations. The moments where she does make you feel her agony deserves recognition...perhaps even winning any such awards. Ewan McGregor as Henry, the father also has one powerful scene. The one bum note in this move for me was where Henry came across as the 'star' of the movie, instead of just being someone in the same boat as everyone else...I mean how the non-central characters got involved in his story. It just rang false to me...because his plight was no more or less important than anyone else's. Tom Holland has the eldest Bennett boy also has some very good scenes where he powerfully conveys emotion. I'm not sure that the performances are of a consistently high quality, but when they hit those heights, Naomi, Ewan and Tom certainly deserve recognition for their acting. They truly moved me.This movie is a good candidate for recognition in the fields of acting and special effects and effects, costume and the like. There are some scenes of injuries suffered in the tsunami which are definitely not for the squeamish though.Have noticed at least one professional reviewer mark the movie down for substituting a white, Anglo family for the Spanish family this movie was based on. That seems really pedantic to me. The credits to demonstrate a very big Spanish role in the making of this movie, so it looks like a conscious decision to maximise the audience for the story in the West, and a photo of the actual family is shown at the end.If I was to quibble, the start of the movie emphasises the ""true story"" aspect of this movie whilst it does have some very Hollywood like coincidences which didn't seem plausible. Maybe such coincidences did actually happen to the family, but in the movie it just seemed contrived...but not in a way which devalued the experience.The end credits lists ""tea boys"" in the crew...that must be a first, surely? Pity I missed the person who ""always says...""...not sure if that was sourced from the original family or not...they do get mentioned a bit.",The Impossible

I guess what most people liked was the fact that it really happened to a family and it tugged at their heartstring, because cinematographically speaking, it's not worth much. Most of its fault are certainly the consequence of sticking to facts. That better done in a documentary.There's basically no rhythm to the movie, the scenes are just thrown one after the other, just like in real life, but with the polish of a movie, which is a bad dichotomy. I mean, the ""homemade"" video sequence is no such thing. We just get jangled around a little bit more. The editing is poor. In some places the reaction times are stretched to push more drama. A big mistake. There's also the failure to capitalize on real drama. At times, the script just falls on its face for logical reasons.The special effects are excellent though.I can't recommend this film unless you love real stories, family drama, and are interested in the 2004 tsunami.",The Impossible

Still it's able to put you right there in the horror with two easy to empathize leads and a handful of bafflingly wonderful child actors.You expect this kind of extra-impressive acting from the two old pros, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, but these new kids, especially Tom Holland plying their son Lucas, are at least as effective. Never caught the slightest false move on any of them. Now how is that possible? They've certainly never had to live through anything quite as horrific and yet you would swear they have.Somehow the tsunami itself looks real as does the landscape in its aftermath. We've just spent some time on a beach on vacation and this movie brought it all back. Even the family's dirty and disheveled state looked right in every way.Quibbles might include some unnecessary near misses as they searched for each other and what might have been an overblown rendition of one lead's physical state, but I could just as easily believe this was the way they remembered or lived it.",The Impossible
113,SumanShakya,The Impossible .... a nice film on Thai Tsunami......,7,14 November 2013,"""The Impossible"" manifests the disasters led by the 2004 Tsunami that hit Thailand in December. The film chronicles the story of a couple with their three sons who come to a Thai beach during the Christmas vacation and face one of the greatest catastrophes and get separated from the Tsunami. Perhaps one of the major films on Tsunami after 8 years of its occurrence, it tries to revoke a theme on disaster and succeeds to a par excellence in terms of narration, acting, and photography. At times the film has a feel of a docudrama and at times even becomes digressive but on a whole, the film is rich in emotions and melodrama and succeeds in bringing the harrowing experiences led by a natural catastrophe. On a whole, though not the best family film I've watched; I would still like to strongly recommend this film as it tries to revive one of the unforgettable events from the history seen through cinematic frame. Rating: 2 stars out of 4",The Impossible
114,Marc_Israel_365,An emotional tsunami of the heart,8,9 March 2014,"There are scenes in The Impossible that could have happened in any situation any of us have experienced. The volcano of bottled up emotions coming out in bubbling tears when finally speaking words of a tragedy is one that I think is most universal. It is this every persons' perspective that works so well in this film about people caught in the wort disaster of our lifetime. Every decision after the initial catastrophe seems so crucial to life and death, yet each is made for logical reasons after fighting the initial instincts. The reward is The Impossible, but the experience is what the film is about. Naomi Watts is quite a powerhouse of an actress when called upon, and Tom Holland, as her eldest son, is phenomenal in his portrayal of a young boy forced into a caretaker role (not what young boys do best) and in roaming about the hospital doing whatever he can for his family and for others. There is also the Thai communities that are shown as caring and giving despite their own horrendous situations, either in the village or feared as they worked non-stop in the hospital. While you want to declare this true family story as lucky and/or valiant, it seems meant to be more of a family amalgam for all of us to see the easily felt message of family and living in the now... who knows what tomorrow may bring.",The Impossible
115,dvc5159,Horrifying depiction of a tragic event,7,12 January 2013,"A moment of guilt sunk in as I was watching Juan Antonio Bayona's ""The Impossible"". It's during the holiday scenes in the first five or so minutes of the film, where the tourists were happily lighting floating lanterns on the beach the night before Christmas '04. The calm before the storm.How haunting to remember, the happy faces of the tourists/couples as they bustle about partying and celebrating on the coasts of Thailand. How haunting to know that it would be one of their final nights, as I was, days before the horrific event, treading one of the very beaches struck hard by the waves. It's moments like that you ask yourself, do you truly have a life well-spent? Because it could be gone tomorrow, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.Yes, the trailers do indeed spoil the movie, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if you've seen the trailer or not. We all saw the news footage during and after the disaster, and the images hauntingly burned in our brains as a memento of the merciless fury of mother nature.But Bayona does something else. The waves devastate the landscape, turning a land of pure beauty into a ruined wasteland beyond comprehension. Trees tumble, buildings are smashed, people are swept away and knocked around within the waves and debris. If that sounds horrific enough, Bayona doesn't hold back and we are treated to his recreation those cringing moments to gripping effect. Naomi Watts' blood-curdling scream as she clings on to dear life amidst raging waters and drifting debris sums the experience up. This scene makes the one in Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" look like CliffNotes.After the tsunami comes another harrowing look at the aftermath. The survivors are meandering around, shell-shocked by the devastation and loss. The Thai hospitals are thrown into chaos as the hallways and rooms overflow with patients and corpses. These scenes are done tremendously well.The film's focus, however, is on a wealthy British family separated during the disaster. The mother (Watts) is swept away along with the eldest son (Tom Holland), and the father (Ewan McGregor) with the younger two sons. Each side fears the other is done for. It is a testament to their will and determination that all five manage to pull through to ultimately survive this ordeal. Holland and McGregor are very effective in their roles, but Watts gives the best performance, as a woman who has just seen the worst first-hand and still is determined to keep going.Yes, there are genre conventions. The real family which survived this have all been turned British for this film. Disaster genre conventions, especially fateful meetings and misses, are done to death in a lot of movies in a cheap attempt to exploit the emotion out of the audience. In this movie it's no exception, and the final reunion of the family, where they find each other, is frankly, ham-fistedly directed but well-acted. Aside from that minor gripe, the point is, Bayona uses this family's story as a central point to revisit the devastation of the tsunami aftermath. And he succeeds effortlessly at that.Three years ago, I saw this Chinese movie called ""Aftershock"" about the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake in China and it's ripples across a family. That movie used its effects horrifyingly well also, as per this one which ratchets up the cringe-factor up to 11. The PG-13 rating has never been more justified in recent times, with injury-related gore/nudity prevalent throughout the film to show the masses what's real. If you ever wondered if you spent enough time with your loved ones, this film will give you a reminder.A VERY GOOD disaster film.",The Impossible
116,bobbobwhite,"First half great, second half not",5,18 January 2013,"The bad last half of this film ruined the great first half and made it an overall loser to me. Great visual effects of a violent tsunami and its catastrophic aftermath gradually turned into a sappy, maudlin, Family Channel-level tear-jerker with tons of group hugs, tears, and scenes manufactured wholly to activate the tear glands and the wallet. Scenes of The Perfect Family(none truly exist)early on so obviously portended horrible things later, as everything coming later was so telegraphed in advance that the outcome was obviously predictable.........the perfect family was all back together and it was going to be so perfect once again!

117,doug_park2001,As Good as Most People Say It Is,9,2 June 2013,"Though it's a straightforwardly based-upon-a-true story, THE IMPOSSIBLE still has its share of surprises and turnabouts. The cover blurb from Mary Pols (TIME) says ""Emotionally rich and life-affirming."" I agree, but it should also be noted that this film earns every bit of its various life-affirming qualities. The initial scenes of the tsunami and its aftermath are heart-stopping in places: This is definitely one of the more disturbing PG-13s that I've seen. It's also the first film I've seen in a long while that honestly brought tears to my eyes.While the pacing could use a little more of this and a little less of that, THE IMPOSSIBLE is expertly filmed and acted. Lush scenery too: It made me want to go to Thailand in spite of everything shown here. Fine performances by Watts and McGregor, with special kudos going to Tom Holland as eldest son Lucas. The Special Features are all worth a serious look.",The Impossible
118,TheMarwood,Terrific spectacle and decent drama,7,18 July 2014,"There is something a little unsavory about following one privileged white family through the hellish aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami, but there's more than enough good material to counter any feelings of whitewashing. The recreation of the tsunami is a marvel of visual effects, combining miniatures and digital elements that must have been grueling to film and the result is a technical masterstroke. Its spectacle is both stunning and frightening and director Juan Antonio Bayona stages this mayhem with a brilliant eye. He holds shots without cutting quickly and even with his characters being tossed around from the water, the action is made of well composed shots that are never difficult to tell what is happening. Watts spends most of the film on a bed rotting, but manages to pull out a great performance, where she could have easily over done it and hammed it up. Newcomer Tom Holland (no, not the horror director) also does a fantastic job as Watts' young son. The Impossible spends most of its running time in a hospital, as tourists and locals search and mourn for their loved ones and while the film occasionally enters 'inspirational' territory, it never goes too far to become cloying and sentimental. There's enough quality filmmaking here to highly recommend The Impossible.",The Impossible

It is difficult to watch at times, as it truly represents the devastation that can be caused by such a disaster, and the aftermath on screen was horrendous. Well acted by all, including the children, and a brilliant debut from a young Tom Holland.The title is very appropriate, as the ending feels like pure Hollywood coincidental make-believe. But, apparently it's accurate, so I suppose in many ways the filmmakers struck gold for an emotional climax, it does bring everything together to formulate a conclusion for an utterly unbelievable story.",The Impossible

122,eshwarmail,Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall,7,17 January 2013,"It starts off as a movie with a disaster waiting to happen just as advertised showing off happy moments, family bonds and future expectations just enough to ensure when the disaster hits, it hits hard. It did hit hard. If you forgive the occasional pacing issues and consistent coincidences (being a true story it is nothing short of miraculous), the actors will leave you with a feeling of unease with their brilliant natural and touching performances. The tsunami scene was quick, short, devastating and mostly well executed. Naomi Watts deserves a special applause along with the kid who played Lucas.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are moderately happy couple who comes down to Thailand for a vacation with their 3 sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. Just when the holiday mood kicks in the disaster strikes without a warning. With utmost perseverance and love for life Maria and Lucas endure themselves to safety badly beaten, scarred but not broken. On the other side, Henry is in search of his family. How their unbroken spirit and persistence help them to find each other constitutes the rest of the story.The scene where Maria is stuck in a frenetic underwater current makes you look away but could have been done a lot better. It was also difficult to watch with my ardent fear of water. If not for a true story credit, the near misses and the way the family finally reunite looks a bit undercooked. Naomi Watts shoulders the first half of the movie but Tom Holland (Lucas) steals the show for a short while by portraying a kind, confident yet vulnerable character. Runtime could be edited by a good 20 minutes and the melodrama and over emphasis of the power of human spirit (though apt in this instance) was a bit too much. Background score does not leave a mark and nor does the Thai locals performance.Touching and powerful occasionally but a little flat overall.",The Impossible

Through the eyes of this family, we're witness to all the devastation and heartbreak surrounding this catastrophe, all gritty to the point that makes it hard to watch at points, although some of that may be the shaky cam as well. The whole cast is great, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor specifically giving some of the best performances of their careers, pouring out so much sincere emotion. On a visceral level, on an emotional level, it hits HARD. Not only does it hit, it practically delivers a punch to the gut.

124,aminifatimaaa,a deceptively simple enough film on the surface,7,12 March 2019,"The Impossible is less about the natural disaster itself or sharply defined drama and more about the survival of its core protagonists, so those looking for a film broad in scope may be disappointed.

125,akash_sebastian,"An Unforgettable, Draining but Uplifting Cinematic Experience!",7,10 January 2013,"It's an unforgettable, draining but uplifting cinematic experience. Juan Antonio Bayona makes a sensational debut into English movies, after his gripping Spanish horror masterpiece 'El Orfanato'. This time, he creates horror of a different variety. He terrifically recreates the mayhem of the environmental catastrophe named Tsunami, through the eyes of one family. If people are expecting to see the complete devastation and tragedy surrounding the disaster, they'll be disappointed. As the movie's tagline says, 'This is one family's true story of survival'.The haunting background score, the remarkable camera-work and the spectacular special effects almost throws us into the middle of all the chaos. But, it is the stunning acting that carries the movie forward, and helps us understand the gravity of the situation. Naomi Watts and the young star, Tom Holland, are the stars of the movie. Watts gives one of the finest performances of her career. But Holland, being so young, shows such maturity with his stunning range of emotions. Their characters, and their amazing relationship, are quite poignantly portrayed. The characters could have been developed and explored a little more, before the Tsunami hit, so that their story could have been more effective. But other than that, I've got no complains.The climactic reunion scene outside the hospital is a well-acted and amazingly shot scene; it was undeniably moving.It's a heroic tale of endurance, hope and survival. Pray that this movie is the closest you, or anyone close to you, get(s) to a disaster.",The Impossible

Tom Holland manages to put the performance of his life, even tho he is only 13-14 year old when the movie was released.

128,martinrobertson300482,An amazing TRUE story,10,18 February 2013,"Sometimes a film you can't wait too see can dispaoint you, and other times a film you think probably shouldn't off been made, can impress you. Fortunately ""The Impossible"" is the later. Perhaps its too early too be making movies about the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami. But ""The Impossible"" focuses on an amazing thing that happened during that horrible time. Its telling a happy story that happened during all the tragedy. Off how an entire family actually survived, and had to find each other amongst the rubble.I feel a bit overly generous giving ""The Impossible"" such a high rating, but I have to admit to it breaking me in a way that rarely happens. If your into your tearful movies you'll love it, if not, you probably shouldn't be reading this. As you'll have no interest in the movie at all. I'm not usually up for these sorts off things, but cant deny that I had a tear in my eye way more than once throughout. Maybe that's because its a true story, and its about a family. Not some soppy ""twilight"" style romance.""The Impossible"" doesn't exploit what happened only 8 years ago. It merely shows us something that happened during that time. There are no sickening, disrespectful CGI shots off giant waves (That would off been awful!) We See off the disaster what the leading characters saw, and they are played brilliantly here by Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, as well as some great child actors (Again, something I'm not usually impressed by).",The Impossible
129,ghost_dog86,"Sappy, yet effective.",7,17 January 2013,"If the only objective of ""The Impossible"" was to make an entire theater full of grown adults cry, then MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Based on the ""true story"" of a (Spanish?) family who survived (not a spoiler alert, only because this movie was seemingly made to be utterly predictable) the 2004 tsunami which hit South Asia, ""The Impossible"", directed by Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) in incredibly impressive fashion and containing fairly compelling performances from the likes of Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, would have been assuredly one of the best films of 2012 (and an Oscar contender) if only it wasn't hampered by an overbearingly sappy script, with plotting worthy of The Lifetime Channel, from Sergio G. Sanchez.While Sanchez's plot development makes ""The Impossible"" one of the most predictable movies you will ever see, this aspect doesn't actually hinder the film as much as one would expect. For one, during the initial act, the fact that audiences are fully aware of the impending doom, works as a form of suspense on the same level as a well crafted horror film would. Secondly, the payoff (which is drenched in predictability) during the climax, shockingly works immensely well due to a lot of help from a well choreographed sequence from Bayona. Furthermore, though this was truly a climax which everybody in the theater could and will see coming from a mile away, it is ""impossible"" to not be swept away (figuratively) in the moment; no matter how cynical a movie-goer you may be. As for the middle chunk of ""The Impossible"", it rides that fine line between visual excellence and a forced ""triumph of the human spirit"" storyline, with the reoccurring theme of sappiness rearing its head again and again and once more, directly following the great climax with an eye rolling prolonged ending.Side Note: Kudos to the director for not shying away from showing the most realistic depiction possible of the people who lived through and died during this tsunami. And by that I don't just mean the violence and gruesomeness of people drowning and being impaled by large pieces of debris, but more so the amount of nudity, i.e. not going the American PG-13 rout of showing us tsunami victims who are cut up, arms broken and eyes popping out of their head, but with clothes still intact. With that said, while nothing in this film is gratuitous (aside from the gratuitous sappiness) how this movie passed without an R rating with the amount of Naomi Watts' breasts shown, during a time when American parents are more afraid of their thirteen year old seeing a woman's exposed nipple than a movie riddled with gun violence, is one of the most impressive things I've seen in an American distributed film in quite a while. In short, if you where planning on seeing this movie with your kids, then see this movie with your kids; a little breast never hurt anybody.Final Thought: Though I still stand by my point that the overwhelmingly forced pathos throughout does drag this film down a bit, I will say ""The Impossible"" contains some of the most impressive visuals of 2012; just falling short of Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"". But still the most overwhelming aspect that this film has going for it, is how eventually (and quite forcefully) it pulls at the heartstrings so much so, that much like those SPCA commercials, you won't be able to help yourself but choose the emotional response of ""that poor family"", rather than a rational one of ""this isn't that great of a movie"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

130,Catharina_Sweden,"Interesting, very realistic, not overly sentimental either",9,8 January 2013,"Many Swedes were killed in this tsunami, so it has become like a national tragedy for us, despite of the fact that it took place so far away. The aftermath is still not altogether over, as many people feel it took too long for the Swedish Government to send help to the stranded Swedes.Personally I am of the opinion, that the Swedish Government cannot be responsible for earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, snake-bites etc.. If Swedes of their own free will choose to leave Sweden for latitudes where these phenomena occur, and in addition to that do not care about getting valid travel insurance, which was sometimes the case... And especially when there had been heavy cuts in the support to vulnerable groups in Sweden, who could never in their lives even dream of a vacation in Thailand... But now we are off topic.I have often wondered what happened to those survivors I know, who came back. They have not wanted to talk about it. I was glad to get this opportunity to try to understand what they went through.I can of course not know how authentic it all is, as I was not there, but the feeling of this movie, at least, is very realistic. I like it that it is not overly-sentimental either, despite of the subject matter that could very well have been made into a melodrama.The actors are all very good, and the child-actors especially are excellent. I do not think I have ever seen any children acting so believably! This is an interesting and exciting movie, with no dull moments, that has a special impact as you know it really happened. And not far back in time either. I highly recommend it!",The Impossible
131,nesfilmreviews,Falls short of capturing the impact of the 'real' footage.,6,23 April 2013,"""The Impossible"" is a solid, well-made disaster film, based on a true story, fueled by the human spirit fighting for survival with fine performances, especially by Naomi Watts. The tsunami sets up the story line for the rest of the film--a catastrophic situation that allows the audience a sense of the aftermath of such an overwhelming natural disaster. However, ""The Impossible"" soon becomes a painful experience to endure; and not for the reasons one might expect either. ""The Impossible"" feels every bit as average, never rising above its own genre conventions--but it compensates with fine performances and outstanding realistic effects. Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) decide to spend Christmas with their three children in Thailand, hoping to enjoy a festive season complete with sunshine and exotic beaches. However and without warning, a massive Tsunami crashes into the coastline, separating the family, leaving them to face one of the most devastating natural disasters of modern times. The first half of the movie unfolds as a survivalist picture, pitting the characters against horrific and devastating conditions--creating gripping suspense through the process. There are inspirational moments of perseverance, families reuniting, people pulling together, and overcoming obstacles. The film's most dramatic sequences focus on Lucas (Todd Holland), assigning himself the role of his mother's lifeguard and protector.However, as the film continues into the second act, it becomes slightly disjointed with a sense of seamless wandering as it stumbles toward its denouement. As the husband, separated from his wife and searching for her, McGregor finds himself walking aimlessly and completely hopeless. He does a lot of tripping and falling through floors and screaming. Through McGregor's role, he encounters others adrift and injured searching for family members, and this introduction to a broader story makes this families' story seem a bit more trivial. What Juan Antonio Bayona is trying to do with ""The Impossible"" is honorable and well done, but does absolutely nothing with an endless number of possibilities. Simply put, it just gets boring after a while. The tsunami that slams into their resort happens in the first 15 minutes of the movie, and it is the most exciting part of the entire film. Their characters exist to serve as a component guiding the narrative that takes us on a ""tour"" of the aftermath caused by the tsunami. Not to take anything away from Naomi Watts outstanding performance. When watching the actual footage and material online and listening to the real victims and their gut-wrenching stories, it leaves one stunned in disbelief. In comparison, the movie falls short of capturing that genuine, raw emotion of astonishment and incredulity.",The Impossible

The acting was incredible and the special effects, especially the tsunami scene in the beginning, were fantastic. Having seen almost most of the critically acclaimed films in the 2012 year, I can now say that they made a mistake in giving the Best Actress in a Leading Role to Jennifer Lawrence for her role in The Silver Linings Playbook. That award should've gone to Naomi Watts for her incredible and moving performance in this film. Lawrence did great but Watts was amazing, key difference in my opinion.

133,rgblakey,The Impossible takes you inside the tsunami of 2004,8,30 April 2013,"While you hear about major event son the news all the time, seeing them come to life on the big screen brings them more to life giving viewers a bit of a closer idea of what those involved went through. One of the most shocking natural disasters took place in 2004 when a tsunami hit across Indonesia taking the lives over 200,000 people. This tragic event has now been brought to life in the film The Impossible based on one family experiences during this event, but is it able to convey the terror and desperation these people lived through? The Impossible follows a family on Christmas vacation in Thailand. While hanging out by the pool enjoying the sun and fun, there comes a roar in the distance that will change their lives forever. This is an intense and powerful film that delivers way more than you may have thought from the initial trailers. The cast all do a great job with each of them having to convey a variety of emotions. The story is so insanely unbelievable you have to see it to believe it. Seeing what these people had to endure to survive not only keeps you on edge, but also gets you thinking about what other people had to endure that was easily much worse. The story structure really makes this film even more powerful than it may have been if delivered straight forward. It starts a bit slow while setting things up and makes you almost forget what is coming, only to suddenly slap you in the face when it hits the fan and never truly let's up. Sure there isn't much action beyond the initial destructive force, but the sheer drama and torment these people deal with in the aftermath will keep you stressed and on the edge of your seat. In addition it bounces back and forth between the various characters telling their stories, but still keeping the primary focus on the initial leads. High praise for both the actors and filmmakers for the choice to use and endure actual water on set for the scenes as opposed to all CGI. There is some CGI of course, but the scenes that are the most effective are those watching them really deal with the danger of the water. This keeps you invested in the film and the believability constant.While this movie looked good from the trailers it delivers a lot more than you would expect. The performances are great; the visuals are beautiful and terrifying and it respectfully tackles a tragic event with intensity and passion to let you understand a small bit of what these people really dealt with. There are two sequences that to describe may not sound all that bad, but visually are brutal to watch and will no doubt effect you on some level which is what a great film is supposed to do.",The Impossible

I'm not sure how it was filmed, but I cannot imagine it being re-created more realistically. As devastating as this 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was to many, this is basically a small and sort of intimate story of one family offering a wonderful performance by Naomi Watts and the usual always good one from Ewan McGregor. This was Tom Holland's film debut and how he landed the role is an unknown to me, but he is excellent in it and who knew then the heights he would reach in the film world & thus far I've never seen him give a better performance. The Impossible wasn't seen by a lot as its subject matter isn't exactly box office nor entertainment to the masses, but as sad and tragic as it is, I suggest anyone who is interested in film take a look. It's a fine piece of filmmaking.",The Impossible
135,maximkong,Can't Help it but Felt Inadequate,5,17 May 2013,"Based on the fact that the actual family behind the movie was a huge supporter throughout the whole shooting process, and the fact that they actually went back to the original locations in Thailand to shoot the movie, I think the director and his team tried hard to make it as realistic as possible. The CGI was quite well-crafted.Maria Belon herself already said the movie is accurate Maria Belon (the real mother) in an interview responded to a question on what she thinks the movie will mean to people. She said it is not about that it was a story on another person, but it is a story that people can connect with even though they had not seen a tsunami. She stressed that it is part of a struggle of life, that everyone can recognize and relate to.Sadly, I do not think that this movie did enough to accomplish the things she said. Even after all the scenes of being trapped in the water and the sense of not knowing whether your loved ones survived, I still felt empty from the movie. There are scenes where it would have made more sense to conserve energy but the main leads wasted them with unnecessary melodrama. Dialogues were limited, understandably because people at times do not know or do not want to say anything under that level of trauma...but the director could have allocated more scenes/ more body language/ involve more people at the correct times, to make up for the disconnect.I do not believe Naomi Watts did a good job portraying Maria Belon. When I watched Maria's interview, my impression that she was a strong woman and the type that would put rationality above emotions. She was not afraid to re-watch the movie on sufferings that she herself endured, but she felt pain when she watch the sufferings OTHERS endured. I do not understand why Naomi, who have had many conversations with Maria, failed to recognize Maria's strong personality but instead portrayed her crying too often (not when she was crying in physical pain but there were many scenes where she was crying for the sake of crying). Of course I knew she was aware at that time of the things she may have lost and that she was in between life and death. But her eldest son was with her all the time and common sense would say she was needed to be strong! Naomi did a wonderful job portraying a mother thinking about her children no doubt. But not a wonderful job portraying a woman strong at heart. Maria did said she nearly gave up at the end, but Naomi looked to me as already given up somewhere in the middle.",The Impossible

THEN their insurance company of all things send what is basically a private jet to go pick them up to fly them to Singapore for her medical care was laughable! Has anyone every had their insurance company send a private jet to go get them? This was just stupid and insulting! Do yourself a favor and don't watch this garbage!
Oh wait one more thing... Watts has NO English accent, McGregor very little and the kids have it so thick (esp Holland) that they couldn't possibly be related!

139,sandnair87,"While Trying to Recreate the Horror of 2004, Bayona Manages to Do 'The Impossible'!",9,21 April 2016,"A married doctor couple, Maria (Watts) and Henry (McGregor), has brought their three young boys on a much-needed vacation to the coast of the Indian Ocean. In a scenic resort, the brood fit in for a gorgeous afternoon poolside with nary a Christmas tree in sight and their holiday plans prepared for a beautiful vacation. That day, however, was not to be the one they had hoped for.A mere fifteen minutes into the film, a slight breeze catches Maria's hair, quickly turning into a whipping gust of wind. It's one thing to hear stories of tsunamis and the spontaneity with which they appear, but it's another thing to see it happen in front of you. No warning. The ground rumbles, vacationers scatter and scream, their world about to be turned upside down, forever. From complete relaxation to impending death. No warning.Separated by rushing water and dangerous terrain, Maria and their eldest son Lucas (Holland) travel as best they can on her severely wounded leg towards civilization and hopefully help. The first half of the film focuses on this pair as if Henry and their other two children were swept into the sea like so many others. Henry, however, is still alive and his chapter begins at the halfway point when he tries to seek Maria and Lucas out. From then on, it becomes about the apparently insurmountable logistics involved in getting this family back together.Technically impeccable, 'The Impossible' gives the brutal caprice of nature its due, never romanticizing it or demonizing it. It begins as a steady radio dial, suddenly and violently spun into fits of static and garbled chaos. Director Juan Antonio Bayona conducts this symphony with a steady hand and a wonderful visual eye. He spins the focus in on a single family caught up in the disaster, personalizing the horror and bringing it home in unashamedly melodramatic fashion on its very own tidal wave of emotion. While doing so, Bayona creates one of the most traumatizing and realistic disaster sequences in history. Avoiding the temptation to fill his piece with dramatic underscore that swells as our protagonists are tumbled in the muddy waters of the invading ocean, Bayona removes all musical accompaniment for this portion permitting loudness and utter silence to fill our senses along with visual stimuli that will leave you scarcely able to breathe. This swift wrath of nature is expertly realized, but the heart of the film is in its characters and how they respond to the betrayal of the world around them.Naomi Watts, in her career best performance, expresses the rooted emotions of a mother both physically and emotionally, filling the film with so much fearlessness and unshakable motivation, that she enraptures the audience with her survival instincts. Ewan McGregor provides able support as the distressed father and is extremely competent. Tom Holland delivers one of the strongest juvenile debuts seen in years, conveying a complex series of emotions with natural serenity.The Impossible separates itself from the other disaster films by focusing not just on the scale of the mayhem, but the intimacy of the struggle. Yes it takes us back to an epic nightmare that was the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, but the flashback is vertiginous and horrible and oddly poetic.",The Impossible
140,lucasnochez,"Review: The Impossible--A By The numbers, emotional journey of faith",7,21 February 2013,"Driving on intense emotional pain, explicit physical human damage and unbearable scenarios of brutal tragedy and deep suffering, The Impossible is a truly independent disaster movie minus any Hollywood trans fat. Absent of absurd fantastical elements plaguing high-end disaster movies in Hollywood, The Impossible is a film which uses the real disaster of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and one family's compelling true story of survival that surfaced cause of it. The Impossible may not be the best disaster movie ever made nor may it be the greatest parable for the strength of family and the bonds of community, but it sure as hell makes for one deeply satisfying emotional tale of endurance and hope. Re-Telling the story of Maria Belon's family's inexplicable survival, The Impossible is a retelling of one family's journey during one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded. Belon, along with her husband, were vacationing in Thailand from their busy lives back home in Japan. Caught without any warning, Belon and her family held on long and hard enough to live to tell the tale of there family's unbelievable tale of survival. Drenched with compelling special effects and outstanding stunt work, this was second in comparison to the stellar showcase of Naomi Watts' acting range. Being in front of the camera the longest and having her story told for the majority of the movie, Watts was harrowing as an injured mother clinging on to her life for the sake of her children. Accompanied by one of the stand-out performances by a newcomer this year, Tom Holland who plays Watts' son Lucas and her sole companion for the first half of the film, was completely on-point and the two were a dynamic acting duo. The two performances sparkled with life and ingenious moments of sheer beauty. Ewan McGregor did his best and held his own with what seemed like ridiculous plot- points for a father and very little screen time with two child actors (Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin) who were significantly overshadowed by Holland. The film itself owes great credit to its sophomore director Juan Antonia Bayona, whose direction is strategically planned and appreciated throughout the film. Dealing with a narrative with so much room for emotional manipulation, Bayona masterfully paces the film and its stars for small yet powerful instances of truly great human feats. The Impossible is a gut-wrenching and heart breaking marvel of a film. Layered with multiple challenges of the people who struggled to survive during a time of hardship and tragedy, The Impossible is a tale of true possible hope for the good in all people to shine. Challenging in not only content and the visuals it presents to the audience, the film is a challenge for people to accept and believe that good exists within everyone, especially during times of strife and extreme hardship. Physically challenging and magnificent, The Impossible is a true example of a small scale film doing it right with large scale heart.",The Impossible
141,grnhair2001,Accurate depiction of disaster experience,6,26 January 2014,"Tom Holland's performance carried the film for me. I didn't love the script in some of its details, and I thought the reunion moments and some of the emotionality after that was maudlin rather than moving.In certain other ways I was impressed. I've read a good deal on the psychology of disaster and experienced one major one myself, and the film does a good job of showing how chaotic things can be and how poor human decisions can be at such times. (Sending your tiny kids off with strangers in a foreign country while you set yourself a task that will get accomplished somehow later on even if you keep your kids? A really stupid thing to do, and a really normal human response in a disaster.) The shutting off of sound at times they are tossed around in the water early on is also something that happens (sometimes people go temporarily blind, too.) While surely some film viewers will say ""I would do better than this,"" they're mostly wrong--some people are great in disasters, but if you are or not is to a great extent hard-wiring, if you have certain brain structures or not, and not under your willful control. Training can help maximize performance, too, but who could train for this? Absent tsunami warning sirens, you're at the mercy of luck and how well your brain automatically works. Lucas--the character and perhaps the boy in real life--has the optimum response, while the adults here are nearer average. Did the filmmakers trust the reports of the survivors or read extensively to get this information? However they came to it, I appreciated seeing a truthful depiction.Still, the film seemed pretty average to me overall. I'd never watch it a second time, but I don't resent the 90 minutes I spent with it.",The Impossible
142,troy-manatunga,A must watch movie that will make you appreciate for every single tomorrow of your life!,8,26 March 2013,"The story behind the Tsunami of 2004 that took South East Asia by surprise and left her weeping, helpless and angry will never be forgotten. Boxing Day will never be the same again for those families and their relatives who were devoured by the angry waters of the Indian Ocean that morning. To reenact that day in history and to bring to life a story of such mega catastrophic proportions is considered both foolish and wise. 37 year old Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona in my opinion delivers a balanced view of the carnage that took place that day and how it affected both the local and foreign alike. One of the most important issues he balances is the presentation of the suffering of the local islanders and the story line of a family on holiday that is caught in the middle of one of the largest natural disasters to be recorded in our history. He finds this balance in the powerful performances of Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland. Naomi Watts who was nominated for an Academy Award is indeed performing the role of her lifetime. Hands down she surpasses her previous nomination over a decade ago in 21 GRAMS and bedazzles me with her most heartfelt showcasing. Her characters persona undoubtedly is not only the cry of Maria Bennet; it is the plea of every single mother that saw her family wash away in front of their eyes. I know what this look feels like because on that day I saw that in my own mothers' eyes as the wave hit shores of Sri Lanka where I was travelling by. The only thing lacking in THE IMPOSSIBLE is the lack of screen time for Naomi Watts as her character restricts to be bed ridden with injuries.The desperate father who would stop at nothing and the 10 year old son who literally carries the weight of his mothers' pains moves the audience. Hollywood star McGregor and new to the widescreen Tom Holland are unbelievable. I would say again; they are unbelievable. Every minute spent in front of the screen is every minute lived in that moment. McGregor's versatility has never been a surprise to the movie enthusiast. He rarely misses what he is aiming for. Although with time I have realized that McGregor fails to rise beyond the others whilst performing brilliantly. This may be the only reason he is yet to be nominated for an Academy Award.Naomi Watts deserved the Award for Best Actress at the 85th Academy Awards way beyond Jennifer Lawrence and her irritating screaming performance. Ewan McGregor as always meets the expectations. However the actor to watch out for is Tom Holland. He takes on the emotional wand once Watts is bed ridden and he is the best performance I have seen in a young actor in 2012. (I am yet to watch BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD). Holland will not forget this debut motion picture and it's not wrong to assume that he was lucky to have been presented with such a well written character that allowed him to explore the depths of his abilities. THE IMPOSSIBLE is the story of family based on true events that is on holiday in Thailand at a resort Island when the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake triggered a series of devastating waves along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean. A sunny morning by the poolside with the family turns out to be worst day of their lives when they are swept away with gigantic muddy tsunami waves reaching over 30 meters in height. The CGI dominance will drown you in the reality of this horror whilst the script will resurface you to the light of tomorrow. If you have the patience you will be able to get a glimpse of the photo of the real family that narrates this story as the end credits roll up the screen.A must watch movie that will make you appreciate for every single tomorrow of your life!TITLE: THE IMPOSSIBLE DIRECTED BY: JUAN ANTONIO BAYONA STARRING: NAOMI WATTS, EWAN MCGREGOR & TOM Holland RATED: PG 13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 114 MINUTES",The Impossible
143,OneAnjel,Amazing story but cheesy retelling,5,17 March 2021,"I think the many high stars are rating the family's ordeal instead of the film. The portrayal of Lucas was excellent, kudos to the young actor. However, outside of the shocking special effects to emulate real-life tsunami power (could not have been easy and was very realistic) I thought the film was mediocre and plodding. And I'm sorry to critique the actual ordeal but what father leaves his two most vulnerable family members to fend for themselves when his safest bet is to continue on with them to civilization and seek professional help in his search -- where he would have been able to check hospital records, as well, not to mention that he clearly had great insurance and could have used communication devices to simply contact them for immediate high-level assistance. It just felt so unbelievable considering the high incidence of white children being taken in foreign countries for either slavery or ransom. One review mentions he felt the film was remis in showing mainly 'white' people. It's a sad statement that anyone would think all light-skinned vacationers fit into the unfortunate narrow profiles of some cultures. In reality, it's usually European (including Swedish, German, British, Russian et al) who are often light-skinned and blond; and Caucasian (white is a derogatory slang, actually, and just means Europeans who have immigrated to America but has broadened in vernacular use to mean even those still living in or from Europe, which is inaccurate, for the record) -- but it is mainly these who vacation in such remote tropical places. The majority of those affected would be the tourists and those in the tourism industry since the rest of the islander predominantly live inland. Also, since it's a film aimed at the English-speaking community about a European family the focus would naturally be on them and the tourists they were able to communicate with. Not every film can be nor should be all-inclusive just to try and make the new wave of liberal victims comfortable. All in all, the film is not a waste of time. It's a feel good film about a family's reunion against all odds. But it's not a family film. Too many shock and awe moments. Your kids will have nightmares. PG13 means kids 13 and over need adults there to supervise and answer questions.",The Impossible
144,Golden_Hope,Good But not Great,6,14 March 2021,"This is an extremely heavy movie and is extremely difficult to watch. It is not a fun watch but that isn't a bad thing. I think it is actually a positive because if there is something to be said about this film I think that it really tries it's hardest to capture the emotional gravity of events like this.It doesn't sugar coat things for the most part so scenes are graphic and uncomfortable to watch.I think Naomi Watts was fantastic. Everyone else was okay.Before watching I thought to my self that this whole premise was a weird ""in"" to this story. Why are we telling a story about a white family not native to Thailand when there are thousands and thousands of Thai stories that are also important to hear. Then I was even more confused when I found out the family was Spanish? Why cast English people. Apparently the real Maria wanted Naomi Watts but I think everyone involved probably thought it wouldn't be as marketable as a ""foreign language film"". So that was all confusing to me.The script or more so the dialogue was something. I don't know who is the blame. It could be the actors delivering the lines flat or it could be that the dialogue is bad. It is definitely over written. People don't talk like that. Lines feel like the come from a piece of paper.I also think this could have been trimmed. The pacing was strange to me. I was expecting to get to know the family more so I was shocked when things played out like they did. Some scenes could have definitely been shaved a little bit. And unfortunately the way this movie is there is a part in it which feel like Groundhog Day. The movie almost resets. Which slaughters the already unsteady pacing.You could watch it if it interests you. It is absolutely devastating and I do think that the film makers made a real effort to show the heartbreak and horror that this event caused. I just think it lets it's self down in some areas.",The Impossible

The 85th Oscars will go down as one of the most myopically unjust in Oscar history. Next to this film and the others I have watched, Argo, while a nice little film, does not deserve even honorable mention.This film is excellent on so many levels: casting, acting, film editing, FX, story telling, drama, suspense, emotional depth, social relevance, as well as any other category I could mention.How this was not included among the Best Picture nominees is beyond understanding.Besides compellingly excellent performances by the two principles, the work of young Tom Holland is a revelation! Although I think Christoph Waltz deserved his second award, Holland should have been considered and nominated for this role. He is just amazing! Physical demands aside, his performance is more compelling than most of those provided by much more seasoned actors for that year.The Academy has revealed tells about its apparent prejudices over the years, and one of the most glaring is against ""true stories"" for some inexplicable reason. It is a gross injustice that a film of this caliber is so overlooked. 2011's Oscars had 10 nominees, and they still couldn't get it right! Why not for 2012?Anyway, this is a great film!

147,jaxbubba,Phenonemal but Forced....,6,30 January 2013,"First and foremost, I would like to state beforehand that I cannot even begin to imagine the pain, devastation, and anguish that the Belón family must have endured during this most heinous event. This is truly an incredible story of survival, in which I highly recommend seeing; however, I do have some serious reservations as to the 'deliberate' emotion-seeking story telling techniques that director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez decided to use in order to tell this tale of woe.""The Impossible"" is the 'based on true events' story of the Bennett (Belón) family. Maria Bennett (Naomi Watts) and her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Tomas and Simon were on holiday over Christmas at a tropical paradise resort in Khao Lak, Thailand. An error with their third floor reservations got them upgraded to an oceanfront bungalow; however, it is curious to surmise if this was a spot of good luck or just one of life's awful twists of fate. While relaxing poolside on December 26, 2004, the Bennett (Belón) family was present during one of Thailand's most devastating natural disasters, the 2004 tsunami , which ravaged and leveled most of coastal area in which they were residing. The painstaking details that director Bayona goes through to recreate this catastrophic ordeal is absolutely mind-bogglingly. Again, I am more than confident that this reinterpretation of this ungodly event pales in comparison to its actual occurrence. However, director Bayona does portray the calamitous, perilous, inauspicious aftermath of the devastated Thailand coastal area quite effectively, and the days that followed even more so...However, here is where I am torn between being the completely immersed audience member awestruck by the events which are being presented to me versus super sensitive critic who is highly skeptical to this Hollywood retelling of this most hideous tribulation. Granted, this had to be an arduous experience; but I definitely feel that director Bayona pulled out all the stops in order to 'milk' the most impassioned audience reactions. Here are some examples of what I mean: (1) possibly one of the most touching moments in this film, is when 12 year old Lucas Bennett is able to reunite a father and son in the Thailand Hospital in which his mother has been taken to. However, this brief moment of joy in this most tumultuous place is ripped from the audience's beguilement as Lucas runs to tell his mother what he has done, only to find an empty bed and the thought that she had passed away. (2) The film's climatic scene in which the Bennett family: father, brothers, mother are finally reunited plays out like an Abbot and Costello routine with all the near misses of each other, retracing the exact same footsteps as the previous lost individual, the just oh so nearly seeing each other only to have the other turn at the exact moment as the individual walks out of sight. The intensity is supposed to build until the entire family finally find each other; however, the scene is so 'intentionally' drawn out and overly dramatic that it actually (almost) becomes comical. (3) However, my most disturbing sequence of the entire film has to be the closing sequence (which was possibly the most true scene of the film). Obviously the Bennet (Belón) family was a very affluent, well to do family. So as the family has been finally been reunified, and the mother (Maria) has successfully undergone surgery, the family is whisked away on a private jet to Singapore. Here my issue whether it's true or not (which I tend to believe actually did happen as shown on screen), the image of this family departing Thailand alone on an empty airplane in which they are the sole occupants, when hundreds maybe thousands of others were sitting there at that same airport in distress was just disheartening. Not an image that I would have decided to end this movie on.I know this review sounds harsh, and I apologize; however, I do still recommend seeing this film. It is truly a testament to the human survival proclivity, and I cannot begin to even phantom the despair and anguish endured by this family. I would like to add that I am sure that I would not have enjoyed reliving this experience by deciding to bring this abominable life incident to the big screen as Mrs. María Belón Alvárez elected to do either... but I digress. Rent this movie, enjoy this movie, recant my observations... but I am positive that my review comments will resonate in your mind as you watch it!!!! This film absolutely has a 'forced' feeling undertone to it.See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel""",The Impossible

Maria Belón said it was the ""biggest lie"" in the movie."" How can that be the biggest lie in the movie when the film based on her Spanish family's story are portrayed as being English? What other lies are there?Many reviewers have criticized the movie for that portrayal and that the film does little to portray the Thai that died (nor the Sri Lankans for that matter). Don't they see that is the truth of the story being told that it is a Hollywood world?Did any of them try to fund a version that told a different story? Did any of them reach out to help the victims other than to criticize this movie? What help is that? How different is that than some film company making a profit for telling this tale? Perhaps the outcry would have been even greater had they portrayed the Thai victims and made money for that.When the son lies to his Mom that her leg is still red (and hence well) it is a metaphor for the whole story that things are not well in how the incident has impacted civilization and belies the lie that Hollywood Culture (you and I who watch this film) cares.I was grief stricken when this disaster struck and reached out to friends who were in the area. Sure enough they were greatly affected having been swept away in the path of the tsunami. I contributed nothing to the relief fund. (My donations go to Wildlife Conservation)This is just a movie; it helps to remind that the disaster happened and that concern for extent of the disaster is a Western perspective. We are not one with the world - therein lies the truth of the lies - we don't care.The special effects and editing were superb - it was so realistic 10 out of 10.

152,julian-mumford,Not for the faint of heart,8,10 April 2013,"Despite occurring in Asia, the Boxing day Tsunami of 2004 was truly a world event, with ripples emanating around the world as many of the 280,000 plus victims were holiday makers from all over the world.Focusing on a single family's true story, albeit changing their nationality from Spanish to English, was always going to invite accusations of filtering a tragic story through the eyes of a white privileged family, rather than the locals who lost everything.This is perhaps unfair, in the same way ""Schindlers List"" might be accused of focusing on those few that survived. Highlighting one families initial struggle, by telling a story a modern audience can comprehend or realistically watch, is the only practical option. Artistic licence is regretfully necessary to secure not only movie funding but offer a ray of hope for a western audience to desperately cling to.And holding on, is what you may have to do, even with the glimmer of hope offered. This is truthful, unflinching and harrowing film making.Be warned, this is no easy watch.The story centres on Maria (Naomi Watts ), her husband (Ewan Mcgregor) and three young sons, Lucas (Tom Holland), Simon (Samuel Joslin) and Thomas (Oaklee Pendergast), on holiday at a upmarket beach resort in Khao Lak.The sense of foreboding is swiftly alluded to and when the wave hits, the effect is quite breathtaking. The effects are terrifying to watch but more than that, there is visceral quality to the sound and turmoil. A maelstrom of not knowing which way is up with the sheer terror conveyed in a unsentimental manner, stripped of the usual Hollywood veneer. ""Towering Inferno or ""2012"" this is not, a disaster movie that conveys just that, disaster on a colossal human scale.Managing to survive, Lucas and mum are reunited. The pair attempt to find help for the serious injuries sustained by Maria. The foley and special effect work providing suitably grisly and very believable sound effects and wounds. At times this only stops just short of horror, it is intense, emotional and deeply troubling. The response of Lucas to his mothers injuries and state of undress, is truly gut wrenching.To say too much more would rob the story of it's emotional highs and lows. Overall the film is sensitively handled, with the film makers taking pains to show the local effort and help provided, hammering home that no-one is safe when a Tsunami hits, white, brown, rich or poor. Latterly the film suggests that that being wealthy or just holding good insurance cover, can whisk you away from all the unpleasantness. In the modern world, this represents undisputed fact. Whether this is ""right"", is a philosophical debate not likely to be resolved in a two hour movie.The acting is uniformly good, Watts gets the most to do and excels in a role that cannot have been easy from both a physical and emotional sense. The young boys are all exceptional, on occasion Tom Holland showing world class talent. The director Juan Antonio Bayona, teasing superb performances even from his youngest cast members. McGregor is solid and certainly does not let the side down.Whether the film needed to be made or indeed whether the intended audience exists, is subject to debate. Does it provide a small but just watchable glimpse into what such an event would feel like, yes. Will it live with you for a few days at least, certainly. For those directly involved, is this a fitting tribute to the human spirit and kindness shown, impossible to say.Summary A natural disaster movie that is both affecting, effective and unflinching in it's depiction of a very real recent event with several notable performances.This is not for everyone, despite the focus on a white middle class family, this is no airbrushed Hollywood watered down TV movie. From the moment the Tsunami arrives, an emotional roller-coaster is unleashed and is not for the faint of heart.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",The Impossible
153,jonnyfendi,Powerful and Heart-Shattering Performances,7,6 February 2013,"Frankly, I had been experiencing some obvious pains while watching thiz movie. The movie gives you an actual situation of one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 21st century. It was the mega tsunami that hit most of Southeast Asia in 2004. To be more specific, it's based on the incredible true story of the Belon family consists of a father, a mother and three sons, which at that time were on vacation in Phuket, Thailand. The father Henry is played by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's character went through a lot of struggles to find his wife and son. It's a very complex character. However, he can translate thiz character pretty well. But personally, for me, it's the mother Maria who is played by Naomi Watts that delivers some powerful and heart-shattering performances. Watts can bring her character to life, with great emotional depth and effective improvisation. The other strong performance comes from the role of the eldest son Lucas which is played by Tom Holland. Holland creates a brilliant chemistry with Naomi Watts. The other two younger brother Thomas and Simon are played by Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast. Thiz movie is directed by young Spanish Director Juan Antonio Bayona who previously known for ""The Orphanage"" (2007). I can guarantee you will be in awe for the first 45 minutes of the movie, but after that, the storyline seems kind of lost. In addition to the impressive performances from the Cast members, thiz movie also provides breathtaking Visual Effects. It directly drags you into the middle of the situation. The giant tidal wave is frightening and believable. The sound of how tsunami debris hit and tear up the body is even more terrifying. There is always a meaning behind every tragedy. I appreciate the moral values in thiz movie. There is a scene, when the mother Maria tells her eldest son Lucas to help other victims though they themselves are in distress. It is praiseworthy deed and so amazing to see humanity is still alive. It's true, nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.

The suspense that is built at the beginning is great, you know that there will be a tsunami but you keep waiting for it to actually happen and when it does it is so terrifying and shocking. The realism of the movie is really what makes it stand out form any other natural disaster movie, the gore is so disgusting and makes you tremble, the wreckages look like they are right on front of you. My only negative of the movie is the end, it wasn't bad, it was just lacking compared to the incredible start, it felt a bit slow and drawn out. Still though, amazing emotional movie...8/10",The Impossible

There are some events that have occurred in a person's lifetime that never seem to fade9/11and this horrendous tsunami for example. Happenings so painful and emotional that time doesn't seem to help numb the brain, the heart, enough to be able to offer any sort of dispassionate observation. This film is excellent. The casting and the acting couldn't have been better. And I guess I'm glad I saw it, but then again.there were parts I was unable to watch and I left the theater wanting to just go home and cry. The movie has resurrected all the pain, the sorrow, I felt watching that shocking scene unfold, watching so many lives be swept away, so many families ripped apart, so much loss. I will only caution youif like me you are haunted by such tragedies... you might want to think twice about seeing this..or at the very least take a huge handful of Kleenex along with you.",The Impossible
156,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012),8,15 January 2013,"Word of warning: this is not a Roland Emmerich-kind of disaster movie (e.g. 2004's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and 2009's 2012) where larger-than-life special effects matters the most. Instead, THE IMPOSSIBLE is a rarity -- Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (2007's THE ORPHANAGE) has created an emotionally-driven disaster movie that successfully captures the devastating effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as the aftermath of how a significant family struggles to stay alive. It's a remarkable piece of filmmaking, and certainly not for the squeamish.The title is actually refers to the real-life Belon family, in which they vacationed in Thailand on December 2004 and miraculously survived one of the deadliest tsunamis in the history. In this movie, we are introduced to British-born businessman Henry Bennett (Ewan McGregor) and his doctor wife, Maria (Naomi Watts) along with their three boys, Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). They arrive at a beautiful beach resort in Khao, Thailand on Christmas Eve. They spend wonderful times together, and things are going great on Christmas Day as well. But on the fateful December 26, they are surprised to discover a sudden Indian Ocean tsunami approaches without warning when they are lounging by the pool. Nevertheless the raging tsunami hits everything in its path and thus separating the family apart.After the tsunami subsides, Maria and her oldest son Lucas are trying to find their way to a safety place before they gradually getting help by local villagers and send to a nearest hospital. Meanwhile, Henry is together with Thomas and Simon somewhere within the ruins of the beach resort.With a seamless mix of special effects and real water surges created in a water tank in Spain, the particular 10-minute reconstruction of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami sequence is vividly realized with such captivating effect it truly makes my heart pound. Not only that, the effect feels so alarmingly real as if you are there witnessing the harrowing event. It is no doubt the most convincing tsunami effect I've ever seen. A special credit goes to Bayona who is certainly has a deft touch handling such tremendous visual impact.Other than that, Bayona is also adept on tugging our heartstrings. Blessed with a powerful script by Sergio G. Sanchez, its everlasting theme of family survival is well-handled here, even though the emotional values are tend to be amplified for the sake of dramatic purpose. Unlike most disaster movie, Sanchez made a smart decision not to focus on too many subplots with multiple characters from all angle. Instead, he strips down to the utmost important core to keep us focused on certain individuals. The result is somewhat intensely personal as we follow the Bennett family from start to finish.The cast are similarly first-rate. Naomi Watts is as excellent as always while Ewan McGregor gives one of his best performances in recent years. His scene involving a phone call back home is certainly heartbreaking. In his live-action big screen debut, Tom Holland delivers a remarkable performance as Lucas.Technical credits are all pitch-perfect, except for Fernando Velazquez's score which tends to get overwhelmed. Sound effects are meticulously detailed, especially the one involving the tsunami sequence.",The Impossible

159,mdnobles19,By far the best movie of 2012.,9,7 January 2013,"The Impossible is the most gripping, heart shattering, intense piece of filmmaking I've seen in quite some time. The human tragedy, horror, fight for survival and unity is based on the harrowing true story of one of the worlds worst natural disasters of our time. 2004, Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and one family's terrifying account. To me, this is the most powerful, heartfelt; disaster film based on real life events since probably Titanic, if not as grand.The performances were inspiring and heartbreaking. Naomi Watts gives one of her best and challenging roles to date; to me she deserves an Oscar for her performance. Another standout was Tom Holland and believe it or not this is his first major role, which to me is a bona fide movie star! Tom was the heart and soul of this movie and carried the film like a pro and deserves to be nominated, he was great! Ewan McGregor is always a strong performer and here is no exception, you feel all of his pain and powerful will to survive and find his family that swept away in a blink of an eye. I was also really impressed with the younger siblings in this film, played by newcomers Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast; you believed every emotion from them. Gripping ride!Director, Juan Antonio Bayona has created a triumph of a film, especially since this is his first major film, but you may also remember his other and also gripping foreign film, The Orphanage. The guy has mad talent and was bold and relentless in showing the horrors on that fateful day in December. Definitely a director to look out for. Oscar worthy all the way! The writing though, didn't match the effectiveness of everything else, but wasn't distracting from the film, it just could have been more memorable.Overall, forget about all of the other Oscar contenders, The Impossible is the real human soul of the awards season and an unforgettable watch. The filmmaking, acting, story and spectacle don't get much better than this. A MUST SEE!!!!!",The Impossible
160,he88,"Good Story, But A Slow Drag At Times",7,4 August 2020,"This director did a good job except when it came to a few scenes where he tried to capture moments of silent contemplation. That's fine, but then you need to give a hint what went on and what conclusion was reached. Instead we get some far away looks...Then nothing.As for the primary action in this movie.

161,VinceGambini,"Utter rubbish, going nowhere",2,4 May 2019,"I gave this film a second try after not liking it much the first time round. That because I had been to Thailand and Sri Lanka, the places most affected by the tsunami. I have friends there and donated money to the community rebuilding efforts in one of the towns I had stayed in several times. But I was right, this is movie is a royal waste of time. The entire approach is wrong. The script sucks, the directing and acting is mediocre and the camera work... well, don't get me started. It's Shakycam all over, with the majority of scenes shot with relentless close ups, all for no reason other than screaming 'look how authentic!!' The actual tsunami scenes are shockingly realistic but that's about it. There is no real development from there, no context, nothing that would do justice to the global magnitude of the event. The story and photography suggest you should care about that one white family of five and even that doesn't work. All locals are nameless extras. Pointless and annoying to say the least.",The Impossible
162,lovintennis,Great story except for the end,5,18 September 2017,"I give this one a so-so rating. The movie as a whole, up to the end, is excellent. The climax/end, though, is so typical and stupid. There's no reason for the oldest brother to close the curtain to give his mom some privacy before he wanders off and you knew that move would play a factor in a minute because of course the dad would walk by and not be quite curious enough to see who's behind it. Then, when the son sees his dad down below, walking away through the crowd, all he has to do is yell his name and his dad, along with everyone else, would hear him. Yelling ""Dad"" would probably work, or even better, his name. He didn't have to keep wandering around the place silently until letting enough frustration build up in him to finally do it. Once he knows his dad's there, he should just start yelling for him, calling for him, and there would've been much less suspense and worry. That's just common sense.",The Impossible
163,eonbluedan-1,Where were the Oscar nods for set and sound?,7,1 February 2013,"there has been complaint from certain quarters that the film somehow does a disservice to the family by making them white Brits, rather than sticking to the reality that they are Spanish. There is also claim that, by focusing on this one fortunate family's survival, the movie arrogantly disregards the experiences of those indigenous to the country, and those whose experiences were not so fortunate. I find the prior accusation petty, and the latter ludicrous. In casting big names Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor in the lead roles, they simply ensure that the budget necessary for the production is more likely to be granted, and covered; the story of the family is still honoured well. The idea that somehow we ignore the plight of anybody else is just silly; certain moments in the movie, and in particular the beautifully conceived final scene, touch very well on the fact that many were not so lucky. The title of the film itself ties in with Bayona's intent to illustrate just how rare the sort of good fortune it depicts was, and the family are shown to clearly understand this. I am flabbergasted people are reading it any other way, to be honest.The first ten minutes of this movie are filled with a tension; the fact we know what comes next makes the setup of Maria and Henry's great relationship with their boys, Lucas, Thomas and Simon somehow more distressing. The next forty minutes are truly a technical miracle; never before have I been in a cinema feeling quite so overwhelmed by the depiction of a natural disaster. Bayona uses incredible miniature sets, real water, terrifying use of sound, and superb in-camera make-up to stunning effect, forcing us to endure the entire tsunami as mother and son do. We follow Maria and Lucas' events for about an hour before cutting over to Henry, Thomas and Simon. I will say that there is, for me, something lacking in the second act of the film, but this is possibly because the first has blown you away to such an extent, the devastated quietness of what follows feels naturally muted.This said, the performances carry through very well; McGregor is heartbreaking, and particular note has to be given to all the boys, who we adore pretty much on the spot. I would also suggest keeping an eye open for Tom Holland, who plays Lucas; his arc and the maturity of his performance feels so wonderfully natural, it is a struggle to believe his only experience has been as Billy Elliott on stage, and voicing a character in 2010's Arrietty. Naomi Watts has been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, and whilst I suspect she will not win, I can say I have not seen her giving such a physical and emotionally draining performance, and that if you only see her in this and Eastern Promises, you might be forgiven for believing she is English.This film does drain you; by the time you leave the movie, you do feel a little washed out, and thankful that in the end this is a story of human triumph over adversity and a celebration of spirit, rather than the dour tale it could have threatened to be. Despite a second act lacking the kinetic force of the first, and the fact that Watts and Holland are really the more compelling characters and performances, and despite some moments where the gorgeous score does seem to teeter on being too much, overall this is a recommended experience. I have no idea why it is not nominated for production design and sound editing, because it should wipe the floor in those categories.",The Impossible
164,pamma09,The Impossible,9,23 January 2013,"A incredible movie of parental and family love. This obviously loving family settle in at a resort in Thailand, celebrate Christmas, and then the most horrific event happens. The tsunami hits the coast of Thailand and their lives are changed to survival. I could never imagine the force of the water that hit the coast -the movie does a great job of giving you that feeling. Then the people - the destruction of families is so hard to watch - the hope of families survives. This family was so fortunate and obviously have a deep love for each other. The father searching for his wife and son, and at the same time sending his other boys off to safety. Tom Holland who plays Lucas is terrific - the connection between him an Naomi Watts is believable. He gives a great performance. Naomi Watts is equally good as the mother - wounded in many ways and still not giving up. She knows what is happening to her body and tries to hang one and have hope. At times this was a hard movie to watch but I think it is truthfully presented - being a nurse the conditions of the makeshift hospital - it was horrific. And yet given the conditions - life went on. The people searching for loved ones is well presented. A good film of a sometimes hard to watch event - good work coming out of Spain.",The Impossible

166,writerasfilmcritic,"""Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!"" ""Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!"" A Really Ridiculous Movie in Several Respects",1,9 January 2014,"After they survive the tsunami, his indulgent mom calls Lucas so many times that it will drive you up a tree, which is where the pair finally find themselves after being hit by the wave and nearly dragged out to sea in the backwash. Somehow, they didn't drown outright, which comes off as a tad hard to swallow. The experience scratched up the kid and hurt the mom more seriously, but the worst part was when a local villager drug her through the mud in a misguided effort to save her. That, I seem to recall, is what made her absolutely filthy and she never got cleaned off, not even when they were delivered to a hospital. There, she ended up in surgery, still muddied of course, even though the doctors and nurses were decked out in scrubs and masks and both they and the operating room were spotless. The contradiction between the filthy patient and the sterile surgical team was rather startling and silly. Movies and television don't understand the first frigging thing about sterile procedure, and I include in that pointed criticism the stupid show called ""ER"" that made George Clooney's career take off. Just because a health care professional or a detective dons latex gloves doesn't mean they can touch any nonsterile object (like a gruesome corpse), grab their pen and notebook or a doorknob, and then remove said gloves and regrab the same now contaminated pen and notebook or doorknob. If you don't understand why, then I don't know how to explain it to you any plainer than that. It's why public restrooms still have a door that opens in rather than out, despite other improvements that limit cross contamination. You have to grab the door handle to exit, and you must have noticed how many people simply don't bother washing their hands after using the facilities. If, after washing your own hands, you don't grab that handle with a paper towel, then you just got that guys germs all over your hand, you know, the dumb slob who just emerged from the stall after making a real stink. Think about it. In any case, wouldn't someone have cleaned these people off at least minimally when they were given a bed in a hospital? And wouldn't a person brought into surgery certainly have been properly prepped for the experience? Not in this movie. The entire family was muddied from the getgo and still muddy by the time they hopped on a jet for Singapore. It was absurd. ""Hey, folks, just allow our seats to absorb all that disgusting filth. Considering what a bad day you've had, we won't insist that you minimally clean up before boarding."" Not to harp on this issue too much, but one of the first things you should do after you are caught in a catastrophe and survived is to clean up. Those cuts and scratches and abrasions will become infected, especially in floodwaters, which are frequently swarming with bacteria. I guess they forgot about that niggling little problem when they made this dumb flick. Better to leave the actors ""realistically filthy"" so as to emphasize the extent of the terrible ordeal they had just experienced and the level of shock they are exhibiting. That major objection aside, this movie was schmaltzy, unrealistic, and rather stupid. In no way does it communicate the extent of the real tragedy that occurred that day, when upwards of 200,000 people were killed. The best scene is the flashback of the moment the tsunami hit the resort, in which the mother tumbles over and over in the water, gets hit by objects, and somehow doesn't need to breathe. It's better than the depiction of the tragedy when it occurred, by the time of which you are totally sick of the family and don't much care what happens to them.",The Impossible
167,movieman89-2,The most intense drama/disaster film I've ever seen on the big screen,8,13 January 2013,"I remember hearing about the tsunami on the radio on Boxing Day and being shocked about it. Then seeing footage of it on the news, seeing all the terrible damage it caused on people's lives. Before this was released, I read about it in Empire that they were going to make a film about it. My first thoughts were that it was going to hard hitting film. I then saw trailers and felt I had to see it. I went to see it a few days after its official release. What a brilliant film it was.Character development was slightly shaky to begin with because the disaster happened very quickly. But then the rest of the development happens through out their survival. Through out I felt a strong connection with them as the film went on. Even the scenes where the family meet up a 2 or 3 days after the wave hit, I felt a lump down my throat (spoilers excuse me). Near the end when Naimo Watts had to go through surgery, I nearly wanted to shout out 'For gods sake, don't kill her off' The acting from all the cast was fantastic. But the actor that really caught me was Tom Holland, who was sensational. Why he's not nominated for an award, I don't know. I really liked how the director gathered extras who were real survivors from the real tsunami. I felt that they really put a lot of care into this film. Except, I found that the real family this film is based on are Spaniards, not English. I would like to find out why they changed this.The filming and the cinematography was spectacular. This director has done a brilliant job. Another part that caught me was the sound. Now that doesn't happen very often with me with film. When they wave hit, I actually thought I was in the wave with them. Usually, in disaster films, when the action happens, I think 'oh wow that looks amazing'. But since this tragedy actually happened, I thought 'Oh my god'. The sound editing was fantastic. Even through the scenes where characters are walking through the damages, it was deathly silent but you can hear someone, far away in the distance, screaming for help, which was really emotional.Through out most of the film, there is not an inch of cheesiness at all. Only except, at the end, where the main characters get on a plane first class and is going to have first class health care. But this I didn't think lasted too long because the father brings out the piece of paper with names of people that were asked to find by survivors. The same for the eldest son. Also the mother having her name, tattooed on her arm so that the hospital could find her when one of her family members wanted to find her. These are all remaining scars and this made the ending very realistic.Audience at the beginning were very loud and irritating. Someone told them to be quiet. Through the film, there was complete silence, which I rarely hear in cinemas these days.I really recommend this film, please go and see it. This should nominated for more awards. I do hope Naimo Watts wins for best actress in a leading role. This will remain the most intense drama/disaster film I ever seen on the big screen.",The Impossible
168,DJRMewzique,An Emotional Journey Through the Human Spirit,10,22 January 2013,"I offer two pieces of advice if going to see ""The Impossible."" 1) Bring Kleenex 2) Bring extra Kleenex.""The Impossible"" is the true story of the Belón family. Mother, father and three children who survived the devastating 2004 Tsunami which ripped apart south-east Asia. There has been some criticism that the film ""Hollywoodized"" the story by ""whitewashing"" the family, but clearly, they have not seen the film. The beauty of this story, written by María Belón and turned into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez, may never have been able to be produced had they not been able to bring in big-name stars and get the funding for spectacular special effects, so one must forget the politics and just be truly happy this story made it to the big screen at all in a form which could touch a wide audience.Naomi Watts plays Maria Bennet who, along with her son Lucas, are separated from her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor) and her other two sons, Thomas and Simon, after the tsunami hits the resort where they were vacationing. This is the true story of how they miraculously survived and found each other.And a reminder of the hundreds of thousands that were not as fortunate.Watts has been nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her riveting performance as Maria, and with reason. The amount of emotion and pain this woman pours into the role makes it easily one of the most heartbreaking of the year. Sadly, she is not a front-runner, but this performance is far more deserving than the woman who is.And I am not one who is generally terribly impressed by younger performers, but if there was any young actor this year who actually deserves an Oscar nomination, it is Tom Holland in the role of Lucas. The depth and feeling that this kid brings to his role is astonishing for someone of his age. Unlike the other young kid that was nominated this year, Holland actually showed some actual skill in his craft and not just merely being, well, a kid.This is not to overlook excellent performances as well by an incredible strong McGregor and, yes, the two younger actors that pulled in much of the emotional weight, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast.""The Impossible"" is an extraordinary journey of the human spirit. Not always easy to watch, but the devastation and pain is worth experiencing. Through the love of this family and the efforts of the people of Thailand, you are brought into an emotional wave almost as strong as the horrific tsunami itself while it drags you through the heartbreak to the bitter end.Take my advice, bring extra Kleenex.",The Impossible
169,shannen-l-c,Completely misses the mark,4,6 August 2018,"To make a movie such as this that tackles the real life disaster of the 2004 tsunami is no small task. It took the lives of so many and even for those of us around the world that weren't there or were fortunate enough to not have any loved ones involved, it still never leaves you. I remember the devastation and disbelief of seeing it on the news just as I remember the day of the 9/11 attacks. Disasters like that are cemented in all of our consciousnesses for the rest of our lives. It's a fantastic take on the sheer devastation and shock that the people present that day must've experienced. It felt so real in places that it felt I was watching a documentary rather than a movie. The way the tsunami itself was filmed was incredible as were the reactions of the family at the centre of it all. However, none of this stops the movie from being dull. I understand that many will appreciate this movie because of what it is about and for being a realistic and honest depiction of it, but there's simply no entertainment value. There's no story, nothing to get invested in. The movie follows the same family of five from beginning to end which should have made it more impactful, but unfortunately, it didn't. Whilst the family's pain and shock was understandable and I could imagine the horror of being in that exact situation myself, I simply wasn't invested in them to the extent I should've been. Personally, I think this movie would have been a hundred times better if it was told from the perspective of the locals of Khao Lak. Although there were many Thai characters involved in the movie, it would've been even more emotional for it to be told by them. Whilst the British family we followed were physically and mentally impacted by the disaster, the reality is they could jump on a plane at the end, go home and move on with their lives. It was the local people who had their entire lives destroyed and had to pick up the pieces. Why not tell us that story instead? It seems that the filmmakers felt the only way to tell and interesting or relatable story was to tell it from an English-speaking white family's perspective, which makes no sense to me. I haven't seen any other movies based upon the 2004 tsunami, so perhaps there are already such movies out there that exist, but I still strongly believe this should have focused on the locals rather than a British family.Furthermore, although the ending was as happy as it could have been it was very unrealistic and it would've added to the authenticity of the movie if it had a different ending.",The Impossible

Unfortunately, it is usually when something bad happens and such a thing happened on Christmas of 2004 in Southeast Asia when a Tsunami hit many countries in the area. One of the countries that was hit the hardest was Thailand and this movie clearly shows the devastation of the horrific event.The movie is about a family of 5 - two parents (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three kids (one of whom is played by a young Tom Holland). They are vacationing in Thailand. They are having a wonderful Christmas when, all of a sudden, a tsunami hits the streets and literally destroys everything in its path, tearing the family apart.Before I get to the amazing performances - and indeed they are amazing - I must start off with the wave sequence itself. Everybody that was a part of this sequence deserves an Oscar for their stellar work. Although horrific, every aspect of it is beautifully done. We see people getting hit around by debris under water; we see people hanging on to fallen trees for dear life; we see people struggling to stay afloat amidst the roaring waves. J.A. Bayona has created a great sequence in a great movie and he really should have been recognized a lot more for this movie.That being said, it really is the performances that sell this movie more than anything. Naomi Watts gives one of the best performances of her career, earning the Oscar nomination for her part in the film. She spends about 2/3 of the film beaten, bruised and looking nothing like a Hollywood star, and you can really see the emotions that are going through her head. There's one particularly scene towards the end where she says something that will make your heart break. I won't say what it is, but you'll know when she says it. Ewan McGregor also gives an unbelievable performance; seriously, when is the Academy going to honor this man? He really deserved the Oscar nomination for Moulin Rouge and he deserved it here too. I really hope that he gets recognized someday because he really deserves it. However, the true star of the show here is future Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland. Even before he was saving people with his webslinging abilities, he was saving them with his compassion in this movie! He spends the movie helping a lot of people - whether it's his family or other families. When he sees the other families reuniting when his has not, you can really see the mixed feelings of joy and pain in his face. A mature actor who will one day get an Oscar.My one complaint about this movie: I wish that they had spent a bit more time on Ewan McGregor's character and the two younger boys. Once the wave hits, we spend a lot of time with Naomi Watts and Tom Holland, but there is a moment in which Ewan McGregor tells his little boys that he was the most scared when he saw that he was alone and then he saw his two little boys and that he wasn't scared anymore. That would have been such a great moment to see on film and it really would have made the movie even better in my opinion.All in all, a beautiful movie with superb performances all around.

One day, Lucas arrives where his mother was resting only to find his mother gone. A friendly caretaker (Ploy Jindachote) helps Lucas find his mother but she is still too weak for surgery. Can the doctors stabilize her enough to operate on her? Where are Henry, Thomas and Simon? Are their lives taken by the devastating tsunami?I wanted to watch The Impossible because I wanted to remember what I felt like almost ten years ago when that tsunami devastated Indonesia, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka. I was in shock that one natural disaster could take such a heavy toll. This movie does an excellent job of physically recreating the damage done by the tsunami, and I give the filmmakers credit for tackling a story that's extremely difficult to tell, but this is a movie with surprisingly many shortcomings. It's based on a true story, but the real family was Spanish, the movie family is British, so again, like The Butler, how many liberties did the writers take with the actual story? I didn't like the ethnocentric focus of this movie, if viewers knew nothing about the tsunami of 2004, they would think that all the victims were European, because Europeans are the only victims shown in this movie. The reality is that hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of the 2004 tsunami, most of whom were Asian. Other than the caretaker, and a nurse, none of the characters in the movie were Asian, that's not right. This is a movie that almost demands a tragic ending, to reflect the tragic circumstances of the storm, I won't tell you the ending, you have to watch it yourself to see if it's fitting. The writers even write in some product placement involving a can of Coke, hardly appropriate for a tragedy of this magnitude.One big reason to watch this movie, despite whatever shortcomings the script may have, are the performances. Naomi Watts has a physically grueling and emotionally taxing performance. She gives her all in this performance, there is nothing left behind, no physical or emotional pain unmined. She is the soul of this movie. Ewan McGregor gives a similarly strong and emotional performance. He is such a versatile actor, and is so good in so many different roles, Big Fish, Salmon Fishing in The Yemen, Attack of the Clones Revenge of the Sith, he brings an incredible vitality and humanity to all his roles. The kids are all very good also, they are very mature at times, yet very vulnerable at others.The story is long, but the pacing is good, so the movie doesn't drag. The visuals speak for themselves. The scenes of devastation speak in ways that words cannot express. Those scenes by themselves make the movie worth watching.Impossible to find a good movie?

176,digiteum,Larger than life - caught in a Tsunami and survived,10,25 April 2019,"A true story, and I liked the fact that the holiday appeared perfectly normal and calm, that is until the wave hit.... then disaster as the family are split up under the water. At least one of the children greatly disturbed and finding himself lost. Worth watching and a tear jerker as the audience become sucked into the film.",The Impossible
177,donuthaters12,One Of The Best Films Of 2012,10,10 July 2013,"I had high expectations for this film as it looked like something that would be nominated for Best Picture or something just as prestigious. When the awards came, it did not get enough praise as I thought it would. So my expectations of this film was a little lower coming in, now that I have finally seen it, I am baffled on this film not being regarded as one of the best films of 2012.The film's plot is that this British family who lives in Japan, who decides to take a Christmas holiday in Thailand and a tsunami hits the holiday resort which forces them to be separated form one another. Screenplay written by Sergio Sanchez, who also did the screenplay of J.A Bayona's previous film The Orphanage, is an amazing story of family and resiliency. The strongest area of the film is the event of the tsunami and, Maria and Lucas' attempt to find each other. It's really powerful and moving. The latter half of the film may not be as strong and frightening as the first half but it still works as the aftermath of the event on this family.I have a feeling that in the future, we are all going to see a lot Juan Antonio Bayona's films being critically acclaimed and receiving awards. He knows how to create something so shocking without making it feel unfamiliar. We all see injuries and pain everyday but not like this. I cringed a couple of times on the gashes that are found on people. He wanted to make the event to feel heavy and really see the impact it has on the family, whether it's emotional or physical trauma. The disaster scene alone was suspenseful and felt that maybe someone won't make it. Bayona doesn't want the CGI effects of this film to feel too ambitious or too flashy and just focusing on making it feel real. The ending was predictable but after what these people have just went through it's acceptable.Beautiful. Simply Gorgeous. The way Oscar Faura captured Thailand before and after the incident are done so well that it sometimes dominates the scene. The lighting feels very natural and doesn't at any point become too forced or artificial. Even cramped and intimate moments in the hospital or the plane works. There will be at times where the camera feels shaky but I felt that it was tamed well and doesn't feel at all distracting.A lot of the people working on this film has worked with Guillermo Del Toro productions before and I think that's what makes the film work at times as the crew know each other and knows each others abilities. Fernando Velazquez is the film's composer and I am familiar with his recent film Mama, also produced by Guillermo Del Toro. The Impossible's score at the start is subtle but as the drama elevates, his score becomes bigger. I did not really took notice of the score's presence at times as it has been outshone by fantastic cinematography and amazing acting performances.Everybody in this film was great, in particular Naomi Watts. You really see it in her performance that everything that just happened hit her like a wave, don't mind the pun, and makes her vulnerable emotionally as well as physically. There was a beautiful scene with her, her son and this young boy they were able to save and the boy caresses her hair as a way of saying thank you, this scene shows the best in her acting as she didn't need to say anything and yet so much about her character is said with a single smile. Ewan McGregor was good but I felt didn't carry it as much as Watts did but nevertheless great. How Bayona was able to get something great in the children's acting was beyond me because they were fantastic.One of the best films of 2012, probably just under my favorite Silver Linings Playbook, and is deserving of much more praise than it currently has. Strong performances from the actors and moving drama made this film unforgettable. Bayona has made a film that shows the other filmmakers out there he is a force to be reckon with. I am excited to see what he is going to make next and hopefully it's as beautifully crafted as this one.",The Impossible

179,jefflouvre-435-77367,Tsunami film shows that it pays to be a white if you're caught in a disaster,5,14 January 2013,"ONE thing I learnt from watching Spanish director J.A. Bayona's tsunami disaster film is that it pays to have travel insurance and it's good to be a white if you're caught in a natural disaster.For the first lesson, I'd like to think that my insurance firm would rush over a luxurious private jet to pick up me and my family and transport me to a proper hospital in another country.I don't know of any insurance firm that would go to these lengths for its customers. It would have probably asked me to pay first and then make claims upon my return.For the second lesson, Bayona — whose movie is based on the true account of a Spanish family, the Belons — focuses on the impact of the Dec 26, 2004, tsunami on one white family.On watching it for the first time, I thought that it made sense to describe the trauma experienced by one family whose members were separated by the giant tidal wave. The sole white family could have represented the multitudes of families whose lives came crashing down to earth.On watching it for the second time, however, I noticed a huge void regarding the sufferings experienced by the local residents, that is, the Thais.The kid on the left doesn't look too frightened about what's going to happen in this CGI shot. Indonesia was the hardest hit, with about 130,000 deaths; Thailand recorded 5,395 deaths, and Malaysia, 68.In the film, nothing is seen or said about the Thai experience. The white woman and her son are brought to safety by an elderly man, and an elderly woman puts a blouse over the white woman.Some villagers take the injured white woman and he son to the hospital, and along the way, the plight of so many more whites is shown.At the hospital, there are only whites in it, with their pain and anguish being the film's foremost concern.The boy, too, helps to track only white patients.There are scenes of bodies left in the aftermath of the destruction, and they are white ones.When the husband of the white woman manages to call home, he talks only of his family. There's no mention about the death and destruction in Thailand.The finale of the film is also contrived. The director milks every second leading up the reconciliation between the family members in the hospital.The family in concern comprises big company employee Henry (Ewan McGregor), non-practising doctor wife Maria (Naomi Watts, nominated for an Oscar best actress for this role), and sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast).The film opens with the family in a plane about to land in a southern Thai island. Eldest son Lucas is rapped by his mum for not taking care of his brother.The family members settle in for their holiday. They are thrilled to light Thai balloons on Christmas Day on the resort's beach, but again, there's not a single Asian in sight.I had visited Phuket during the 2009 Christmas season, so I know that Thai resorts are overrun by whites. I had even joked that the number of whites was greater than the number of whites during this time of the year. But not even one non-white at the beach? Ewan McGregor with Samuel Joslin (left) and Oaklee Pendergast. Maria and Lucas are separated from the other three by the tsunami. I had seen Clint Eastwood's Hereafter and Korean tsunami disaster film Tidal Wave (2009), so I was prepared for the onslaught.But the director goes one better by showing what happens to Maria and Thomas in the water. They are hit by so many objects that it's a miracle that they did not die in the water.The film follows the badly-injured Maria and her son as they struggle to reach safety.However, I cannot take anything away from the excellent acting. Holland is wonderful in showing greater responsibility, especially when he orders his mum to get to the top of a tree and forget about the cries of a kid.Watts, for her part, must show pain, compassion and the desire to see her family again. She's terrific in the first half but she's then limited to a hospital bed and looking tired with a ghastly white pallor.McGregor gets to shine, even though his high-pitched boyish voice is distracting. His scene with the second son, when he convinces the kid to take care his brother while he (McGregor) goes to look for the others, is touching.Responsibility is a theme in the film, and all the kids step up their duties during this critical moment: Lucas takes care of his mum, while Thomas minds Simon.The ending of the film is like that in Argo. Viewers already know how the film will end, so there's no dramatic tension, but that doesn't stop Bayona from creating excitement out of nothing.www.jeffleemovies.com",The Impossible
180,honeybloggs-69648,More about a relationship than a Tsunami !,4,12 August 2019,"The movie was more about the relationship between a mother and her eldest son .Her young son steps up and looks after his mum and ensures that she survives . It had a couple of moments that were quite moving .Tom Holland who played the eldest son was brilliant ! Watts bizarrely looked like Nicole Kidman and even copied her style of acting! She was wasn't bad but I kept thinking that I was watching Nicole Kidman! . Btw Watch out at the beginning the movie's a bit gory!The effects of the actual Tsunami before it hit were visually poor . It did not capture the enormity of the Tsunami . The after effects shown weren't great either . I'm sure there was much more devastation than shown .The hospital was shown to being very dirty , including the mattresses . It was the usual cliche ! In fact Thai hospitals are not dirty . They are very clean. Some Thai hospitals are of a very high standard. They are of a much better standard than any of the private hospitals in the UK and Europe. ( I've been in hospital in Thailand!)As others have said the movie did not show the suffering of the Thai people at all . We didn't even see any badly injured Thai people . It appeared as though only White Tourists were badly hurt and suffered !The saddest part of the movie was that it focused solely on the privileged White tourists . I found this very disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Thai people injured and dead in the Tsunami .The movie tried too hard to pull at the viewer's heart strings . As a result it became a bit sickly sweet . It had a 'Hollywood type ' ending . Yuk!",The Impossible

182,SoverniX,LIVE IN SPITE OF... BELIEVE IN SPITE OF... ALWAYS,10,26 October 2020,"The film ""Impossible"" is the best work of cinema in the genre of disaster films based on the great tragedy that occurred at the end of 2004. Stunningly filmed scenes of natural violence amaze and terrify at the same time, because you understand that all this happened in reality, with real people, not all of whom were able to escape (according to various estimates, as a result of the earthquake and natural disasters that occurred after it, from 225 thousand to 300 thousand people died)...It is also noteworthy that this is not an American blockbuster. Spain provides a good example of how you can make high-quality movies without resorting mainly to special effects (although they are present here, but only in order to convey to the viewer the scope of the disaster that happened many years ago). I want to emphasize the beautiful performance of the actors - you live these minutes, hours of despair with them, worry and sometimes do not hold back tears. Naomi Watts, who played the role of the mother of the family, by the way, was chosen for the filming of the heroine played by her (Maria Belen Alvarez). Naomi was her favorite actress, after Maria saw her in the movie ""21 grams"". But most of all admires of course Thomas Holland, the same 13-year-old Lucas, the eldest son of the family. But this is his first role, which should be noted - such a debut was appreciated by the American national Council of film critics, who awarded the young actor the award in the category ""Breakthrough of the year""! In the film, he resembled the angel himself, his courage resisting the ubiquitous fear and willing to help everyone who needs it so badly. Remember how he looked forward to his mother coming to her senses to tell her ""something very important""?! And this ""important"" was for him to share the news that he met the same boy in the hospital with the father who found him. The same boy they had saved in the darkest moments after the disaster. At the end of the tape, where Maria looks out the window of a flying plane, as if you catch the thoughts that fall with tears from her tired eyes ... Oh, how much gratitude they have to the Almighty, and also... in her eyes you can read the love for her family, and in particular, for her eldest son named Lucas. Thanks in many ways to his perseverance and zeal, the fate of not only his family, but also perhaps other people whom he managed to help, was formed in such a happy ending of this story!We should also mention the music in this film. She's amazing! Many melodies in different scenes were written by the famous Spanish composer Fernando Velazquez. I admit that some of these soundtracks are still relevant in my music playlist, and you can call me crazy, but as soon as I hear these incredibly sensual tunes, I sincerely want to go outside and hug the first person I meet...This film does not leave anyone indifferent, it fills the heart with warmth and faith in the brightest ideals of human relations. Very often, in the daily bustle, people do not see each other, remaining indifferent to human destinies. Sadly, it is in dramatic situations that one comes to understand the true nature of unity. It is impossible to convey this in words, but at least for the sake of this awareness, we can safely say that the film was not made in vain, despite some critics who ask questions like ""why profit from tragedies by shooting such pictures?"". Many years will pass, and I am sure that the interest in the film ""Impossible"" will continue to attract the attention of those who are alien to such concepts as indifference and disbelief. After all, is it not thanks to the opposition of these weaknesses, in an incredible way, contrary to all expectations, the family was together!",The Impossible
183,barberic-695-574135,Just Brilliant - Up there with the best ever films,10,11 February 2013,"I suppose one of the reasons this film is so special to me is that I know that part of the world really well, in fact it could so easily have been me on that beach on the morning of December 26th, 2004. The previous year we were there, just a few miles south of Kho Lak.We went back the following year and have been back 3 more times since. The sad thing is, the Tsunami changed many things, the really sad thing is that the ""aid money"" and corruption that followed has done more damage than the initial disaster; the area's affected will never recover from the over development and greed that has changed the tranquility, but most of all changed the people.As a film, it is a cinematic master piece, one of the best films I have ever seen, stunning, moving, heart rendering - brilliant.

184,Jerominator,Surprisingly good,8,1 August 2013,"For some reason I really wanted to dislike this movie. Exploiting a natural disaster to make a story with a happy ending. I'd heard good things about it though so I watched it.Easy to be cynical or picky about something like this. If you're going to make a Hollywood movie about something so huge and sensitive that really happened, you're surely going to put a lot of noses out of joint and get a lot of flak whatever choices you make.I too was slightly perplexed when I realised the family whose experience this story was based on was Spanish. I hate it when they mess with the details in true stories, yet I've come to accept that's how movies work. Besides, if the popular account is to be believed then it turns out the real Maria had a hand in choosing Naomi Watts for the part. The rest, I would imagine, is the studio trying to increase box office sales by appealing to a wider audience.The only thing that bothered me slightly was how it focused on the tourists' plight while seemingly ignoring the plight of the indigenous population. Then I remembered I was watching a movie, not a documentary so they either make it about the one thing or the other. Lets face it if they did make a movie about the plight of the indigenous population, it would lose box office sales. Sad but true.I do honestly think there's a danger of over-sentimentalising real life tragedies on the cinema screen. Great for making people weep en masse, but somehow surely missing the bigger picture. But if it rains you get wet, and if you go to the movies, you get sentimental half-truths with orchestral scores.So all the factual hang-ups, moral implications and story choices aside, I think this was a very well acted film which makes you wonder what it would be like for you and your family to be caught in such a terrible event.Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor were good as the parents. I guess Watts got the best screen time, but I thought McGregor put in one of his better performances of late. Particularly good when he was calling home.The children were pretty good for children, especially the older boy.It made me laugh when somebody complained about seeing a breast in this movie. My god - when you consider what it must have really been like there, and the horrific sights that would've littered the landscape, you get upset about a part of the human body being exposed? Really? What kind of reality do these people live in?I don't know how they recreated some of the scenes but I thought they did an amazing job. Co-ordinating all those extras must've been hell. That was the best aspect of the movie for me - how convincing some of the settings were.It all gets highly emotive surrounding the separated family, and there are some pretty gory scenes too so watch it with a box of Kleenex and a blindfold handy.An all-round well-polished, annoyingly good(for some reason!), must-see movie. I wouldn't have thought you'd want to let kids less than 11 watch it, but barring that, good for the family - because that's what it's all about.",The Impossible

I have seen Bayona's earlier masterpiece, the horror film ""The Orphanage"", so I'm not surprised at his ability with actors; once again he helms an extraordinary and difficult film.I disagree with others in regards to the relationships in this movie, as I find them quite complex and moving.

191,cguldal,"Well acted, but hyperfocused on experience of a tiny minority of white tourists",5,19 December 2020,"No question The Impossible has great acting and a heart wrenching plot. However, for a film that declares to be based on true events (the story of a Spanish family played by British actors), the choice of a British white family is a deliberate one at putting profit over art and truth. Other choices, like focusing on Thailand, which wasn't the epicenter of the disaster, also add to this poor judgement. To have a Spanish director, but to be able to even commit to a Spanish (at least Spanish-speaking) cast, even that... The truth here is that big names of white actors like Watts, McGregor and Holland most definitely sold/sells the movie far more than Spanish names, even well known ones would have, forget about native Thai actors or South Asian actors even. This is then not just a reflection of how racist/white washed the film industry is, but also how racist we as film goers are. Imagine how well a film that would require Western (especially American) audiences to read subtitles would do (gasp!) We all know the answer.However, the film industry is not off the hook. It is the artists' and film industry's responsibility to commit to diversity and true representation over mere profit (easier said than done, I know), especially when they claim things like ""based on true events."" This may be acceptable by law, but it't not nearly enough ethically. You can do better than this. Please do. I will watch even if the main characters are not white and privileged.The film had opportunities to at least highlight the impact of the disaster on local communities, yet each and every one of these was missed. Let's say you had to have white actors, fine. Let's say you had to focus on the white people's struggle to get out and get back to their cushy lives, fine. But those opportunities to show the plight of the local people who were ALSO living the disaster, who also died and suffered and lost their only way of making a living/feeding their families and at the very least had to stop what they were doing and go help the rich tourists, who couldn't get the regular healthcare they normally could have due to their hospitals being overwhelmed by disaster victims, who were heroic, who made so many sacrifices for strangers... Those opportunities were lost here. There wasn't a moment where the hyperfocus on white people was lifted. There wasn't a moment when the white characters looked around them and counted themselves lucky and uberprivileged compared to the locals who had no escape, no charter plane to lift them off and up to Singapore. None, zero.Even if this was a true story acted by people of the same ethnicity, even if it were absolutely true, I'd like the film industry to choose better which stories to tell, to spend all that production dollars on. Is this the best story to tell about this disaster? Does this story represent the story of more than 200,000 people who died? It doesn't have to, but when you claim it's a true story, and when you decide to spend sooo much money on this one story... maybe it should? Sometimes? Often?I hope Watts, McGregor and Holland and others make better choices in the future and use their fame to help open and keep open doors for other actors who are not white and would/could easily have played these parts. Still, choosing a project like this over some romantic comedy (which would have made more money for these actors, I imagine (but I don't know for sure)) is a good deed and I applaud them for at least drawing attention to this disaster that took so many lives and devastated whole economies.",The Impossible
192,pseawrig,really boring,2,21 September 2013,"I don't know how they did it, but the makers of this movie made the 2004 Tsunami seem really boring. In fact, only about five minutes of the film is dedicated to the Tsunami itself. There is no footage of the awesome pullback of the ocean before the wave hits and very little of the wave hitting. Instead, we watch a family who gets separated and then spends the rest of the movie looking for each other. The disaster appears as little more than a catalyst for this family's traumatic separation. It's more like a Lifetime movie than a film about an epic disaster. I was truly disappointed. If you want to see powerful images of the 2004 Tsunami, I suggest ""Tsunami: Caught on Camera,"" a documentary made up only of eye-witness footage. The documentary is powerful and eerie, while this film is understated and prosaic. This movie is just dull. I am baffled by its high ratings on IMDb.

Arguably, he's the central character (although all three of those actors take center stage at various times), and he easily showcases a star on the rise.The film itself is a sucker punch. It hits hard and keeps you hooked either through suspense or heartache. One caveat though: this is by far the most intense and difficult PG-13 film I've ever seen. I'm sure it was rated R until it was toned down for the MPAA, and it probably squeaked by with it's PG-13 rating by only a hair. If you're have difficulty with reality based trauma or are in a headspace that might not tolerate this well, give it some time before you see it--it doesn't hold back what being in a tsunami would feel like.

Horror! Exploding into her legendary screaming skills or well, lack of control. Certainly not worthy of an Oscar nod, particularly since this mode is her norm in most films to date. It just doesn't rise to the same caliber of acting of Meryl Streep or Sally Field's abilities to invent diverse characters and moods in every film. One doesn't know WHAT may happen with them in the role; one can safely guess with Watts.However, the film which retells the true story of a family's horrendous ordeal experiencing and enduring the terror of the catastrophic tsunami in Thailand of 2004 has a lot of emotional punch to it. Helping the script along is the astounding cinematography depictions of activity UNDER the water and in it! Truly -- well, real! I also appreciate the lack of any hidden ""agenda"" messages about politics, etc -- but rather focus on the story of one family out of thousands terrifying nightmare.",The Impossible
197,aequus314,Emotionally stirring drama. Entertaining!,8,28 January 2013,"The Impossible delivers what it promises; and movie goers can expect an intense, disaster film set against 2004′s Indian Ocean tsunami.This latest film by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) is based on a real family and their harrowing experience while holidaying in Thailand. When violence struck the seaside region of Khao Lak on boxing day, all five individuals were separated and left to fend for themselves.Bayona spends half an hour introducing British family; the Bennetts, establishing relationship dynamics that effectively presage each member's survival instincts. Henry and Maria (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts) are loving and middle-aged parents to privileged kids: eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) is 12 and outlier of the group; second child Tom is 9½, thoughtful and sensitive with a soft spot for astronomy; youngest son Simon is 5, young and adorable apple of the eye.It's just another morning by the pool when cataclysmic destruction arrives and the first wall of wave smashes against the resort. Palm trees and structures collapse, tourists and locals are washed away. In one of the most riveting sequences of this film, we witness the violent assault Maria endures when submerged underwater--she is physically mutilated, crushed, knocked, twirled, punched, slashed by miles of debris before spotting Lucas. The second act begins with a frantic and painful race against time to safety before another wave hits.Pervasive atmosphere of this film is dank and risky, but the fact that Maria and Lucas are still alive shrouds unspeakable hope that their loved ones will live. In classic passion and ferocity so often evoked by Spanish cinema; we worry for these characters and despair at the brutal invasion of fragile life. With Maria teetering on the edge of fatal injury and the fates of Henry, Tom, Simon still unknown; Bayona successfully creates emotionally stirring drama. Brilliant performances by Watts and Holland will also bring tears to the soft-hearted.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",The Impossible
198,cultjones,Tearjerking; The Impossible,7,11 February 2013,"On vacation at an exotic resort in Thailand, a family of 5 are torn apart by a large tsunami that rips the island apart. The mother, played by Naomi Watts and oldest of the three sons do their best to survive while the father, played by Ewan McGregor, juggles between the safety of his two boys and the search for his wife and missing son.Director Juan Antonio Bayona vividly shares the shocking and yet, miraculous story of the Alvarez family. The cinematography when the tsunami sweeps in is nothing short of stunning and captivating. A glimpse of the sheer force and destruction behind this natural disaster will undoubtedly leave you breathless. Watts delivers a strong performance as does McGregor but the stand out here, besides the cinematography, is the brilliant and mature portrayal of the oldest son by young, Tom Holland.An emotional tearjerker, The Impossible is a brilliant film, which will have you glued to the screen as you root against the odds while simultaneously fearing the worst. The fact that it's based on a true story is a testament of the human spirit and the bond of a family. The Impossible is definitely one to watch.",The Impossible

201,italo505,Impossible not to cry,10,7 January 2013,"The Impossible is the incredible true story of the Belón family who are vacationing on this beautiful resort in Thailand along with their 3 boys: a 12 teenager named Lucas, another 7 ½ and a 5 year old. They wake up the morning after Christmas ready to enjoy another beautiful day at the beach resort when disaster strikes. The first few minutes after the giant waves come crashing down palm trees, cars, debris, people and everything in their path, I kept clutching onto the armrests bracing for impact. Even after seeing Hereafter and Tsunami: The Aftermath, including the real footage from that fateful day, the horrible images from the tsunami still send chills down my spine. Not only do I have to endure seeing people disappear under the waves but then I get a look under water which is even more frightening than what's afloat. If you've ever been dragged by a giant wave while boogie boarding then you can just imaging what that felt like and multiply it by a hundred and you'll begin to understand how your body gets crushed, mutilated, scraped under the violent current underwater. No detail is spared in The Impossible and, as much as you try to look away, the noise of desperation deafens you and you just can't help but feel helpless. Both Maria (Naomi Watts) and her oldest son Lucas try to hold onto each other against the violent waves. Here lies the heart of the movie and the unforgettable struggle to survive is what drives this movie, gets a hold of the audience and doesn't let go. The images are so real that I felt as if I was being hit by the waves and the debris that they carry within. What director Juan Antonio Bayona accomplished with this recreation of the devastation that unfolds with the most powerful tsunami recorded in modern history is unparalleled. What's more unparalleled is the miracle that Henry (Ewan McGregor) and his 2 youngest sons have also survived miraculously the first impact of the tsunami and are now in search for Maria and Lucas which is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I believe that Naomi Watts's Maria really held on to life for her oldest son since they had lost faith in seeing the rest of the family. Lucas confronts her mother and tells her, without hesitation, that they're all dead and they only have each other to survive. As hard as it is to accept, she must accept that her son may be right and she sort of make him in charge since her condition gets worse by every moment. Lucas (played by Tom Holland) must make the decisions that would either save them or cost their lives so he must grow up and fast. Luckily they are found by villagers that take them to safety.",The Impossible

If you are squeamish however this movie is not for those who are. From beginning to end, the movie is intense and pushes you inevitably to the edge of your seat. It is impossible to hold back tears from the moment the water hits until the movie ends... for a moment it's almost impossible to say that this is a movie because of just how surreal the emotion of it all really is.

This movie is 3 times more painful than ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Zero Dark"" had torture in it.I now have more fearful respect for consequences of a Tsunami. Every painful thing that can happen to a person in such a disaster is presented in this movie. It overwhelmed me and I wanted to walk out. But I stayed. My day was slightly ruined by this movie.

It was soppy beyond belief, the acting was second class, with the child actor playing Thomas saying lines that were so unbelievable and contrived. As a film it certainly had me thinking, to the point that i had to have my say, i honestly can't recommend this to anyone.

208,aleator,A Curate's Egg of a movie,6,19 January 2013,"The actual tsunami is well done; this and the scenes immediately after are gruelling and hard to watch - lots of blood and pain, near-drowning etc. Then the movie settles down into an old-fashioned 'search for lost family members' type of pic with all the sentimental manipulation that involves. Much of the film leaves a poor impression - it replaces the actual Spanish family with a classic middle-class English whose members display all the mannerisms and behaviour you would expect right down to the heroic eldest son who saves his mother etc (Admittedly a fine performance from young Tom Holland). The film is blatantly manipulative, the music swells in all the expected places and so it's hard to feel genuinely moved by the family's plight. Just as irritating is the fact that much of the filming is by hand-held camera and after half-an-hour or so I began to feel distinctly queasy. I really do wish directors would put out of their heads the notion that realism can only be depicted by use of the hand-held camera.",The Impossible

210,dbracco86,"A visceral, harrowing portrayal of one family's experience during the 2004 tsunami",10,28 December 2012,"I'm not even sure it's fair to count what I'm about to say as a spoiler because it has become a widely known true story, but the warning is there anyway. From this point forward I will discuss all aspects of the film, including the ending.I think it's important to point out that while the film's conceit--the focus on one Spanish-turned-British family who somehow managed to all survive--may bother some, and it's a worthy point, I also think that complaint is a little unfair. The creators of the film and all involved have been very clear that they became attached to this one woman's story, and that's the film's perspective. Maria Belon, the real-life mother of the family, was on the set much of the time ensuring that everything took place as it was. Who are we to deny her interpretation of that day? From her perspective, ethnicities took a back seat to humanity, and the people of Thailand took time away from their own grief and ailments to help her and her son. That is what she knows, and that is what this story is about.For as much as I read about the tsunami sequence (and I read a lot about it), I still wasn't prepared for how visceral it was going to be. It's very difficult to watch--overwhelming, even. The 3D sound engineering is incredible...and loud. But you're in it, as much as I believe a viewer possibly could be. You panic for these characters. And when it's over, you feel as scattered as they do. It's a really remarkable, watershed moment in physical film making.The journey that follows is paced and structured nicely. We follow Maria (Naomi Watts) and her eldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland) through their story until it comes to a distinct point, then we see where Henry (Ewan McGregor) and the other two boys are before their stories inevitably converge. Because I knew the ending of the story--because it was marketed as a story of their survival--this isn't the typical ""will they/won't they"" trope of disaster movies (and, I suppose, romantic comedies). It's more in the ""how""--how will they find each other amidst the chaos, and when? And when they do is the only real critique I have of the film. The film has been building toward this moment and the actors have propelled us there emotionally--the sweeping, melodramatic score at the moment of their reunion is almost distracting, and I imagine it will become even more so upon repeated viewings when I'm less taken in by the story unfolding.An ultimately minor quibble amongst an extraordinary movie, however. The three leads are sublime, brave, and earnest. Holland is a real find; the film sits squarely, unfairly on his shoulders and he carries it with real gravitas and poise that defy the fact this is his first on-camera film. McGregor's role is more limited, but no less powerful, particularly in one devastating scene when he must make the dreaded phone call home. Finally, Watts continues to prove that when it comes to physical and emotional anguish, no one can hit the same real nerve as she can. She gives way to the weight of the story (and water) as if she were a cartoon, bending her body, face, and voice to the will of the elements and the emotions. Her story on the page must read rather one dimensional, but on the screen it is deeply layered. Her connection with Belon is evident; she very much embodies this mother. Hopefully this will finally mark the turn in how people view her as an actress and she starts getting all the lofty praise she deserves.The Impossible may have arrived too late and may be too intense for the award season powers that be, and it will always come with the asterisk of controversy with regard to is particular portrayal, but I feel like that complaint comes from those who decided the film was in the wrong before they saw it. As the film comes to its conclusion, it isn't a happy story about a family that found each other against impossible odds. It's a somber, honest conclusion about the pain of surviving and the fragility of life as much as it is about the marketed triumph of the human spirit. Spirit got this family far, but not as far as pure, inconsistent, and unfair luck. And I think this movie knows it.",The Impossible
211,alexdelliott,emotional roller-coaster,8,10 January 2013,"I don't know anyone who was involved in the tsunami of 2004 and for that I am truly grateful. This film is a great example of how to take the terrible nature of such an event and create a really compelling story about the themes of love, hope, helplessness and, above all, panic.The story focuses around one family as they struggle to find each other and stay alive in the aftermath of the vicious tsunami of 2004. However it still does a lot to show the mass horror the tsunami caused for everyone involved. Not a lot of films do this in my opinion, they manage to keep us connected to that family whilst also making us feel for every character we see. This is done as well as, if not better than, Titanic. The story manages to strike the right nerve at the right time, it gives us just the right amount of hope for our characters, which is cleverly juxtaposed by the feelings of helplessness and dread. As said, the film takes you on an emotional journey, and this is in no small part due to our actors. The acting is fantastic all round. McGregor is reliably good as ever although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have hoped. Naomi Watts has really entered my radar recently, I've been seeing some of her films and she really is one of the best actresses of this generation. However Tom Holland as Lucas owns this film. He isn't even 18 yet and I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a very big star in film. The other kids played their parts very well. The acting adds to the great character development so much so that I actually found myself hoping the tsunami wouldn't actually happen.This film really surprised me and I didn't even plan on seeing it. No film is perfect, but this one left me feeling emotionally drained. Hollywood could certainly learn a lot of lessons from this about how to make a compelling film without the need for clichés and formulaic plots. The Impossible comes with my highest recommendation for those who want a subtle but emotionally moving film about the lengths ordinary people will go to protect those they love.",The Impossible

214,parallel_projection,"Harrowing, emotional portrayal of a devastating event",10,6 January 2013,"It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible, devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead, director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez focused smartly on the true story of one family's struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th, 2004. This allows the film to be much more intimate, and the audience is quickly able to connect with the Bennett family, starting simply with their arrival to Thailand. While the audience was filled with dread in anticipation of what was to come, the Bennetts were blissfully unaware and enjoying themselves over vacation. However, everything soon takes a terrifying turn as the tsunami hits their resort in a horrifyingly realistic manner, sweeping up people as they attempt to flee before it or protect themselves from its awesome power.At this point, I, too, felt like I was drowning. The camera bobs in and out of darkness, in and out of the water, as the family's matriarch, Maria, struggles for breath. Then, clinging hopelessly onto a palm tree, she screams all too realistically for anyone who could possibly help her in a desperate, surprisingly shocking moment. It is at this point where she spots her son, Lucas, floating in the fierce waves, and I held my breath as the struggled for what seemed like an eternity to reunite in the water.In a way, Lucas, brilliantly portrayed by newcomer Tom Holland, carries the film from this point forward. He takes on the role of protecting his stubborn yet badly injured mother, and in the process he's forced to mature far too quickly. During every moment, his emotions and facial expressions convey more than any words ever could, as she shies away from and is frightened by his mother's injuries and nudity, all the while attempting to deal with the scope of the pain and devastation.However, it is his mother, Maria, whom the film truly centers around. Naomi Watts gives quite possibly her finest performances to date, portraying harrowing desperation, stubborn determination in the face of incredible pain and agony, and, ultimately, a sense of love and care despite her deteriorating state. True, she is bedridden for about half the film, but it is during this time where there are these small moments of tenderness and humility which undoubtedly makes Watts's performance one of the best of the year.In fact, the entire cast was exceptional, including Ewan McGregor, the father desperately trying to put together his family again, and the two littlest sons, Thomas, played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, played by Oaklee Pendergast, both of whose innocence prevented them from thoroughly capturing the extent of this tragic event. The story of these three is intertwined with that of Maria and Lucas, as they all struggle for survive amidst the destruction and reunite amidst the chaos. Ultimately, this is a touching and heartwarming film, as the true kindness of humanity can be seen in this time of great loss. Yes, the tsunami is terrifying, the injuries gruesome and shockingly realistic, and the pain and suffering visible on just about everyone's faces. However, the Bennetts' story is a remarkable one of love, determination, and hope, and it simply cannot be missed.",The Impossible

The film placed a clearly biased attention on a white family and did not spared a thought for the local population, who suffered a lot more and had to remain with the situation. I was expecting at least a tribute to the volunteer rescue efforts at the end of the film. There was none.I think this film does a great injustice to those who deserve the attention. It also relies far too much on the shock factor and the overall tone gave far too much Hollywoodism to be desired.The only redeeming part for me was a line uttered by a dying woman.

I hated all the acting, especially from that one woman I can't remember the name of who was in King Kong (which seems like Pulp Fiction when compared to whatever this was) who's method acting consists of fake crying and standing there looking bored. Ewan McGregor was also pretty bad but that's nothing new is it. Tom Holland was.... there.
The characters were the embodiment of pretentious. Ah yes let's take our kids on a holiday to Thailand just because we can afford it. I mean, kids enjoy most holidays because they don't understand the concept of 5 star hotels or money. Well I'm pretty sure they'd have enjoyed a trip to a slaughterhouse more than this.
It's pretty lame too how they cashed in on a tragic disaster which killed a LOT of people. I can think of at least a hundred better ways of executing this theme as a movie. The acting only made it more offensive to the actual victims of the tsunami.
Nothing made any sense at all in this dumpster fire. I'm pretty sure if you get knocked out under water in a bloody tsunami you most likely will die. Not this family. Of course KKW (King Kong woman) is absolutely fine with half her leg hanging off, after all, there are no nerves that could possibly be damaged, no tendons severed, no bones broken, no bleeding to death. That would just make too much sense.
I walked out of this film because of how stupid it was, I can't stand disaster films because you can guarantee the acting and characters will be bog standard and the acting will be even worse. The characters were so vacuous that I couldn't root for them, I just wanted the nightmare to end.
I couldn't even be bothered to waste anymore time remembering their names. I've seen some pretty awful films, but even Tommy Wiseau's The Room didn't make me feel this type of rage. At least you could laugh at that. There is no relief in The Impossible.

That we should treasure each other whenever we can and we should never allow anything to get in the way of that. Be thankful for the people in your life because they can be taken away at any moment. If you have someone or something to live for you need to know that that something is worth fighting for.A beautiful story that had me captivated from beginning to the end.

226,leoocampo,Impossible to Forget,9,17 September 2018,"Memorable not so much for its action or effects (though both are gripping and intense) but for its humanity. The only thing lacking is extending that humanity outward enough to encompass the full scale of the vast majority of the victims of this tragedy, who were not well-to-do caucasian tourists, but the natives of the Indian Ocean basin and nearby regions. All those floating corpses and masses of brown people packed into those poorly-funded Thai hospitals and refugee camps who might have considered themselves lucky if they had the option of calling home to someone in the first world to let them know they were OK let alone a private jet from a high paying corporate job to fly them to a first rate hospital in Singapore once they managed to get out. The film's stark empathy stands in contrast to the final scene... for all they'd been through, the disaster was something the tourists merely had to ""escape"", witch while a truly heart-wrenching, harrowing and close run gauntlet that may have been to run, was actually nevertheless quite a fortunate situation compared to those with no one to call; nowhere to escape to. Many of those people and communities have still yet to recover, I'm sure, and while neither the characters nor the film share any blame for that, it is disappointing the film missed the chance to more overtly nod their head to that fact when given the chance.",The Impossible

Someone else who reviewed this film suggested it was 'white-centric' and you could be forgiven for thinking this. Of course if it had been made by thais about thais the audience would be non existent outside asia. As it is they changed the nationality of the original family from Spanish to English probably for the same reason; but we should expect this and go with it.No, the real problem is I just didn't care about the family, especially the way over the top hysterics of Ewan McGregor. The thing that pulled this movie up from 1 to 3 for me was the children, especially 'Luke'. In a glib by the book TV movie format they were surprisingly natural and Luke was the only actor who showed any real talent and grew with the story.Overall this was a poor trivialisation of an horrific tragedy.",The Impossible
228,malaysian1789,Emotional and Epic,7,6 January 2013,"With it being a New Year, I thought I'd go and see a comedy to kick off the 2013 film season. Unfortunately there wasn't any comedies showing at my Cinema so I ended up seeing this film about the 2004 South-East Asian Tsunami which killed over 250,000 people and displaced millions. Not what I had in mind as a cheery film, but oh well....So basically we have a family that include married couple Henry and Maria Bennett (played Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts), a classic middle- class couple, as suggested by the fact they spend most their time on the plane travelling to Thailand worrying if they set the alarm to their house back in Japan, and also their three sons all string sentences together without saying ''Bruv'' or ''Innit'', so they must be Middle- Class. Anyway the family arrive at their resort in Thailand, and all is going pleasantly when.....yes arriving in spectacular fashion, almost like the rise of Godzilla, the Tsunami arrives and decimates everything in site. The family is split in the wreckage of it all and the film then deals with them all trying ti locate each other, if they all managed to survive that is....The film was actually very good, a simple search story made gargantuan by the amazing effects used to portray the actual Tsunami, it literally comes at such a speed and power that leaves you in bewilderment and gives you a better idea that news reports of what it was all like at the time. They also have the classic ''Titanic'' Hollywood orchestra as the soundtrack whilst this is happening just to add to the emotional intensity, alongside top notch acting from McGregor, Watts and Tom Holland as 12 year old son Lucas. The main complaint, and flaw of the film, however lies in the fact we hardly see any actual Asian people, in a film about an Asian tragedy. The main Asians in the film are tribesmen and doctors who seem unable to apply composure or logic to any of the hectic situations occurring, we don't see any Asian characters searching frantically for loved ones or showing pain at losing those they love, unlike our Western Heroes here.So overall, aside from the debatable premise of casting for the film, which you'd expect from Hollywood, it remains a good, epic, emotional film if you watch it for what it is. 7/10",The Impossible

The story in itself is very well developed but that comes naturally for movies based on true events. The way it is told makes the entire experience even more mesmerizing. The entire cast is exceptional and the debut of Tom Holland is one to remember. There are some scenes, which go a bit too far with regards to how graphic they are and even I felt disgusted, but they do make the movie even more difficult to forget.

The wise and deep sayings that must incite you to take this very serious, as also with Ewan (the father) suddenly and grippingly bursting into tears... o how profound! Give me a break, will you. The real event itself was serious, not this monstrous production that clearly was meant as a tearjerker smoothly exploiting grave incidents. Why on earth was it rated that high? Are Americans so melodramatic, or is it political correctness that makes people believe that you ought to value and esteem any film about such a dramatic topic? Could you earnestly compare this to such quality movies like Collateral, the Godfather part 3, Munich, Dracula (Bela Lugosi, 1931), Love actually, Rabbit-proof fence, A room with a view, Never let me go, Steel magnolias, and many other films that were rated somewhat about the same level or even lower, but that are of a whole different (e.g. far better) quality?",The Impossible

We already are living the drama alongside with this family; more than a nightmare it's a radical change in their personal life and in History too. I personally think that the music (a great score by the way) is just too much, and the casting is not really fair with this Spanish family... But maybe are they trying to put this story at some universal point of view? Kind of an ""evry one"" story and not only their?We didn't forget the 26th/12/2004, so why push it that way?

We have all heard about it but the movie reinforces the fact that Mother Nature's wrath is something no man or man-made property can withstand. What we tend to take for granted in our everyday lives can be taken away from us in a whisk of a second.Excellent direction by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat in a heart wrenching story, which is told in a seemingly simple way without any frills or complications of commercial cinema. The Tsunami scenes are well shot but not over the top, keeping the focus on the various emotions of the characters. Through the characters we experience, love, joy, fear, pessimism, optimism, sadness and humanity.Naomi Watts delivers an impactful and hard hitting performance as the mother of the kids. Her emotive eyes take you on a emotional roller- coaster. The surprise package and for me the star of the movie is young actor Tom Holland who plays the role of the eldest son and stays by the side of his mother through dangerous and emotional times. A scene in the movie when his mother's top comes off and she is oblivious of it speaks volumes of this actor's acting prowess without speaking a word. Ewan McGregor as the father is very expressive and believable. The character get's under your skin and makes you ponder what would you as father do when totally helpless against a force much stronger than anything.Without divulging the plot much, I highly recommend this movie. This is one of those movies which will keep you riveted throughout the screening and make you feel what the characters feel.At the end of it you do believe that belief does make the impossible, possible.",The Impossible

This story was well told and even riveting at times. It is easy to watch footage of a natural disaster on TV and not be affected by it. This movie really hit home hard and gives you a deeper understanding of the suffering and struggle that is involved in the aftermath of such an event.

I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event.

Watts, McGregor and the children (especially Holland and the little one Pendergast) have vividly portrayed the sufferings encountered as a family caught in a Tsunami while on vacation in Thailand. The acting is exemplary, award-worthy ones. The children portrayed the agony and the pain that one might go through when they're separated from their parents and not knowing what has happened to them. The movie gives us a glimpse of what would have been the state of mind of thousands of families that lost their loves ones forever.From the Direction perspective, Juan Antonio Bayona has picked up a story that has been well told on screen. Cinematography has excellent as well. The shots involving the slow-motion effects of watts towards the end of the movie deserve special mention. Editing is great. The story and the screenplay keeps us hooked to the movie.I sense that the movie was primarily shot in Spain and was first released in Spain and then later for the world-wide audience. But still, good movies reach audience somehow through word-of-mouth. I felt that this movie should have had a mainstream release in Hollywood to have had a wide ranging reach and effect.One of the best movies that I have ever come across with.

So many PC and petty people (giving 1-2 star reviews) that take a political stance about how no tsunami warnings were given to the poorer countries that suffered the most, or that a WHITE family instead of the dark-skinned Spanish were portrayed. Who cares! The movie ultimately was made for an American and English speaking audience and with it costing almost 50M to make, why not take some artistic license to make sure it is an ATTRACTIVE movie for most audiences! I get it. The movie, even with it's flaws, still works! Watts gives an amazing performance and how she hasn't won an Oscar yet is beyond me! She is astounding in her dramatic range. Ewon is good not great, and the older son Lucas also does a great job being a kid forced to grow up real fast. The movie focused mainly on this one family although a couple of other victims, a female in the bed next to Naomi and a man who lost his family at the beach and loans Ewon his cell phone are brief but good scenes. Yea, all white Euro-Americans but like I said, the movie is for middle-America so you have to dolly things up for the masses to fork over 15 dollars a ticket!I still give it 9 stars for the ultra-realistic tsunami scenes that look so real you think it's actual news footage but it is all original and Naomi Watts performance that despite it being a pretty simple story-line of tragedy and anguish, still rings with high emotion.

243,rachelandfilms,Unflinching and inspiring tale...,8,29 May 2013,"The Impossible is a film which will invariably cause conflict and backlash among critics and perhaps even victims of the event upon which this film is based. It is virtually impossible to avoid criticism when you are making a film which dramatizes a tragic disaster in human history – that event being the 2004 tsunami which struck Thailand on Boxing Day and claimed the lives of over 200,000 people.In this film we follow the lives of the Bennett family, a perfectly normal family who were unprepared for the tragedy of the event and its repercussions. This is one stumbling block the film has faced in its critique, with many questioning the narrative approach. Why follow one family (who are English and don't have to live with the long-term repercussions that a local Thai family would have to deal with) when you can look at many with a wider range of perspectives? This is a valid question, however I have to disagree with those who take this stance. I believe that by concentrating on one family we are forced to empathize with the emotional difficulties that they face. The unflinching depth to which the audience is shown this one family's struggle is where the backbone of this film lies and heightens its sense of claustrophobia making the film much more realistic and emotionally resonant.If you would like to continue reading my thoughts on this film then go here...

244,jdneukom,Maybe Impossible but not Really Enjoyable,4,16 February 2013,"Naomi Watts was phenomenal as Maria and skillfully played a severely wounded part for almost the entire movie (either struggling to move or from a hospital bed). I can honestly say that her performance is the best acting from an actress I saw in 2012.The make-up, depicting all manner of gruesome injuries and the set design, trying to re-create the rubbish from the tsunami, was superb and very effective.I also like that although the movie was based on a Caucasian family (who lived in Japan but was vacationing in Thailand for Christmas), the indigenous Thai people are portrayed as caring and sympathetic in this movie. The reason this really stood out to me, because I watched ARGO recently and was stunned at how one-dimensional, stereotypical, and negatively the Iranian people were portrayed. Here, in THE IMPOSSIBLE, the Thai are rendered much more humane and are critical for the protagonist family in their attempt to reunite.However, the reason for the low star-rating is mostly due to how the movie drags on after the first 20-30 minutes. Perhaps that was intended to get more and more shots of carnage and to impart a sense of hopelessness (this movie did make me feel hopeless once or twice, but not in the way the director probably wanted!). Really, the whole quest seemed ""impossible"" though it was based on a true story. Again, not really the ""impossible"" that the director was probably going for, but rather impossible to care about and implausible.Another major issue I had was that we leave Ewan McGregor's Henry until nearly an hour of the film has elapsed. The problem is that I felt Ewan seemed to try to overact his scenes to get the most out of it, probably because he was left out of so many scenes. I normally enjoy McGregor's performances but I thought he came off as amateurish and lame in this role.I won't be critical of the children in the film, because that would be just mean. But, they did alright, and Tom Holland, the boy who played Lucas, had a large role and seems to have quite a future in the acting business.TL;DR: Overall this was a movie that dragged on and failed to inject the viewer with the emotion that it needed to. It's sad because a film of this nature should make it easy to portray those tearjerking sentiments. Obviously, I understood the devastation and tragedy, having made a donation at the time this happened, but this movie failed to make me emote as some other tragic movies have. THE IMPOSSIBLE is watchable simply for Naomi Watts' performance and the opening 30 minutes. The rest is not worth watching.",The Impossible
245,wolfcub7,Hatred can be blinding.,10,7 February 2019,"Whilst it is possible I overlooked some issues because of what an emotional powerhouse this movie was, I do think some of the one star reviews writers' rage blinded them to the point where they did not even take in the numerous fantastic moments and aspects this movie has to offer.Most of all I'd like to point out that, unlike some haters claim, this movie definitely is not just a family screaming each others' names. There are countless beautifully written, shot and acted moments of humanity in a devistating situation that you shouldn't miss out on. Some of my personal favourites being when the just reunited mother and son debate whether they should climb a tree before a possible third wave kills them or to go try locate the screaming young child they hear. And later when they all sit up in the tree that little 3-year old boy reaching out to touch the mother in what I interpretted as his need to feel a mother's touch, even if she's not his, as well as to comfort the woman, in the lonely, scary and traumatizing situation.And personally, I don't understand where here people see wooden acting. It's all very fine and I was actually really impressed with the child acting. The threr pre-pubescent actors of Daniel, Thomas and Simon do a great job, they're rare among their peers. Tom Holland, tooThere's no cgi here, it's all models and tons of real water and practical effects which in combination with the acting and the way evefything was shot and edited truly makes you feel like you're there with them.Yes, it's awkward that they kind of ""white-washed"" this story. But to me it seems like they did it mainly to enable the movie to be in english language and to cast huge stars. In order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible for max profits, but perhaps also because a story like this needs to get a wide audience. When you're safe and sound in your little corner of the world it's easy to forget these disasters and impossible to really understand what the victims go through when you only read news articles. After this movie you're not likely to forget.There's no need to get offended for the real life family, as they were deeply involved in the screenwriting and talking with the actors, and have said they're proud of this movie, and do not care about skin colour. As for all the people who suffered worse than this family...Sure their stories deserve to be told in a movie format. Someday they might be if they want to share in the first place. But why should this story be any less worthy of tellng and watching just because they were wealthy and lucky? They are just as much human and went through much of the same pain and trauma as anyone else. This is a story about and for human beings, not about or for any specific race or class status.Frankly, I didn't even really notice how priviliged they were. Because it was not at all important to me. All I saw was a loving family violently and suddenly torn apart without any warning and then desperately trying to reunite, and having lost family members myself I didn't care how they travelled back home as long as they did.This movie is so intense and authentic feeling that any worse story told in this particular film might have been too much to sit through. Worse ones need a lighter/different approach. And one more time: Why should this family's story be any less worth telling? It is also casting light on essential parts of any other that did not end so soon or well.This movie is very realistic, immensely powerful, has fantastic visual and sound effects, beautiful moments and great actors. I see no reason to not watch this. But do sit down with a pack of tissues and don't show this to young children. This is deeply upsetting and disturbing even for most mature audiences.

247,MediaboyMusings,An average movie with one great ten minute sequence,6,6 October 2012,"The term ""disaster movie"" tends to conjure up images of campy and disposable entertainment involving killer asteroids and doomed ship voyages, so attaching it to a film like The Impossible feels wrong, considering the terrible true-life circumstances on which it's based. Those circumstances involve the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed an estimated 280,000 people in 14 different countries. Specifically, the film tells the story of the Belon family, British tourists who were separated from each other when the tsunami hit their beachside resort in Thailand on December 26th.The bulk of the film features the parallel stories of Henry (played by Ewan McGregor) and his two sons struggling to reunite with his doctor wife, Maria (played by Naomi Watts), and the couple's oldest son, Lucas (played by impressive newcomer Tom Holland). The Impossible's focal point is obviously the tsunami event and the sequence is quite impressively executed by Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona. Mostly eschewing special effects and relying on recreating the spectacle in the second largest water tank in the world, the ten minute sequence is gripping and immersive, realistically conveying the magnitude, violence, and unpredictability of mother nature. The aftermath of the big disaster (meaning the vast majority of the movie) inevitably feels somewhat anti-climatic, as the family makes the slow, arduous journey back to one another. Bayona briefly livens things up during one of these scenes with a gruesome close-up shot of a thigh wound suffered by Maria that elicited collective gasps and squirms from the theatre audience. That shot apparently caused a couple of moviegoers at The Impossible's TIFF world premiere screening the day before to actually pass out. In either the same scene or one shortly before or shortly after it, the director also made what I thought was an odd decision in showing one of Maria's breasts being exposed to her son because one of the straps on her top had broken off. Considering the hell the tsunami had just put them through, the scenario was completely plausible and the real-life Maria was on set for most of the lengthy seven month shoot (ironically, bad weather slowed down production), so I can't even entertain the notion that the shot was exploitative. Even still, it just seemed like a very strange creative choice on Bayona's part.Watts and McGregor give sound performances in roles I'd classify as unremarkable, especially McGregor's. Watts has a lot more heavy lifting to do, particularly during the numerous scenes where she's bedridden. Some early reviews of The Impossible wildly speculated on Oscar nominations for their performances, which would devalue that whole spectacle even more in my eyes than it already is. Holland gets more screen time than either star and acquits himself very well. The Impossible's frequent reliance on the youngster's point of view, coupled with the spectacle of the tsunami, also lends the film an unmistakable Spielbergian quality (you can also find it in the occasionally overly manipulative musical score).I found myself intermittently more emotionally invested with the characters than I would have expected, but The Impossible ends up feeling like little more than average entertainment with one dynamic ten minute segment.( More of my reviews at Mediaboymusings.blogspot.ca )",The Impossible
248,Ginsengjin,Supposedly a representation of a tragic story of the tsunami in southeast asia,2,9 May 2013,"I decided to write a short review on 'The impossible' because I completely disagree with the average IMDb consensus on this film. The thing about disaster movies, especially if it's based on tragic real-life events, is that the director needs take discretion in the presentation of violence and gore. However this film hits you with gratuitous amount of gore and nipple showing that I think it takes away from the situation.Some will argue that the reason they did that was to show how dangerous a tsunami can be, but a tsunami causes thousands of deaths, and they just focused on the mother and the son getting bumped and receiving flesh wounds in the beginning that bordered on snuff film levels. The entire time, I was wondering how this movie was able to pull off a PG-13 rating instead of thinking about how much victims of the tragedy suffered. The mother was also detached through the entire scene, not in the acute traumatic way, but due to bad acting that made the mother seem like GI-Jane through the entire process of getting bumped and wounded.When you watch a disaster movie, you have to wonder what the director's motive is. Whether the director made a film for the sake of making a film, or if they're trying to accurately portray an event. The fact that they choose to tell the story of a Caucasian family of an event that killed thousands of people in southeast Asia is telling enough.",The Impossible

Based on the true story of one of many families affected by one the biggest tsunamis to hit Asia in 2004. The consequences of the tsunami, and also the undying hope in a rapidly closing dark hole that they are all still alive.Bayona really shined in this film. He knows how to direct actors, set up shots and craft a fine film. However, he was unable to salvage realism in the sappy, melodramatic scenes and more importantly the last 20 minutes. But then again, it's hard to find any director who could make those scenes any less than what they were, which is those exactly.The dialog was gripping, there were a few unexpected developments in the screenplay, which poised a great deal of excitement. It grips you and never lets you go. I would say captivating, but that would be an understatement. Go see this film, it attained the perfect balance between being too exploitive and too childish. Not the best film of the year, due to a few scenes and maybe a bit on the children's acting side, but besides that, it is a great film.",The Impossible
251,akp0583,Starting 2013 with an amazing movie...,8,4 January 2013,"The Impossible (2013)Starring: Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee PendergastSynopsis: Based on the true life story of a family caught in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated and engulfed the area they were staying in Thailand on 26th December 2004. Review: JA Bayona (The Orphanage 2007) brings a harrowing account of the 2004 tsunami from the point of view of one family as they fight to survive. The movie opens only days before the catastrophe, seeing a holidaying family relax in a tropical paradise as they celebrate Christmas together and then on 26th December 2004 saw one of history's most destructive and deadliest tsunamis. Bayona uses the sound and effects most convincingly during the tsunami and its aftermath, as the scene was playing out on the screen I was literally froze solid, using practical effects and little CGI through the duration makes it feel incredibly real and scary. Bayona masterfully uses a lot of the camera framing shots that normally are used in horror movies lending us the belief that the ocean is a killer waiting to strike.Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor play husband and wife, Maria and Henry holidaying with their three sons. After the tsunami as struck Maria finds her oldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland) showing that even after the waves have calmed surviving a disaster as actually only started to begin. Later we see what happened to Henry and the younger brothers Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). The acting on display throughout the movie is not only believable but fantastic, this is a movie that will be nominated for many awards and I believe should win at least best actor/actress and new-comers awards for the family members. The actual event and story belongs to a Mexican family who were on holiday in Thailand, I'm not sure why the movie choose to use British stars but believe this is the only change however a major one. The film is certificated at 12A (can take younger than 12 if accompanied by an adult) but I would be very careful and choose who you do take as the film pulls no punches, submersing the audience in with the family without having to force graphic death scenes on you. An emotional film with a lot of lows but a major high points, one character in particular makes you laugh during one of the films lowest points. It also a movie that doesn't go out of its way forcing views on us, from the all other characters portrayed well from hospital staff to villagers and other survivors, with exception to one English holiday maker. Watch this if you liked: There aren't many true life movies that bring you this much emotion and deals with an event of this magnitude, or at least one I have seen. To anyone who watched and liked fictional work such as 'Day after Tomorrow' and '2012' you should watch this movie.Verdict: A surprising realistic movie that will take you on an emotional ride, always believe and never give up.",The Impossible
252,gthombos,Mawkish Maudlin Movie,4,27 January 2017,"mawkish adj. 1. Excessively and objectionably sentimental. 2. Sickening or insipid in taste.To describe The Impossible as mawkish is like calling Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas ""not nice"". The Impossible is one family's story of survival in the aftermath of the tsunami that struck Thailand on Boxing Day in 2004. The special effects used to recreate the tsunami are very impressive. I was saying ""Wow"" at that point of the movie. As the film progressed, I found myself saying ""Wow"" in a different manner; while rolling my eyes in disbelief at the acting and dialog. Based on that, a better title for this flick would have been The Implausible. The screenplay is by Sergio G. Sánchez from María Belón's story. Belón is the woman portrayed in the film by Naomi Watts. Since the writers were Spanish, we can only hope that something was lost in translation since I hardly believed any of the characters' words.Watts does a decent job in the lead role, and it's a credit to her that she succeeds even to that extent, considering the direction and writing. Other actors don't fare as well. Tom Holland, who plays her son Lucas, shows some promise as an actor, but here he mostly comes off as an overly sentimental caricature. The other main character is the father portrayed by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's ""acting"" consists mainly of looking anguished in blood-smear makeup while screaming out the names of his family members.Director Juan Antonio Bayona has decided that the best way to convey the hardship and emotions experienced by the poor souls who suffered through this ordeal is to show closeups of their faces to the accompaniment of some Williamsesque music done to the nth degree. I could just imagine John Williams (a.k.a. The Big Schmaltzy) sitting in a theater where this was playing, wincing and saying, ""Eww, too much music.""I have to say that I felt a little uncomfortable while watching this movie. Here was a real and devastating tragedy, and I was feeling as much emotion as I do when I watch my computer run a virus scan. Those who suffered through this catastrophe deserve to have their stories told with dignity and gravitas. At the very least they deserve more than this uninspired and maudlin celluloid effort.",The Impossible

But this movie is most definitely worth watching! Be forewarned that at times it is quite difficult, emotionally. At parts I flinched (watching them in the water being hit by anything and everything), and there were several scenes that drew tears, (both tears of heartbreak and pain and tears of joy for the positive moments). The movie did a really great job portraying the emotions that people felt on that tragic day. The dark and emotional nature of the subject made me glad that the family that it focused on had a happy ending otherwise it would have been even more challenging to watch. I do understand that many many people were killed and did not have happy endings and that is tragic, but for a movie like this I do feel that it was a good way to end it.

I can't remember when it was I started checking my phone for messages and emails. I think it was when we'd finished telling mum's story and then started telling dad's. You could have easily put in a commercial break and I wouldn't have noticed. Having said that, the doubt started creeping in when Coke got its product placement in with a mini sub plot all of its own.

261,amberm18,A tear-jerking tale but I would have preferred to see more.,7,25 February 2013,"First off, I would like to say that Ewan Mcgregor, Naomi Watts and the child actors in particular, were fantastic in this movie. The original Spanish mother chose Naomi Watts to play her in her tale, so this explains how a darker Spanish family becomes blonde and blue-eyed in this retelling. What it does not explain is the focus on only this family and white people in the background. I feel like the media is constantly pandering to us by assuming that we can only feel emotion for people of our own race, or from our own country.I live in Ireland, and when 9/11 happened, the newspapers here went with headlines about how 11 Irish people had died in the tragedy. It was a horrific event that killed thousands, and I felt for every one of them, regardless of nationality or race. I dislike Hollywood's ""dumbing down"" of cinema for it's viewers, remaking fantastic foreign films like The Girl with the dragon tattoo for American viewers.They assume that Americans and perhaps all English speaking Caucasians cannot feel for other races, connect with their story, or be bothered reading subtitles. Perhaps this is true of a small minority, but by continuing to pander like this, it breeds even more people to close off their minds. I enjoy the story of the human struggle in any language portrayed by any race, I'm perfectly capable of crying when a non-Caucasian experiences pain, and I would be willing to guess that most people would be the same as myself. Hollywood gives it's viewers no credit and treats them like dummies.As I stated before, the original mother of this story picked Naomi Watts herself to play her in this movie. They all do a fantastic job of portraying one families struggle to find one another and to survive. However I would have preferred maybe a dual story, one following these unfortunate holiday makers, and one following a native. I think this would have given a much well rounded story of the event as it happened, and impress a greater impact on the audience.It was quite unsettling that few natives were even involved in the story at all. You see them as the white family drive past to the hospital, and as they are going towards the plane at the end. They are crying and huddling around lost pictures of their loved ones. I found it hard to fully commit to being relieved for the one family that escaped when they are walking past so many that are suffering, who's stories are not over.",The Impossible
262,martin-kooistra,"Impressive recreation, but limp characterisation",7,14 February 2013,"An American husband (Ewan McGregor) and wife (Naomi Watts) and their three children, looking for some R&R in a beach resort in Thailand, are in the wrong place at the time, as a tsunami literally hits them. After this opening sequence, which at times relies too much on obvious CGI- effects, the story trails Maria (Watts), who is badly injured, and her eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland), who together try to find a safe haven and any trace of their family. Although Watts and Holland acquit themselves pretty well, Holland's character is marred by dialogue which suggests this child has the wisdom of someone who's seen it all. It takes away a lot of the credibility of this story, as do a couple of coincidental, melodramatic twists, which may or may not be true, but if truth is stranger than fiction, go for fiction! It would also been easier to care for this family, if they hadn't been a bunch of rich, spoilt Americans. McGregor is not given a lot to do, but Joslin and Pendergast are perfectly cast as the little brothers, and there's a wonderful, authoritative cameo by Geraldine Chaplin, in one of the most poetic scenes in the film. All in all a mixed bag, which depends on your willingness to buy into the characters.",The Impossible

I can't and won't forget this film. This film is well written and has a fantastic cast, Naomi Watts and Tom Holland especially, their performances alone blew my mind, it's just unbelievable how great they were and the chemistry between both of them is unquestionable. This time I gotta agree with the critics, they praised Watts, Holland, and McGregor's performances, which I agree and I'm sure all of us who have watched the film agree too.If this film was released earlier, then it wouldn't be so overlooked, I'm still upset how this film only earned 1 nomination at the Oscars, I mean, at least the Academy should nominate them for technical achievement or even Tom Holland's performance. Naomi Watts' performance is just wow..wow and wow. Personally, she should have won the prestigious Oscar that year but I think It's okay that she didn't win, I hope she's gonna have some left over votes for her performance as Princess Diana in her upcoming film 'Diana'.I'm glad this film was commercial success and how many people loved it.

265,Blooner,"Although certainly not perfect, it's a movie worth watching.",7,24 January 2013,"Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com - Last night I went to the advanced screening of The Impossible starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.First of all, if you're planning to go see this movie and haven't seen the trailer, be sure not to see it. I think it's a perfect example of a trailer that reveals too much of the movie. There is even a part that has to come as a surprise, but when you've seen the trailer (or even some of the movie posters) it isn't, and you were just waiting for it.The movie is about a happy family who spent their Christmas Holiday at the shores of Thailand in 2004. Indeed, the year the tsunami hit The movie starts with an eerie sound, a sound that sets the feeling for this movie perfectly. The first fifteen minutes the movie is building up to what we all know will happen, the tsunami. The moment where this happens is a great scene. The filmmakers did this very well, by using one powerful thing: Sound. By not using a song or sad melody but just using the sound of the powerful, powerful water it is as if you are there! We all know how everything sounds when your head is under water, multiply it by 100, add some debris, a lot of panic and a rush of water and it feels immense. The sheer noise of roaring water. If you are going to see this movie, be sure to have an adequate sound system.After the severity of the tsunami itself subsides, begins the silence, the loneliness, the search. I think they showed this very well and you feel the brutal reality of it.About an hour into the movie things start to go downhill. At some point I got annoyed by the plot becoming too forced and the cheesy American-movie-things happen. The near-misses, the doubtful choices of the characters and the illogical things. They (try to) make the movie more dramatic than it needs to be. This is unnecessary because the whole tsunami-thing and aftermath IS dramatic enough. Sure, maybe only because it happened for real, but if it didn't happen for real there probably wasn't a movie like this.The main characters are the family, where especially the kids are great in the movie. Aside from the fact that they are cute they're also good actors and it's the children who manage getting you watery eyed now and then.Funny detail; at a given moment there are people of different nationalities who say something. Among them there is a Dutch woman, and surprisingly (contrary to what often happens) I could understand what she said in Dutch. I think it's great that they cast a Dutch person even for one sentence in the movie. I don't know how it is with the other nationalities (my Swedish isn't great ;-) ), but it was a welcome surprise.It wasn't a great movie, but there are plenty of moments the theatre was dead silent and no one dared to make any noise, not a single bag of crisps was crackling and even breathing stopped for a moment. Especially in the first hour you are drawn into the movie and the fact it is (based on) a real story adds to its power. The second half of the movie wasn't the greatest, but nonetheless I think it's a movie worth watching. - Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com",The Impossible
266,cameronmorewood,The Impossible,9,12 January 2013,"In 2007, Spanish no-namer Juan Antonio Bayona released his debut film, ""El Orfanato,"" or as we English speaking folk say, ""The Orphanage."" I saw that film based on glowing recommendations from a few people I follow on Twitter, who's opinions regarding movies tend to be similar to mine. Despite those recommendations, I didn't have huge expectations going in. A horror flick from an unknown director; how good could it be? I was blown away, and instantly made a note to remember this talented director whose artistic vision proved to be entrancing and hypnotic. Five years later, he's returned with ""The Impossible."" You probably remember the awful disaster that took place in southeast Asia in 2004. It was all over the news, and the estimated death toll capped 230 thousand. ""The Impossible"" tells the true story of a family that survived the disaster, and despite the PG-13 rating, the images shown on screen are gruesomely realistic. Calling ""The Impossible"" the best disaster movie ever made doesn't even do it justice, because it's something more. It's a heartwrenching, captivating, and moving tale; and one of the very best films of the year. The film tells the true story of Maria and Henry Bellon, played flawlessly by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, and their three children, Lucas, Simon, and Thomas, and their awe-aspiring story of survival. Lucas is played by a young actor named Tom Holland, and his performance blew me away. Watching the film, I was perhaps SO impressed because I assumed Holland was twelve or thirteen, similar to the age of his character. He's actually sixteen, but, nevertheless, the performance remains a great one. There is; however, an even greater performance that deserves recognition. The brilliant Naomi Watts is pitch-perfect in the lead role as Maria, the family member who came closest to increasing the tsunami's death toll by one. There will be an injustice if she doesn't finally get the Best Actress Oscar she's deserved for so long. After her haunting and hypnotic showing in ""Mulholland Dr."", and her powerful performance in ""21 Grams"", she still remains Oscar-less. I'm not saying it's right to hand someone an Oscar because they are overdue. Watts deserves it. In my eyes, the only other real contender, despite great displays of acting from Jessica Chastain, Emmanuelle Riva, Mary Elisabeth-Winstead, and Marion Cotillard, is Jennifer Lawrence for her fantastic work in ""Silver Linings Playbook"". The difference between the two performances, I think, is only that Naomi's performance is more inspired. Someone lived what she acted. I'd like to see Naomi win Best Actress, and I'd like to see the real Maria Bellon up on stage to accept the award with her. Another important aspect of ""The Impossible"" to note is its stunning visual spectacle. This is a film a few years in the making that shows time was taken to create a realism in the production design and special effects that leaves a startling impact. It should definitely receive a Best Visual Effects nomination come Thursday, instead of films like ""The Avengers"" or ""Skyfall,"" because it's recreated real life, not just playing with fire and making the sky look cool. ""The Impossible"" is a film of power and a film of importance, and it should be treated as such. I urge you to flock to the theaters and see this movie. It's an experience unlike any other, and it'll take a piece out of you.",The Impossible
267,KaDaWe,The Most Shocking Movie I Have Ever Seen,9,16 August 2013,"When I first saw the trailer of ""The Impossible"" I had my doubts to be honest. How do you want to make a movie of this event which isn't offensive to some people? Nonetheless, I decided to watch it, as I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor, who plays the dad.The result after about 110 minutes was nothing but shock and sadness. I saw the TV reports in 2004, but somehow never thought that it was that extreme (ok, I was pretty young back then). When you watch Naomi Watts crawling around in dirt and full of pain, it's like you feel the pain as well. When you watch Tom Holland missing his mother and despair, you fell the desperation as well. And this is the case all the time. But that's also the thing which makes this movie so great. During the whole movie you share the drill with the characters, that they find each other again. After the movie you are, like I wrote already, just shocked and you wonder how this could happen and how many families were separated because of it.At last, I want to say that the performance of the actors and actresses is just fantastic. It looks like Tom Holland, the oldest of the three children, is the ""unofficial"" main character, but in this case it's not bad that a kid has the main role, as he plays it so awesome. The others are of course great, too.So, my conclusion: A shocking yet amazing movie. The only reason why I don't give it ten stars is because there are some very nasty scenes in it (blood, injuries, etc.), and I'm not a fan of something like that. But yeah, if you don't need action or comedy in every film, you'll like it for sure.",The Impossible

271,ng_open_air,A decently directed true story family drama,7,4 June 2013,"There isn't much to be said about the plot in this movie, because, mainly, there is none. Which is, of course, to be expected. The main event here is the devastating natural disaster which we all, sadly, still remember, especially all the countless families that were affected by it, either by losing their loved ones or participating in it themselves, which has without doubt changed their lives forever. This is a story about one such family.The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was, in fact, one of the worst natural disasters in the recorded history, killing over 230,000 people. I remember watching the TV reports, I still feel shiver just thinking about it. I guess I cannot even begin to imagine what horrors families like this went through during the fore-mentioned events. And I am quite sure no movie can ever express those horrors thoroughly enough.I think this movie was done cleverly and with much precaution. The tsunami aftermath is still a very delicate subject, and there are a lot of people that witnessed this nature's act of destruction one way or another, so the filmmakers obviously didn't want to make it too realistic and documentary, instead they tended to focus on a single family's struggle for survival, with just the right amount of drama. The TV reports that I recall of were much more horrifying than the movie, but I guess it is better without too many explicit scenes.Speaking of explicitness, there is a small detail that I can't see the relevance of - showing Naomi Watts' naked breasts in a few scenes of the movie - but I guess the filmmakers had their reasons for this.The definitely most terrifying scenes in the movie were when and right after the wave struck, which was quite a good impression of nature's devastating whims. The effects in the movie were quite satisfactory. Though I must say I expected a longer introduction before the actual strike scene, i.e. some shots of the water recession. Not that it is of much relevance anyway, I just think it would have been a nice touch.To sum it up, there are some things that could have been done differently in this movie, nevertheless, it is a good, professionally directed, natural disaster movie, with good cast and some nice special effects, plentiful of drama, all in all qualities that make it's watching worthwhile.",The Impossible
272,ciera-larose,"""The Impossible"" is based on the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand, who find themselves caught in one of the worst natural disasters on all time.",9,22 April 2013,"""The Impossible"" is based on the true story of a family on vacation in Thailand, who find themselves caught in one of the worst natural disasters on all time -the 2004 tsunami. Among tens of thousands of strangers, the members of this family are forced to fight the elements and the catastrophe to try and find each other and remain together.The cinematography of this film was wonderful. It captured the disastrous scenes perfectly, allowing us to see the devastation but also to appreciate the beauty of it all as well.This movie was wonderfully cast. Naomi Watts' portrayal of Maria, a mother in an incredible amount on pain due to her injuries, who struggles to remain strong for her son, all while trying to find safety and the rest of her family was so beautiful and perfectly performed. Ewan MacGregor also did a great job portraying his character Henry. MacGregor plays a father who is struggling to care for his two young sons while trying to find the rest of his family. Along the way, he is forced to make some very difficult decisions that prove to us how truly determined he is. Both interpretations of the parents seemed very genuine.Sam Joslin who plays Thomas, the middle son, also performed his character quite well. He managed to walk the fine line of being the innocent little brother to Lucas but the mature and strong older brother to Simon quite gracefully. Oaklee Pendergast who portrays the youngest son Simon did a wonderful job as well. He displayed great control and execution of his emotions for such a young actor.With all of that being said; I firmly believe that the best acting came from the character Lucas, as portrayed by Tom Holland. In my opinion, he was definitely the star of the film. He displayed incredible maturity and delivered a performance well beyond his few years. His emotional and facial expressions alone left you with chills at times. I honestly couldn't help but fall in love with his character but also with him as a young actor. Mr. Holland is definitely one to watch for in films to come.In conclusion, ""The Impossible"" is an absolutely beautiful film that is both heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time. It is absolutely, without a doubt, worth a watch.",The Impossible
273,me-998-978033,"Great film. Pictures the terror, the horror & hope of the Tsunami",10,19 December 2016,"In film & TV history, the ""based on a true story"" handle has been played to death, but the Impossible, did, well, the impossible.It follows the events of a family who were caught in the 2004 Tsunami, killing countless, stranded & injuring even more. Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor & Tom Holland carried the film, not just during & after the Tsunami, but before, when we're getting to know the family. You feel like your part of the family before everything flips upside down. The littlest things that most films overlook are shown & demonstrated. They weren't their perfect family, they were dealing with uncertainty about employment, oldest sibling stubbornness (I'm the eldest sibling, so I can talk from personal experience). Even with a PG rating, it doesn't shy away from the terrifying natural disaster. There's blood, bodies faced down in the water, injuries are real! I have not been this terrified & gut-wrenched for a film in a long time. But the part that was very different to larger films, there was no big lead up to the tsunami, no weather warning, no experts, no news casters saying get ready. Nothing. Just a few seconds before & they were subtle. Watts' performance as the scared, struggling to survive & protective mother, Maria, was incredible, the scenes with Holland's Lucas, I don't think there was a moment in the film where I could speak or had a dry eye. Ewan McGregor's Henry showed a terrified father & husband as he looks for his wife & eldest son. I felt & saw his desperation to reunite with his love & children. I want to forget this film so I can re-watch it with the same admiration. The eye to detail made this film have an edge to other disaster films.

I was afraid it would trigger bad memories. Actually had to jump over piles of dead bodies and debris to go to a safe place with my Mum and Dad after the second wave hit Galle, Sri Lanka were we were that day. Its the city next to were that train ironically called the Queen of the Sea got hit by the tsunami. The largest single rail disaster in world history by death toll, with probably 1,700 fatalities or more.But after few years i developed a backbone and finally watched it. I saw the tsunami in 2004 in the eyes of 11 year old child and again through this exceptional movie as an adult. I remember the very first thing that come to my mind when i heard 30 feet high wave was coming towards us was 'DAY AFTER TOMORROW', the disaster movie i saw only months before. Though not as high budgeted or green screen as that movie this movie covers the part were it shows how people act in a situation like this. Luckily i didn't see the wave as we were already at an upper floor of a shopping mall. But i definitely saw the aftermath.Lot of children and parents got separated by the wave.MY aunt and uncle were at the car park near the mall and we had no idea what happened to them. My parents had to check camps and then hospital morgues.( which could not handle all the bodies as there were too many so they had to arrange them in hallways and cafeterias and everywhere so the relatives can come and identify them) But they were okay and i remember how happy i was when i saw them alive after two days.Really saw best of humanity and how a brought everyone together. How people helped each other. I have to say the movie directors have taken some risk bringing an incident that still rather new in people's minds in to screen but they've handled it very well. Better disaster movie than 2012 in my opinion.",The Impossible

Allot of emotion has gone into this film and i know 300,000 people died in the Tsunami but this film was about Discovery, it was a film where Lucas takes responsibility for his mother. it was a story from a point of view of a a family of survivors there could of been more done but how long do your want the film to go for? we live in a world of criticisms and this film will get criticised for its portrayal that it centred on the survival of the family. But think about it during the Tsunami wave Lucas and his mother could of been easily separated, The Mother could drown or knock unconscious but the impossible was accomplished. i did few a bit awkward at the end where the Travel insurance comes along and saves the family, and leaving the less privilege to evacuate themselves from Thailand i mean all those empty seats on the plane i kinda felt that maybe.... but this how the story was told, and the father was on a good salary, but the women was near death. Great cast, Great film and Let more of the survivors come out and tell their story in Film both natives of the Thailand and abroad their PoV would be great to see how they survive more of this and less of the Reality TV shows of big Brother and The Bachelor. because you take something from this film and its hope, faith, Discovery, spirit and responsibility.",The Impossible

From start to finish it is an emotional roller coaster, telling the true story of a family desperately trying to survive and reunite after they were hit by the 2004 boxing day Tsunami. Tom Holland is the stand-out performance of this film. He is the boy that drove everybody to tears with a simple look or a sentence. Naomi Watts is fantastic (and the make up department did a great job by the way) and her Oscar nom was well deserved. Their strong and exciting story creates a thrilling first half, and although McGregor had everyone in tears during the train station scene, many were left sighing at his character's often idiotic decisions (like leaving his kids with strangers on some random mountain?) - yet this is redeemed by the great final act of the film. Lots complain about the focus on white tourists and not the natives, yet I don't think this ruins the film. People forget that the western tourists the family DO turn to for help are rude and selfish. Thai people could not be shown in a more positive light, helping those around them regardless of their race. This is an incredible film. It's one that will stay with you, and Tom Holland has a very bright future ahead! 10/10",The Impossible

280,the_grand_lebowski,"""Take Care of My Babies""",8,22 January 2013,"Few films manage to capture a story of devastation without stumbling into clichéd, sappy moments, but The Impossible—the newest film by director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage)—holds its head above water to deliver a visually beautiful and emotionally captivating feature.The Impossible recounts the true story of a Spanish (British in the film) family caught amidst the colossal devastation of the 2004 tsunami that ravaged Thailand. Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) Bennett are enjoying a holiday at a picturesque beach resort with their three young boys: Lucas (Tom Holland), Thomas (Samuel Joslin), and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast). The family's vacation is interrupted by a massive wave that separates the family, and causes massive destruction throughout the mainland.The film's main focus is Maria—embodied perfectly by Naomi Watts—and the struggle she must bear with her eldest son, Lucas. When the family is torn apart, Maria and Lucas must travel through the wreckage, seeking shelter. While the entire cast provide brilliant performances (McGregor never ceases to amaze.), it is Watts and Holland who display the pinnacle of emotional fortitude. Sergio G. Sánchez, who penned the screenplay, demonstrated his ability to craft an engaging relationship dynamic between a mother and her child in Bayona's previous film, The Orphanage, and the emotional dependence he creates between Maria and Lucas is astounding.The film is a spectacle of chaos. When the tsunami strikes the beach, the magnitude of the impact is personalized through Naomi Watts' point of view. After she is delivered from the ocean's turmoil, Bayona pulls back, revealing the shear scale of the devastation. All that is visible lies in utter ruin. The scope of this event is frightening, and Bayona does not shy away from his material. The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, and this is respectfully envisioned by Bayona. Though the storyline concentrates chiefly on the Bennetts, the audience retains a sense of the desolation visited upon this community.The Impossible is a shocking film. Bayona manages to capture some riveting images, thrusting the audience directly into the horror of a natural disaster. Through this particular family, Bayona displays the necessity of human solidarity, the power of physical and emotional pain, and the joy of deliverance. This is the first movie I watched this year where I was unable to take notes while viewing it; my attention was consistently on the screen. The film is severe in its presentation of devastation, but enthralling in its display of human resilience. Here are my other reviews: http://flickermotion.blogspot.com",The Impossible
281,dms-21,Blah Family in Disaster,2,13 February 2013,"We went to see this based on a trailer that looked great combined with excellent reviews, but were very disappointed. The worst of it was that the characters lacked depth. ""Blah Family in Disaster"" would be a better title for this movie, since that's what you get. It seems like the director made a half-hearted attempt to establish some emotional depth for the characters before the disaster struck, but couldn't figure out how so just gave up and hoped that seeing them going through a hellish experience was all the plot he needed. What came out is chaos without any real drama.Need to pad this for the line counter, so if I'll just say that if you're looking for a disaster *drama* rent Earthquake, or even Deep Impact - just about anything with a disaster theme is better than this, except perhaps Mars Attacks!",The Impossible
282,jertrav33,"Awesome Visual Effects, not such awesome acting",5,2 February 2013,"I don't think Naomi Watts, for her role in ""The Impossible,"" will win the Oscar for best actress. I don't even think she deserved the nomination for what she did in ""The Impossible."" This movie has gotten a bunch of praise from any number of critics, but other than the awesome opening when the tsunami came rushing in and killed over a quarter of a million people and caused all the destruction and devastation, there wasn't much plot. Okay, so it was based on a true story about this family that somehow survived and somehow found each other again, but still, the search wasn't enough story to hold me. Just nothing much happened. I had the feeling all through it that I was watching people acting like people in tragic circumstances, especially Lucas, the oldest son played by Tom Holland. He kept screwing his face into what he must have considered anguish, but to me it looked like he was really on the verge of cracking a smile. And Naomi Watts just didn't have much acting to do. She did a lot of groaning and sobbing but had almost no dialog. So where is the great acting? I don't know. Maybe I'm just too out of sync with modern film trends. I don't much care for vampires or werewolves or zombies or gnomes, and until they get rid of the glasses, I can skip all the 3-D gimmicks.

I felt that the ""near miss"" encounters between the father and the oldest son were contrived and predictable. Ditto with respect to the mother's sudden absence, leading her son to think she was dead while the viewer was pretty sure she wasn't. And, I wondered why, over the days the story unfolded, even when they had time and the resources to do so, no one wiped the blood of their faces. This seemed like a cheap attempt draw eyeballs with gore, but completely unrealistic.",The Impossible
284,ertank,Mediocre disaster movie,5,3 January 2013,"I was cautiously excited the moment I learned that the director of the movie, Bayona, is also the director of the lovely sad horror movie 'The Orphanage'. Still, shooting a disaster movie has a number of drawbacks -hence the caution-. 1) developing a character without resorting to clichés, such as the scared man/woman turning resilient, broken couple who rediscover each other, etc. 2) relying on too much on the technique -everyone wants to shoot a lovely disaster scene, which often shadows the movie itself- 3) finding an original way to tell the story.Since the work is based on a true story, Bayona has an excuse on narrative issues. But he doesn't have any excuses on a lot of mistakes: 1. No character development: We barely learn anything about our typical white family before the tsunami hits. Actually, it makes sense; because our family is so ordinary, so typical white; that developing a character out of them is almost impossible. Hence, he lets the tsunami roll as early as possible. 2. Inconclusive attempts: Bayona tries to create small stories, but almost all of them fails miserably. In the early stages, we catch our adolescent male protagonist looking at her mother's breast with mixed feelings. Only natural if you are adolescent, but Bayona doesn't follow the trail; he leaves it there. Why did you start it in the first place then? Also, we see the mom reading Conrad -most probably ""The Heart of Darkness""- in the plane on their way to Thailand. Nice touch to stress the white - indigenous tension, and nice referral to Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"". Nevertheless, if you imply such a tension, you have to give the audience the follow-up your promise, which Bayona fails to do so. A careful eye will observe two-three other subtexts which Bayona put forward to make his story more interesting, but none goes anywhere. I have a feeling that the stories were most probably lost on the editing table. Or worse: Bayona wants to show off, ""Look, I know Conrad! I even read a couple of works on post-colonial studies!""3. I'm not even mentioning the lack of subtleties in the movie: the indigenous dragging the mom in spite of her leg wound, and the son not preventing it, etc.Avid movie lovers know the difference between a 'character' and a 'type'. This movie doesn't have a single character; and this would have worked if Bayona tried to create a distance between the victimised typical white family and the audience. But you cannot prevent your audience to create an emotional attachment with the victims, and as a matter of fact, we can't see any traces of Bayona making an effort on that, either. For instance, there is no side-story that would have made the deeper. Instead, all the tragedy of the 'else', apart from a couple of white side-kicks who happen to have the chance to bump into our white protagonists, is reduced into general ""Oh, see how dramatic it is!"" shots. All in all, this movie is full of intellectual inconsistencies and half-spent efforts; which drags it into the league of mediocre and typical disaster movies. Makes me think that the real magic in ""the Orphanage"" was not director Bayona, but the executive producer, known by the name, Guillermo del Toro.",The Impossible

I am not sure what the director intend on this idea but that made no sense to me at all!! in some of the scenes it felt like the director was trying to distract the audience from noticing plot holes by taking them on a roller coaster ride of emotions and tears which -to be honest- was working most of time while I remained in need for further details or depth in exploring each of stories and characters portrayed here and there. that been said, I have to highlight some of the great stuff about the movie which were: Naomi Watts amazing and astonishing performance wither physical or emotional wise, the young talent Tom Holland, the soundtrack and the most amazing cinematography I have seen in a movie since along time.at the end I will not say I am disappointed with the movie as it was a bit better than what I was expecting but for sure I will be big time disappointed if Naomi was not the one who will take the Academy Award home this year",The Impossible
286,Ajarn_Cole,Riviting...Powerful...True...A must see movie...,9,2 August 2020,"I had just moved to Thailand October 1st, 2002, and was back in the US visiting family for Christmas. Upon awaking on the 26th I logged online to read emails and had received a notice there was a posting to my Yahoo Group. The post was from a friend who lived in Phuket, and he had said strangely he decided to go have breakfast in the city instead of his usual place by the ocean. A few minutes into the tuktuk ride he received a text message to return because a horrible disaster had occurred, so he had the driver turn around. As he was returning he passed the usual restaurant seeing that everything was gone...umbrellas, tables, motorcycles, most of the building, trees...all gone where just minutes before it had all been there. His life was saved by mere minutes because he chose something different that day.So when I first watched this movie all those memories flooded back, and I cried. This movie was spot-on! And Tom Holland's performance was most definitely the best part. I had forgotten he was one of the actors, and watching how perfectly he displayed emotions had me bawling repeatedly. It really was his break-out role, and I can only applaud this young man's performance as he has given us so much to enjoy in the movie industry, just like this movie.

288,CelluloidRamblings,"Realistic, bleak, but ultimately life-affirming.",7,5 January 2013,"Disaster films have an odd reputation, often merely dismissed as popcorn fodder, so it's strange to have a film billed as such but to put character and drama over spectacle. Then again, as it's based on a true story, it's probably unfair to label 'The Impossible' as such a movie because the plight of the characters is at its heart throughout the entire duration. Perhaps this film is best described as a family drama with elements of disaster, then.The Boxing Day tsunami was one of those events that put our lives into perspective, and the film achieves the same feat. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts play the parents of three children who decide to spend an exotic Christmas in Thailand. Suitcases are unpacked, presents are exchanged, but the sense of impending disaster is overwhelmingly unsettling. When the inevitable does happen, the following 15 minutes are intense, realistic and terrifying; an onslaught of terrific practical effects and incredible sound design. However, after that concentrated outburst, the drama shifts down a gear to a more intimate, personal level, which is no less frightful. That is why this film shines; it's about the smaller picture. By focusing on the survival of this one family rather than the scale of the event itself, a better, and more human, representation of the disaster is displayed. The performances from the central cast are nothing short of spectacular, especially Tom Holland, who carries the film for a hefty chunk of the running time with a gravitas that many older actors would fail to achieve. Many criticisms have been made in the press about the anglicisation of the story; in reality, the family was Spanish. To me, that seemed to be a decision to globalise this story to the maximum amount of people, a decision that was warranted in my eyes. Thus, the main issue with the film was the score to be unnecessarily overriding in certain scenes, adding an unwanted sentimentality to the film. The scenes which worked best were confrontational, uncompromising and, you guessed it, without a swelling orchestra. Nevertheless, this is a minor gripe considering that this is a film where tears are wholeheartedly justified.My Blog - Celluloid Ramblings . blogspot. co . uk",The Impossible

And here's us thinking reviews were for the benefit of the reader...ha flippin' ha.Here's what I found after seeing this movie:It was about a privileged white family - yeah, I could tell from the movie poster it wasn't going to be about our poor Asian fellow beings.The cinematography was 15% breath-taking and 85% awful. Far too much crammed into the actors face and being shaken around. Sit well back in the theatre is my advice here. When two characters are talking quietly standing by a bedside, the cinematographer doesn't need to shake the camera about to create tension. I hope this tiresome, amateurish trend ends eventually. I was moved despite myself. No one likes to be manipulated, least of all by Hollywood, but the oldest son, played by Tom Holland was quite superb and even Ewan McGregor had his moments. I nearly shed a tear with him though I'm considering denying it from now on.So what if there's a happy ending, that must be why the film has had such a long stay at the local theatre. No one wants to see a story of a family get obliterated, we had enough of that on the news back in 2004.The tsunami effects were amazing and I found myself gripping the arm rests without realizing. I would be very careful about letting any 12 year-old of mine go to see this on their own, while not gory it has LOTS of implied injuries taking place, a lot of visible wounds, and a lot of terribly frightened kids and adults being thrown and battered about in the muddy water.Despite the annoying camera-abuse I was glad I went to the cinema and saw this flick.",The Impossible

I really hope this is not entirely a true story because it's sickening to watch the selective entitlement and previlage bestowed only to certain group. While I am glad the female protoganist got help, its almost leaves you with a bad taste with overly dramatic heroism depection. The real heroes are the ones that rescued them but the focus is entirely on the heroine and her superhero son. Only saving grace is that the oldest boy did a great job with his acting ( they almost made this boy look like a super hero, over the top but that's not his fault) and Niomi Watts is a pleasure to watch, good actress. Over all a BAD movie that failed to capture the overall emotions and damage suffered by millions during this unprecedented natural disaster. Do yourself a favor and watch a documentary instead, if you are interested to learn or just see the tsunami and how it affected people.

By some miracle the Bennett family including the three sons survives the tsunami after being tossed about amid the debris with only Maria suffering a serious leg injury. After the water recedes, we see the extent of the destruction, (real footage of the devastation?). But the only bodies or injured people that we see are fellow European tourists. Not one recognizable Thai local. And so the movie goes featuring only white tourists and their various travails. The Bennett family after wandering about and split up for a couple of days finally locate each other.

I do believe that they put a great deal of effort into not only researching the facts of these kinds of disasters but then also implementing that research and making the film look totally accurate and strikingly beautiful, if that can be said of a disaster film. They finely honed their script and it payed off in bundles. The acting is absolutely perfect and the story is pitch perfect. It's captivating and sucks you in from the first frame to the last.

303,laheyray,A terrible event ... but a moving film,8,12 September 2012,"THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami's awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a ""true story,"" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family's three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami's effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn't try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.Ray Lahey",The Impossible
304,varun-sin,Remarkable story of celebrating struggles,8,17 February 2013,"The kid says, ""I am scared"", mother whispers in his ear, ""I am scared too son"". Having gone through the devastation of tsunami and having lost the family in destruction, perhaps, being scared was the only option left. Or not! The Impossible collects threads from all the lives and connects them to form strong bonds - of support, of love, of smiles in despair, of beaten yet strong enthusiasm, of innocent courage, of broken happiness, of countless tears and of human spirit. Cinema is a powerful medium. One could choose to create something that contributes in making lives beautiful or choose to create something meaningless or just ""entertaining"". Both have their places but unfortunately the latter has a more prominent presence. This movie chooses to reemphasize that every moment has many lives present in it and the beauty is in recognizing and celebrating all of them at all the times. Emotionally stirring!",The Impossible
305,mxmtsk,"Moving, brutal but made for an american audience",9,21 July 2018,"I keep it short and say: The movie is touching and even brutal at times. It's definitely worth to watch. I gotta say though that I found it odd that it resolves so much around a white tourist family. I'd like to see more locals and their fate portrayed in the movie because in reality for this family it would come down to this: They survived but ultimately they fly home to their perfectly fine house and live on while the local people lost everything. On the other hand they are not the target audience of the movie so I get it.James Cameron said about Titanic that one of them had to die and it was Jack who died. He justified this with the fact that it would not do justice to the fate of the other passengers if there was a happy end. I would have liked a similar ending for ""The Impossible"".",The Impossible

Underneath all the grime and gore, it was a true and incredible story of survival and a beautiful study of human life.

309,forgotmypassword2009,A fantastic film experience,10,16 January 2013,"The starring actors, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor performed brilliantly. However, the young talent Tom Holland, seemed to guide this film with his superb acting. For someone who is only slightly older than myself, I was in complete awe of how well he acted, with his inexperience due to his age. The two VERY young 'brother's' did brilliantly also, and I was crying when they were finally reunited with Lucas. In contrast to many people's feelings about the timing of the tsunami etc... I believe it was executed perfectly. Already, at fourteen minutes in, the action was already taking place. I've heard a lot of people wish that the family were introduced better, for longer, but I disagree. The brief, but golden introduction to the family let us see how happy they were, and so when the destruction came, it made it all the more heartbreaking; but I feel that the lack of complete immersion into their family life strengthened the idea that this utter horror was happening to so many families when the tsunami of 2004 hit, not just this family in particular. Besides, the storyline of the film built up the 'family bond' even more. As well as this, the tsunami hitting early on in the film regurgitated the idea that this was a sudden occurrence.The special fx in the film were also astounding. My adrenaline was pumping when the tsunami hit, because the crashing waves just looked so real and terrifying. The extent of the injuries and pain the family went through, Maria in particular, left me in awe. This film was completely full of the brutal honesty and facts that took place. The scene in which Maria is coughing blood left me feeling sick to the bottom of my stomach, but it just added to the experience of being a part of the tsunami aftermath. All in all, this film is a must see, and the young actor, Tom Holland is one to watch out for! Being my 15 year old self, I think I can quite happily say that's he's not half bad looking as a teenager, and I'll be expecting (*wishing*) to see more of him in the future!",The Impossible

311,irr_inventory,Great effects but not recommended,6,19 August 2013,"Excellent special effects and some good acting in this film, but I can't recommend it. My basic complaint is slow periods (seemed like an hour was spend in that hospital where so little happened) and a strangely myopic story with the core family + a parade of unidentified strangers briefly encountered. I would have appreciated something more real, better geographic sense (how far is Phuket/airport, how far is the nearest town, what is adjacent to the hotel?) and some verbal relationship with the people around the family (at the pool, in the hotel, on the shuttle). Some have complained here about this film being a ""typical Hollywood story"" and I can only say, ""I wish!"" I would have loved to have some other people, say another family with children, introduced at the resort and carried through the story.There were flaws in the story and periods where you shake your head and say, ""That could never happen."" An example was when the father abandons his 5 and 8 year old sons, on a truck, in a foreign country, after a natural disaster, in the dark-- NEVER would happen, not ever. So I looked online for the real story and it said that Alvarez left his 2 youngest children with someone at the resort. And there are other periods of poor direction where the viewer is needlessly confused. A last comment, the Thai nurse was just awful at acting, how did her work ever make the screen? A replay of Maria going through the tsunami toward the end of the film was not appreciated.",The Impossible

314,rozeminho,"Emotional, heartbreaking and terrifyingly real.",8,28 October 2013,"Based on a true story, The Impossible is an adaptation of what a family of five had to endure during one of the most devastating natural disasters to occur in our time. Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons take a trip to Thailand for the festive holidays. Following Christmas day the family spend time at the hotel swimming pool not expecting what's to come. Once the tsunami hits they are split in half not knowing if they have all survived. Only hope and the will to live is what pushes them to believe that somehow they will find each other.I will say straight away that this film doesn't fail to pack a punch emotionally. It's intentionally powerful and so it should be for such an amazing story. it's nothing short of a miracle what the family had accomplished after such a catastrophic event and it's a story that needs to be told. There are a lot of encouraging and powerful themes explored in this film which can drive anyone to inspiration. It shows how heroes can come in any shape and sizes and all it can take is a simple touch to say everything is going to be fine to heighten someone's spirits.This film for me holds two of the most powerful scenes of 2012. The opening scenes where the tsunami hits the hotel is both terrifying and realistic that your heart can't stop pounding. I felt emotions stronger than any other film that I've watched before, there was a genuine fear and realisation about how vulnerable and alone you are in such a disaster. Recreating that event to the level of realism they had is pretty amazing, and it's hard not to appreciate that scene. The second scene was with Ewan McGregor where he calls his father-in-law to tell him their situation. I've not seen a moment in a film as intense as that this year, the amount of emotion he puts into it is infectious and if you don't feel just a little emotional then you are obviously too manly for this film.Performances from everyone needed to be intense and inevitably they were with such an awesome cast. I've missed seeing Ewan Mcgregor on the big screen, and he really proves how much of a talent he is. Props also going to the three kids, couldn't have been easy parts to play but they got through it convincingly. Lastly Naomi Watts easily steals the show with such a devastating performance, capturing probably every emotion you could get in such a situation, and at the age of 44 it's amazing how young she looks.The only negative I could find with this film is that it didn't seem to explore the people who weren't so fortunate to find their families, there was a lack of tribute to the unlucky individuals. I can easily see where people could get easily offended, especially if they were victims of the tsunami or a similar disaster. Admittedly it could have really done with it towards the end because it became quite evident that they lost things to film and it ultimately played out the sentimental tone a bit too long. All in all, an amazing story told well through the media of film.",The Impossible

321,denisejatkins,Impossibly good,9,1 February 2013,"I thought the film was brilliantly made and extremely moving, it really stays with you. Tom Holland was superb as the young Lucas and the rest of the cast was also fantastic.While I understand the criticism about the focus being on a western family and keeping indigenous victims in the background, I liked the simplicity of the narrative, following this one family's story. It wouldn't have had the same impact if it had knitted together lots of story threads. It avoided the traps of other films like it, letting the action and emotion speak for themselves, without the need for uncomfortable exposition explaining the wave (I don't think the words tsunami or earthquake even get a mention) or telling us what happened to the characters later over the end credits. There was no need for names, long introductions and back story for the supporting characters – there was too much distress and chaos for anyone to dwell on those things and it would have felt unnatural. The audience doesn't need to have it spelt out that the devastation was far-reaching and that this family's story was exceptional – it's all there on screen.I think it's been terribly overlooked in the awards, for both technical and acting categories. It should surely be up there for sound and effects, and the hair and make-up category shouldn't be limited to period dramas! Tom Holland should certainly have been nominated for the Bafta Rising Star.It was tough to watch but contained enough moments of hope, human kindness, and happy reunion to make it enjoyable too. Definitely a film to see on the big screen.",The Impossible
322,andres-rosenberg,Most emotional movie I've seen in years,9,27 October 2012,"It is difficult to begin writing this review when you've left the cinema only hours ago feeling absolutely overwhelmed. My throat still tightens while I think of some scenes from the movie. I'm not going to explain the plot cause we all know what happened in Thai and Sri Lanka in 2004. And this is a true story of the survival of a Spanish family on vacations. The movie engages the audience from the get go, before the wave hit the hotel. The cinematography is exquisite; it has everything a hard and sad movie should have and none of the natural disasters's movies clichés. But when the water hits and the family gets torn apart the volume rises while we witness the pain and struggle of Maria, mother of 3, to stay alive and protect her family.I have to admit that I was not ready for some scenes that came afterwords. The director shows everything, most notable Maria's injuries. One asks themselves of this is truly necessary, and I believe it is. While newspapers in Spain talked about many people leaving the theater at this point (it didn't happened at my showing in Barcelona), I personally felt agony more than feeling sick from the images. You need to see it in order to feel it, and to remind yourself that this is as true as it can gets, and that this same thing could have happened to you and your family while on vacations. It just doesn't get more human than this movie.Probably since Kate Winslet, I've never felt an actress deserving an Oscar nomination and win, but Naomi Watt's performance is nothing less than brilliant. This type of emotion, this type of connection both with the other characters and the audience is what acting is really all about. She's deserving of every season award there is. And I have a feeling that she doesn't even care about it. I felt her commitment to the family and to nothing else. Just bravo. The young children, specially Lucas the oldest of the three, and the husband portrayed by Ewan McGregor are also great, but as another review stated above, the second part of the story that follows the husband's trip to find her missing child and wife was not as emotional or graphic as Maria's journey on the first part. There's absolutely no one to blame for this, it is just that Maria was the one who got injured the most, and as I stated, Watt's performance was on a league on its own. And for that reason alone I gave the movie a 9. We need these type of movies and these type of professionalism and art to remind us more often of how lucky most of us are of being good and healthy.

It is based on fact. It provides the experience of having one's family caught in a catastrophe with a vividness few other films have had. My qualm is with the film-makers' decision, faced with an event that killed an estimated eight thousand people in Thailand alone and devastated countless families, to take for their subject an extraordinarily fortunate family of British tourists who were violently separated and endured terrific trauma, but who managed to find each other and return home with every family member alive.The story of this family is pretty inspiring, but should Bayona have considered making a film about a Thai family that did suffer loss, as innumerable families did? Is his message that when calamity strikes us we suffer great terror and difficulty, but it will all be O.K. in the end? And why are nearly all the other people we meet in this movie also European? Why are there so few Thai people? Why does nearly every one speak English? Amid so much destruction, why do we see barely any dead people?

330,sahil-pahwa89,feel the pain,7,20 May 2013,we often hear the news about various natural calamities but very few times we actually feel the pain of the victims of those tragedies.Juan Antonio Bayona through this movie has put an endeavor to portray the difficulties and pain of the victims of such catastrophic events... and i am left speechless with his efforts..the movie could actually define the word empathy where we actually start feeling the pain of the victims... there were lot of touching moments in the movie shot in a flawless way where i could feel tears in my eyes and believe me it does not happen often... Naomi watts as usual was perfect and deserved the Oscar for her performance. Ewan McGrego justified his character with his superb acting.. but the surprise of the movie which no one would have expected was tom Holland who played a young kid lucas. he was just the carrier in the movie which kept the movie interesting all the way.. i would give 8 out of ten to this movie...,The Impossible
331,jsjeffjeff,They forgot the tsunami,2,13 January 2013,"I just don't understand how this movie got good reviews.Imagine if James Cameron had filmed The Titanic entirely as closeups of people suffering in the hallways!!! Thats how the makers of The Impossible would have done The Titanic!!!! Closeups of people suffering as the hallways filled with water, then closeups of people suffering in lifeboats. With an initial 10 second opening shot of the ship, the ocean and other passengers. I expected that this movie would be about one family's experiences set against a backdrop of unique natural tragedy that caused 400,000 deaths and left 500,00 homeless. After all, thats what made their story unique. Unfortunately the makers of this film pretty much omitted the tsunami from this movie. Also omitted, the ocean, beaches and all the people in Asia. While the actual tsunami was a natural catastrophe of epic proportions, occurring in one of the worlds most exotic, beautiful and tranquil locations, the tsunami is only seen in this film as a wave entering the swimming pool area of the hotel. After that its pretty much all closeups of Naomi Watts suffering and screaming. Except for the cuts and bruises, she could be in any puddle of water, say in a bad rain at a Florida Motel. Strangely, even though hundreds of thousands of other people were swept away, Watts is always alone, under muddy water, walking out of a swamp, sitting in a tree. She and her son are pretty much the only ones in the first half of the movie. Nor are there any buildings, cars, or anything else that might have been hit by the wave. When she reaches the hospital there are a couple of dozen extras to represent the million people injured and dead. The hospital scene could have been filmed on Saturday night at any Brooklyn Hospital except that, in the movie, the scene was too calm. After 45 minutes of this we get closeups of Ewan McGregor yelling and suffering. Thats pretty much it, yelling and suffering, with cameras on their faces, almost never a reference to the scale and circumstances of the unique and colossal tragedy thats the basis for this film. We're left with one family having a bad day somewhere with palm trees.",The Impossible

I didn't really expect anything from it, since a friend of mine decided what we'd watch, but I was pleasantly surprised by how terrifying yet realistic this movie was. Knowing the whole movie is based on a true story me and my friend actually had the feeling after we had seen it that the picture we both personally had of hurricanes etc. and the impact they bring on people their lives was quite incorrect. The movie contains quite a bit of action to keep you occupied and heart warming emotional moments to smile and weep.

333,dongquan110296,The Amazing Race,10,19 March 2014,"The Impossible itself is a remarkable story of human survival. It starts with an ordinary family, an ordinary couple, an ordinary getaway from their time- consuming life to enjoy with their children. But just right at the moment you think life could be perfect for once, the possible disaster crush and shatter that fanciful picture. The next 100 minutes of the movie demonstrate the family's journey, bringing us from agony to ecstasy. One of the fragments to create such success for the movie is definitely the acting of Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and newbie Tom Holland. It is very sophisticated to see the oxymoron between the two parents. The mentally strength is rooted in a feminine form. The mother (Watts) incredibly overcomes the physical pain with bravery, determination and survival skills. In the other hand, we see the extreme emotional side of the father (McGregor) that could make you knees go weak. Undoubtedly this movie marks the finest performance of Ewan McGregor since Moulin Rouge. The child actors are amazing, especially Tom Holland, who we can see growing up throughout the film. Surprisingly, the movie is not miserable at all, it reflects hope and family value which keep the family members going strong and fighting firm for their lives.",The Impossible

335,keenouk,An epic disaster flick - one to watch,10,7 September 2020,"One thing any disaster movie needs to get right is putting the audience with the characters on screen, going through their hardship, grief and pain. This film does that in spades.Every cut, scrape and agonising moment the characters are put through you feel all thanks to great camera and sound work. The effects used in the film further help this along with use of great underwater work, which I come to found nearly saw Watts drown due an tech malfunction and the actual destruction of the resort which I also came to find out was a miniature replica painstakingly detailed and for which they had only one go at that shot.
Exceptional performances from all involves, especially Naomi Watts and a young-looking Tom Holland in his first movie which is hard to believe given that his acting excellent.Based on a true story (with a few artistic liberties taken (the family was actually from Spain not England), you get an idea of what they went through and the meaning of the title, it was nigh impossible to find each other again after it all, but they did; impossible that the mother survived her near fatal wounds; impossible that they survived at all.Overall, an amazing, epic and immersive film which at the end of it left us tired for being tense through most of it as the characters, all separated look for each other desperately, especially feeling the fathers frantic search looking for his kids and wife.",The Impossible
336,charliejohnson-79963,The Impossible-Film Review,10,10 August 2015,"The Impossible Film ReviewHi!A Brief Summary:The General plot of this true story revolves around a white British family, whom live in Japan due the father's (Ewan McGregor)job. They are on Holiday in Thailand, at a beach front hotel, for Christmas and bear the brunt of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. The Family are separated and of course attempt to find each other and help out others along the way.I can honestly say this was a great film.It was gripping throughout. Just a continuous stream of ""what's next"" or ""what are they gonna do now"".The Acting is 100% Believable, and although all performances were good, there were a select few that were absolutely superb. Ewan McGregor performed well, while Naomi Watts also had a very good performance. Despite these two playing key roles, and acting in a properly ""raw"" and believable fashion, Tom Holland(Lucas)was absolutely astounding. He was the center point of the movie really, and even though it was such a big ask for an actor of his age, he smashed it. It was him that made the film what it was, and his character really helped the flow of the film. Seeing the Emotional roller-coaster he went through, and the way he had to quickly mature, somehow made it very relatable.Certainly not stupid or unrealistic like some have said.Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast's performance as the two, cute, innocent younger brothers was effective, and at times really added a different sort of element to the film.I agree with certain users who have said things along the lines of ""there wasn't a single Asian casualty in a film about a Asian tragedy"". That is the only thing I can fault about this film. But to be honest, unless you're a particularly observant person like me, it's hard to notice it in the midst of what's going on!It was well scripted, and it wasn't over the top. This has shown Hollywood how to make a decent true story film. It wasn't ALL action, and it didn't particularly try and force you to feel anything. It was more of an ""open"" movie which you could interpret in your own way. The Cat and Mouse like chase scene where your thinking ""will they spot each other"" is effective yet also unobtrusive.The Fact that it is a True Story, which is mentioned several times, makes it even more real and touching. To think that what happened there was real (not just the story but many places, such as the hospital, were where these events actually took place,)is heart breaking and truly moving. Especially the Re-Union Scene towards the end. Even most of the people in McGregors Scene who were telling their stories about them and their families were real survivors. This is actually based on the story of the Almarez Family, who were portrayed by the cast of this film!And it's a good portrayal at that, with no over the top dramatizations.It's just real. That the best way to describe it...Just Real!All in all this is an eye opening and must see movie!An absolute must-watch!",The Impossible

The films imagery perfectly displays the power and destruction that a tsunami will leave in its wake, both physical and emotional. While the film shows us the destruction through powerful imagery it is the emotions portrayed by the actors that captures the true spirit of the film. Both Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor give Oscar worthy performances. Naomi Watts, portrayal as a mother struggling to survive has only been matched by a limited few on screen. While Ewan perfectly balances the pain of loss and the relentless will to never give up even in the face of great adversity.

The quiet vacation in the marvelous beach is very relaxing and reliable, i almost phoned this hotel to order a room. The play is quiet well, the kids are cute as honey, and the life of common people in our rushing planet are shown on screen in simple and direct way. The catastrophe that comes without any warning is also very real. The fear and shock, the hope and despair are well transferred to audience, and in some way i was a bit tensed to see whether things goes more badly, or happy ending is coming.BUT, there are two points that made me sad: The first is that in overall this film was boring, like the chewing gum that has lost it's taste. There was a drama, but the director missed something. The second problem is with the unnecessary semi-nude moments that didn't contribute anything to the story.

343,maciel50334,"tourists, stay home?",7,2 January 2013,"A good catastrophe story, not a lot more. A happy family with a typical irritating adolescent vs. good compassive mother conflict structure goes to retrieve the exotic and is almost destroyed by the real exotic. And that means a big adventure centered around a white family in a foreign country that simply doesn't appears to exist in the drama construction. Okay, it's an adventure that drags everyone in a breathless adrenaline exercise until when the title of the movie becomes justified. It seems that the not-so-hidden message is something like ""Beware tourists. Stay close to your homelands"". The film is well done narratively, attractive on the whole technological project - what means trivia and a lot of blingblings for cinephiles to quarrel about. With some good camera work, etc., etc., but all that just to tell Hollywood that other cinema schools can tell a good story with competence. What strikes me the most in the whole work is that it must have the (good) intention to preserve tourism but openly spouses manicheism to the point of preserving Nokia in such a catastrophe - and in that sense, it falls into old good Hollywood clichés. A must see, anyway. The watcher gets entertained all the time - but that's it. Watching tourist's disgraces is always good, even if spurious, entertainment. Just another question: local people didn't die, right? (THAT impression that the film conveys is the real catastrophe. Eurocentrism. Not the tsunami. At all).",The Impossible
344,MrMacBeth,Good film but not totally amazing.,6,19 April 2013,"A good moderately dramatic story, which you can tell is roughly true to life. There is not enough back story and character buildup so we do not get the emotional investment needed to engage with the people in the film all the way to the end. The events carry a lot of emotional charge but for me - just not enough.According to many of other users comments the main concerns are the family in the original true life story are Spanish => Non Northern European => basically Black Africans, replaced with tall blond perfect Aryan Specimens with a rosy English tint to them, and the second big racism charge is that native Indonesian's are used as mat's for white people to cross to safety which they gladly and willingly do.OK, I can see why there is a feeling of ignoring the horrors the Thai's went through, we should have seen more native victims - but in a tourist resort, not the mainland, it probably was like this - and the natives are portrayed mono dimensionally like saints, but because this is just a story from one families perspective, there can be no Native narrative! As for the bunch of Blonde dopplegangers - One of the real life characters in the movie is now in the UK learning how to be a lifeguard. And I wouldn't know to look at him or any of the family if hes is Welsh, English or Spanish just as with any other European! The only racist here is the attempt by people to make hair colour racist.

It tells the story of one family becoming a victim of the 2004 tsunami in South-East Asia. The film didn't even meet my modest expectations.The main problem with this film is that it does little more than tell the story of exactly one family. Little attention is given to everyone else, which is mind boggling given the magnitude of the catastrophe. Even some members of the family are left out a little bit, and the movie concentrates mainly on few characters.The other problem is that the film is too slow-paced and boring. It should have been cut much shorter or even better there should be more content.One weird thing is that there is not much death to be seen in this movie, but still the amount of gore is plenty, courtesy of mostly one main character.",The Impossible

I knew from the trailer that a disaster was imminent from the word go, so I braced myself for impact and kept my fingers crossed that Ewan Mcgregor was going to give more than the lack luster performance that i feel like I've been growing accustomed to. Okay, so i was crying from about 10 minutes into the film. While McGregor is credible, although still not a return to form, the real performance here is from Naomi Watts. She is gripping to watch, and lends credibility to the rest of the cast as she watches the world fall apart around her. I winced, squirmed and spent many minutes forgetting to breathe. An emotional roller-coaster which, while somewhat lacking in depth in storyline, more than makes up for it with a strong edit. Great job with an average script.",The Impossible

As the family, and the people around them, freeze in confusion and fright, a horrific wall of black water races across the hotel grounds; towards them all.The effects and scenery are outstanding, as the team shoot a giant, man-made, wave (with-out green screen), giving the film an astonishing effect of its own! It almost feels real as you watch the giant monster sweep away the lives of innocent people, destroy the beautiful lands, and take away everything that was once important to the people of Thailand and tourists.I would highly recommend this film to anyone as it's magnificent and an honour to watch the devastating story of the Belen family.

That was a waste of money...We had seen the trailer and thought it was going to be really good, but trailers can be misleading and in this case, the trailer made a better film than the actual one. Personally I don't think that any of the actors did very well, especially the main boy. Also, we keep getting told that it is based on a true story, but the actual family is Spanish, not a rich, white, privileged family who get seen first in a hospital full of people dying and get given their own special room even though the hospital is bursting for space.I have to admit that I did cry, but I think that was more of the fact that so many people died in real life, not the fact that they got a private jet home perfectly fine. It was a sad storyline, but i found it hard to connect with any of the characters on any level, or empathise with any of them because they just annoy you so much by the end.Overall, it's a really bad film with a story based on coincidences we are supposed to believe.

I have quite a week stomach though, so those scenes were not for me. I feel that those scenes were vital for truly making the film very life-like and show what really happens in such drastic conditions as this.The characters were so real, and I feel that the actors and actresses did an AMAZING job portraying their parts. I was particularly attached to Lucas, the oldest son, and as I watched the film, I literally felt like I was him in some ways.I think the story was told very nicely, and it has stayed with me ever since I watched it.

351,everythingispossimpible,Impossibly Brilliant,10,13 May 2015,"The Impossible is an incredibly moving film that had me in tears for most of it. I don't think I'll be able to write a review that could convey the emotion that this film stirs up, so I'll just keep it simple and try my best to describe the brilliance in filmmaking and acting that feature in this film.The Impossible follows the Bennett family as they deal with the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami that hit Thailand on Boxing Day. The family is separated and their dream Christmas holiday has quickly turned into a nightmare as the Thailand coastline is now a graveyard and a violated landscape. Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Tom Holland were simply exceptional and immaculately convincing and believable in their respective roles. The Bennett family are split up and they frantically search for each other in tear-jerking fashion as each of them face shocking scenes of devastation that survivors called ""beautifully accurate"". Tsunami survivors also felt compelled to respond to some cynical critics who complained about the ""whitewashing"" of this horrific event. They argued that these critics have missed the point of the film and the true story completely, which was the touching and profound sense of community and unity that was shown by visiting survivors and the local Thais.This film is exceptional with every cast member delivering unbelievably authentic performances as they waded their way through the landscape blighted by the horrors that the tsunami brought. Every moment was perfectly framed that made me as a viewer invest into their story and the agony that they experienced in this tragic, emotional and incredible film.There are umpteen moments where the viewer is brought to tears by the devastation that has decimated the local landscape and the horrific injuries that have affected people's lives, for some indefinitely. Not to mention the scenes depicting the thousands of body bags that people had to look through just to make sure they didn't see a face that they recognised. By not seeing them, they can keep holding onto the hope of seeing them again. An exceptional portrayal of the excruciating tragedy that happened almost a decade ago, but it will always seem fresh in the mind after watching this special film.If you liked this review please check out my website where I have reviewed other films too. https://rwh92.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/some-more-short-film-ratings/",The Impossible

This movie showed their story as they search to be reunited with each other. This movie enraptured the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami that took over 200,000 lives in Phuket Thailand. With a wave height reaching fifty feet this was the biggest and deadliest tsunami to ever hit Thailand. In addition, there was a large number of tourists vacationing during this time adding to the death toll. This film accurately depicts the chaos and confusion after a natural disaster hits as well as the destruction it causes. There were thousands missing and more injured. This movie accurately depicts the massive undertaking of trying to provide medical aid, food, and water to all affected. However, it failed to show the warning signs of a tsunami. During this movie it appeared that there were no warning signs of any danger. In the event of a tsunami the water would have receded and tides would have been unpredictable. This was not shown in the film. Additionally, this tsunami was originally caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake. This was another warning sign that was missed in the film. However this earthquake happened in the deep ocean waters off the coast of Indonesia in addition to the sand absorbing the shock it is possible no one felt it occur. It did however depict the silence before a tsunami hits and how fast it hits. With speeds of around 200 miles an hour there was no time to react and this was depicted in the movie. Overall this film accurately portrays the aftermath of a tsunami. It caused a large amount of death as well as showing the damage it caused.

They came forward and volunteered their story and to cheapen it with racial remarks, or to say that the emotion is 'corny,' is disgusting.Would it really effect you more if it was a Thai family's ordeal? The whole point of this fim is that in the face of adversity people from all backgrounds become equal; they have to band together to survive. It is about a family's love and strength and it is a beautiful mess. I was really affected by the film and couldn't help but put myself into the family's position.

He did a phenomenal job bringing the realism into this movie.The stars of the movie were definitely Naomi Watts, Tom Holloway and Ewan Mcgregor.Naomi Watts was epic and the emotions she was able to convey to us was beyond belief.The surprise of the movie and the star was Tom Halloway.I cannot believe that it was snubbed in the academy awards for best picture, score, supporting actor, and actor. This shows that interest and politics do play a role in the nomination process.In the end, this cast was one of the best cast of recent time, due to the fact that their performances were awesome. This movie is one of the best disaster movie of recent time, if not ever, and definitely one that need to be seen.

363,yipiha,"Nothing to see here, keep walking...",1,18 December 2013,"I won't discuss the racism, it has been expressed enough by other commentators. What shocked me the most was the stupidity of the characters - a useful tool to create suspenseful situation when nothing justify watchers keeping interest in what is going on.Examples...When the first wave arrives, the eldest screams 'Dad' while the dad shouts 'Lucas'. Running away, in silence, is somewhat out of the question. The mother clutches the book she was reading as a protection. After saving themselves, the oldest boy and the mother decide to climb a tree (you have just wasted 10 minutes of your life watching this part). Why? There is no water, the efforts she has to make are incredibly painful and walking further would probably be a better option. They save a little boy (hidden under a very heavy pack of straws) but forget him when they are brought to the hospital. There the oldest son looses track of his mother twice: first, he watches television (they are saying a massive tsunami just killed a lot of people). Second, he runs errands for other victims (his mother asks him to help other people). Rather than telling him where she was moved to or inquiring further about him, a nice nurse sticks a 'orphan' sticker to his chest. When the staff realize they might have the boy of a parent under surgery, they first ask him to repeat his name, then to recognize jewelery - was it to confirm or infirm whose kid he was? Saying 'we think we can bring you to your mum' never occur to them. 'Not saying it' must have been the scenarists motto.Meanwhile the dad saved his two younger sons. And as the hotel where they stayed is evacuated, he leaves them with nice people, in a truck to a shelter in the mountains, to look for wife and first-born by himself. At night. On the devastated beach. After 10 minutes of fruitless calling, he ends up in a post-traumatic therapy group where he can borrow a phone and call his family in Europe.So for no real reason the dad, the mum, the 2 younger boys and the oldest one are separated. The last 20 minutes are about nearly seeing each other but somehow looking just the other way at the wrong time. They each do finally meet up after much near misses (the eldest son shouts 'Dad' in an overcrowded hospital rather than the name of his father - the two boys keep calling for the oldest one, who takes a whole minute to turn around and as they don't get down from the truck, it might go away at any time!).This movie is an insult to your common sense .

365,wi-tch,Absolutely Breathe taking,10,11 January 2013,"Originally i had no intention of watching this film, i don't know why but it just didn't really catch me. Then after reading a review in which the reviewer completely slated the film, i decided to watch it and i am exceptionally grateful i did. Since watching the film i have not been able to stop thinking about it. I have no connections to the 2004 Tsunami in any way shape or form, i wasn't there, i don't know anyone personally that was affected by it but that being said, in one scene where Ewan McGregors character phones home and speaks to his father-in-law i sobbed. There are so many emotion filled moments in this movie, moments made all the more poignant by the fantastic acting by the whole cast. I feel i have to mention in particular Tom who plays the eldest son Lucas. This is his first movie... wow his acting is absolutely brilliant, even Ewan and Naomi upped their game where their acting is concerned. There have been so many people commenting concerning the fact that this film is based on a ""white family"" when so many people from Thailand and Indonesia lost their lives. It seems to me those people just do not get the point of the film, it is not a documentary, it is a film based on the true story of a family who got caught in a terrible disaster. It is not a film made about that disaster it is a film about a family in the middle of that disaster. I easily give this film 10 out of 10 I think my last words should be these, this film successfully shows one families struggle to reunite with each other, but what it is also shows is the kindness of strangers, that in the end when something so devastating happens we come together for the sake of survival.",The Impossible

At the cinema, I heard sniffles, crying and even yelps of sadness. Which shows how this film can affect people! I felt myself connect with the characters and was completely glued to the screen throughout.Nice performances throughout helped shape the story. In particular, Tom Holland gives a realistic and emotional performance.A film suitable for all ages and one which everyone should see.

368,julianmarksmith,The phrase 'emotional roller-coaster' is used too often....,9,6 January 2013,"****SPOILER ALERT *****The phrase 'emotional roller-coaster' is used too often....But in this case I can't sum up the diversity of emotions that I felt whilst watching this movie in any other way. I knew it would tug on my heart strings purely due to the subject matter and the pre-release material that I'd seen. What I didn't expect is that a film, a movie, a piece of celluloid would tap into the most base emotions of my 'lizard brain' as the scientists call it. As a father with a son of the same age as the main child in this I felt myself pulled into the family's plight, decisions and ultimate salvation like no other film I've ever seen.If I was to criticise though, the ending was terribly cheesy - the mum fighting towards the light to survive her surgery and then all the family are greeted by a representative of the father's employers, a large bank and taken to a private plane past lines of grieving survivors only to have the plane to themselves with rows of empty seats when they could've helped others.Overall a magnificent film though and one that the cinematographer must get nominated for an Oscar for the tsunami scenes which were breath-takingly realistic.",The Impossible
369,deannakara,Moving film with outstanding performances and a story that everyone should be told,7,21 January 2013,"This film is so hard-hitting and most of that comes from the foreboding at the beginning. However, despite knowing what is going to happen it still shocks you and the foreboding only helps add to your experience. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts both give fantastic performances in their roles but are outshone by the child cast. Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin are brilliant and I would have liked to see more of them in the story and Tom Holland is perfectly cast as the older son Lucas. His acting is phenomenal for his young age and I would definitely like to see him get an award for this performance. A lot of people have slated the film for focusing on one vacationing family instead of the local people who were affected also but I believe that you understand the scale of the disaster despite this. It was a lot more gory than I expected and although I have seen gory horror films (Saw, Se7en etc.) I found this much harder to watch because you know it is based on a true story and when watching, due to the amazing performances you really connect with the characters. My friend was close to leaving the cinema he found it so hard to watch but afterwards he said it was worth getting through and he was glad he watched the rest. There is also some nudity, but it is not sexual and whilst I don't think all of it was necessary, it only adds to the sense of disaster. Juan Antonio Bayona's direction is fantastic and the cinematography is breath-taking, despite the tragedy being told it is quite beautiful. The effects are also incredible and this helps to bring home the impact the tsunami had. I didn't know much of the tragedy as I was only young when it happened, but this film really opened my eyes and helped me to understand how tragic the event was. The performances and the story of 'The Impossible' is so moving and the music adds to this, out of the five of us who went to see it, only one of us didn't cry and she was still shaken by it. I recommend taking tissues just in case. The whole audience in the cinema was entranced by this film which you do not see often. You really connect with the characters and the story hits hard. Although this film has a big emotional impact however, underneath it has a lovely message about the amazing endurance of humanity and the love between families that can withstand so much. This is not an easy film to watch but I completely recommend it, to the point where I think is should be compulsory for all to watch it.For more film reviews see deannareviews.blogspot.co.uk",The Impossible

I was reticent when a friend told me to watch this movie- I was thinking that no movie can express what those people felt when their families were torn apart. Well, I was wrong: Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor's performance is amazing, the scenario is perfect and the soundtrack completes everything else in this masterpiece. There are so many things to say about this movie, however, I will not spoil the viewer's surprise.

I thoroughly enjoyed this true story masterpiece from the very start. At first I didn't expect too much, but as the film progressed I got stuck into it. If you've watched the trailer you will have seen the stunning tsunami that destroys this family's holiday and causes them to lose each other. If you are a fan of disaster movies, you've come to the right place as this movie is an emotional roller-coaster filled with sadness and a horrific scene of destruction replicating the unfortunate day on the morning of December 26th in Thailand in 2004.

373,user-419-381779,A Must See!!,9,16 January 2013,"The Impossible is so moving and inspiring, when I saw it i was just touched. By the story, the actors and the themes. The 2004 Thailand Tsunami causes a British family to become separated. They drastically try to find each other and save they're family. For me, Naomi Watts and Tom Holland made this film, but especially Holland. They're portrayal of the family members was spot on and they're acting was just superb. For a young guy Holland played his character which such great depth and pure emotion I could some how relate to him and feel like a part of his story and the situation. Ewan McGregor was also fantastic. This film is just utter amazement. I would recommend it to everyone as it is an astonishing film of the true story of this family, it is so powerful, magnificent, majestic and life changing and i hope to see it get some big awards, it defiantly deserves them.",The Impossible
374,manifornothing,Washed away,7,9 September 2013,"The Impossible is one of those man Vs nature stories but with the emotional layer of a family torn apart. The actors go out of their way to play their parts realistically. I thought Naomi Watts was fantastic as a mom struggling to cope with trauma and nearly teenage son. The young lad is also someone to watch out for. The art direction, an oft forgotten part of cinema, is fantastic. Can't even begin to imagine how much planning would have gone into making this film. A must watch just to comprehend some of the events post the tsunami and how people coped with it in their own way. The writing and direction are subtle and never fight for attention, just like how i like it. I guess the story lacks twists and turns and relies more drama and acting but that's not really the writer's fault since it is based on the true experiences of a family. Having been to Phuket in the years after the Tsunami its amazing to see how this city has got back on its feet and it makes this story even more personal to me. Watch this on your big flat screen, volume and be prepared to be washed away.",The Impossible
375,alicelouise-94,Great film! A must see for the new year,9,2 January 2013,"WARNING MY REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS. Apologies but it was too difficult not to.I went to see this film this evening with my mum. I was very excited to watch this (if that's the right word for such a sad film) because the trailer really captured my emotion and the detail of the film it's self as well as the acting looked truly magnificent and true to the real event. It is about a family of five, who in the film are English but in real life are Spanish, however this did not effect the truth behind the story. It follows their story from the day they arrive through the event and the day they leave the country of Thailand. When the day of the dreadful tsunami arrives the atmosphere is still as though preparing for something. The mother (Maria) drops a page from her book and goes to retrieve it. She crouches next to a pain of glass and it begins to shake. Knowing something is wrong she looks up and the birds are flying away from the shore line. Then panning towards the dad and three sons, they look and the wave hits. The dad and the two younger sons are swept under and the eldest boy Lucas dives into the pool whilst the mother cowers against the glass. This scene is very powerful and upsetting, when watching it the footage feels so real, as though you are actually there. When the characters are struggling you almost feel their pain, the camera shows debris hitting the mother Maria and the eldest son Lucas making you wince at the sound of the objects as they hit and cut them. My self and others in the audience gasped out loud at the reality of the filming. The story then continues and mostly follows Maria and Lucas as they find safety. Maria is severely injured and the pain she feels goes right through you, Naomi Watts is phenomenal throughout the film, a truly talented actress. The acting throughout all characters is amazing but Watts steels the show for me. After they reach safety Maria is in a bad way and is helped by local Thai people. This scene is very affectionate and yet again emotional. When they both reach a hospital the amount of people that were been affected becomes apparent. There is one difficult scene when Maria is coughing blood, it is quite hard to watch. The film then reaches the father, Henry who is still at the coast looking for Maria and Lucas. When he goes back inside the building ruins it is a relief when the two younger boys Tomas and Simon are safe. Henry then leaves the younger boys to continue searching for the other two. The acting of the youngest sons is excellent and very touching. Henry then ends up checking the hospital where Maria and Lucas are and throughout the scene Henry and Lucas are walking around missing each other only by a few feet which is frustrating, you almost want to shout out loud that they are in that hospital. Lucas ends up sighting the back of his dad Henry and runs outside searching for him. The two younger boys are also in the area as the bus they are on stops. The four characters luckily end up reuniting during this scene and this was one of the most emotional scenes at which I couldn't hold back the tears. The family then reunite and Maria goes into theatre for operation which is a very tense scene, Lucas falls asleep and as though he is dreaming we re live the tsunami as hit the coast. During this we see Maria struggling in the water through the debris and appears to be drowning but then reaches for the surface in a dramatic slow mo sequence. This dream then relates back to present time as Maria fights for her survival. Her triumph in reaching the surface almost reveals that she has survived the op, and will be OK. This is the outcome which is a great relief that the family are going to be OK. The five of them then catch a flight to Singapore away from the devastation, and it is a shot over the ocean where the film comes to an end.The impossible is an amazing story and piece of film work and array of talent. I was close to tears throughout the whole of the film, each scene was emotional giving me that painful lump in the thought. But there were two scenes where I could not hold back the tears, one of which I have mentioned. It is a great film and I would highly recommend it as a must see of 2013, but be ready with a tissue to hand as it is a real tear jerker of a story, a true story that really did seem impossible.",The Impossible

377,bob_182,Excellent representation combined with great storytelling,8,18 January 2013,"Reading the reviews of this film, I find it a shame that so many users have labeled it a racist view of this disaster. It appears many people on IMDb were expecting to find a documentary and were shocked that the story followed a western family. These people clearly do not understand that a movie aimed at westerners is going to be far more effective with characters they can relate to. This film was filed under drama and in my mind, it was one of the best in that category in 2012. I'm glad we didn't watch a wave of water for half the film. The time spent telling each part of the story was perfect. From my memories of the incident, the wave hitting the shore was the first 1% of the story. The recovery and rescue efforts were what made the world come together and push their support to Thailand. When I heard about this film, I didn't picture the wave. More the images we saw on every news broadcast of temporary shelters with injured tourists from all over as well as natives. This was the setting for most of the film and within that is a well told story. The acting was 8/10, with all actors plying their part reasonably well but for obvious reasons, it would be simply impossible for them to represent the authentic emotions of a victim in such a disaster and it does show. They can yell and scream and cry all they want but even the best acting in the world is still acting when playing out such events which cannot be recreated.The visuals were a 9/10. Absolutely stunning. I was amazed by the way the water looked to be coming 'with more power than you could imagine' as so many described it in 2004. The extras, the injuries, the shelters all looked authentic and detailed. Cars, buildings, trees all swept away and left spread across the land. The only complaint i would have is that only small destination was shown in at the point of impact. If someone didn't already know, they could be forgiven for thinking the wave only hit one of the beaches. There were very few aerial shots with more than 100 meters or so in sight but the shots we did see were violent and realistic.The writing was great for a drama. Probably 8/10. Not a thrilling film that would have you jumping out of your seat but at no point boring. While scenes felt uncomfortable at times and you just wanted to look away, I think that was simply the result of the direction capturing the horror that was seen by everyone involved in the disaster. There were a few loose ends which again I think were intentional as they kind of sum up the feelings of the victims. With nothing but a first name for those around you, it would be impossible to find out if they ever found their families and made it out alive and I suppose the actual victims would be still wondering what happened to the the others they met in the days after the wave hit.",The Impossible
378,jonathan-t-byrnes,Beautifully Realistic,10,6 February 2013,"When I saw the trailer for this film I did not think much of it. The trailer seemed like a spoiler and left me disinterested. Do not be disinterested! wow.What an epic window into a tragedy most people would have flicked through on the news years ago without any true understanding of the emotional trauma the individuals involved went through. I feel this movie gets it 100% right. Maybe because it was a true story, maybe because there was brilliant acting even from the young kids in the film, perhaps the subject matter, Whatever the case this movie grabbed my emotions from the very beginning and did not let go for the duration of the film.I keep seeing reviews from critics arguing that the film is slightly racist as it centers around a white privileged family and not enough emphasis was placed on the fact that Thai people suffered also. This is absolute rubbish, the film is simply accurate, I have been to Thailand multiple times and nothing in the film seemed out of place. I have even been to hospital in Thailand ... thats what it is like. Lots of white people with the white people, why? because there is more chance you will be able to speak to the people around you. It just makes sense. I love Thai people but I don't speak Thai, If I was stuck in a hospital surrounded by people speaking another language it would just be confusing and confusion is not something that needs amplification in a disaster. Most of the critics have probably never even been out of their house let alone to Thailand. The movie was focused around what one family saw. That is what they saw, end of story. I didn't see any racism I just saw people helping people.This film gets it 100%. Its a deeply emotional story that made me appreciate my life more at the end of it. If you are a critic and you are talking about insignificant stupid things like how Ewans hair looked too perfect after the tsunami then you have completely missed the point of the movie. Just watch it and let it take you where it took me. If a movie makes you appreciate life more at the end of it, then it gets a 10. enough said.",The Impossible

Holland dominates the movie throughout,subtly changing his emotions from fear, to strength, to despair. A performance overlooked by the various film awards. An actor to watch for in the future. Not an easy movie to watch, but one that speaks to the power of family. Scene with Geraldine Chaplin and a young boy is a moment of simple wonder in an otherwise chaotic time.

380,iancualice,Not impressed and quite annoyed,2,11 September 2013,"Alright, so I have been reading some of the reviews and debates around here and I'd like to add my two cents. I watched the movie without high expectations and I got what I was expecting plus some irritating moments.Good things: the tsunami scene(s) I felt where beautifully shot and portrayed. It came suddenly and furiously it kept me glued to the seat. That's about it as far as ""the good stuff"" is concerned for meCons: 1. Horrible wooden acting. The boy playing the leading child character was so stiff and annoyed me to no end...the only one doing a decent job was Naomi Watts, but by no means was I blown away. The bad acting made the characters completely void of personality and their ""family connection"" mostly had no depth.2.Product placement: when the kid found the coca cola can I literally burst out laughing at how weird it felt... 3. This is not a film about the ""triumph of the human spirit"" unless you think the human spirit triumphs through watered-down-soap-opera coincidences and feel-good endings (although the ending didn't feel good for me). Actually it just felt overall like an average TV movie. 4. While I read some of the one-liners and debates around here, on one side or another, there is no way I can understand how so many still feel it is OK to focus on Western suffering and present it so shamelessly as ""the triumph of the human spirit"". People will say this was a story about this family (not the original Spanish one mind you) and that's just the focus of the film. OK. Fine! Now please just take a second and think about all the stories you see about families like this and all the stories you don't see about other types of families, about long lasting problems and serious decision-making. Neah, we don't want to see that, we just want to see middle-class (upper?) white people triumph, because if they triumph surely the ""human spirit"" triumphs...in a movie about a horrible natural disaster that left poor countries poorer and fighting with the aftermath still for years so come...really??really? 5. That ending! Not a feel good ending for me, as it made me realize once more what a twisted socially unjust world this is. And before anyone starts screaming, yes, I was happy they were alright. Not happy at the despair they left behind and at the empty seats in the plane. Yes, you can feel both: happy for those who make it and still outraged at a world where your money and nationality can save you. These are two different things. And playing the emotional card and saying that I should just feel for this family and leave it at that really is just beating around the bush and slamming the proverbial straw-man, while remaining so Western-centric it makes me dizzy. Institutional racism is, among other things, about making the white story ""THE STORY"" and about downplaying everything else (and oh, was there a lot downplayed here). This film, as evident from a lot of the reviews, excels at this. This is the only thing its really good at. Well, hooray for that...(sarcasm pouring here). Gave it two stars for the tsunami scenes and for Naomi Watts. As far as I am concerned that's all it deserves.",The Impossible

Both epic and intimate devastating and uplifting, the impossible is a journey to the core of the human heartReview: j a bayona has created a very powerful drama about the effects on a whole nation during a very difficult time in our history and the story of one family triumph over the odds and survival of this terrible event. I was blown away by the special effects of the tsunami waves and the fact that this wasn't achieved by cgi but with real water and physical stunts makes it even more impressing and exciting to watch, also I was even more impressed by the performances of the lead actors, there were many amazing moments in this film and many things to love about it, I particular loved the scene were the younger boy in the family is sitting outside and an older women comes outside and the boy asks her how old she is and she says nearly 74 and she asks him his age and he says 7 and a half, it was a scene that really showed the wide scale of the disaster as if to say that everyone from age 7 and a half to 74 were affected by this event including people younger and older than that. But what I most loved about the film was the performance of tom Holland playing Lucas when he was reunited with his mum and they were both split up from the rest of the family and Lucas had to step up and take on the role of the courageous, strong character to save his own mum who was in a much worst physical position than he was and I think he stepped up to the mark and was probably the main reason why there family has a happier ending compared to other people caught up in this disaster.

Once you start your venture, you will lose track of the goosebumps and tears that will ease their way out of you. Good direction, beautiful cinematography especially the scenes portraying symbolism, a neatly compiled script and a suitably coordinating background score are the supporting pillars behind this gem. I don't know on what grounds they refrained from giving the Academy award (2013) to Naomi Watts because this is going down as her best.
People complaining about weak script fail to comprehend the meticulous use of symbolism in the movie. To them it's just another cliched flick with a happy ending. But at times it is more important to look into the box rather than just appreciating the gift wrap

Ewan McGregor gives what I personally think is his greatest acting performance yet, Naomi Watts is forced with a lot of roundabouts and tough situations but manages to be as great as ever, and the children performances including Tom Holland were charming and added another great element to the overall grand scope of this movie.One sequence in the movie, about half-way through the first act, was so intensely real and crafted with so much mastery, that I'm ashamed of the lack of praise J.A Bayona has been receiving. This man is a wonderful talent, and a clear rivalry of Steven Spielberg, who has been recognized for the way he visualizes stories and art through screen, but unfortunately he still has not received the amount of praise that he deserves. The fact that he was not nominated for best director at the 2013 Oscars, SCARES ME.The Impossible is one of the most incredible film experiences I have been treated to in the past few decades, as it depicts the true horror and affect of the 2004 tsunami, but also sparks hope. Hope that keeps people holding on. It is acted with a tremendous amount of investment and care, directed with an admirable amount of effort, and shot with the kind of realism that only true filmmakers can implement so intensely. The Impossible is the best film of 2012, without a shadow of a doubt.",The Impossible

392,veronicacox-45618,merry christmas,9,11 February 2020,"The Impossible (2012)The gripping tale of the Boxing Day tsunami (2004) follows the Bennett family to Thailand on their Christmas vacation. The family of 5 are soon in for a traumatic shock when they are swept away from their exotic resort by a massive tsunami. This film is based on a true story of a family who lived through this disaster. It was one of the deadliest disasters in recorded history, leaving at least 200.00 people dead. The tsunami wreaked havoc on the resort and the surrounding coastline, destroying everything. Infrastructure was destroyed, trees knocked down, cars carried away, and people clinging on to whatever they could for dear life.
In this movie, you can see the mother clinging to a tree, alone. The family has been torn apart and no one is safe. As the movie progresses you can see that the mother and oldest son are reunited and father and two youngest boys together as well. The story is about desperation and fighting to survive, especially on the mom's end. This movie portrays the medical emergency response to this disaster as incompetent, in my opinion. They are lacking the resources to run efficiently as well as overpopulating the ""hospital"" rooms. The filmmakers drew attention to bugs in the hospital scenes, probably to point out that the hospitals were not sanitary. Overall, I think the filmmakers portrayed what it was like quite well while still focusing on the main characters and their journey. Obviously, there would have been more people in the water and around the background, but I think they chose to only focus on the family not so much the death toll, being that it is about their struggle.
Some things that I noticed in the movie was that at the resort there were no warnings or sirens that went off before the tsunami hit. This would have saved lives if the resort employees were taught the proper evacuation plan for such a disaster. Also, wouldn't the beachgoers have felt an earthquake that happens before a tsunami? I don't know about the science on that one. I did like the portrayal of the native Thais in the film. It showed their vulnerability and it also how they were willing to help the vacationers. One other thing I noticed in the movie was the inaccuracy of the survivor lists in the hospitals. So many people are looking for their loved ones, *SPOILER* and when the father goes to the hospital that his wife and son are at (unbeknownst to him) he almost leaves because his wife's name is not on the list. However, he quickly finds his boys when they reunite after the smallest one needs to relieve himself, and the oldest boy shows his family where their mom is being treated.
Most disaster films have a bad reputation, but this one portrays this families experience and the reality of the disaster quite well I would say, except the fact that they completely changed the race of the family, but that is beside the point.",The Impossible
393,Zach_Meyers22,The Impossible Movie Review,9,11 February 2020,"I thought The Impossible was a fantastically executed movie as it was highly gripping, heart-wrenching, and a largely accurate portrayal. It begins with the family of five enjoying their holiday vacation at a resort in Khao Lak, Thailand. Two days into the trip the massive tsunami rips through the area, immediately destroying the resort and everything else in its path. In a dramatic scene, the mother and oldest son, Lucas, swirl around in the water for several minutes, knocking into all kinds of objects and suffering multiple serious injuries. They reunite once they find safe ground and rescue an even younger boy who is alone. They make it to a hospital and the mother is rushed into surgery while Lucas goes off to help others find their loved ones, which he does successfully for one father and son. Meanwhile, the father and two younger boys make their way inland from the resort, and after being separated once and the father checking multiple hospitals, they are all reunited in an uplifting scene. The movie ends with the family being transported by plane to Singapore to get the mother to a better hospital for her further surgeries.
I thought this film was fantastic because the portrayal of the tsunami felt very real compared to most disaster films. The underwater camera shots of the people being tossed around provided an excellent sense of what it is like to be caught in one of these nightmares. Overhead shots captured just how devastating the tsunami was, as there was usually nothing but wreckage for as far as the eye could see. Claustrophobic scenes in the camps and hospitals during the fallout of the tsunami did an amazing job of showing how stressful this period can be for families. The entire movie was extremely gory (to the point where my roommate left to throw up halfway through watching) but this very accurately depicted how harrowing an event of this nature can be. All of this is not to mention the star-studded cast that absolutely nailed their performances and sold the reality of the movie.
In the movie there appeared to be no warning system in place at all, as the characters only understood what was about to happen just as the wave was upon them. With almost 5,000 confirmed deaths from this 2004 disaster, this certainly played a part in it being one of the deadliest tsunamis on record. In the wake of the tsunami (pun intended) Thailand has reinforced their tsunami warning system to be much more effective, a practice all towns in earthquake-prone locations should adopt if they aren't already. Watching this movie definitely makes me think tsunami preparedness has more to do with timely warning and evacuation rather than infrastructure, and this is an area that can be easily improved in many areas. As far as response to the disaster, it was decent if unorganized. There were mainly scenes of families reuniting rather than people dying on their hospital bed, which gave the sense that the Thai rescue force did a largely admirable job. In the end, cutting down the death toll from a tsunami is mainly about preparedness and forewarning.",The Impossible
394,jlbauer-82561,"Great movie, but why change the family's race?",6,28 February 2021,"After seeing the end credits, it really bothered me that they made it a white higher-middle class family, when it was a Spanish family that endured the events that were portrayed. I don't see a reason why they made this choice. If I was the family that this movie was based on, I would be deeply insulted that they ""whitified"" the family.",The Impossible

Maria and Henry are two of the most irresponsible and frustrating parents in a movie I've ever seen. Some of the actors, specifically the nurse, deliver their lines so awfully I genuinely can't tell if I'm watching a person or a piece of cardboard. All of the supposedly emotional or intense scenes are just plain laughable because of how badly they are shot and acted. Speaking of the cinematography, it is so distracting. Some of the shots genuinely made me burst out laughing because of how awful they were. The music choice was also extremely questionable. On to the characters, this movie gives me zero reason to care about them. None of the emotional beats hit because I don't know a thing about these people. I care more about the guy who lost his wife and daughter than I do about any of the main characters. It's extremely hard to believe that this is a true story because of how convenient everything is. Some scenes are SO drawn out it's almost unbelievable. The scene where the family is looking for each other is a particularly bad offender.

397,susiminasyan,Summary,10,20 September 2020,"The film is indescribably interesting and touching.It is directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio Sánchez. In December 2004, close-knit family Maria,Henry and their three sons begin their winter vacation in Thailand. But the day after Christmas, the idyllic holiday turns into an incomprehensible nightmare when a terrifying roar rises from the depths of the sea, followed by a wall of black water that devours.
Despair, pain, panic and hope fight for supremacy in this outstandingly made and heartwrenching film, based on the true-life story of a Spanish family who went on a Christmas holiday in Thailand in 2004 and were caught up in the tsunami that hit south-east Asia, killing 230,000 people. With simplicity and conviction, it manages to be something other than a conventional disaster movie. The tsunami sequence itself is a masterly piece of film-making - and as for what follows, I have to admit to being blindsided by its real emotional power. This film is of course vulnerable to charges of manipulation, and of magnifying the western-tourist experience at the expense of the indigenous communities who lost everything. But in the end I found honesty and compassion in The Impossible. It could well be Ewan McGregor's finest hour, and there were long sections that I had to watch through a wobbly blur of tears.What The Impossible brings home is the simple agony and terror of being separated, a void which is worse than physical injury. In the chaos and devastation, the parents and children find themselves, variously, in different parts of this post-apocalyptic landscape. They wonder if their loved ones are dead, or about to be dead; they wonder if they themselves are going to die, if they would be better off dead, and if being dead is in fact what they will come to want more than anything.Watts's Maria is suffering her own torment in hospital, almost unconscious with a badly injured leg: Lucas - in a very decent performance from Holland - is anxiously watching over his mother, terrified that he will be separated from her, but at last takes a break and wanders around the hospital on a self-imposed mission to re-unite strangers with their lost children or partners. His altruism is rewarded with success, but then punished by a horribly ironic twist of fate.
The Impossible"" is the powerful and unforgettable account of a family caught, with tens of thousands of strangers, in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time. But the true-life terror is tempered by the unexpected displays of compassion, courage and simple kindness that Maria and her family encounter during the darkest hours of their lives. Both epic and intimate, devastating and uplifting, ""The Impossible"" is a journey to the core of the human heart.",The Impossible

I made an account with imdb to leave a review for this movie specifically because there were so many harsh reviews for the choices. I for one loved that they chose to focus in on the family that all lived through the tragedy, that's why it was called The Impossible. I would have liked some more character development in the beginning to get to know the family better but glad it wasn't too drawn out. I also would have liked to see the big wave come in from the beach as that was left out. After reading reviews, I found many people upset that it didn't cover the amount of how many people suffered but I thought it did except to say when Maria and Lucas were in the tree I would think there would be more bodies around and so wondered about that.

It offered to get you a better sense of this incredible tragedy. But, it provided little else.1. There was hardly any story at all: some family gets separated and rejoined. Big friggin' deal - this happened to thousands upon thousands, and many more thousands lost loved ones permanently. We all read about how tragic this event was - why show us a completely unremarkable side of it? Maybe if they hadn't said ""true story"" as if it's so incredible you wouldn't think it happened unless they remind you that it did. But it's so banal!! Especially compared to the actual tragedies that did unfold all around these people who had their little holiday ruined. 2. The story centered on one Western family who had the privilege of jetting off out of hell once their trusty insurance agent found them. What about the rest of the people impacted? Are we really saying that the most interesting thing about the Tsunami was a bunch of rescued vacationers? You can tell that story, sure, but how can you leave out everything that changed for all the local people or the people who actually lost loved ones? This film treats the local people like scenery - they are shown positively, that's nice, but flat.

OK, good for them, comes of living in the 1st world, having tons of disposable income, etc. But it makes for a boring movie, which it shouldn't have been since it's based on real events. I kept waiting to FEEL something, at least something other than wow! at the special effects. A much more interesting focus would be to delve into the lives of some of the local populace, the ones not-so-rich, not-so-white, no-so-insured. The ones, say, who lost homes, families, communities, livelihoods, health, virtually EVERYTHING that matters, and somehow neglected to have some Zurich-based insurance company covering all misfortunes.

412,kylesdesk-255-829878,A beautiful film with universal appeal,9,6 January 2013,"I responded to someone who thought this movie had racist overtones. I thought it was a beautiful film with superb direction and acting. I just saw the movie. First of all, the medium of this illustration is film. Producers and and other involved in this kind of art have to consider the mode and the way characters are able to portray the story, not just the material. I suppose the most accurate method for delivering the story would have been to have the original family star in the film. Race certainly wouldn't have been a factor in this case, would it? When viewing art, yes you consider the artist and where he came from, his own personal story. But how far do you take this idea that 'race' should be as much a part of this story as the family and what happened to them? Should the director also be of this 'race'? Should they all meditate around the ideas that race might play? Remember, film is a form of art. One with limitations, such as time. And art also has certain rules. In film, like a ballet, you're dealing with a medium that uses time in a very different way than traditional art. Time is depicted, not in a linear fashion, but as a moment in and of itself. A ballet isn't made up of each formal move and the stories of the dancers themselves. Movement in this way is meant to capture all of these pieces as interpretive experience which can say something quite true in 2 hours about something that took a lifetime to construct: the struggle between grace and nature for example. Art in this way moves our soul, not our logic or our understanding of the progression of things in the 'real' world. I'm sure casting is a tough job, but Naomi Watts and Ewan McGreggor both have incredible resumes and were very qualified to play these roles. These are creative decisions, not social ones. There was no 'social' argument here. A Japanese family could have played these roles just as well if the actors were decided to embrace and commit the direction of this creative work. Yes it was a true story, and because of that the creative process demands certain considerations. But as far as critiquing western culture, your argument lacks premise. The family the film was based on is Spanish. And if my geography is correct, Spain IS a western country. Culturally speaking, like every country in Europe, they have their own way of life yes, but they're still largely western in their thinking, their play, their political ideology. But once again, this film isn't about 'Spanish"" culture. It's about a family. Yes they were Spanish, but as such a family they have their own familial nuances and particular way of life that I'm sure is different enough from other families in Spain to make them personal. Did it matter that the actors in the film didn't speak Spanish? They were on vacation. They played soccer. Celebrated Christmas. Played ping pong. Drank soda. And they enjoyed the amenities provided for people who are accustomed to western culture. So the fact that the cultural experience of the family in the film seemed to be British (Ewan McGregor's character was obviously Scottish) isn't in any way a distraction from what actually happened to the Belon family. I agree casting for Lucas might have yielded better results, but the outcome of the experience portrayed is unchanged. So the premise that this film somehow falls short of a narrative accurately depicting some 'racial' truth about Maria and Henry Belon and their children is just completely absurd. The film is a narrative about deep suffering, courage, love, ... a family's desperate struggle to find each other. The husbands undying devotion to his wife. The wife's bleeding heart to help others in need. To demonstrate that character for her son. To overcome her own internal fears. And somewhat about how they perceived this new devastated world they found themselves in. How to relate to others. How to cross a language barrier. How to let strangers take care of them. These ideas in fact aren't 'western' at all. They're Universal. If you can't see that, you should spend a little more time studying these disciplines, art, culture, psychology. Before you try to impose something as controversial as race into a conversation that obviously affected the readers in a very personal way. One of the gentleman who responded on the 'Boards' actually went THROUGH this disaster, like the Belon family.",The Impossible

I think this movie truly captures the essence of what those people in the tsunami had to go through, and I think that was really what the most valuable asset of the movie was. The story line kept you on your toes, always begging to find out what happens next. The fact that it was a true story, makes it even more difficult to watch.

To be honest I never cried in a movie but in this movie all I could do was let the tears go down my cheek.It is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life ! This movie wont take time to be one of the best drama movies ever done and I recommend this movie for everyone from all ages its Simply Brilliant! This movie will touch you deep in your heart and then tear it apart !,The Impossible
420,joshuawakeman,"Wonderful effects, acting and directorial input...not an outstanding script.",7,9 January 2013,"The film is based upon the true story of a Spanish family who holiday in Thailand for Christmas 2004. The choice to use a white family here is clearly so that the film can appeal to the masses and be watched by and appreciated by a main-stream white audience. With outstanding rolls from Watts and Holland which display a true bond and raw emotions throughout, it was very easy to get caught up in the emotion of the film; making it a successful representation of ONE FAMILY'S struggle in the tsunami. The fact that they are (in the film): white, privileged and British only highlights the tsunami's ability to effect all rungs of the social ladder. However, I could not help but feel a little dishonest when the film did not show nearly enough Thai people being effecting - considering that they were impacted the worst. All in all a must see film which I hope will do very well. However, a little more character development would have been welcome.",The Impossible
421,swastiksingh4,Tom Holland is the best in the film.,8,2 February 2013,"It is the most emotional natural disaster film i have ever watched.there are so many scenes in the film which will make you cry, i have seen this movie many times and tears come to my eyes every time i watch those scenes .this film is packed with outstanding performances by Naomi watts,Tom Holland and Ewan McGregor but i must say Tom Holland is the best in the film.Naomi watts is nominated for the best actress in academy awards for this film and i think she should get the Oscar this time. but i would say that the film is more dramatic than realistic but still i cant deny the fact that the film is one of the best of 2012. 2004 hazardous natural disaster is well shown in the film and every actor have justified their character, Naomi's emotions never look fake and only a mature actor can do that what Naomi has done in the film and Tom at this age he acted like a matured actor although it's his first film.

422,alexva0,You have to see this!,8,5 July 2013,"Before I first saw this film, I had hardly any expectations. I knew Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar and that it was based around the devastating 2004 Thailand tsunami, but not much else.The premise of the film is simple: a family, which contains of 3 children and their parents are in shock after the tsunami and are trying to locate the other members of the family, whilst surviving.The acting in this movie is indeed spectacular. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor do not in any way disappoint, they are as convincing as ever. At first I was a bit unconvinced by Lucas, played by Tom Holland. I thought his acting wasn't on par but later on in the movie I was proved wrong. He has some talent and can showcase a wide range of emotions.My only problem with the film is that the pacing was a bit slow at the beginning. I wondered how it would go on for 2 hours without boring me to death. As the script developed, however, I felt more and more attached to the story and the characters in it. It does a great job of immersion.In conclusion, this is a must-see movie that will make you feel for the characters through their bad and good times. It will make you think about appreciating your life and the ones close to you.9/10",The Impossible

Because, I think the quake is the most important thing in this movie. I was a little bit disappointed. But, I seriously felt the movie, and reminded me of the exact time of tsunami. The visual effect was awesome, it was so real, The place was torn apart like the way it was hit. I saw with my own eyes. The acting was really great, Naomi was so good in the movie. Ewan did a really great Job. But the one who deserve an appreciation would be Tom, this kid is so amazing, he would be a great actor.

The movie takes a very real approach to horrors that some people must have endured that day and captures the realism very well. The Tsunami scene was breathtaking i could literally feel my self holding my breathe. The score adds to the occasion and really tugs on your heart strings. I was left thinking ""wow"" and took a second thought to those who actually endured that day.

This is obviously a very sad story about a natural disaster but it is not, in my opinion, entertainment.The scene where the tsunami wave knocks trees down, tree by tree, just looks so unrealistic, and the following scenes do nothing to convince me.A huge amount of people died in this tragedy, and yet the family that are depicted in the story all survive and fly home to live happily ever after.

For starters, This story takes place in a Thai city with this English family vacationing when the tsunami strikes. This entire story is revolved around just these white family's,victims and people while there is no showing of how the locals suffered. *Spoilers* Then at the end the Maria and the family leaves on a charted plane while the country still suffers.It's not one of my favorite movies in the world but it was decent.

The 4 stars i give this film go purely for the character of Lucas whom is relatable and who i actually felt emotion towards as the rest of the cast are understandably weak but to the point where it just gets annoying.

429,HallOfFameWalkOfShame,"The Impossible isn't quite mission accomplished, but is probably on the better side of most likely genre contenders.",7,3 January 2013,"A Hall Of Fame/ Walk Of Shame ReviewWith the sun set on the horizon of 2012, the flood gates open for 2013's rather hefty load of comic book sequels and horror reboots, with some looking promising and others nauseating. But leading the charge of the new year is The Impossible, a families true story of survival during 2004's devastating Tsunami (with only the ethnicity of the family being altered from Spanish to British as some sort of insensitive marketing technique).The cast is fronted by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGreggor, who awkwardly deliver underwhelming dialogue in the scenes leading up to the pivotal catastrophe. The sense of unity and family is never entirely established because the on-screen chemistry seems forced and slightly 'robo-tronic', with the child actors actually upstaging their piers, as their playful innocence seems more organic than their parents' stiff interaction. This could perhaps be director Juan Antonio Bayon inability to direct actors in none distressing scenes, as both lead performances and new comer Tom Holland performances start sloppy but thankfully pick up as the film goes on and the situation get more intense with no favours from the wishy-washy screenplay.However, if conversation isn't Bayon's forte, then visual direction most certainly is with The Impossible being filled to the brim with astounding shots of total destruction, with the tidal wave act definitely surpassing Eastwood's efforts in Hereafter (hmm, you don't remember it either?) The cinematography and set design is an achievement in it's self, remaining slightly unnerving how Bayonmanages to keep such malfunction under such control. The make-up on the injuries is unsettlingly profound, really pushing the boundaries of blood and injury in a PG-13 film. The wide shots of the panic in the hospitals and wards needs to be applauded, however Bayon does manage to drop the ball when it comes to commemorating the lives lost of the countries natives and portrays a almost 'I Am Legend' like aura in a disaster claiming 30,000 lives. This refrains the film from much needed authenticity, but it's enough to keep you somewhat engaged in the survival and discovery of the other family members.Disaster movies do suffer from taking lulls after the main attraction hits in its second half (in this case, with waves from the Indian oceans tearing up the scenery) but to it's credit, The Impossible quite comfortably pulls off interest in it's 114 minute running time, with an execution that isn't too sweet, but savage either, but just right. It's moving without being upright tear jerking, which is surprising considering it's subject matter, probably due to cliché secondary characters weighing down the realism when it comes to panic and social interaction.So, to concludeMore of an achievement than a mission accomplished, The Impossible succeeds in it's visuals, but isn't quite the triumph when it comes to it's human side. Moving with out leaving you distraught, positive without leaving you inspired. Will offend by the thousands, but is probably on the better side of most likely genre contenders.",The Impossible
430,Ilovefilmsx,Amazing story of an unimaginable impossible real life disaster,9,5 January 2013,"I left the cinema feeling very emotionally drained after this film but it was totally worth it. Only after viewing it will you understand the true meaning of why the film is called the impossible! I viewed this film with open mind and not really knowing what to expect and straight away I was gripped by it! Its filmed so well that you cant help but feel as though you are right there living through this awful experience with the family. Everyone involved did an amazing job of making sure the audience were en-captured and could almost feel what the characters were feeling. I say almost as as much as I tried to feel it I doubt you could ever know how scary heartbreaking and terrifying it must have been to live through it but the film made sure I felt it enough to thank my lucky stars I have never had to and hopefully never will! The tsunami hits very early on in the film which I wasn't expecting but nothing more of the before shots were needed, its simple, it was Christmas, they were a loving family in paradise in a brand new hotel on the beach front with lots of other people doing exactly the same thing. None of who could have possibly imagined what would unfold without any warning! The build up was quick and thats how it would have been, one minute your reading a book or in the pool and the next hell arrives on earth.The rest of the film needs to be seen and not explained but its a very well told story of this families journey. It leaves you stomach and heart in your mouth the whole time as everything unfolds.In some parts its gory and you do see dead bodies, some may say this is 'too much' but it isn't, that was how it was there so thats the story that should be told. It was devastating but real. Very real. This is not a feel good film and even though the families story is amazingly impossible, there is no good ending to this as for every amazing survival story there is a heartbreaking notion that roughly 230, 000 lost their lives. The main focus was on this families story which was exactly the right thing to do but I believe it shows enough of glimpses of other peoples stories and horrific images to show how tragic it really was out there. I came away thinking of this amazing family but also of all those who had a very different story to tell. As I feel at the end when they are leaving the devastation to return it was brilliantly captured that although they all survived and more thankful for this than they could put into words, their faces also showed their lives would never be the same again, this would live with them forever.I watch lots of films, I enjoy lots of different genres but I can honestly say no film has ever made me feel the way this film did both at the time and still a day later as I write this.That in itself proves this is a must-see film. It feels real. It was real and you will not forget it.",The Impossible

I felt especially bad for the mom, because I am a mom myself, and would have gone crazy with worry if this had happened to me.If you like natural disaster movies and you like a little suspense and are not too faint at heart, I recommend you watch this. And best of all, it has a good ending.I would like to see more of this type of movie, it keeps you glued to the end and it (for me) had a good amount of suspense in it. Cant believe that it is a true story though, with everything this family had to go through. It makes you appreciate your own life more!

I have watched a new movie everyday for the past two years, i do not consider myself a critic or talk badly about any film. I simply give my opinion, i do not hate. Too many reviewers on this website strictly write reviews just to hate. I'm gonna be the guy who tells you that your wrong. Every movie has a spark in every movie goers heart. Whether its the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the special effects etc... You critics should find the good in every movie instead of focusing on the things you hate. This move first and foremost may not win best picture, it may not be an 8.0, it may not be accurate, but what it is, is inspirational. This film moved me like no other, and to argue such stupid things as financial status is repulsive. Do people honestly think that having a deep bank account helps you when your faced with a Tsunami? Does having money make you swim better? IMDb is riddled with negative couch- potatos talking down on other peoples work. Work hard and do it for yourself.

434,neilsim-arsenal,Horrific and moving but leaves a bad taste.,6,11 January 2013,"As a movie, this film is both frightening and moving. The scenes involving the tsunami itself are absolutely devastating. I'm not a fan of movies that rely on special effects, but in this case they are the most horrifying since the opening scenes of 'Saving Private Ryan.' You could never recreate the true horror of being there, but this is probably as close as you could get.So, why has it left a bad taste? Firstly, I must say the makers did put the Thais in a good light as friendly, helpful people. This is actually true. They can seem shy, even aloof at times, but in a crisis they are the best people to have around. I was not living here during the tsunami but I was here for the great flood of 2011 and the Thai people were absolutely fantastic in every way. An old lady rescued my family and I in a boat from our house so I have first hand experience.So, I really was hoping for a movie that showed the difference between the rich on holiday and how they got treated and the poor who lost everything and had no medical insurance.Some westerners did suffer terribly and many died, but it was a small amount compared to the thousands of Thais who lived in ram shackled housing.This movie is good, but it could have been great by showing the effects on western families on holiday, the rescue services (including the locals, although that was touched on a little but not enough) and the Thai community and the response of the authorities.The movie turns into a 90 minute 'disaster movie' instead of the 3 hour epic it could have been.",The Impossible

Without doubt this site is the most reliable source for honest film reviews and in my opinion anything rated 7 or above is well worth watching. Until now that is. This film, currently rated a whopping 7.7 is in fact unbelievably bad. Like you would not believe. And right from the off. Wooden acting from McGregor and Watts is simply terrible, throughout. Either I must be missing something, give the startling reviews, or, more likely the reviews are based on sentiment given the tragic loss of life from recent tsunamis. The story line is also highly implausible. How is it that first class actors and a director with at least one excellent film to his name (Orphanage) can be happy with this production? Given the basis of the story it can't not be nominated for any awards. But it ain't gonna win any, and thats for sure.",The Impossible
436,mel-582-138004,What people are forgetting...,8,15 January 2013,"... the film is BASED on a true family. Just because they are a white British family who have travel insurance (which everyone tends to get when they go on holiday) doesn't mean that the film is a LIE. Has it crossed your minds that the Spanish family may have been just as well off and also got travel insurance?? In my opinion, as long as the actors represent a true feeling and represented the family it is based on in a good way regardless of what race they are, THATS what makes a film good. Geeeez...And as for those wanting a film about all the Thai people who suffered terribly during this time, please do not see the film as this is solely about ONE family events. This is THE only family in which the film delves in. Please remember this is about a family's experience and events during the tsunami in Thailand, not a factual documentary.As for the film itself, I thought the VFX was absolutely out of the world.

Family.Just be prepared for the intense emotions this film will bring out of you. I absolutely wept through most of the movie. Here's a great line (among many from critics reviews): A sensory overload of emotion and spectacle, The Impossible is a disaster movie much, much better than the usual overblown fare pumped out by Hollywood.It's like you are THERE, experiencing this horrific disaster with them-- especially as the mother and son are swept along, trying desperately to get to one another. The 10 minute scene of the tsunami alone took a year to shoot. It's powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional, incredibly touching, and oftentimes raw.

442,agnieszkamoody,Mumsy stuff at its best,8,20 January 2013,"My kind of film. About a brilliant and loving mummy with three adorable sons - Lucas an adolescent on the verge of his first exam into manhood plus two gorgeous little'uns 7 and 5 year old. They arrive at this amazingly idyllic resort in Thailand for their Christmas holiday. A happy affluent western white family in love. There is a slight worry whether Dad is going to keep his job in Japan but Maria is a doctor so she can always go back to work in England. A cute scene shot like a home movie from Dad's p.o.v. to records the Christmas morning and the excitement of the presents.Tsunami comes to them as they are in the pool overlooking the beach. Good effects and photography but sound is best. The first hour of the story is the surviving mum and Lucas. First they are still in the fast moving water very precarious with lots of dangerous objects and debris in it. They almost die even though they survived the wave itself. Then they manage to get back to the shore. She is badly hurt a big slice of her leg is hanging off on the back of her knee, it makes the boy wheezy. They rescue a little Daniel perhaps 4 y. o. who is screaming for help in the surrounding solitude. They climb a tree to rest on it and then are rescued by the locals and taken to a hospital. The hospital: mayhem of course. Mum is treated but in a bad shape. She tells Lucas to make himself useful and he runs around the hospital helping people find each other. When he gets back to her - she's gone and it all looks like she's died.Cut to father who survived (we find out one hour into the film) which no harm but for a blood shot eye. Soon after we also know that the two little ones are unscathed. He sends them to the safety somewhere in the mountains so he can stay and look for Maria and Lucas ,futile as it may seem. He must make a heart breaking phone call to his parents to promise them he'll not give up looking for his wife and son.At the hospital Lucas is asked to identify a few objects left behind by his mum but he is unsure - it turns out that Mum is alive, the paperwork got muddled up but she is not dead! At that time the Dad arrives at that hospital and spots Lucas and then the little ones and they all go to Mum. Mum's really poorly and still might die but how could she now knowing that, unbelievably, all her family are there to support her. She goes into the surgery and only now we see the more detailed beautifully sh0wn - lots of very slow motion - account of what's happened to her UNDER WATER until the first triumphant gasp for air above water. Quite powerful stuff.A really beautiful scene with Geraldine Chaplin - the little'uns are sitting in the camp at night all by themselves and an old lady comes to sit with them. They look at the stars and they comment on their light coming through to us even though the stars may be long dead. The little boy asks 'can we tell which stars are dead and which aren't' and the old lady explains that we can't.Really fine child acting: Tom Holland - i see a tremendous future for him and look forward to seeing him more. Finally a Spanish film that looks like a Hollywood production - what's not to like?",The Impossible
443,filmblogeffect,The Impossible Review,9,28 January 2013,"Based on a true story of a family swept apart by natures most fierce. Starring Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, a couple and their family embark on what would be their biggest adventure yet. The mass destruction in which the tsunami left and the sheer madness that arose the couple and their children start The Impossible task to find one another.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) take their three sons on holiday to a remote area on the coastal region of Thailand. As December 26th 2004 arrives, the family go out to play around the pool, that is where all fun and games were going to come to an end and the sheer roar from the incoming tidal wave sent shock-waves down everybody's spines, a huge black wall of water sweeps her and her family as well as other holiday goers off their feet and into the abyss. A family separated by a tragic circumstance but somehow reunited as one.The film conjured some very interesting and effective camera shots. There is a particular scene in which the camera focuses on Maria from a wide angle to establish the type of danger that she is in, this is followed by a close up of her struggling face, this together emphasize on the sheer size of this catastrophe. Another really nice camera shot is when Maria is emerging out the water and there is somewhat of a glow around her which forms an angelic type of shot which maybe suggests a miracle as occurred a better still, she is alive.This story through visuals and powering script is a basic story told in an absolutely brilliant way. Of course a challenging aspect to this movie was making the tsunami and effects look as really as possible and with the aid of top CGI artists, Antonio Lado (The Expendables 2, The others) and his team of FX artists. All came together to create possibly one of the most realistic and believable natural disasters to appear on the cinema screen. You will feel completely submerged into the tsunami itself as the camera bobs in and out of the water and by the way the waves have been rendered and how it fits within the scene. As well as the sheer roar that comes with the wave, altogether creates a very unnerving atmosphere; one that no man would like to be a part of.As the wave seemingly calms Maria and one of her sons are reunited, it takes around 30 minutes before we actually know whether Henry had survived the tragic event along with the other two sons. However, a further wave hits which lead us wondering whether any of the family had survived, surely not I hear you say, not after two huge waves hit the coastal region of Thailand. This adds to the suspense and the continuing question as to what happened to them. This in my opinion reflects on how strong and emotionally telling this film and story is and it really emphasizes on the true meanings of family.Lucas (Tom Holland) makes his feature film debut and he surprised a lot of people. He surprised in a very good way and he really held himself in this film. Throughout the film you see him mature from playing with his new toys which shows his child like behaviors to incredibly saving his mother's life, as he does so he meets lost children and possibility he may lose his mum, he tries to do everything that will make her proud within what could be her final hours.Overall this film sends you on an emotional roller-coaster, this is what invests the audience and this is what the audience pay their money for. This brilliantly crafted master piece from J.A.Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez, they immersed me into an event which I never wish to happen to myself or anybody for that matter. This film showed me what it would be like as realistically as possible to be involved in such a horrific event albeit one families views out of the 300,000 people who unfortunately aren't with us anymore.One of the most outstanding pictures of the year!Go and see it people!",The Impossible

The viewer is left to wince in pain at every gory detail as the vacationers deal selfishly with the disaster.Characters are occasionally heroic, but usually stupid, and always end up in ridiculously convenient situations. Almost nothing is learned about the multitudes of real people who were affected by this tragedy.There is only one scene worth watching... where the husband borrows a cell phone.

I recommend it and give it a ten out of ten. One of the best movies i have ever seen. It leaves you wondering for hours afterwards. This is a must see movie, an iconic film of this generation, and it really knows how to raise sympathy. It shows you how destructive tsunamis are and opens your eyes to the lives lost.

He is a very talented young actor and definitely has a bright future in this industry.

It is set in beautiful resort in Thailand which the family escape to from Japan for Christmas.I think it shows how some people dealt with the trauma, and shows it in a life-like manner. You follow each breath of the survivors, and it is easy to see yourself as one of the characters in the way it has been filmed.

My point is here that my film diet is varied, and it is not some genre bias.What is most difficult to fathom is the immensely strong 7.6 rating, many thousands of voters.

Eventually, when the film ended I simply hated myself for glorifying such self-centered middle-class rubbish. Basically, this is the story a rich white family that lost their luggage and had to search for each other for a couple of days to then fly away in a private jet arranged by their insurance company. After the film I decided to document myself a little further, hoping to be wrong about the whole thing and watched, amongst other footage, an interview with the mother of the actual family. This only confirmed what I suspected. The part of the interview that did it for me is when the mother recalls the following: The film was shot during dry season and yet it was raining a lot and the director was getting restless because of this. The mother spoke to the director and told him that it was OK, that he did not have to worry, all that rain were the hundreds of thousand of tsunami victims crying.

I knew little to nothing about the movie before watching it and I think that is the best way to go into this movie. I encourage anyone to give this movie a look as I feel you will not be disappointed. The Impossible was a hit overseas but for some reason American audiences didn't connect with it or it got overlooked. I have shown this movie to most of my family and a bunch of friends and they have all had the same overwhelming reaction that it was an amazing movie and one of the best films they have seen in a long time.My older brother who is a huge movie buff had never heard of this movie. When he told me that, I was kind of in shock. How did I come across such a gem of a movie that he and never heard of. I watched it with him and he was captivated from beginning to end. When the movie was over he actually felt ashamed that he had never heard of it and didn't know how it had not won the Oscar for best picture. He then began to research who the director and writer was so he could see what else they have done and watch that.I know you don't know my brother, but if you did you would know that he doesn't just take that big of an interest in anyone. He saw a gifted writing and amazing direction and wanted to know what else was out there that he could watch from the writer or director. FYI the director made a movie call The Orphanage which I haven't seen yet but plan on it very soon. Do yourself a favor, give The Impossible a look. You will not be disappointed.",The Impossible

I was one of the lucky few that escaped with my life from the Tsunami, sadly my partner was not. I was therefore unsure whether I wanted to watch a film that would depict the day in which my life changed forever. I am, however, extremely pleased that I did as what I have just watched was an extremely powerful, moving and sympathetic film. I would however like to highlight the ignorance of one such reviewer, ""yipiha"" posted on 18 Dec 2013....Running away in silence is somewhat out of the question.... Oh how I would have loved it if I was able to run away or not scream! When the Tsunami hit where I was staying, I had about 5 secs to try and understand what this huge black wall rapidly approaching actually was. It was traveling at 500 mph and was 20 foot high so the actual impact was similar to having been hit by a jet plane. After saving themselves, the mother and eldest boy climb a tree. Why? Well I would have thought this was self-explanatory.... Having just been hit by a huge wave and not understanding what a tsunami was (I mean how many people honestly knew what a tsunami was until it happened), everyone that I encountered didn't know whether there would be another one so we all scrambled to the highest point possible, whether that be up a tree, up a mountain or onto the roof of a hotel until we were certain that there were no more waves, in my case this was almost 24 hours.The oldest son loses his mother twice in the hospital... This highlighted the fact that the hospitals were totally ill-equipped to cope with a disaster of this magnitude. During those first 48 hours after being rescued, I was twice taken down to the mortuary to identify a body (neither of which were my partner). I was then found by my father who had traveled to Phuket when he had heard what happened, where he saw on one of the hundreds of missing people boards that I had been found and was in hospital in Phuket, when I was actually in hospital in Krabi some 100 miles away. There was total confusion everywhere as the authorities tried unsuccessfully to keep a hand on what was going on. With over 5500 confirmed dead, 8000 reportedly missing and over 10,000 injured in Thailand alone, surely you can imagine the chaos that was going on.I could go on but I feel I have made my point. Yes, I think it was still too soon for a film to be made of this disaster and be portrayed as ""entertainment"", but I also think that it was done with the utmost respect to those that did lose their husbands/wives/families. The reality of the situation really hit home and I have since urged all those around me to see it as I believe it is the most accurate portrayal of what actually happened I have ever seen.",The Impossible

Not sure why a director thinks constant close ups makes for a good movie. The close ups become distracting and the constant moving between people's faces make the picture seem shaky. Secondly the close ups take away from the bigger picture of what is happening. The acting seemed realistic and even with the photographic shortfall gave you a good sense of what the catastrophe must have been like. The hospital scenes provided a real depiction of what it must be like in Thailand. The kids did a great job and really conveyed they were a family. Save for the photography this could of been a great movie.",The Impossible
461,amyllast,The accuracy of the disaster depicted,9,17 February 2020,"The Impossible is based off a true story about a family who survived a devastating tsunami originating in the Indian Ocean. The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian coast and hit several countries around the Indian Ocean, including Thailand where this family was visiting on vacation. This disaster occurred on the 26th of December in 2004 and it killed over 230,000 people. The movie opens with a family of five enjoying a vacation at a resort in Thailand. While the mother was reading a book by the pool and the father and their three sons were playing in the swimming pool, their environment suddenly began to change at an alarmingly quick rate. The wind began to get stronger; the electricity went out and people began to hear unnerving sounds of creaking and whooshing. Birds were flying away from the shore, the ground began to shake lightly, the sounds they once heard were followed by crashing and screams. Trees began to fall as a wave taller than the resort came rushing towards them. The people had only seconds to react to what was coming, a tsunami. The wave immersed the resort, destroyed the houses, and swept people away; and it wasn't going to be the last wave. This movie follows the story of the family's survival and journey to find each other amidst the natural disaster.
The Impossible is a great representation of tsunamis and what it is like to go through one. One of the best things about the direction of this movie is the pace in which the tsunami events happened. Back in 2004, the Indian Ocean did not have a tsunami warning system, so the waves caught most people by surprise. In fact, I'm not even sure anyone mentioned the word ""tsunami"" in the movie, so it is quite possible that the tourists, and perhaps some residents, lacked the proper knowledge of tsunamis, including warning signs and safety procedures. In the film, one of the sons, Lucas, is seen standing by the pool staring at the wave as it approached them until he finally dove into the swimming pool. In footage of the real-life Indonesian tsunami you can see people who are entranced by the approaching wave, people who just stood there and watched it, not knowing the destruction it was about to bring. It seems that this is what Lucas was going through; he was in shock and didn't know what to do with himself for several seconds, which, during a tsunami, count for everything.
Later on in the film the father sends his sons to the mountains after he has met other survivors who are trying to get to a safe place. This is recommended safety protocol for when a tsunami is about to strike. Unfortunately, since the family wasn't on the beach, they weren't able to witness the receding shoreline that signals a tsunami. Scientists say that after the shore quickly draws back, you roughly have about five minutes to get clear of the shoreline. But there were other warning signs in the movie that were a little more subtle. The shaking was a good indicator for an earthquake and the noises that they were hearing were also accurate of the noises you would experience. Animals have also been reported to act strangely when natural disaster is near. They become anxious and move inland. People must be informed that tsunamis are not limited to just a singular wave, but more commonly come in a series of waves. In the film, there were two large waves that devastated the area and carried cars and massive amounts of dangerous debris inland. When a tsunami hits the shore, it starts mixing with everything it hits; it becomes a mixture of water, dirt, sand, garbage, cars, wood, metal, glass, etc. and it travels at around 30-45 mph on land. It is extremely difficult to survive in these waves. And when you get wounded, this water is going to go into your wounds and bacteria will infect them and you are more likely to attract a parasite, which is what I believe the mother coughed up in the hospital. Lastly, the emotional toll that a tsunami takes on the people affected by it, is immense and this movie hits that on the nail. When that wave hits, you are torn apart from everything and everyone if you are caught in the crossfire. If you are ever caught in the wave, it is best to do as the family did-cling for your life. Whether it be to a tree or a floating piece of debris or a part of a building, it is best to hold onto debris because there is no swimming in a tsunami. Overall, I would say that this movie very accurately depicts tsunami events.",The Impossible

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. The second time I watched it, I was focused on the strength of the mother and, in particular, the oldest son, Lucas. He was still a child but held it together with remarkable strength. This showed through at the very end of the movie, which I will not explain because it will ruin it for those yet to see it. His character was one of heart, of real emotions as was Ewan McGregor's character. The tears were so real, the pain so great for this family-- one of many who were killed, injured, traumatized and whose lives were totally altered by the experience. Ironically, several decades ago, I had a dream about waves as tall as buildings going straight up and straight down while I sat on the beach with friends.

464,waynecarr-26827,None Really,9,20 October 2015,"I saw this for the first time last night and it had a terrible effect on me. Let me explain. My wife had been badgering me for years to visit India. She was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin and had always wanted to visit her 'home' country. After many years I finally agreed and duly we booked a two week holiday with our children (14 and 20 at the time) in Kerala in a hotel a few miles north of Kovalam. The flight was awful but I kept thinking of the idyllic time we would spend on the beach. On our second or third day we booked a three day trip to visit the backwaters and the hills (Periyar) and set off three days before Christmas day. After a good trip we arrived back at the hotel late on Christmas Day. My wife said that we would get up early the next day to visit the sacred Hindu site of Kanyakumari. We woke up well after 8am the next morning and my wife said that she was exhausted from our previous trip. Perhaps we should just go down and have a leisurely breakfast and then lounge by the pool. I agreed and so did the 'kids'. We ended up by the pool, a stone's throw from the sea at about 9.30. It was hot and after a while my wife said she would go and get some cold drinks after a wander along the beach. About fifteen minutes later she came back and said 'Have you heard the news ? There's been a tsunami and people have had to be pulled from the water'. A thousand questions followed 'Where, when, should we move ?'. I was sceptical. We would have been dead if a tsunami had hit. News filtered in, in dribs and drabs and slowly the immensity of the catastrophe began to sink in. We were prevented from going onto the beach and the stories began to circulate about how tide had gone out for a long way at Kovalam beach and the police had had to order people off the beach. Later that night we walked along the part of the hotel where it met the beach and two old ladies that we had become acquainted with were sitting sipping G&Ts. We asked what they had done that day and had they heard the news? Yes, they had been on their way to Kanyakumari and their taxi had broken down. When they arrived, they were in a line of hundreds queuing for the boats to take them across to them temple. They witnessed first hand the immense waves sweep hundreds to their deaths and the shock, no traumatized, onlookers realizing that their loved ones had been killed. large families had been split up due to the numbers able to be taken at a time by the boats. The next day I spoke to a honeymoon couple who were on a 'safari', on their way down to beach when the lead vehicle had spotted something wrong and had had the presence of mind to turn the convoy around, thus saving many lives. What impacted me the most was the randomness of the event. Some were killed yet some were spared. Two hundred had died in the backwaters where we had been to on the previous trip and fifteen hundred plus had been at Kanyakumari on that terrible day. Mothers, Fathers, sisters, brothers and so on had died that day and yet we had not even noticed the event on our beach or in our hotel. For several years after, I could not come to terms with this and even avoided watching any news related to it. Then the other night I saw this film for the first time and it was too much to bear. I cannot adequately explain my feelings and my sorrow at the deaths of so many. There is not even the anger at being able to say they could have been avoided. I feel helpless and insignificant. I don't have anxiety or nightmares, I only feel empty. It's what my soldier father used to call 'dead man walking'. He said many soldiers felt it after a battle having survived, while many of their comrades died. Not being able to comprehend why some had died, but they had survived. Perhaps this is it.

After yelling and yelling mother and son names around 50 times, comes the emotion, more emotion, and lot more emotion. The movie goes very fast to hokum and starting to be irritating. All people around the family just seemed sadly or unconcernedly wandering / sitting / lying figures, nothing else. The script was not more than 1 page.

Naomi Watts takes on a challenging role and she really embraced it, impeccable acting. But it's worth noting that the real star of the movie is newcomer Tom Holland, as Watt's son in the film. His acting is so natural which manages to immerse you in the film led by a great script and great director. He managed to project that feeling of anger, sadness and helplessness throughout the struggle with his mother in the hospital.This is a tear jerker.. at least for me it was. It's one of those rare films that come along bringing back the 'movie magic'. The realism of the tsunami and destruction kept me in awe throughout the whole film. I would really say it has indeed earned it's share of Academy Award nominations - especially for sound editing and mixing. I never really pay attention to the sound quality in much films but in this one (also because of it's nature) it really outshines.I really wished there would have been more character development though before the disaster. Because of this, I really couldn't connect with the characters as much as I wanted to.

471,orhnolivia,J.A.Bayona and Sergio G. Sanchez make The Impossible Possible,9,21 February 2017,"This film told the story of a family that lived through the deadly Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami of 2004 that struck fourteen countries - one of them being Thailand, where this story takes place. It hit the day after Christmas without warning, killing and injuring many. From the exceptional acting to the life like scenes, this film was able to draw the audience in and make them feel as if they were experiencing the disaster first-hand. Within the first 20 minutes, producers J.A. Bayona and Sergio G. Sanchez caught my attention. They started the plot off with a seemingly happy family, who is excited to be leaving for a Christmas vacation. After they arrived at their destination in Thailand, the plot twists and the tsunami hits the resort at which they are staying. At this point the whole movie changes as the family is separated and hurt due to the disaster that struck. They are now fighting for their lives while trying to be reunited. Before the tsunami scene, there wasn't much to the film. After and during, however; the film completely changed and kept me engaged and wanting to know what would happen next. Overall I think that the film and filmmakers did an excellent job at recreating such a devastating event, especially how it affected one family in particular. They showed the daily struggles that the family faced during the days following, while also showing how the locals coped. Remaking scenes that almost seem impossible to recreate. This made the film more credible and interesting. During the tsunami scene, it seemed as if a real tsunami was there, not a fake one used for filming. From the rumbling, shaking, and sudden quietness, to the sheer terror on peoples' faces as a giant wall of water hit the resort along with the running and yelling of people as they began to realize what was happening. From that scene on, it was everything that I imagined it would be. The drowning scene made me feel as if I was actually drowning. The occasional black out of the screen helped with the effects too – it was like a screen of death and made me wonder if they were actually dying. The acting by Naomi Watts, Ewan McGreggor, and Tom Holland throughout the film was exceptional. From the beginning when the tsunami first struck and the family was separated and injured, while they were struggling to stay alive and find each other, to the end when they were reunited. They brought real, raw emotions to the screen that made it seem as if it were actually real. This film is sure to leave you feeling emotional. It has you hoping for the best, but also knowing that it might get worse. It makes you want to hug your family and remind them of how much you love them. All-in-all I thought that this film was really good and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thriller drama and wants to shed a few tears.",The Impossible
