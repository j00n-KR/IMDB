0,MartinHafer,Give me an icepick--I'd rather gouge out my eyes than see this AGAIN!,1,25 May 2005,"Other than Babe: Pig in the City and Santa Clause Conquers the Martians, I can't think of a more detestable kids pic than this. I hated Jim Carey and I hate Dr. Seuss' widow for authorizing this pile of #@@%!!! AND THEN SAYING ""This is exactly the sort of film my husband would have made"". Yeah, well maybe after he had an aneurysm!! Come on, lady. Just be truthful and instead say ""it's dog drool and the Doc is spinning in his grave like a rotisserie--BUT MAN WILL YA' LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THEY GAVE ME?!?!?!??"".I base this on the basic fact that the entire message of the book and wonderful TV special is: The GRINCH HATES XMAS and the People of Whoville know the REAL reason and joy of the holiday. Now with this crappy movie it's: The Grinch rightfully hates XMAS because it's been over-commercialized by the selfish people of Whoville. Huh?!?!?! This is the complete OPPOSITE of Seuss' vision and his widow has the nerve to say it was what HE wanted?!?! This was the most overblown and over-hyped movie. With $10000000000000 dollars spent on advertising and marketing (and $6.79 for writing), it's no wonder the movie made money!!! Kids can't help but see Grinch paraphernalia EVERYWHERE and demand to see the movie. BUT, to the parents of Planet Earth we have a solution to movies like this---Tell your kids NO!!!!! Then take them for a walk or go fishing or beat each other senseless with tire irons--it would STILL be better than going to see bloated MEGA-crap like this!UPDATE: I have an Italian friend who likes the film. When we talked about it, I understood why. He had never read the book nor seen the wonderful cartoon versions--and the message in them is the exact opposite of this movie. So, if you haven't seen the cartoon or read the book, this could be a nice film to watch....but if you HAVE and loved them like I did as a child, the film is an insult.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
1,TheLittleSongbird,5.6??? Sorry but I thought the film was surprisingly good!,8,9 September 2009,"Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
2,SnoopyStyle,"Not Who, Not What, but Why?",6,24 December 2013,"With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works. Nothing can change that.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
3,Hitchcoc,Just Another Christmas Movie,6,1 December 2015,"Jim Carrey is really fun, though his canon does include some clunkers. I really wanted to like this film, but with all the bells and whistles and Carrey's mugging, it just got dull. Because it is from the Grinch's perspective, the events seem cruel. The humor is juvenile and unoriginal. It has that anything-for-a-laugh being to it. What carries it to a point is that it is a good story. But it is not enough. I guess when someone does a sequel, even if it is a feature film updating a cartoon, it needs to take it to the next level, to put some new and original spin on it. I'm not even saying it's terrible; I give it a six. But a few days after seeing it, I really took nothing with me.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
4,mark.waltz,Roast beast? Roast ham for Jim.,5,22 December 2020,"During his heyday as a comic film star, it was expected that a Jim Carey movie would be over-the-top with his antics, especially if he was playing a milquetoast character who suddenly got some gumption to stop being picked on. With ""The Grinch"" and ""The Mask"", Carey went overboard with the antics, reminding me of that attention seeking kid who could break people up laughing with their silly faces and funny voices but never knew when to stop. In other words, he's perfect for roles like this, yet after a while it can become pretty tiring.As the Grinch, he gives an over cafineated performance, frenetic and sly, barely stopping to get a breath. Of course a lot of that is in the makeup and costume, special effects and the editing, but no one else in 2000 could play that role. This isn't the quiet menace of the Boris Karloff cartoon but something a lot more complex, some of which works and some of which can be eye rolling.The direction by Ron Howard is decent but there's so much going on that you may feel forced to watch it every other Christmas or so to gather it all up. It's beautiful to look at and often funny (especially his love of raw onions), but there's a bit of cloying nonsense with the character of Cindy Lou Who, unfortunately not always easy to understand, especially when she sings.Bill Irwin, Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor provide a few of the familiar faces with Anthony Hopkins almost sounding like Karloff. This must have been a magical set to see for the first time for those involved, and certainly the first viewing can bring on a lot of ooh's and ah's. The town of Whoville though isn't presented as the perfect Christmas town even though it's obvious their favorite holiday. Certain individuals are grinches in their own right. Not bad for an occasional viewing (my third in 20 years), but not one I'd make a Christmas tradition.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
5,kosmasp,To Grinch or not to Grinch,6,28 November 2020,"For anyone not enamoured by the spirit of Christmas, they will understand the cynic in disguise. Or you can just call him Grinch. Jim Carey gives out quite the performance as a villain/good guy. He kept the latter for his Sonic performance I watched recently. I watched this back to back with the newer Grinch (and saw on imdb there is another Grinch movie with Bela Lugosi? Another one for the have to watch someday list) and it made it obvious that this is not as good as the newer version - at least to me.Having said all that, the movie is still funny and just for Carey it really is more than worthwhile. I guess some watch it every year, so depending how your emotional connection to it is ... otherwise I'd suggest go with the new and entirely animated one.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
6,gavin6942,A Refreshing Christmas Tale,7,27 December 2012,"Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things (""Gossip Girl"") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
7,jboothmillard,The Grinch,8,15 March 2005,"This was the second version of the famous story by Dr. Suess, following the 1966 Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon, a big-budget live action adaptation, produced by Brian Grazer, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind). Basically the Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, everyone is excited to be buying gifts, decorations and food. Seven-year-old Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) feels however everyone is missing the point about Christmas, going overboard with festive items, rather than personal relationships. While on top of Mount Crumpit lives the hairy, green creature the Grinch (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey), he is feared by all the townspeople, he has a heart two sizes too small, and he really hates Christmas. Cindy Lou encounters the Grinch when he comes down the mountain into town to create trouble in the Post Office, she is initially scared, until he reluctantly saves her from being crushed in a packaging machine. She becomes curious about the Grinch, and asks townspeople about his history, she asks many people in town what they know about him. The Grinch had a tragic past, as a baby he was adopted by two spinsters, he showed sadistic tendencies as a child, but was not cruel as he would later become. In school, the eight-year-old Grinch (Josh Ryan Evans) had a crush on classmate Martha May Whovier (Landry Allbright), but his rival Augustus May Who (Ben Bookbinder) teased him about his hairiness. One year, the Grinch makes Martha a gift, he also attempts to shave his face, the next day his classmates laugh at him for his face cuts, he loses his temper, destroys the gift and trashes the classroom, and exiled himself to the top of Mount Crumpit, never to be seen again. Touched by this story, Cindy Lou decides to nominate the Grinch to be the Christmas Whobilation ""Holiday Cheermeister"", to the displeasure of Augustus May Who, now the mayor of Whoville. She climbs to the top of Mount Crumpit and invites the Grinch to the Whobilation, he initially declines, but reconsiders hearing about an award, and that Martha May (Christine Baranski) will be at the celebration. As Cheermeister, the Grinch endures wearing an ugly sweater and judging all the Whos' Christmas food concoctions, but he enjoys being unsportsmanlike and beating children in the competitions. The Mayor reminds the Grinch of his childhood humiliation, giving him an electric shaver as a present, and publicly proposing marriage to Martha May, and offering her a new car on the side. In response, the Grinch berates the Whos about the Christmas festivities, saying it is all about the gifts, most will end up in the garbage which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He proceeds to ruin the party, burning down the town Christmas tree and causing chaos. Cindy Lou is shamed by the Mayor, but the Whos have a spare tree, which they put up after the Grinch leaves. The Grinch wants Christmas to end once and for all, it is when he sees his dog Max (Kelley, voiced by Frank Welker) with snow on his face, like the beard of Santa Claus, he gets a wonderful, awful idea. He concocts a plan to steal all the Christmas presents, decorations and food from the Whos, he creates a Santa Claus suit and hat, building a powered sleigh, and sticking an antler on Max's head to become a reindeer. The first house the Grinch goes to is Cindy Lou's house, she catches him as he is stealing the Christmas tree, but he lies to her, as Santa, that he is taking it to be fixed at his workshop. The Grinch continues house to house stealing everything Christmassy, packing it into a bag in the back of the sleigh, and gets it back to the top of Mount Crumpit, ready to dump it. The Grinch listens out for the cries of the Whos when they wake up on Christmas morning, the Mayor blames Cindy Lou for what the Grinch has done, but her father Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin) defends her, saying that Christmas is not all about the gifts, it is about family. Before the Grinch pushes the sleigh of Christmas goods off the edge of the cliff, he hears the happy singing of the Whos, he is puzzled that he has not stopped Christmas from coming. Then he realises, Christmas means more than judt what comes from a store, it means a little bit more, and in this moment, his heart grows three sizes. He sees the sleigh is about to fall from the mountain, he is unable to stop it, but then he sees Cindy Lou on top of the load, this motivates him to save not just the gifts but a life, he finds the strength to lift the sleigh. The Grinch and Cindy Lou ride the sleigh back to town to return the gifts, the Grinch confesses to stealing Christmas and apologises, surrendering himself to the police. Officer Wholihan (Jim Meskimen) lets him go, and Martha May turns down the Mayor's proposal, handing back his diamond ring, as heart belongs to the Grinch. In the end, the Grinch joins Cindy Lou and all the Whos in a singalong, and he has the honour of carving the roast beast for the large feast. Narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins, also starring Molly Shannon as Betty Lou Who, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Whobris, Mindy Sterling as Clarnella, Rachel Winfree as Rose, Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Elderly Timekeeper, Jeremy Howard as Drew Lou Who, T.J. Thyne as Stu Lou Who, Deep Roy as Post Office Clerk, Rain Pryor (Richard's daughter) as Shopper, Verne Troyer as Band Member, Rick Baker as Puppeteer, Bryce Dallas Howard as Surprised Who and Ron Howard as Whoville Townsperson. Carrey is almost unrecognisable under the makeup as the hairy, green pest, he really laps up being mean and causing havoc, Momsen is cute, and Tambor and Baranski do their parts well, and the narration by Hopkins is nice. It sticks to the basic story of the mountain dweller who hates everything festive and plans to steal it, the extension seeing the lead creature's past, why he hates Christmas and other bits and pieces works, it deserved the awards for brilliant makeup for Carrey in his green getup and everything with their noses, the costumes, sets and props are likeably weird, kooky and colourful, and Carrey sings an amusing version of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", it is dark in moments and might be a little much for children, but you will find yourself laughing a lot, and feel the Christmas spirit, a wondeful seasonal fantasy comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Jim Carrey was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
8,ccthemovieman-1,A Lot Of Fun; Looks Great On DVD,9,4 November 2006,"I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, ""The Grinch"" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. His rhymes are fun to hear.I saw this in the theater, though it was ""fair,"" but on DVD, it was far better. I've seen in three times and it got better each time.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
9,moonspinner55,Christmas mania from inside a Hollywood snowflake...,4,8 December 2007,"Despite the misgivings one may initially have about Hollywood turning the still-satisfying animated TV special from Dr. Seuss' book into a big-budget live-action feature, fear not over the look of the piece. Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show, and one couldn't possibly hope for a better-looking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch, a green, furry, Christmas-hating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville, although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With make-up designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn, distinctive (or likable) personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario, screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic (some may argue, cloying) passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a self-serving jerk, a Christmas lights contest between neighbors, and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening; he becomes exhausted by the material itself--the bombast wears him out--perhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag (particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo, later munching on shattered glass). Bits and pieces work crazy magic, though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining (he's too anxious to be funny). Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion, and there are some marvelous scenes, but interest for adults should wane after the first hour. ** from ****",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
10,Quinoa1984,A fun and psychological look at Dr. Seuss' infamous character,6,17 November 2000,"Dr. Seuss' infamous character (as famous as any Seuss character besides Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham) no comes to the big screen. And I couldn't be happier. Especially because not only does the film team up to great film people- Actor Jim Carrey and producer/director Ron Howard, the makeup effects in this film is the best I've seen in years. It is simply amazing craftwork done on Jim Carrey as he is enveloped in the Grinch caharcter, and even though you can't see him exactly, his personality, voice and soul is shining through at all times. What also attracted me to the movie is that it takes a look at The Grinch in a way that you understand his phsyche. If you were to read the book or watch the 1966 TV cartoon (which was also fun), all you would see is the basics (and or the third act of this film). But in most of the film, we see how the grinch has been transformed into an antihero and how he may be mad outside, but inside, he has a heart (even if it's 2 sizes to small). But the seriousness beside, this film is pure fun. It's consistently funny as we look at Carrey use his grinch to make the audience yuckle up. And it works. A true family film (kids, adults and teens will range from being amused to being convulsed in laughter), this is the film of the season, that is unless Unbreakable passes it.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
11,sunwarrior13,Carrey Is The Grinch,8,2 October 2012,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a family comedy based on book of the same title by Dr. Seuss. It was the first adaption to be a film feature. Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story as the Grinch. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates the story.The film is directed by Ron Howard.He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit.High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas.The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday.If a movie can unleash Jim Carrey at his finest, revamp the Grinch story, and still pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Seuss, you can bet it qualifies as rousing entertainment.It is definitely a joy to watch.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
12,studioAT,"Sorry to be a Grinch, but...",2,5 December 2017,"Ron Howard's big screen version of the beloved Christmas book is one of the few modern Christmas 'classics' (and I use this word loosely) that we have.For me though it's not that great. The visuals are great, the story well adapted, but it didn't do a lot for me.Jim Carrey is given full reign to mug and clown around, with his own brand of humour not always hitting the spot. Christine Baranski is the best of the various supporting players.So, sorry, for me this is not a Christmas classic. Just another fairly average attempt at being one.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
13,Doylenf,"It deserved the ""Razzie"" award for worst script...",5,14 December 2010,"A lot of money was spent in turning this Ron Howard production into a full-length feature with JIM CARREY as ""The Grinch,"" but I'll take the 1966 animated version any day over this overstuffed fantasy.The director obviously gave Carrey license to ""go for it"" with some moments of comedy enough to produce a few chuckles, but Carrey's lack of restraint reaches manic proportions before the film is half over and his sickly green and grotesque make-up is an unappetizing sight to behold in those huge close-ups. The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with ""The Grinch."" Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of ""how"" the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hourThe script rightfully won a ""Razzie"" as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice: If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.Summing up: Not a shred of charm. It's as if ""Opie"" meets Tim Burton.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
14,Bunuel1976,"HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas (Ron Howard, 2000) **1/2",6,29 December 2011,"This is a live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss novella, following the classic 1966 animated short by Chuck Jones (narrated by horror icon Boris Karloff); for the record, I own a copy of both the latter and the earlier Stanley Kramer production of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T (1953) in my collection. This remake, on the other hand, features the voice of a bored-sounding Anthony Hopkins. The Grinch (actually the title of the copy I watched, shown on local TV) is an ideal role for the facial contortions and over-the-top antics of Jim Carrey. He is a hairy creature in the fictional town of Whoville (whose 'normal' inhabitants are elfish in appearance).They love Christmas and celebrate it in grand fashion, but The Grinch does not since he had always been given the cold shoulder at this time of year in view of his unusual appearance. Consequently, he has gone to live by himself in the mountains (attacking occasional trespassers from town) but a little girl feels pity on The Grinch and determines to help him (even carrying out a survey around town to learn what the townsfolk really think of him!). When a prize for the most prominent personality is to be handed out, she nominates The Grinch, even if the Mayor (the latter's arch-enemy and contender for the hand of the town belle) expects it to be given to himself. The girl convinces The Grinch to accept but, when the ceremony turns unpleasant – with the people of Whoville making fun of him a' la The Hunchback Of Notre Dame – he decides to take revenge by disrupting their Christmas festivities (the premise, then, is very similar to the recently-viewed THE Christmas THAT ALMOST WASN'T {1966})!What he does is wear the traditional Santa Claus clothing and, rather than delivering presents as he is supposed to, The Grinch goes round the Whoville houses on Christmas Eve to steal the gifts ready to be opened the next day! However, his triumph is short-lived as the townsfolk realize – once again, thanks to the girl – that Christmas is essentially a time of solidarity but, of course, this being at heart a morality play, The Grinch is himself reformed and finally accepted into the town's fold. Though reasonably engaging (the little girl's sincere portrayal helps a lot in this regard), occasionally funny (for instance, The Grinch dresses his dog like a reindeer on his nefarious expedition!) and undeniably good to look at (highlighted by the imaginative production design of the Whoville locale), this still makes for little more than a kiddie movie. Incidentally, Carrey would later 'star' in that other Yuletide favorite A Christmas CAROL (2009), which I also included in my schedule for this season.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
15,utgard14,Not Fun At All,4,19 December 2013,"Overproduced spectacle that misses the point of the original story and TV special. If you had to do this film (and you didn't) at least get the point of the story right instead of bastardizing Dr. Seuss' message. Jim Carrey is obnoxious and gave me a headache. Taylor Momsen is the best part as Cindy Lou Who, although I miss the adorable two year old from the original. This Cindy Lou is a typical ""smarter than all the grown-ups"" kid like you only see in movies. Still, overly precocious or not, she's one of the few sweet parts of an otherwise charmless film. Garish sets and dark colors are a turn-off. See the original cartoon instead. It will save you a lot of time and you will come away much happier.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
16,Boba_Fett1138,Never quite understood why it isn't liked any better.,8,4 December 2005,"I already loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when it was released and I'm still loving it now, 5 years later. Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.Sure, the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All of the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming truly ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie making at its very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie.Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch.The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.The musical score by James Horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day Horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.Perfect Christmas entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
17,Calicodreamin,A Christmas favorite,8,4 December 2019,"One of my all time favorite Christmas movies.

18,evanston_dad,Atrocious,1,6 December 2006,"Ron Howard, who never met a story he couldn't screw up, takes the delightful holiday cartoon classic and turns it into something gormless, vulgar and awful. The cartoon used imaginative language and iconic animation to create its magical effect. Howard replaces all of that with gaudy art direction and stupid physical humour. The makeup effects are creepy, not cute; the Whovillians are anonymous drones -- and it doesn't help that they look like half pig/half human lab creations. Jim Carrey, who on paper seems like he would be perfect casting, overplays to the hilt, creating exactly the opposite effect to that inspired by the original droll creation of animator Chuck Jones and actor Boris Karloff. The only positive attribute Carrey could have brought to the film, that rubber face with which he could have created any number of comic moments, is buried underneath heaps of prosthetic makeup.This is a foul, terrible movie, and I can't believe that anyone could possibly like it. How it even rated a 5.6 here at IMDb is beyond me.Grade: F",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
19,ferguson-6,It's a Family Affair,8,20 November 2000,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Check out the number of ""Howard"" surnames listed in the credits.  I counted four, but may have missed some. Dedicating the film to his recently deceased mother, Ron Howard was the perfect choice for directing this Dr. Seuss adaptation.  Mr. Howard has a real feel for family relationships and that plays a key part in the theme of the Grinch vs. Who-ville.  Howard, as usual, cast numerous members of his own family in the film.  This includes, the always good for a laugh, brother Clint.  Jim Carrey again proves that he is a tremendous acting talent.  ""The Truman Show"" followed by ""Man on the Moon"" and now this!  We are are blessed to watch such a uniquely talented performer perfect his craft.  If you say the Grinch role required little acting, you are wrong.  Carrey captures the true spirit of the role, and a wide range of emotions, while toting make-up that makes it impossible to recognize him.  My one complaint with the film is the extremely weak version of the Grinch theme song.  Done wonderfully creepy in the original TV special, the song is so light-hearted in the film that it loses the punch it is supposed to pack.  My tidbit on this one is to be sure and catch the Ron Howard parody performed by Jim Carrey as he doffs a ball cap and begins mimmicing the director.

He is rejected from a small village and lives in the mountains. We are never given any back story as to what his parents were like. Instead we are given a lame pelican explanation that just seems tacked on. The villagers also have snouts, which I never fully understood and probably never will. Plot regards his stealing away Christmas and having a change of heart. While it may mirror the classic holiday animation, it still comes off as artificial. Interesting directing choice for Ron Howard who is known for films such as Apollo 13 and The Paper. While his attempt is praise worthy, the payoff is nowhere near as entertaining as the animated film. Jim Carrey is the ideal choice to play the Grinch but without any background, it just comes off as a really good impression. Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor and Molly Shannon are given the embarrassing tasks of sporting snouts and lame lines of dialogue. The Grinch costume passes but art direction is artificial and about as festive as your average toy store. Perhaps the Grinch should have stole the screenplay.

21,Wuchakk,Knock-down-drag-out performance by Jim Carrey,7,25 December 2015,"Released in early 2000, Ron Howard's live-action version of Dr. Seuss' ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" stars Jim Carrey in the eponymous role of a green curmudgeonly monster living on a mountain outside of Whoville. He hates Christmas and has a beef with some of the citizens of the village, like the mayor (Jeffrey Tambor), but little Mary Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) inspires change in his life and the town. Christine Baranski is on hand as a woman in Whoville who has a secret crush on the mean freak.The original 1966 cartoon based on the 1957 book was/is a potent denouncement of the materialistic side of Christmas: After the Grinch steals all the presents, food and decorations in Whoville, he's dumbfounded to discover that it doesn't matter to the villagers as they sing together in jubilation to celebrate the holiday, which profoundly transforms the Grinch.This live-action version severely complicates matters in order to extend the runtime to 3½ times as long. Here, the townspeople are not so one-dimensionally benevolent and we discover why the Grinch is so cantankerous & hateful. Concerning the former, the villagers have to learn a lesson about the meaning of Christmas as well as the green meanie. The theme of 'love conquers all' is driven home with Taylor Momsen standing out as the cute 6 year-old girl. Her performance is so great it's hard to believe that she was only 6 during filming. Interestingly, Taylor went on to launch the hard rock band The Pretty Reckless in 2009.The imaginative Dr. Seuss-inspired sets are as good as could be expected for a live-action version of a cartoon and the beefing-up of the story is interesting while turning off purists, but it's Carrey's over-the-top performance that's most memorable, not to mention quotable. The likable dog, Max, is great as well.The film runs 104 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, University City, California, with some outside photography of Utah.GRADE: B",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Horrible,1,9 February 2004,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period.All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.1/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
23,MovieAddict2016,How the Grinch stole what could have been a good film,4,6 September 2002,"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on the childrens book by Dr. Seuss. In this live action film, Jim Carrey brings to life one of the most beloved stories of our time to the big screen with the direction of Ron Howard. The plot is taken straight from the book with a few creative liberties along the way. Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Who's, A munchkin like species that all love and adore Christmas. Yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty, green creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally loathes. Yet a small child named Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch and teach him what Christmas is really about.  What is probably the most interesting aspect of The Grinch is the cinematography of Whosville that Ron Howard brought to life. It would be very hard to live up to Dr. Seuss' standards in the book, but Whosville itself in this film is basically the only delight you have while watching. Jim Carrey does fit into the Grinch well, but too often we get an Ace Ventura vibe. Now I ask myself even in dramas why Jim Carrey always seems funny, even when he's acting serious, why is this? In the Grinch at times he seems calmed down to a certain degree, but the longer the camera rolls the more he starts to act up and eventually we can just picture Ace walking in that snow instead of the Grinch. One other thing I disliked is that in the cartoon the Grinch never talked much, but in this version all the Grinch does is talk. Of course both these films were taken off the book, but I still think Jim should have shut up half the time instead of rambling and doing wacky and crazy movements (like Ace.) The humor itself consists of only a few funny lines. In one scene the Grinch is sitting looking through his 'schedule' and is saying something like '1:30 Loathe-2:30 Have lunch with myself..I CAN'T cancel that again! 3:30 Feel sorry for myself..' And the scene basically goes on like that. I think that is probably the funniest scene in the film, and if you don't find that funny, you will hate the Grinch. I first saw this film in the theaters and expected too much. Perhaps that is why when I viewed the video release I enjoyed it more. If for some reason you do want to see this film, just don't expect it to be great and you might enjoy it more.  I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're an absolute fan of Dr. Seuss and in your opinion 'must see it.' Other than that, avoid the Grinch's good looks and charm, because there is not much of it in the film. 2/5 starsJOHN ULMER",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
24,sddavis63,The Politically Correct Version,5,9 January 2002,"An adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story, best known from the 1966 animated TV version.It was all right, but I didn't find it to be anything particularly special. Certainly good makeup work. You wouldn't have known that the Grinch was Jim Carrey unless you looked at the credits, and even the Who's were pretty well made up. But it just didn't grab me. The most original part of the story, in fact, truly bothered me.Turns out that the Grinch isn't really a bad guy, after all. He was just a guy who was different and so he got picked on when he was a kid. Please! Give me a break! Why can't the Grinch be just a bad guy? But in our politically correct world, no one can be bad; we have to find ways to make sure that no one is actually responsible for the bad things they do. Thus, the Grinch isn't really responsible for being cranky - the kids who picked on him are. Whatever. The fun part of the TV version was that the Grinch was so absolutely and completely unlikeable. Now, I think we're supposed to feel sorry for him, but I didn't. I just felt kind of sorry that I rented the movie.It wasn't a disaster, but the next time I need a ""Grinch fix"" I think I'll stick with the cartoon.5/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
25,lesleyharris30,"Not a Spectacular Christmas Movie,but Jim Carrey is Undeniably Entertaining,",8,24 December 2014,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a great movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It certainly made a few mistakes with adapting the classic Dr. Seuss book in to a live action movie,there are just certain elements to it that certainly could have been improved upon.It is a film lots of people like to watch at Christmas,and while I'll admit it is a fun movie,it dosen't really put me in to the Christmas cheer the same way movies like Its a Wonderful Life or the Santa Claus do.However,Jim Carrey as the Grinch is certainly a highlight,he's completely unrecognisable in this make up,but the characters personality and mannerisms remind us that it really is him under all that.I remember reading a review by Roger Ebert a few years ago in which he said that this movie focused too much on the meanness of the Grinch,and I would have to agree that this was a problem as we are suppose to feel sympathy for him,but it's hard when all we are seeing is why he's a bad person and seeing very little moments of kindness.It certainly made a few mistakes,but How the Grinch Stole Christmas is still a fun movie that brings the creations of Dr. Seuss to life,and I would recommend it to a family looking for a nice Christmas movie. An evil creature living near the cheery town of Whoville plans to put a stop to Christmas once and for all.

26,CuriosityKilledShawn,Very badly made,1,11 December 2000,"Very, very, very badly made film indeed. Ron Howard's direction is totally wanton and gutless. The cinematographer obviously thought that if the camera went squint for about.99.9999% of the film it would mean that he was being creative. A little note to all: diagonal camera shots do not make good photography. It looks moronically awful.The art and set design is cheap too. Everything is way too close together and cramped looking. You cannot really make anything out at all. And in some shots you can see the roof of the sound-stage. I reckon about $50 in total was spent on production design.Half the film was pointless effects that did nothing for me. They did not make the film look magical. No, they certainly did not. The Whos look really stupid too. What on earth are they supposed to be? They look like the Beagle Boys from Duck Tales. To sum it up in 2 words they look 'totally ridiculous'. In the scene where the Grinch shaves the Mayor's head.why do they start screaming and running away? That whole scene was the worst directing I have ever scene. I know that this is a kid's movie and, believe me, there were many kids in the audience. There were hardly a couple of laughs among them.The type of humor in this film is the kind that expects you to laugh when someone walks into a lamppost or falls into a custard pie. Come on. This is the 21st century and we're STILL getting this trash that passes itself of as a movie?Not even the hugely talented Carrey can save this steaming pile of trash. I don't think anyone could. He simply is NOT funny. You'd think that playing the Grinch would be a role he could twist and manipulate. But no, it's a kiddie's movie. So he just acts stupid without being funny. The cartoon is way better. I suggest you watch that instead.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

28,vincentlynch-moonoi,A unique gift from Ron Howard...brilliant,8,22 December 2015,"I rarely review a film that has more than 100 reviewers, but I'm going to make an exception here.I think it's brilliant! Most who really like it give the highest marks to Jim Carrey. But I'm going to give most of the credit to Ron Howard. It occurred to me while watching this that Ron Howard is one director who has contributed an unusually diverse body of work to American cinema. Everything from ""Cocoon"" to ""Willow"" to ""Parenthood"" to ""Backdraft"" to ""Far And Away"" to ""Apollo 13"" to ""A Beautiful Mind"" to ""The Davinci Code"" to ""Frost/Nixon"" to his current tale about ""Moby Dick"". The question with the Grinch film was how to make it relevant to adults, while still keeping the moral of the Suess story..and although it's nothing like the book, it does maintain that moral.And then there's Jim Carrey. Who else could have handled this role? No one. I couldn't help but wonder how much of his performance was scripted and how much was ad-lib.The special effects -- absolutely outstanding. The makeup -- remarkable. And all wrapped up in a film that is truly unique.I was interested to seen Christine Baranski (""The Good Wife"") here. Somehow I missed that Anthony Hopkins was narrator.For balance, watch this film, George C. Scott's ""A Christmas Carol"" and Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"".",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
29,ironhorse_iv,"Don't be a Grinch! This live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale by Dr. Seuss, wasn't that bad.",6,23 December 2014,"I can understand, why certain people might dislike this film. I agree that the live-action film didn't really needed to be made, and that the film will never outdo the original 1966's TV animation movie. Still, this movie directed by Ron Howard is not as bad, as people make it, out to be. Its way better than other live action Dr. Seuss adaptations like 2003's Cat in the Hat. Produce by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, based on the 1957 story of the same name by author, Dr. Seuss, the movie tells the story of the reclusive Mr. Grinch (Jim Carrey), who decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville by stealing all their gifts and everything holiday related. The only person that can warm his heart is the endearing Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) whom hopes to show the Grinch, the true meaning of Christmas. Because the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions had to be made to the storyline to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the titular character. Most of that backstory is pretty damn good, despite that the fact that it doesn't fit that well to the original story. Things get very confusing as Cindy Lou can't tell the different between Santa Claus's voice and that of the Grinch!?! How is that possible? I found it funny that the Grinch show his face to her, and she still can't tell them, apart. Is she really that clueless!? Another clueless person is the Narrator (Voiced by Anthony Hopkins). The Narrator speaks as if, he had no knowledge, why the Grinch is mean. It doesn't make sense. Did he not see that the Grinch was mock? Anyways, I still like the backstory. Remind me of the outcast revenge horror movies, just in a tamer kid movie. Sure, it make the citizen of Whoville look like materialism consumer jerks, but the Whos in the novel, didn't have much of a personality. It even gives us, more reason to feel for the Grinch. It made him more sympathetic, than pure unlikeable. The movie expands on the Grinch's character, actually creating legitimate motivation for his actions and a reason why he stole Christmas this year as opposed to any previous year, in comparison to the original story where he simply hated Christmas and randomly decided that after years of putting up with it, he would ruin it. I think this backstory, really gave the movie more emotional depth. Did it weakened the overall moral plot to an extent? Kinda, but it was really needed. Most audience members that saw this movie, had already readt the book in the past. So, most of them, knew coming in, what's going to happen. I think by adding depth, it made the movie a little less predictable and little more watchable. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have a lot of pointless filler scenes that run the time, a little too long. Most of the jokes in the film are pretty clever, and had lot of wit to it. Lots of pop culture references, wisecracks and insults, break the fourth wall humor, slapstick, gross potty humor, and wordplay and puns are some of the jokes, you'll see in this. Lots of adult jokes like sexual, ethic, dirty jokes, are mixed so well with childish humor under a PG rating. It's has everything for everybody, but it really depend on the parents, if they will allow their children to watch this film or not. Not everything is kid's friendly as there are frightens imagery. Most of the jokes for me, personal, hit the funny bone hard. I couldn't stop, laughing at how funny Jim Carrey makes it out to be. A lot of people might criticizing Jim Carrey's performance as obnoxious over the top. I find it, alright. After all, it's Jim Carrey. He's known for over the top, wacky performances before, where critics love him. I don't know what makes this role, any differ than Ace Ventura or Lloyd Christmas. I guess, certain people want the Grinch to be a one-dimensional Scrooge, rather a full-fresh out character. I also found the young actress, Taylor Momsen to be very good at her age. While, she didn't have the chops for a singing voice, she did carry the heart & soul of the film with her performance. Most of the music in the film was pretty amazing to listen to. James Horner' score get you into the mood for the holiday. Faith Hill's song 'Where Are You Christmas?' awaken that Christmas spirit within you. Jim Carrey's 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' isn't as good, as the original as he tend to overdo it with multiply voices, and volume tones, but it's funny as hell. Even some of early 2000's Boys Bands feature in the soundtrack wasn't as bad, as I thought, they were going to be. I still have mixed feelings about the production. The cinematography need a little more cleaned up. The sets are very beautiful, but you can't see it with all the mist and fog. I know, Ron Howard was really going for the winter type of weather, here, to make it look more surreal, but it's really distracting. Some shots like the CGI wide shot are really made well on the computer, but most of the footage film on the set, looks like it was film in a steam bath with a lot of muted gloomy colors. It doesn't mixed. The film won the Best Make Up award at the Oscars that year, but I didn't really think it was that good. It wasn't ground-breaking. I saw Jim Carrey in similar make up in 1988's Earth Girls are Easy. He look almost the same, but green, instead of red fur. Overall: I love this movie and watch it over and over every Christmas despite its faults. It's a must watch.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

It tells the story of the Grinch(played by Jim Carrey who's donning a suit and prosthetics)who hates Christmas and Whoville because he was bullied as a kid by a young boy who is now the mayor of Whoville (played by Jeffery Tambor who voiced Big Nosed Thug in Tangled) and to that day he never liked Xmas because of that. So he does all in his power to ruin Christmas for the Whovilles by stealing their presents and destroying their Xmas tree.But when a young girl from Whoville called Cindy(played by a very young Taylor Monsom)enters the Grinch's life can the Grinch ever learn to love Xmas?Overall the comedy in this is funny especially one scene that cracked me up where The Grinch is driving this little car that blows up and he jumps away from the car and does this funny thing in slow motion.Jim Carrey steals this movie for me with his physical movements as well as his humor. I have to give him credit for wearing that green suit(since he first wore something green by playing The Mask in 1994 with Cameron Diaz only he wore a green mask that has magical powers with whoever wears it in that film,and his fully green in The Grinch).If your like me a massive Jim Carrey then check it out next Xmas as its a Xmas movie.Overall its a 7.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

(Jim Carrey) was at some kind of a turning point between being that crazy cartoon channel, and a bit sane comedian / actor. Here, he selected to be the wacky wacko (Carrey). Although he's brilliant, but NOT THIS TIME.The whole deal is so strange; metamorphosing everybody's image transformed the movie's world into big monster for ever mysterious reasons. So, it's not your typical fairytale's soft drawings but, in the same time, not a wild black comedy, or a satirical take on our modern life's towns and people either!As for the humor, let's not talk about the humor. Enough to say that this movie consider seeing a man kissing a dog's butt is something funny that suits a PG comedy!! Who writes this stuff.. Satan?! And if he did, how come that Hollywood agrees to produce it, and sell it as family friendly fun?!!Even as a drama, it's not that right. For example, ask yourself: why the lead got changed at the end? Clearly for nothing but the movie makers' desire! Maybe they expended all the time, the efforts, and the money for building these huge vile set pieces, and forgot about the story, relying on the fact that the audiences would laugh, and be dazzled, more than to think: aka Hollywood everlasting mean trick. But that was out of the question this round, because I didn't laugh, be dazzled, and more than once I found myself thinking furiously ""What in God's name is that?, what they were thinking?, is it the Dadaism?, am I having a good time?"" sure ""NO"" FOR THIS LAST ONE!So the problem of this movie is that it suffers from too much of everything bad I suppose: silly lead actor, hideous make-up, repellent lenses, nasty humor, and unconvincing climax. In one word, this is not the way to make a kids fantasy, it's the new way for making pure ugliness under the name of novelty, uniqueness, whatever. And even with the wise tone of (Anthony Hopkins), as the narrator, nothing could bring any balance to this kids' story which gone queer.This is a fine rival for director (Ron Howard)'s worst movie.

He is very charismatic and you can tell that he improvised allot of his lines and is having fun which is great to see. The little girl in the film is good and gives a performance that works well with the grinch an you understand how their relationship progresses. Jeffrey tambor gives a fun performance as the mayor of whoville and he is good as the annoying antagonist in the film. Unfortunately, there are other characters that are just pretty dull and you don't really care about some of the who's. The story has some really good drama in it and you actually see great character progression from the Grinch. You end up caring about his story arc and you like seeing his character grow. The script has so much great dialogue, so much humour from the Grinch but also drama and depth to the great message in the film.

38,barnabyrudge,Diverting festive fare.,5,12 September 2005,"In the UK, perhaps the most well-known Dr. Seuss book is ""The Cat In The Hat"" (filmed in 2003 with Mike Myers), but in America the best-loved and most widely read Dr. Seuss story would probably be ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"". Here, director Ron Howard takes the classic story and, with the help of an energetic Jim Carrey performance, transforms it into a diverting film experience. However, considering Howard's track record as a maker of excellent and moving films (e.g Apollo 13, Cocoon, EdTv, etc.) this is rather lightweight stuff. While it is fun to watch, and energetic, and diverting as mentioned, it is not a film that lingers in one's mind long after watching it. Rather like Christmas wrapping paper, it looks pretty and you have a fun time tearing into it, but ultimately it's something to be disposed of without much afterthought.In the town of Whoville, the Whos (residents) are preparing for Christmas. It is a time of year they love, going to extreme lengths to buy mountains of presents and trim their houses. One little girl who questions if all the hullabaloo surrounding Christmas might be a bit superfluous is Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the local postal worker Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin). Cindy Lou figures that Christmas shouldn't be about who buys the most gifts or who trims their house most spectacularly.... somewhere deep down inside she senses that Christmas should be about love, family and community. Overlooking Whoville is a large mountain which is home to a grumpy, hate-filled green creature called the Grinch (Jim Carrey). The Grinch famously hates everyone, but more than that he hates Christmas (since it was a Christmas-event-gone-wrong which drove him to turn his back on Who-kind). Condy Lou decides that the time has come to give the Grinch a chance to make amends with the Whos - and vice versa - but her friendly gesture backfires and the enraged Grinch plots to ruin the festivities by stealing everyones' presents.Carrey's performance as the Grinch is amazing, both for his manic physical energy and for the skill with which he conveys numerous emotions from beneath so many layers of make-up. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins uses his lovely Weslh lilt to provide the film with a classy narration. While the remaining performances are competent enough, none of them really stand out in a spectacular way. The set design by Meredith Boswell is also noteworthy, bringing the town of Whoville vibrantly to life. There seem to me to be two principal flaws with the film. First is the fact that the story is incredibly thin, with little to sustain a running time just short of two hours. Second (and most damaging) flaw is the heavy-handed, sickly-sweet preachiness. It's a sad thing if people have really become so self-centered that they've forgotten the honourable values associated with Christmas. But this film lays on the sentiment too thickly to convert those people into a better way of thinking. People who DO hold traditional values don't need a message like this ramming down their throat; and people who DON'T hold traditional values won't buy into this kind of sugary preaching.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

They turned the Whos into smug materialists instead of the kind-hearted, wise folks who loved Christmas because it was a time of love and fellowship. Also, no one can replace Boris Karloff as the Grinch. Ever.Still, I cannot deny this film is a major guilty pleasure for me. Jim Carrey is over-the-top and ridiculous, but his overplaying makes me laugh (and I must admit, the make-up on him is fantastic). The disgusting-looking Whos are so terrible-looking, but that's hilarious too. Everything they could have got wrong went wrong, but it's done in such a stupid manner that it makes it kind of charming in a weird, surreal way.I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time, if you want to do some MST3K for a holiday movie and got tired of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, then this is the flick for you.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
40,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent remake of a holiday classic,10,23 November 2005,"HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, in my opinion, is excellent remake of a holiday classic. I really enjoyed Jim Carrey singing, ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch."" However, I totally despised May-Who (Jeffrey Tambor). This was because he wanted the Grinch to have nothing to do with Whoville's Christmas celebration. Also, in my opinion, Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor Momsen) was a really cute little girl. In addition, another thing that makes this film worth seeing is Faith Hill's rendition of ""Where Are You Christmas?"" As a matter of fact, all the music is good. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent remake of a holiday classic to everyone, especially all you Jim Carrey fans who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to laugh and have a good time.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
41,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Very flawed but visually charming,5,15 December 2015,"While not perfect, Ron Howard's Dr. Seuss's How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a dazzling blast of elaborate sensory overload and wildly inventive Christmas set decoration that it succeeds in whisking you along for its weird and wonderful tale pretty darn well. Howard's decision to go the live action route as opposed to animation was admirable, as it more than likely resulted in a much more daunting undertaking. The star of the film is the set design, starting with the quaint blueprint of Seuss's beloved book, and piling on decadent, surreal spectacle until we are presented with a world where every corner of every frame is a giddily cluttered piece of eye candy and raucous auditory nuttiness. Starting with the Grinch's lair on snow laden Mount Crumpet, a garbage encrusted haven of rickety inventions and off kilter lighting, to the loopy, majestically over the top town of Whoville in the valley below, every set piece is so overdone and buzzing with creative energy it boggles the senses. In that sense, the film succeeds glowingly. Now, on to the makeup. It's my only gripe with the film and one I can't get over no matter how much I try and look past it. This excludes the Grinch himself of course, they did a wonderful job with him, which I'll get to in a minute. The other Whovians, though, look slightly terrifying, and the decision to try and exactly recreate the way Seuss drew their characteristics, mayyy not have been the best idea. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) looks alright, but her dad Lou (Bill Irwin, the voice of TARS from Interstellar) and some of the other adults look very unsettling with their eerily upturned noses and clay set grins, like a drunk plastic surgeon had his way with them using only a cookie cutter. Then there's the baby Grinch.. Who I think was supposed to be cute, but ends up looking like something that a Mogwai would have a nightmare about. It's all in good fun though, and doesn't hurt the film too much, just a quibble I have. When one steps back and admires the movie as a whole, the positives outweigh the negatives. Jim Carrey must be commended for letting another funny, hyperactive performance shine through pounds of makeup plastered all over his face and figure. He never loses that spark that makes his presence so unique, and although great amounts of new dialogue and interaction that weren't in the book have been added, especially with his character, he still manages to retain that 'Seussy' outlook and vernacular (something that The Cat In The Hat failed miserably at, Mike Myers being the chief culprit). Carrey even adds poignancy to the Grinch's delicate, near manic balancing act of bitterness and hate, with a sweetness clawing to get out. That dynamic could have been suppressed into childlike simplicity, but he plays him at an adult level, to the film's advantage. The supporting cast is cool too, showcasing Jeffrey Tambor as the town's smarmy Mayor, Christine Baranski as foxy Martha May Whovier as well as Mindy Sterling, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Bryce Dallas Howard, Q'orianka Kilcher, Verne Troyer and a kindly Anthony Hopkins as the unseen narrator, the only person who gets to speak actual passages from the book. My favourite moment? The tiny, pint sized Who's driving around in their little football sized car. It's oddball little quirks that make the movie work and are its strong suits; a warm, weird sense of humour and endlessly creative visual palette that amp up the Christmas cheer dial to eleven.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Its funny, The make up and cinematography is phenomenal , it's a different but amazing version of a classic, It felt like we were in whoville, its every thing you want in a Christmas movie.

43,davispittman,A pretty good live-action version of the cartoon,7,24 November 2015,"The bottom line is that Jim Carrey made this film. Jim Carrey and the special effects that is. Jim Carrey as the Grinch could not have been a better fit! The special-effects and the looks of who Ville are spot on! Also Christine Baranski is perfect for Martha May! She really nailed her performance. And then you have Molly Shannon, who was very enjoyable here. The movie's script is OK it's not great but it suffices. Really all you have to know about this movie is that it's family-friendly and it's fun to watch at Christmas time, especially with young kids. It's also very family-friendly unless you are offended by a little crude humor. If you don't want to see that, or you don't want your kids to see that just beware that it's in there. Overall the Grinch is an enjoyable film with stunning visuals. That Oscar win was well deserved! 7/10 for the Grinch.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
44,jfgibson73,Less Is More,2,26 August 2021,They did not succeed in expanding this story to a full length feature. Many of Jim Carey's line readings as the Grinch are very memorable--he did a great job. But the script was just not there. The situations just don't work. It's much too busy and overdone. The best Christmas movies create an atmosphere that bring nostalgic feelings of the season. This movie feels like being in a Chuck E. Cheese.,How the Grinch Stole Christmas
45,aidanratesmovies,"Not bad, Carrey rocks this film",8,27 November 2020,"An entertaining little holiday romp, with a stellar performance from Carrey as always, How the Grinch Stole Christmas may not be the best holiday flick around, but even despite its flaws, it still manages to shed some charm. My problems with the film seem to be all about the same, its narrative being a little too forced to be fun, and its world a little too forced to be any sort of realistic. There are also a handful of corny moments and lines throughout, but I feel that is to be expected of any Christmas film, especially a film marketed for children. Obviously there are setbacks trying to make a 60 page children's book into a feature length film, but due to Carrey's energy and charisma on screen, the film largely works pretty well. The other actors are kinda meh, Taylor Momsen being the only decent talent here otherwise. Therefore there is no doubt that Carrey carries this film, no pun intended, and the look and talent he brings to the screen just ups the film in quality more than it probably should. The makeup in this film is incredible, sparing no expense and proving to be tremendously detailed, not to mention the costumes as well as the sets which truly brings this iconic tale to life. In the end, How the Grinch Stole Christmas can be messy, but for the most part, it's a well made, somewhat woodenly written piece of christmas entertainment that manages to still be sweet and earn its smiles throughout.

46,gazzo-2,Hoober-floob Hiway...,7,9 December 2000,"I just saw it, and to be honest I really enjoyed it. There were parts that you could call simple story padding-mostly the young grinch scenes, yet I felt for the most part it moved along well and was quite well handled.Some of these complaints here are goofy. 'Film to dark'! Rubbish. The town is one big neon Ornament; the Grinch's lair is exactly what you'd EXPECT it to look like, at least if you have a clue as to what he's about.The little girl, I thought, delivered an Excellant performance, and if you put her alongside Haley Osment, she'd be Fine. She helps carry this flick, if she tanked, it would tank whenever Carrey wasn't there.He is great, perfect guy for the role. I like him in this about as much as I did as the Riddler and the Mask, it's really the kind of thing he does the best.Loved the heart shown at the end, the terrific F/X esp. the panoramic view of their mountainous world. It truly brings you into the Suess World.By all means check this out-it's not Great but it is pretty good-and well worth yer time.*** outta ****.The dog is good too!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
47,Kamurai25,"""The Grinch that Grinched Christmas""",7,27 July 2020,"Really good watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend, but less so for younger audiences.I never remembered all the weird adult humor in this, it is usually just the charming grinchiness of Jim Carey's overacting that sticks with me, and maybe the Christmas spirit of Mary Lou Who.The movie manages to ride this wonderfully line between keeping the spirit of the book (even rhyming at times) and being new and refreshing, but it does do that by playing to the adults that would have read the book as a child rather than endearing a new generation of children, but I think they intended to try to do both.Jim Carey embodies the Grinch like no one else possibly could (I think Mike Myers proved that in ""The Cat in the Hat""), and that is the majority of this so if you don't enjoy him, then you won't enjoy this movie. I do think they added some refreshing character interactions, though some of the execution is much better than others.While it is far from a perfect movie, my biggest gripe is their stupid noses: it seriously bothers me the entire movie. It bothers me more than them dressing the Grinch. I don't think that everyone is going to love this movie, but it's hard to imagine that people will hate it.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
48,justin-fencsak,The movie that made Jim Carrey king of comedy...,6,4 December 2018,"When i first saw the teaser trailer for this movie before Mission Impossible my thought was...how could they match the wit of the 1960s cartoon as well as the book it was based on? Well, they did a great job making the grinch who he is while showing an origin story of how he became a grinch. This is why this film dominated the box office for the year 2000 and made Carrey a billionaire. Before you go see the CGI Grinch, watch the 1960s special after you read the book, then see this movie. It's worth watching!!!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
49,Christmas-Reviewer,Great Fun,8,17 December 2016,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THESE FILMS.The beloved book and animated special gets turned into a a mega budget movie directed by Ron Howard starring Jim Carrey. In this feature length film we get to see why ""The Grinch"" became ""the Grinch"". The film is packed with the right amount of laughs and heart. All the Whos down in Whoville enjoy celebrating Christmas with much happiness and joy, except the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who hatefully resents Christmas and the Whos with great wrath and occasionally pulls dangerous and harmful practical jokes on them. As a result, no one likes or cares for him. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou (Taylor Momsen) believes everyone is missing the point about Christmas by being more concerned about the gifts and festivities. After her two brothers are harassed by the Grinch when they trespass on his domain, and she herself has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the Post office, in which he saves her life, Cindy Lou becomes interested in his history; she asks everyone what they know about him, and soon discovers that he has a tragic past.The Grinch actually arrived in Whoville by mistake when he was a baby, and was adopted by two elderly sisters. Although he showed some sadistic tendencies as a child, he was rather timid and not the cruel, selfish person he would become. He was bullied by his classmates (particularly by Augustus May Who (Jeffrey Tambor), who grew up to be Mayor of Whoville) because of his appearance, with the exception of Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski), who was courted by both the Grinch and May Who. One Christmas season when he was eight, the Grinch made a gift for Martha, but attempted to shave his face after being made fun of for having a ""beard"", cutting himself by accident. When his classmates saw his face covered with shaving tape the next morning, they ridiculed him yet again. He lost his temper, went on a rampage and ran away to live on a mountain to the north of Whoville, Mount Crumpit.The one scene that should of been cut is when the child sings ""Where are you Christmas?"". It stops the film. The song should of been sung over the closing credits.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
50,mike48128,A Weird Adaptation: Great and Terrible At the Same Time,9,6 December 2012,"The film is 15 minutes too long and loses its magic when it strays from the Dr. Seuss story-book. ""Who"" cares about the Grinch's schooldays or that he has an aversion to shaving? (Or has a girlfriend?) The ""Holiday Cheermeister"" scene seems to go on forever., although it's actually quite short. Many things in this film are not appropriate for children: 1. The Grinch eats a glass bottle, tortures himself, hits his head, and throws a temper tantrum. 2. He dresses like a test dummy and hurls himself into a cement wall. 3. A giant ""toy monkey"" that looks like a Batman film prop. 4. ""Max"" the little dog appears to kiss the mayor's rear (not actually shown). 5. The use of the word ""bitching"" in a kid's movie as a ""sports expression"". 6. The Grinch's nightmarish face and those who-noses might be scary for little kids? The use of a ""soft filter"" presumably to provide a dream-like quality or make the make-up look better makes the film hard on the eyes and creates video scanning problems on the home video disc. (""Macrovision"" anti-copy filter sure doesn't help, either.) Touches of genius do abound, however. The ""Whos"" live on a snowflake instead of a speck of dust. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as the narrator. The sets look just like Dr. Seuss drawings. The new songs are excellent and the classic songs are also included. Faith Hill belts-out a great ""Where Are You Christmas?"" Taylor Momsen ""steals"" the movie as the incredibly adorable ""Cindy-Lou Who"". I upgraded my rating after watching one of the ""DVD"" extras, as the entire production of the movie involves hundreds (thousands?) of CGI effects that are beyond belief. There are only less than 25-40 people that are ""real"" and the rest of the ""Whos"" are CGI. This cannot be fully appreciated on the average video screen as it doesn't appear to be that populated. The sleigh ride and ending are truly incredible and fantastic! I liked the soundtrack so much that I bought the CD also, as good songs got buried as background music. Alas, due to today's capture-motion technology, live-action films such as this will (probably) never be made again.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
51,mjw2305,Jim Carrey saves this movie,6,9 January 2007,"The Grinch is a bad tempered hairy green creature who lives in the mountains overlooking Whoville, and he hates Christmas. While the people of Whoville look forward to celebration and festivities, the Grinch plans to steal all the presents and spoil it for everyone.I have to say that Jim Carrey captures the character with great precision and brings his usual comedy capers to screen once again. It's a good job that he did, because this film stretches Dr Zeus's story out too long, leaving it feeling a bit dull at times; some of the additional background behind the Grinch was interesting, but this film could definitely have been trimmed down to around 80 Min's.6/10 It's fun and Carrey is brilliant, but it's not great",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
52,MartianOctocretr5,Made me want to bash Carry over the head with a gatrumpet,2,6 January 2008,"This version of Grinch was a nasty feast I couldn't stand in the least.This full length high budget extravaganza really has little to offer beyond what the classic cartoon already did so well. Truly, the only good moments are those that are directly taken from the original story. The new material that is added here is simply a montage of misguided, mean-spirited, over-wrought highly intense noise; led by the master of hysterical yelling and screaming for no reason whatsoever, Jim Carry. No moral, no insight, no creativity, no entertainment value. We get some long-winded flap-trap about how mean the Whoville residents are to Grinch. How everybody else disturbed him emotionally etc. etc. ad infinitum, ad-nauseum. Be on the lookout also for subplots about some of the Who's, that are unnecessary, unfunny, and inappropriate. Christmas spirit does not exist in this movie (except in the portion that retreads the original story). Kids will be bored, adults will be annoyed. Any fan of Dr. Seuss's work will be offended.The actress playing Cindy Lou Who is about the only positive in this film. I realize she was a no more than two, and a nice character, but I kept hoping she'd push the Grinch off a cliff and mercifully end this disaster.Your heart will not grow three sizes the day you watch this.

54,pyrocitor,Savour nostalgia and get ready to rhyme - the updated Grinch is a zany good time,9,22 December 2015,"For all those who cherish the holiday season, there are many for whom it is worse than high treason. To understand all of those grumps, it's a cinch - just turn to dear Seuss' tale of the Grinch. But how to redo the cartoon classic, while avoiding a scornful mess most tragic? It seems that Ron Howard has deduced the way to make the Grinch shine in the modern day.He treats the source text with reverence and care, and set, props, and costumes beyond compare. The zany, wild energy makes perfect sense, with consumerist critique to amuse the parents. The obnoxious Whos are pristinely portrayed, with prosthetics and quirks to assuage the dismayed. Colourful, dazzling, a true privilege - The Grinch is still a Christmas film with an edge. To add depth to his lead and expand the story, Howard adds a childhood of woe most sorry And while a romance subplot may feel quite forced, it's maudlin enough to not feel too outsourced.But the real fun begins with our titular lout, whose charisma alone makes the film stand out. Jim Carrey's at his manic, contorting best; his wild riffs and improv are masterful jest. As the holiday hoopla verges on annoying, Carrey's WC Fields grumblings save it from cloying. Buried underneath a mound of green yak hair, Carrey mines pathos to ensure that you care. With his own (stellar) theme song and sickly Grinch smile, Carrey's at his most fun when flamboyantly vile. And for priceless one-liners to leave you reeling, look no further than Carrey's histrionic ""I'm...FEELING!"" And the second half setpiece, the great Christmas heist, is thrilling enough to fit modern zeitgeist. But for all of its flamboyant affectations, Howard's film warns against skewed expectations. The film finds its core with its sole doubting Who - precious Taylor Momsen owns Cindy, it's true. With gleaming eyes and screen presence triumphant, Momsen's charm helps make her song less redundant. As the piece's true villain, Jeffrey Tambour's superb, making his preening mayor a classic Christmas turd.It's rare to find a film so energetic - perfect tonally without seeming mimetic. Infectious sentiment with consumer critique: as a Christmas film, The Grinch is wholly unique. Steered by the serene tones of Anthony Hopkins, this Grinch is one live action update that wins. With wild laughs and no aesthetic compromises, Howard and Carrey will make hearts grow three sizes.

56,Sirus_the_Virus,I loved this film. Carrey's best performance.,10,9 August 2009,"Jim Carrey has done many great performances. From Count Olaf to The Riddler, Carrey actually gives his best performance as the Grinch. Jim Carrey is my favorite actor. I will see any film he's in, so it's no wonder I saw How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It tanked at with critics, but I must disagree. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, it's an awesome film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as The Grinch, and I couldn't believe how much I loved this film. Like How much I couldn't believe I loved A series of Unfortunate events. Carrey is evil in that film but I still liked his character. Sort of like with Ralph Feinnes in Harry Potter. His character is a bastard but I think he is pretty cool. It sounds like i'm supporting evil, but trust me, i'm not supporting evil. Somehow, everybody hated The Grinch. I was one of the rare few who loved this film. Directed by Ron Howard(Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon), I think The Grinch is great entertainment. It's actually one of my favorite Christmas films. How The Grinch stole Christmas is funny, has great visuals, and a great cast. There is such a big cast I don't know if I can name everyone. But i'll sure as hell try. Here is the cast to How the Grinch stole Christmas:Christine Baranski(Cybil, Mamma Mia!)Jeffery Tambor(Too many things)Molly Shannon(SNL, Superstar)Even Narrated by Anthony Hopkins(The Silence of the Lambs)How the Grinch stole Christmas is a great film. You can sue me I don't care. I know everyone hated this film, but i'm one of the rare few who loved it. Definitely Dr. Seuss's best film adaptation and i'm proud of it. I actually prefer the film to the book, and that's saying quite a lot. I loved How the Grinch stole Christmas, and I think you should see it.The Plot:The Grinch, who was bullied as a child, hates Christmas. He happens to live above a town that celebrates Christmas all the time. So when Cindy Lou Who decides to get The Grinch to come down, he hates Christmas even more.

Until this movie the word hate and a Who never hit my mind. Who's were these perfect little people until this movie came along and tore them to pieces.  What cruel being would do such a thing?  The moral was always something to the affect of love.  In this one it's laughter and hey get over it man.  Sure it was funny, and I hope the actress who plays Cindy Lou goes places, but it's hard to get a bunch of people who don't seem so christmassy in a room together.  This was one of the biggest dissappointments I've ever seen.  I've got an awesome headache out of this movie because of that.  It's suppose to be a lovely tale.  And for some reason Ron Howard (which I have much respect from Apollo 13) totally destroyed.   If for some reason you feel the same way.  Quickly watch the original before you go insane.  At least that's family friendly.   Oh I'm so upset.

60,sharky_55,It's because I'm green isn't it?,4,25 December 2017,"Some things are just not meant to be live action. Dr Seuss must have been rolling in his grave as his second wife sold the film rights of his Christmas hit to Universal Pictures, who then ran with the idea that live action was the way to re-imagine these beloved children's books. They would begin the Dr Seuss cinematic universe and fill their films with big name comedic stars to draw in audiences. They would stretch 30 page picture books into bloated, overstuffed feature length films. They would replace the simple, economical illustrations of the original with grotesque costumes and lurid colour schemes (Bo Welch, the director of The Cat in the Hat, began his career as a production designer in Tim Burton films such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, and copy and pasted the same eye-popping style into his own film). Gone was the playful bounce of the Seuss rhymes; a dark menace replaces the atmosphere hanging over Whosville as Christmas approaches. The town was once a circle of warmth and generosity, until a Christmas ghoul by the name of Ron Howard came along and turned it into the capital of greed and consumerism. The film takes something well meaning and good hearted and turns it into a garish toyland to serve its extended plot. Given the challenge of forcing a hour plus long conflict from a picture book, the script turns the story on its head - it was actually the Grinch who was the original victim, a case of schoolyard bullying, and the Whos who become the villains. Seeing the makeup of these Whos, it's hard not to agree - they've taken quaint cartoon figures and replaced them with life sized humanoids sporting button noses that make them look like some god-forsaken pig-dog mutation out of a secret government lab. Perhaps Howard realised that such monstrosity could not be the heart of the film; no wonder the most innocent of all the Whos, precocious little six year old Cindy Lou, never has to sit in that makeup chair. Her character must over-correct for all the Who buffoonery with a cloying sweetness that by now has become a holiday cliche. If you didn't hate Christmas like the Grinch does during the opening credits, you just might after a little girl keeps popping up to shove tinsel and mince pie in your face. Creepy as the Whos are, they are no match for the real antagonist of the story, the eponymous green Grinch who lives up in the mountains and is revered as a Christmas legend. The script's attempts to humanise him this time around via flashback only serve to make audiences recoil further; his junior form is propped up on the school chair like a creepy puppet, forced sympathy engineered on strings. His adult self isn't the Grinch. It's Jim Carrey in a green fur suit, with a transatlantic-Connery-esque growl thrown in for good measure. Maybe executives were drawn to the manic energy of a Carrey, of a Myers. They thought they could ride on the screen power of these comic icons and then slap on a Seuss label. Carrey is aggressively twisted, and not in a good way. One could barely stand the sight of him with a pot belly and nothing else (clothing for his bottom half is optional, apparently), gyrating and sashaying all over the place. Seeing him fidget and snarl, seeing him shove those hairy pipe cleaners he calls fingers into his nostrils and crunch beer bottles with his fangs, we can see this isn't the mischievous fiend that Seuss envisioned. This is our drunk uncle in a creepy Halloween costume, belching all the way into December. Getting Carrey allows them a little mileage for a few elongated action sequences, if only to further press the point that everything the Grinch touches turns to disaster (the camera assumes the position of some drunk bird that can't stop tilting its head). It's too bad that most of this action mimics the same juvenile trash that belongs in cheap sitcoms. You know, crotch humour, exaggerated slapstick, Grinch getting catapulted right into a woman's cleavage, or pinning mistletoe on his behind. Most of it is pitched at a juvenile level but actually aimed at adults; kids won't recognise the Chariots of Fire theme, or register any of his extended stand-up monologues (to himself), and when Carrey winks and talks right into the camera it's just another gag (""And this time I'll keep it off.""). They've never seen the Chuck Jones cartoon anyway, for comparison. I'm actually impressed at how atrocious this adaptation is. It takes a great deal of talent and incompetence to turn a cartoon classic into this gaudy, useless trinket. Is there any upside? Well, at least it isn't as bad as The Cat in the Hat.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

62,Beta_Gallinger,Not so impressed with this version anymore,5,19 December 2011,"I first saw this full-length live action adaptation of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" (one of the many classic children's books that Dr. Seuss is remembered for) in late 2001, the year after its theatrical run. I was a teenager at the time, and remembered the book and the 1966 animated TV special very well from my childhood. I definitely was impressed with my first viewing of this live action film the first time I saw it, and it didn't seem to wear thin with subsequent viewings, even though I certainly didn't find it to be nearly as good as the cartoon. This Christmas season, I have revisited both the 1966 short and this 2000 full-length movie. I still think that classic TV special is a little gem, like so many others do, but this version is far from it.Inside a snowflake, there is a town called Whoville, and in this town, everybody loves Christmas. Just outside their town, up on Mount Crumpet, lives a bitter hermit known as the Grinch, and his dog, Max. The Grinch hates Christmas and is greatly feared by the Whos. However, Cindy Lou Who, a little girl in Whoville who feels that the true meaning of Christmas is missing in the town with all the materialism she's seeing around her, is curious about this despised creature that lives up on that mountain. She asks other Whos who once knew the Grinch what they remember about him, and learns a lot about how he became the hateful individual he now is. Feeling that everyone should be together for the holiday, and that this creature can change, she then attempts to befriend the Grinch, inviting him down to Whoville for the Whobilation. Thanks to her, he has been nominated the Cheer Meister for this event. Will Cindy Lou Who's plan work?One reason why I don't care much for this version is Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Grinch. During my latest viewing, I couldn't keep a straight face through ALL his antics, unlike when I watched Carrey in ""Batman Forever"", but for the most part, he's still not funny here. I also found the characters in general here to be bland and not so likable, especially the nasty Mayor Augustus May Who, who can be perhaps a little annoying at times. I also think the flashback sequence showing the Grinch as a baby is a notable weak segment, with the ""Santa, bye-bye"" and such, and that's certainly not the only one. Basically, I just found the movie overall to be deeply flawed in a number of departments, and totally lacking the charm of the 1966 short. There are some mildly amusing moments, as well as some occasional touching ones, plus the visuals are very impressive and I can't complain much about Anthony Hopkins' narration, but these things are not enough to make up for the lack of heart in this adaptation. Not EVERYTHING fails here, but unfortunately, the vast majority of it does.This polarizing live action version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" led to the making of another live action full-length adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss book, ""The Cat in the Hat"", and that film's reception was generally very negative, which is understandable! The third full-length movie based one a Dr. Seuss story was 2008's ""Horton Hears a Who!"", this time not a live action film but a computer animated one. I said in my review of that film that it was PROBABLY the best of the full-length Dr. Seuss adaptations so far, but now I'm going to have to take that back and say it's DEFINITELY the best of the three! Clearly, live action doesn't work so well with these Dr. Seuss classics. It's been eight years since the release of the ""Cat in the Hat"" movie, and it seems there's still no sign of another live action Seuss film coming, which isn't a bad thing. I don't know how the upcoming CGI ""Lorax"" adaptation will turn out, but at the moment, I can say the ""Horton Hears a Who!"" adaptation is the only good one of these previous movies. This version of Dr. Seuss' Christmas story is not as bad as its 2003 follow-up, but was still unnecessary, and I would say you're better off sticking with the classic TV special to put you in the Christmas spirit.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
63,jhclues,Take A Trip To Whoville,10,20 November 2000,"When such an eagerly awaited, highly anticipated movie like this comes along, you have to ask yourself, can any film live up to the hype?  Well, the answer in this case is, You Bet It Can.  Resoundingly.  `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey, is a triumph to be embraced by the ages.  It's a warm and touching, funny and highly entertaining piece of film making, satisfyingly brought to fruition by Howard, seemingly the perfect choice to direct such a vehicle as this. But make no mistake about it, this movie belongs to Jim Carrey, who was born to play this part. 	Nobody, but NOBODY, could have pulled this off better than Carrey.  It's a dazzling demonstration of his talents; he has all the tools and uses every one of them in bringing the Grinch to life.  From the Sean Connery voice he affects, to the physical bits he manages, to the exceptional costuming and makeup that help make it all fly, it's an exemplary performance in every way.  Amazingly enough, there's no trace of Jim Carrey left here; he manages to disappear totally into the character, a transformation so complete that what you see is pure Grinch from the inside out.  He pulls out all the stops and lets himself go with it, without ever taking it too far over the top. Howard, who obviously knew exactly what he wanted from his star, must get some credit as well for keeping the naturally exuberant Carrey on track, while allowing him to find his own comfort zone that made it all work. 	Howard uses a gentle touch with the film, letting the natural humor work on it's own without ever forcing it, while infusing some sly, subtle comedic bits that work well and keep it all from slipping into anything sappy or pretentious.  It's a feel-good film without the maudlin overtones to which so many other films of this nature have succumbed over the years.  And what a credit this is to the versatility of Howard, who proves here that he can take you into outer space or to `Whoville' with equal alacrity and expertise. 	The supporting cast includes Christine Baranski, who turns in a wickedly funny performance as Martha May Who-vier; Jeffrey Tambor (Mayor of Whoville); Molly Shannon (Betty Lou-Who); Josh Ryan Evans (8 Year Old Grinch); Taylor Momsen (Little Cindy Lou-Who); Bill Irwin (Lou Lou-Who); and Clint Howard (Whobris).  With `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' Howard and Carrey have provided us with an instant classic; a delightful film with a lot of heart that is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.  A great way to kick off the holiday season, this movie is destined to become an annual tradition with audiences everywhere.  In the end, this is what movies are all about:  Pure Magic.  I rate this one 10/10.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

65,stamper,"The, the, the, the...THE GRINCH",7,18 November 2001,"I'd never heard of this story before (probably because I'm from Europe), but I must say that I was immediately dragged into it. The film (I do not know about the book) really captures today's dealing with Christmas as being about gifts and presents, whereas it clearly should not be. At least the film does so during the first 30 minutes and the last 20 minutes or something. The rest of the time is filled up by Jim Carrey's usual goofing around (in a Riddler manner) and I felt that was pretty much of a shame, because the film could have been so much better if it had stayed focused on the main theme and would not have focused on Carrey's grimaces and stunts. It is just that Jim Carrey can overdo it sometimes and most directors just let him (why oh why???). I mean let him bring some character into that Grinch, I know he can do that.Anyway, besides the costumes designers, set designers and makeup people on this film there was also one person on screen that really impressed me. It was little Cindy Lou  Who (Taylor Momsen). I mean she was just so sweet and charming it was really mostly her acting that will get you into the TRUE Christmas spirit. And remember: If anyone tries to ruin Christmas,don' t give in an inch Cause everyone likes Christmas, even the Grinch

Jim Carrey and Taylor Momsen do a good job portraying their characters but even they can't save this movie.If you've read the book or saw the old special then you know what the story's about. There're a few new elements added such as the mayor being the main villain as well as the reason the Grinch became what he is now as well as their being a love interest for the title character in order to stretch out the length. It's not enough for me to recommend this movie though.I hear a lot of people grew up watching this and express their fond memories of it but for me I'm not one of them.

67,bellino-angelo2014,Timeless classic for the holidays,8,2 February 2019,"Always loved this movie since the first time I saw it, and every time it's aired on TV during the Christmas period I can't resist the temptation of re-watching it. And it's always great as the first time? Yes. But since there are yet so many reviews and everything about this movie had been yet said I'll be short.HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS has many great elements for a Christmas comedy: the sets, the soundtrack, and the humour. I have to agree with some that say that this film is a bit too crude for kids, but btw it's a great and funny romp especially since the Grinch (an unrecognisable Jim Carrey in green outfit) appears. He is the best character in the whole movie, and most of his jokes were hysterical. And, if you think that this is the worst Dr. Seuss adaptation, well I am sure you haven't seen THE CAT IN THE HAT with Mike Myers yet! And Carrey is perfect for the role of the Grinch, not like Mike Myers as the Cat, and Anthony Hopkins does a great job as the narrator.However, this movie has many great moments that I strongly recommend it to watch it, especially during the Christmas season!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
68,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An amusing Christmas film that captures the imagination of Dr. Suess with Ron Howard's bold direction,8,22 December 2011,"Ron Howard is known for making such dramatic films like Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons and many more, but before those two adaptations of Dan Brown's novels, he adapted the original book of the same from Dr. Suess, a remake of the 1957 cartoon ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"".The premise, like the cartoon, is the same: The Grinch plots to steal Christmas from all of Whoville, but learns that Christmas comes from the heart. This one, however, has a few tweaks that weren't included in the book. It details the Grinch's past about him being humiliated by the children of Whoville and has a relationship with Martha May Whovier. It wasn't the best origin, but wasn't that bad at all. While this movie stayed true to the spirit of the book (and despite it's crude and inappropriate humor but has a few good jokes) Jim Carrey, although over-the-top, did a perfect job as the Grinch. The rest of the cast did great especially Taylor Madsen as the lovable Cindy Lou-Who.I show some empathy for fans of the book who hated this adaptation, but as for me, I'm recommending this Christmas classic to others highly.Rating: 8.3/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

It's very idyllic, it's very charming, it's very nice all over...the only problem is; the moral actually!

Jim Carrey does his performance as the Grinch beautiful, very nice! He shimmers him so...evil in a good way..so..very good actually! Very good!

To put it this way; the movie is very entertaining and nice with Carrey on the screen, but instead of that it's just okay. Mr. Grinch he is called...look, well..the movie doesn't entertain that much when it is more about Christmas spirit and taking care, than a lovely Grinch grinning and sniffing like a angry dog or something.

Ron Howard, who has directed so many Frank Capra style movies for mainstream audiences, had to twist the plot around and use special effects for a movie that confuses young audiences and detracts from the message. The cast and special effects could have produced a classic from the Grinch story; a movie to reinforce the Christmas message from Dr. Seuss's wonderful children's book. In the end, the movie did return to the original theme but the story was already ruined. There were so many deviations from the story and over the top scarifying scenes that it amounts to a travesty of a great Christmas tale.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

73,Movie-12,"All over the wall with silly, senseless humor. Jim Carrey over acts. ** (out of four)",4,5 January 2001,"DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four)If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable, don't see ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of  the fictional village Whoville. Unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end;  the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. Like in ""Battlefield Earth,"" I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing  Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinch's lone lost lover.The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity!The movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a very good-looking production. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. The people of  Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. Although dazzling, I really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about. His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss.  Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carry's zany silliness. It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""After this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

When I found out that Ron Howard was going to direct and Jim Carrey was going to star I was ecstatic, but still skeptical.  Even when I saw the previews I was a bit leery.I must say that the movie was excellent!!!  Jim Carrey plays the perfect Grinch and Ron Howard directed a beautiful movie.  There are a few times where the camera-work was a bit odd, but nothing I couldn't deal with. Also, the humor was excellent, because some of it was obviously for the adult audience and some of it was for the child audience...and there was plenty of both to keep you laughing throughout the film.  Anthony Hopkins was an added bonus to the film.  He narrated the film with his excellent voice.  The rest of the cast was good as well; Jeffery Tambor, Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon (who I'm usually not a fan of), and Clint Howard.  I also have to mention Taylor Momsen, she was the perfect choice for the role of Cindy Lou Who, and quite a fine little actress.Overall, I thought this was an excellent cartoon-to-live-action film adaption and was quite entertaining.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes the original animated film and/or is a fan or Ron Howard or Jim Carrey.  I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.

83,bregund,This movie is nasty,1,19 December 2005,"Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W.

85,jhaggardjr,Fascinating fantasy,9,3 December 2000,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a delightful fantasy-comedy from director Ron Howard. The film, based on the classic children's book by Dr. Seuss, is a fascinating movie to look at. Jim Carrey makes his performance as The Grinch all his own. He was literally the perfect choice to play the unlikable hairy creature with a hatred of Christmas. Even though he's not quite as funny as he's been in some of his earlier films, he's still fun to watch. The supporting cast is good too, especially 7-year-old newcomer Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, the adorable little girl who tries to bring out the sweetness in The Grinch. But I think the best thing about ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the spectacular production design by Michael Corenblith, who worked with Howard on ""Apollo 13"". He and his art directing-set decorating team have made the town of Whoville come to live like you've never seen before. The look of Whoville is a feast for the eyes, and it's fascinating. Also excellent, the make-up effects done by multi-Oscar winner Rick Baker. He's responsible for creating the make-up job on turning Carrey into The Grinch, and once again he and his make-up companions do an A+ job. I sure hope the Oscar voters are paying attention to this movie, because both the art direction and makeup should get Oscar nominations. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a great film for the entire family, and judging by it's record breaking box office statistics, parents have been taking their kids in droves to see this. And well they should. It brought out the kid in me, and brought back memories of when I read the Dr. Seuss books when I was a child. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is fun, fun, fun.

Jim Carrey gives another stellar performance in this film, because his acting ability combined with the sheer elasticity of his facial muscles allowed him to portray a full range of emotions throughout the film, from the cold and heartless to the kind and gentle, and he does it in a believable way. It's not as if it's two different characters (Nice Grinch/Evil Grinch); it feels very human. Of course, it also goes with the territory that Jim Carrey is hilarious as The Grinch and still, after all these years, the jokes still manage to make me smile.
The supporting cast is fantastic, but Jim Carrey really does carry this film, and it makes his countless hours of sitting in makeup worth it for the final product.
Ron Howard did a brilliant job of creating Whoville and the Whos for the film and, from what I've seen and heard, he allowed a fair amount of improvisational work to be done as well. The actors were given the breathing room to find the characters on their own, which creates a very organic, natural feel among them. Their rapport with one another is completely believable (that is, when it's not supposed to be completely zany).

89,DavidSim240183,"A glossy, sugary confection saved single handed by Jim Carrey",5,21 March 2008,"Now might be a peculiar time of year to be writing a review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But then ITV just did the peculiar thing of showing it today. And at Easter no less! Oh well, there wasn't much else on TV, so I decided to watch Ron Howard's lovingly crafted tribute to Dr Seuss's most famous fictional character.I remember whiling away many hours of my childhood on the gleeful, charming absurdities of Dr Seuss. The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham were perennial favourites of mine. And of course, so was How the Grinch Stole Christmas.And what an anarchic children's story it is. The tale of a lovably wicked creature, the Grinch who hates everything and anything to do with Christmas. Living on the top of Mt Crumpit, he loathes and despises the people of Whoville, who act like its Christmas everyday. So he hatches a plan to ruin Christmas for the people he looks down on, by stealing their presents right out from under their noses (and boy do they have noses!) on Christmas Eve.Now of course the book is a very slim affair, so Ron Howard has to expand upon a few things. He even gives us a Grinch back-story. But unfortunately, the film version disappoints. Although a visual treat, the appealing wickedness of the story book has become buried by the A-list machinery of the sets and production values.I don't think Ron Howard was the director to bring the world of Dr Seuss to life. What the film really needed was someone like Tim Burton at the helm. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to Dr Seuss' sensibilities. Some of the films he's made are clearly akin to the mind of Dr Seuss. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. A film that achieved a perfect balance between the grotesque and the sincere. As well as his recent remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Ron Howard's films are ones designed to appeal to the Academy Award winning crowd. Ones that celebrate the strength of the human spirit. He hasn't really got the wacky imagination to let the world of Dr Seuss truly come to life. And while he's clearly put a great deal of thought into the world of Whoville, the film still looks very stagebound. Everything is crammed in as tightly as possible. From squashed in bungalows to tiny fieldmice. The film would be a glossy, empty confection, were it not for one thing......Jim Carrey. Now Jim Carrey can be an intensely annoying actor. Especially when he goes over the top. His antics have sunk many a film on his resume. Batman Forever, The Cable Guy and Liar Liar are all prime examples. Where the directors of those films foolishly refused to rein him in. So its all the more surprising than that Jim Carrey does just brilliantly as The Grinch.This is one of the greatest performances he has ever delivered. Like the one other really good manic character he's played, The Mask, his OTT excesses feel completely appropriate. Where in the other films I mentioned, Carrey was put into roles that didn't really suit his typically out of control theatrics, he gets it very right as The Grinch.The Grinch is a character that seems perfectly attuned to Carrey's manic energy. Much like The Mask. And Ron Howard seems to sense that too. Which is why he allows him to give a performance of zero restraint. And as a result reaches stratospheric heights.Buried under an impressive makeover by the excellent Rick Baker, Carrey is a thundering cyclone. Hopping about with energy, clearly enjoying himself immensely, he is the life and soul of the party. Whenever he's around, you sit up and pay attention (not hard considering he's green all over).I don't envy him either. The hours he must have had to spend in the makeup chair. Those contact lenses must have been torture. But it never shows through in his performance. His enthusiasm for the role shines right through the makeup. And its animated enough to allow him plenty of mischievous grins and lopsided smirks. Giving a sharp, edgy take on the role, Carrey makes The Grinch one of his most memorable creations.What is especially gratifying about the way Jim Carrey plays The Grinch is the fact that even as he softens, he never loses his edge. Yes he does come to understand the spirit of Christmas, but there's still a bit of a grouch left in The Grinch. One particularly delightful moment comes when his heart grows a few inches. His faithful dog Max jumps into his lap licking him mercilessly expecting high praise. Instead he gets a harsh rebuke: ""Beat it! One step at a time!""Jim Carrey is the best thing in the whole film. The rest of the cast don't have a prayer of keeping up with him. He's the sole reason to watch the film at all. There's something tremendously satisfying (not to mention liberating) watching him tear down the superficial, hollow shell of Whoville. Its a pity he repents on that because Whoville looks better without all the adornments.You're never in any doubt who's behind the makeup, but Carrey makes The Grinch large as life. With lots of pithy, spiteful dialogue to spout as well as neverending insults and putdowns, Carrey does a superb job of bringing The Grinch to the big screen.Its just a shame the rest of the film isn't as good. It'll be interesting to see how Carrey does in the latest Dr Seuss film, Horton Hears a Who! Since he's an actor who seems very in sync with Seuss, I'm sure he'll be just as good there.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I was as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about ""Space Jam"".Furthermore, the original ""Grinch"" film, directed by Chuck Jones (who is, like, a god to me) and personally supervised by Dr. Suess is as close to perfect as any Christmas movie; or any animated short for that matter; has ever come to perfection.

99,squirrel_burst,You THINK this movie is great... but take another look.,5,25 December 2014,"A lot of people consider the live-action version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" to be a holiday classic, but have you really say down and looked at it? If you scrutinize this film even a little bit, you'd see that the film falls apart. You know the story, originally based on the book by Dr. Seuss. ""Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot... but the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-Ville, did NOT!"" Jim Carrey, donning some amazing and surprisingly expressive makeup plays the Grinch, a green, hairy, glass-eating, hazardous waste-loving, sarcastic and mean creature who decides to ruin the whole Christmas season for the residents of Who-ville.My brother is a big Dr. Seuss fan and had informed me numerous times that this film didn't really capture the feel of the book, that it missed the point of the whole Christmas season. I told him he was simply too attached to the source material, that books are different from movies and that of course they had to change some details here and there. Now that I've sat down and watched this Ron Howard effort, I have to agree with him. What's frustrating is that there are many elements that are incredibly well done and I can see how this could have worked and why everyone was on-board when they announced the project.Let's begin with what works. I can't comment enough on how good Jim Carrey looks as the Grinch. It brings me back to the wonderfully expressive makeup used in the original ""Planet of the Apes"". Even though Carrey is covered head-to-toe in green paint, prosthetics and hair, he remains swift and expressive. The face in particular is a true marvel. His yellow eyes, the way the wrinkles in his face appear when he smiles that most devious and iconic smile, the way he is able to contort his face, it's what every makeup artist dreams of. The visual greatness is not limited there. The Whos are very well done (I did not find them to be unsettling, I thought they looked great) and the sets are equally impressive. I loved seeing the wacky-looking bridges and machinery because it does feel like it is capturing the whimsical and fantastical source material. Even the costumes worn throughout are a lot of fun to see. They get more and more extravagant as it gets further along. Every frame of this film is packed to the brim with style.The problem lies with the plot. This movie feels incredibly padded. By adding two iconic songs and some lengthy descriptions of the Whos' presents, Chuck Jones made the book into a 25 minute short. How much material then, did the writers have to add to more than triple the length to make this an hour and a half movie?! And what's added; is it more of the most iconic parts of the film, the scenes where the Grinch steals Christmas? NO! It's additional back story for the Grinch, which adds nothing to plot and in fact makes the movie contradict itself (I'll get back to that). What is this contradiction in the film? Let me quote it directly: ""The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason."" Nope, not true. Many Whos know the reason for why the Grinch does not like Christmas. Are you ready for it? The mind-blowing explanation, the mystery that has plague Seussians ever since the book was written... it's a titanic letdown. Apparently he was born evil, and also mistreated during Christmas time.I found that a lot of the material added made it go in all sorts of contradicting directions. Is the movie for children? If it is, why do we have jokes about key parties and the Grinch checking out sexy Whos? Is the movie supposed to be about the true meaning of Christmas, or are the Whos not supposed to know what it's about? Not only are they quick to judge people on their appearance (since they make fun of the Grinch's look multiple times) but apparently to the residents of Who-ville, Christmas is all about presents and sales, popularity contests and being more extravagant than your neighbor. What a selfish and materialistic holiday. Is the movie supposed to make us like the Grinch, or are we supposed to cheer for the residents of Who-ville? The Grinch is funny and he's against the materialistic nature of the holiday. I can't blame the Grinch for not liking Christmas because I also disliked the Whos' celebration.Even the sweetest resident of Who-ville (Cindy-Lou Who, remember her from those three pages in the book? Now she's a main character!) is so stupid she can't tell the difference between Santa and the Grinch in a quickly-made Santa Suit. Then this film raises whole new levels of bewilderment when we see the REAL Santa shop up briefly too. Does he bring additional presents to everyone? Isn't that kind of derivative? ARE presents the true meaning of Christmas then? There are some moments that I genuinely liked about ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", but I really don't feel like it captures the book it's based on, or even the season it's meant to comment about. Technically it's magic, but the story is a contradicting mess. I still have some small affection for it, but there's nothing that this film brings to the table that you couldn't find in the animated special from 1966. They knew it too because they jack several moments from that original story and throw them in here, even if they don't fit. They managed to turn ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" into a bag of smelly socks, it's downright embarrassing. ""How the Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is a movie that you THINK is great, but the more you look and really analyze it, the more you'll realize is genuinely weak.

103,stormhawk2021,Finding the spirit in a hollow soul,6,6 December 2018,"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is nothing short of a classic representation that there is good in everyone, it just takes time and effort to find it. This extra-ordinary Christmas story written by the well respected Dr. Seuss is brought from comics to life by director Ron Howard who puts his own twist and taste to the story.Jim Carrey, the Grinch, is a citizen of Whoville, a place only found within a snowflake that reveres Christmas more than any other day of the year. Judging by outward appearance the Grinch doesn't fit in, he is a furry green man who hates Christmas. Now the Grinch wasn't always this way, we find this out through the efforts of one little girl named Cindy Lou Who, played by actress Taylor Momsen, in her efforts to solve the mystery as to why the Grinch hates Christmas she begins interviewing many of the citizens whom have shared relations with the Grinch. In the set of interviews we find the Mayor of Whoville, Mayor May Who who could be the main source of the Grinch's hatred of this Holliday as Mayor May Who actively bullied the Grinch all throughout school and specially on Christmas, because they both had a crush on the same girl Martha May Whovier.Martha May Whovier shares the time at a Christmas party where the Grinch was ridiculed by the class because of the gift he brought to her, he destroyed the party and ran away never to be seen again as he climbed Mt. Krampus a forbidden place to go. The years went by and he became nothing but a story and a symbol of anti Christmas spirit. For Cindy Lou there was a simple solution, befriend the Grinch and invite him to the 1000th Whobilation as the Whoville Holliday Cheermeister. Although this was a genuine thought it turned out to be disastrous as he terrorized the party and later that night on Christmas Eve the Grinch makes his move to steal all the presents in the town leaving nothing behind. As the city mourns in the morning the Grinch makes his way to the top of Mt Krampus, Cindy Lou decides to visit the Grinch in a last minute attempt to change him, which turns out to be the successful attempt as the grinch experiences a change of heart (literally). The Grinch begins to feel the love of Christmas and finally understands the meaning of it, its not about the gifts but the people that are in your life.Overall a chilling story to bring together a family around Christmas time where we can all learn to never judge another person because of what they look like or how they act, we can all change.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Still has the same ending you all grew up with.I think that this movie will be loved by children for generation, unless a remake is made. If so, it better be as good at this or better.

It's not perfect, but it sure as hell is better than what some make it out to be. The only issues I can think of is maybe the pacing can be a bit sloppy and the overabundance of fog throughout this film can be a bit distracting in a few scenes, but neither of these really hindered my experience with this film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as the Grinch and everyone else did a pretty good job as well. The humor in this film really does hit and makes this film one of the more sillier Christmas films out there, and that's definitely not a bad thing. The story adaptation is pretty damn spot on with the book, and while that happens during the second half of the second act, I do appreciate that this film doesn't stretch the original story out, and instead, has a new story beforehand setting everything up. It really works well in my opinion and adds a lot to the original story without tainting it. Overall, this film, while it's not quite on par with the original animated classic, is still a staple in the line of Christmas films and I absolutely recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, as it is still a wonderful adaptation.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
106,fjhuerta-2,One of Carrey's finest moments,6,25 December 2000,"Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest ""serious"" performances (""The Truman Show"", ""Man on the Moon""), I've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any ""institution"" that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as ""Titanic"" shouldn't be taken seriously.On with the review. ""The Grinch"" is the sweetest, best looking, best acted, more enjoyable seasons film since ""The Nightmare before Christmas"". Both movies seem very similar, too, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both pack a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable.That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now.

110,kingofdanerds,A Christmas Tradition,7,31 December 2020,"You're a mean one Mr. Grinch! How the Grinch Stole Christmas was released in 2000 and was directed by Ron Howard (Opie from The Andy Griffith Show). The film most notably sees Jim Carrey as the titular character with Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and even Clint Howard making appearances as well. This film is in fact a retelling of the 1957 Dr. Seuss book of the same title and not a remake of the classic Christmas special like some people tend to believe. The film itself was the first feature film to be based off of a Dr. Seuss book. The film was a commercial success grossing over $300 million. The film recieved mixed reviews upon release but I have met many people who call it their favorite Christmas film. Is it though? (It is Die Hard)The Grinch is a vile green creature who lives on Mt. Crumpet. He lives with his dog Max and he hates Christmas. Why? Because he was mocked when he was a child for shaving his face or something like that. While the Whos down in Whoville prepare for Christmas, the Grinch plots to steal Christmas...This film is something. First of all, yes, I do try to watch this film every year for Christmas and yes, I also try to watch the far superior animated Christmas special. With that being said there is a lot of good things that I have to say and some bad things as well. How well does this film do in keeping true to the source material? Well, it has been quite some time since reading the book but I can say that they get most of it right but they add lots of extra things as well to the point of too much. I mean, this film is 110 minutes long!!! So yes, the film is a little too long. The whole theme of the story was the expression of love (which they get right) and that Christmas is not about presents and the materialistic items (which they do and do not get right). Yeah, the whole thing about how Christmas is about family and what not is often contradicted which is somewhat annoying. With this film being much longer than what it needed to be, it takes quite a while for the Grinch to even contemplate about stealing Christmas. All of the extra stuff added is not bad, but I would have liked for the film to get to the main point of the film. Now, let's talk about Jim Carrey. Yes, he is absolutely insane in this film and it is quite genius. Jim Carrey as the Grinch is a different type of portrayal than the Boris Karloff Grinch. Yeah, it gets to be a little too much at times but it is truly a unique and fairly memorable performance. None of the other performances in this film can even come close to Carrey's performance. Kudos to the people who did the makeup on Carrey. Truly fantastic. The humor is something that has often been criticized. This is a PG film but the film has some truly crude humor that, while I find funny, perhaps should not have been in this film. There are 2 or 3 instances where this happens. Now, besides the crude humor, the humor overall still gets me to laugh with every viewing. Not every joke sticks but there are still plenty that do. Now while it is somewhat unfair to compare this film and the classic animated TV special, but I need a comparison to make my point. Color. This film, structurally looks like a Seuss work. But lacks the color. Colors are dull with really the only stand out being green. A common complaint is what looks like the ""smeared camera"" which I never really noticed unless it was in a flashback scenes. Speaking of flashback scenes, let's talk about the Grinch and why he hates Christmas. This film goes and tries to give us a reason why he hates Christmas. Alright, fine, but it better be clever even if it is not really meant to be mentioned why he hates Christmas. This film trys to explain it by saying that it was when he was in school and got mocked. But to me, it seems that he always hated Christmas as seen in the part where he eats the Santa plate. But then the narrator goes and says (after the flashback) that nobody knows why the Grinch hates Christmas. Really? Ugh.....How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a film that is not a perfect film but it still holds a place in my heart. Jim Carrey really carries this film. This film is a tradition to watch on Christmas for many.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

112,RhapsodyReviews,A Christmas Film with Many Flaws.,6,23 December 2019,"Review:
'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a Christmas comedy-drama film directed by Ron Howard. It is based on Dr. Seuss's 1957 book of the same name.
Jim Carrey as a Dr. Seuss character is crazy. I mean that in the best way. I loved how he became The Grinch. The cartoon is still far superior, but this is an okay movie. You just can't compare the two.
Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Whos, an almost mutated sort of Munchkin-like people. All the Whos love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch (Jim Carrey). The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos, whom he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), decides to try befriending the Grinch.
But I say, The Grinch is really good, it's something I grew up with, and watch every Christmas today. The Grinch is a good character, all the Who's are creepy looking, you're better off skipping the Whos' scenes and just watching Jim Carrey perform.
This movie had about 70 extra minutes to tell the Grinch's story and yet, somehow, they didn't succeed in making the sentimental parts of the movie work for me. I get it, a Christmas movie needs to have a happy ending where everyone celebrates the true meaning of Christmas, spending time with the people you love. I've seen it all before and I will hear it again, I just think that a movie needs more than that to work. You can't just travel the road of Christmas trope after Christmas trope and hope that that's going to get you a good movie, because it's not. This movie, however, is not that. It is exactly what you would expect, but it's not as good as you might want it to be.
However, this movie is not as bad as what I first believed it to be, or what most of the population believes it to be. It's a retelling and reimagining of a story, so you can't expect a new masterpiece.
Overall, this movie is perfect to get your family around for the holidays. Jim Carrey's performance is fantastically over the top and funny. It's not original even though they had plenty of extra story to tell, but they had fun in little scenes they did have.

114,TuckMN,What happened to the great story by Dr. Suess?,2,20 November 2000,"This movie's budget of $115 million dollars was primarily spent on lavish and exotic sets, incredible make-up, special effects and wonderful props. Of course, I am sure that Jim Carrey got his cut too.But it just proves that throwing big money around does not make a good film.Director Ron Howard has taken the delightful 26-minute children's Christmas fable by Dr. Seuss and padded it, overblown it and turned it into an over-long mish-mash of effects with little-to-none of the heart and soul of the original.  It was also definitely not directed for children  but for their parents.  It also has the biggest make-up crew of any film I have ever seen.This movie does exactly what the cautionary story by Dr. Suess warns about: Christmas is not in the trappings and money spent  it is in the heart  and this movie lacks any heart whatsoever.The sound editing was near perfect; however, the best songs come after the audience has left the theater.  If you are going to see this movie sit and wait for all the credits to roll: there you will find the best music in the movie.No one but the rubber-faced Jim Carrey could have carried off the role of The Grinch.  It would take a hyperactive over-actor like Mr. Carrey to pull it off through all the layers of latex and dyed Yak fur that he is encumbered with.Christine Baranski is always a delight to watch  though she is given little motivation for her character. The rest of the cast could just as easily have been done as animation.  But wait!  Isn't that how the original -- and still the greatest  version of this delightful story was done?",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
115,Matthew_Capitano,One of the Top Ten WORST Films of All-Time,1,25 December 2012,"Ugly, cheesy, noisy, messy, film adaptation of Seuss' classic animated holiday story.Sloppily directed by Ron 'Opie' Howard with a broader-than-broad performance by Jim Carrey in the part of 'The Grinch'. There is absolutely no warmth or charm in this train wreck of a film - and even less comedy. The Grinch eating glass did not make me laugh... it only made my teeth hurt. A modified script depicting 'The Whos of Whoville' as shallow individuals doesn't help.

Whoville,9,20 December 2018,I must have seen this film around twenty times as my daughter loved it and insisted we watched it a lot.Its starring that great comedic actor Mr Carey and he plays the part well. its the simple story of the Grinch who is like a funny but miserable scrooge like character who hates christmas for reasons you will find out when watching it....It has many Characters from a town called Whoville and and they all have very pronounced and funny noses. Its a colourful happy film even though the star of the show hates Christmas.

However the films side characters feel much to rude for a Seuss work, and the backstory given to The Grinch gets cheesier as I get older. There are many things that make me come back to the film, as it is very well made, and has since become a Christmas Classic in its own right, but if you compare to the book or original cartoon you will find something to be desired. But on its own it's a hilarious Christmas romp.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
118,cofemug,"Pretentious, commercialized crap",2,4 December 2000,"Let me say that making this movie was an abomination to the meaning of the story, and, unless the quality was good enough to overcome such feelings, the people behind this project have their hearts two sizes two small.I hated this movie.  As much as I love Carrey (his one bad movie is Ace 2), this movie should have reigned him in just a little, and yet used his talents.  But, alas, Ron Howard couldn't say ""no"" to a superstar.  The movie then had the difficult job of stretching the small book into a feature length movie.  This is difficult, but it could have been done, maybe in musical style or some other way.The movie seemed to want to become a musical, but it didn't.  It had the ""i want to be a hit single,"" sung by Cindy Lou Who ""Where Are You Christmas?"" While I really liked the song, it was unnecessary, demeaning, commercialized, and insulting to my intelligence.  I think that the song should have been the intro to a musical version of The Grinch or something.Another thing that is bad is the whole new plots.  The actual book really doesn't start for an hour.  They spend almost an hour on WHOLE NEW MATERIAL. Once the actual story comes into play from the book, the movie is actually quite good, but before then, bleh.  First, they make the Whos greedy.  The Whos were never greedy.  They had lots of material items because they could, but they never embellished their happiness on them.  Their happiness came from their heart and from the Spirit of Christmas, not from anything else. Next, they gave The Grinch a traumatizing childhood.  I don't know if this was added as a response to the Columbine shootings, or if they just were trying to attract more groups, but it DIDN'T WORK.So, the movie's first hour sucked.  The movie also lasted too long.  It was TWENTY MINUTES LONGER than South Park.  It had less plot or storylines to keep it moving, and it dragged its feet and plodded along.  There was so much that could have been cut out, the childhood memories, the unnecessary chorus-leader thingy, etc.  CUT IT DOWN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY PEOPLE.THE GOOD NEWS:  Ok, I guess that I liked Carrey acting like Carrey, to a point.  It just would have been so much more endearing in a different movie. The styles were fantastic, along with the devilishly cool camera-work. The whole movie is almost over stylized, but so were Dr. Seuss' books.  If anything, go see it for the sets, the angles, the hairstyles, the clothes, Carrey's make-up, etc.  Its the only reason to go to this waste of celluloid.2/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
119,FeverDog,I really enjoyed hating every minute of it.,2,4 November 2003,"Throughout THE GRINCH I laughed one (1) time, at a throwaway joke about a cash bar. But, generally, this is probably the worst holiday movie I've seen (well, maybe it's not quite as boring as TRAPPED IN PARADISE). I kept getting distracted:-Why did some characters have snouts but others didn't?-Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the Grinch Have Two Mommies?-The movie's secular worldview. Are there no churches in Whoville? Much was said about the true meaning of Christmas, but no mention of the birth of Christ. I'm not religious, but do acknowledge the birth of Christ.-And, speaking of, are there no Jews? I'm awaiting the sequel, HOW THE MESHUGGA STOLE HANUKKAH.-Are there other towns in the snowflake? Is that where the Jews reside, or did they move to the Whoville equivalent of Florida - in the drop of a hurricane's rain?-Why was the visual texture so fuzzy and indistinct, the sets so creepy and unpleasant? Isn't this supposed to be a kiddie movie? -Why didn't the little girl recognize the Grinch in the Santa outfit? Was she stricken with blindness during that scene, or just stupidity?There are other points I've already forgotten, but the biggest thing I hated was the general message. So, someone who hates Christmas is automatically a freak who should be pitied. Guess that makes me one, too.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

At first I was skeptical about a movie conversion of this Dr. Seuss masterpiece, because I didn't think it would make the cut, it would be a turkey, or in this case a roast beast. But as I watched it, it turned out great! Jim Carey never stops making me laugh, and with a few emotional scenes. The man is back with green once again, but there were some scenes that didn't look like it was faithful to the book, there was more background to the Grinch's character, but I can forgive them for that, this was also touching as the cartoon was. Especially when the Grinch finally had a big heart, it made me feel all warm inside, Jim Carey was a perfect Grinch. Perfect for the holidays. I recommend this to everyone to kids from 1-92, it should be shown during Christmas, so you can all have a green Christmas. And the soundtracks were also great and wonderful.

124,mbhgkmsgg,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,3,6 December 2020,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas was not enjoyable, in the slightest. I know that for many, this film is a Christmas tradition and something they love. But seeing it for the first time now, I just wasn't able to find anything to like about it.The biggest problem is the type of humour that this film relies on. Although this is a completely personal problem, it doesn't change the fact that I didn't laugh once during this film. Or maybe I'm just a Grinch. The quippy one-liners might work on the youngest of the family, but they did absolutely nothing for me. And while there are a surprising number of jokes directly aimed at adults, they fell just as flat as everything else. I'm sure that if I had seen this film for the first time as a kid, I would've probably liked it much more. And I'm also sure that kids seeing it for the first time now will really like it. The music is great, and the set design and attention to detail are genuinely impressive. But when the character on the poster ends up being the most annoying thing about the movie, it's impossible for me to like it.That brings me to the characters and the other problem I had with How the Grinch Stole Christmas. When the most likeable and relatable character is a dog, I think that something is off. Max, Grinch's dog, is wonderful, and easily the best part of this movie. Cindy, played by Taylor Momsen, isn't half bad either. Unfortunately, every other character was either annoying or had such a small part that it didn't matter. And as I said, when the main character, whose name this movie carries, is the most annoying part, there's really not much that the movie can do. Again, this is nothing but a personal problem, and as such, it's no wonder that so many people do like this film. I don't think that the writing is that bad either. The type of humour that this film so heavily relies on, unfortunately, isn't the type of humour that I like.I did, however, appreciate the strong stance that this film took against the over consumerism of Christmas. It's evidently clear from the very beginning that Whoville has turned into the capitalistic dream of Christmas. And as we follow Cindy's fight against this ideal, and her attempts to make Christmas what it once was, we have to ask ourselves whether we have fallen into the same formula as Whoville. Most Christmas movies tend to focus on simply making us remember that Christmas isn't just about gifts. How the Grinch Stole Christmas, alternatively, pronounces gifts basically as the root of all evil. As the reason, the Grinch became who he is.Although How the Grinch Stole Christmas has a good heart and an important message, I couldn't bring myself to enjoying it. When a comedy fails to make you laugh, even once, there is something wrong. And while I'm at least partly to blame for that, there wasn't much else to like either. Max was awesome, but that's about it.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
125,robert-259-28954,"The best Grinch, ever.",10,25 December 2012,"This film—one of Ronnie Howard's crowning achievements—was a triumph of perfect casting, namely in the person of one Jim Carrey. I have always believed that Carrey is our greatest living physical comedian, nearly eclipsing even the great Buster Keaton. But even Keaton couldn't have pulled off the part of Dr. Seuss' most memorable character, especially the superb vocal component (the featured song, ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" proves his astounding vocal control and versatility). Without his inimitable gyrations and astounding facial contortions, this would have been just another holiday film (albeit a gorgeous one), without a heart. And the fact that Carrey pulled off this tour de force weighed down by the uncomfortable and claustrophobic wardrobe and facial prostheses he endured for months, is a miracle in and of itself. He still managed to reveal every detailed nuance and humorous facial feature in this one-of-a-kind feature film, one that will never be repeated. With all of the bad holiday films that typically come our way this time of the year, this is one that will stand the test of time. It's certainly become one of my favorites, never failing to make me laugh out loud. It's drop dead funny, hilariously satirical for the adults, and equally entertaining for the kiddies, while never losing sight of it's objective—that Christmas is a time for redemption and joy—a very difficult feat to perform, indeed. Even more wise was the decision of Howard to clearly allow the singular humor of it's star to shine through, unencumbered, for the world to enjoy.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

128,cutter-12,A vulgar and loud insult to Chuck Jones,4,4 December 2001,"One hopes the screenplay, from the man who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit, might have been more clever and sharp than the product the incredibly talentless Ron Howard, and Jim Carrey (talented, but only when he's given some restrained direction ala The Mask) came up with in the end.Carrey does have a couple of good moments as he always does, but more times than not he mugs the jokes to death. Subtle he is not, and anyone who loves the original Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon as I do knows that subtle nuance is what made that cartoon a masterpiece.The Grinch should be more subdued rather than manic, shrewd with his mannerisms rather than in your face with them. He should have been presented for the first 30-40 minutes with some mystery, some build-up, some method to his madness as he presides over Whoville and comes to despise the sounds of Christmas' approach until he can't take it any more. What we get instead is instant gratification, throwing the Grinch at us in all his glory in the first 5 minutes of the story, then it allgoes downhill faster than his rocket sled from there. Until the last half hour anyway. The finale, as the Grinch decides to steal Christmas sticks mainly to the cartoon despite a modification or two, and is actually quite entertaining. What came before though was quite simply a mess.Having the Grinch's sad childhood depicted was just the worst possible direction the story could have gone in. Why do we care what the Grinch's backstory is. It could have been hinted at in the dialogue instead of shown. Howard has repeatedly shown in his films that he has no idea how to develop a character through thoughtful direction. Instead, like a previous member said, he just pulls out the giant mallett and hammers the character into our heads. Also, why couldn't the Who's have been depicted more like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz, just there to forward the plot along and not saying anymore than they should. Who cares about the overbearing schmuck of a Mayor or Cindy Lou Who's parents, or the fact the whoville beauty queen is in love with the Grinch. It's obvious Howard went after a kind of Munchkinland feel to Whoville, but again he hasn't got a clue what made that movie great either. There's just too much useless dialogue and subplots. Superfluous, as Cindy Lou says.If someone like Rob Reiner or Robert Zemeckis had directed this it would have been given the comedic treatment it deserved. Howard needs to take a trip back to Mayberry to relearn what funny and sophisticated comedy is.In addition to the overdone antics, the Grinch is shot looking straight at his face too often. The best angles are his profile or at an angle. The make-up does not resemble the Grinch at all looking directly at him. There are moments when the production DOES look spot on but they are few and far between.Carrey is a pretty good choice for the Grinch, if someone would ever tell him to keep his yap shut, but the first hour should have been erased and redone. Ron Howard must be the culprit for the tatty way this production was handled.The attractive production design, Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou ( what a little sweetheart!) and a few of Carrey's better moments aren't enough to save this one from sliding over the cliff.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

131,GuyCC,A Fun Holiday Movie For 2000.,8,23 November 2000,"I've been reading the comments on ""The Grinch"", and I have to say that they seem a little harsh.  In fact, I even think I saw a review saying this was comparable to ""Batman & Robin"".  No, no, no.  Nothing could ever compare to that mockery of a movie (but several have tried), and while ""Grinch"" has a few little nitpicks, it's certainly not a bad movie.The story itself is all too familiar, but now it has a lot of backstory and exposition and everything else.  Initially, it sags a little at times, but immediately picks right back up before ever really dropping the ball, and as it gets closer to the Grinch's stealing of Christmas, it really picks up and doesn't stop from there.  But you have to look at this objectively: It's a children's story with whimsical characters, so it gets silly at times, and overall, that's fine.  What I didn't like were the camera speed up/slow down effects.  *MINOR spoiler* There's a scene where the Grinch is driving a miniature car, and after he wrecks it, has to escape before it explodes.  This escape is done in slow motion, and this totally just seemed to say ""Hey!  This is a big budget Hollywood film! Explosions are practically mandatory!""  But then again, this isn't exactly ""Die Hard"" either. It does the same effect later for another scene, and it still bugged me.  *End minor spoiler*
I think the film could also have gone without the references to current trends, jokes and happenings.  I think it would have kept more of a timeless quality that way.  But it was still a fun ride.The sets were great.  During a visit to Universal, I had a chance to see these sets up close, and they looked the way they should, and translated even better to film.  While Tim Burton would probably have done a fantastic job with this, the sets were appropriately Seuss regardless.  Colorful, weird, and imaginative all the way.I've noticed some people saying that Jim Carrey was wrong for the Grinch. As his third green cartoon character (Mask and The Riddler being the other two), he was back to the Jim Carrey of 5 years ago: Totally offbeat and just nuts.  And it was nice to see him briefly return to that again, and it shows that he's pretty comfortable with both his comedy and drama roles.  But something happens to Carrey as he begins to steal Christmas: He completely transforms into the Grinch, right down to the posturing, facial expressions and dialogue from the cartoon.  The gradual change was a complete shock to me, and it left no doubt in my mind that he was more than perfect for the role.  The costume looked great and it turned out to be more effective than I thought.The little girl who played Cindy Lou was pleasant for the role (proving that not all child actors are annoying), and her interaction with the Grinch was fun.  Anthony Hopkins was fine as the Narrator, and while Boris Karloff made a great Grinch/ Narrator in the original cartoon, the man passed away over 30 years ago.  There's really not much that can be done about that.  Even the dog was entertaining.
The music?  I always like a good James Horner score (barring the over-played ""Titanic"" theme, and they even fit the songs in from the cartoon, so there's no disappointment there.So ""The Grinch"" got a little too silly for itself at times, but The Grinch himself was good, the sets were amazing, the adapted parts from the book and cartoon were surreally accurate, it had a decent message, and the narration even had Seuss-style rhyme.  It's a film that you can take the kids to, or just sit back and enjoy all the eye-candy.  You might even find some nostalgia in there as well.  If you look at it that way, then there's really nothing to complain about.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, necessarily, just pointless, which is almost as, well, bad. Amazing how all this money was spent and the final product doesn't even come close to either the 10-page story (or however many pages it was) and the 1/2 hour-long 1966 cartoon.Visually, this live-action Grinch is perhaps the best rendition (the Grinch himself, that is; the live-action Whos look ridiculous), but that's about all this movie has over the other two. Compare the flawless narration of Boris Karloff to the lackluster narration of Sir Anthony Hopkins (who sounds as if he'd rather be doing anything else; I got the strong sense that he was bored to tears doing this) and you can't help but wonder what's the point. Compare Thurl Ravenscroft's rendition of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" to Carrey's spastic rendition and you'll want to sew Jim Carrey's lips shut.Finally, compare the pacing. This story didn't need to be more than a few pages or half an hour long. Yet, somehow, this film is 104 minutes! 80 minutes, I can perhaps understand, but 104? Why, for example, the protracted role of Cindy Lou Who? Not enough justification to make a movie, I'm sorry to say.

The same beast is sought after by a sex craved woman.The director tried to rip off the Munchkin Land (a la Wizard of Oz) look of the town and does a real poor job of it.  There is a lot of camp in this movie which is really poor quality (maybe the director should have watched some old Batman on TV to find out how to get it right).If you are taking the kids I suggest Rugrats in Paris which is a thoroughly entertaining film for both children and adults.

136,andrewmerritt-31652,A fun christmas movie for the whole family,8,14 December 2018,"How the Grinch Stole ChristmasHow the Grinch Stole Christmas is based off of the popular book by Dr. Seuss and stars Jim Carrey as the Grinch. I want to first point off that the movie has nothing to do with the book at all until the last hour. It has nothing to do with the book that there is a scene where there is an explosion. I'm not an expert, but I don't believe that when Dr. Seuss first wrote the book he thought to himself; you know what would make this book even better is if I added an explosion. But hey we don't know that, but I don't think that was the first thing he thought of. It's really not a bad movie as people think it is as people have described it as an abomination to the cartoon and how the movie doesn't do it justice. Will it ever be as good as the cartoon? Absolutely not as it plays out like a kids movie, as they sneak adult humor that you won't understand, but when you are an adult you'll understand what they're talking about, but they still keep it family friendly. Say what you will about this movie, but you can't deny that somewhere deep in your brain that you were a little impressed on what Jim Carrey went through to portray the Grinch. Every time I watch this, it still blows my mind that beneath all that Grinch makeup that's Jim Carrey and I can't imagine what was going through his mind when he took on that role, but in the end it pays off. Ron Howard is also the director of the Grinch and I like how he took the book that we grew up with and flipped it upside down. I'm not a fan of backstories as they sometimes have nothing to do with the movie, but I like Ron Howard decided to add a backstory that you sympathize with the Grinch and hate the Who's. They do a nice job of balancing the movie as one half gives us a detailed backstory of why the Grinch hates Christmas so much and the other has him stealing Christmas because you cant focus on one half and leave the other half that you remember reading stranded. That's like an insult to Dr. Seuss. So overall, this movie is perfect to watch during the holidays, but if you watch it other than the holidays, than it's not the same and while it may not be better than the cartoon, its still entertaining. Don't listen to the haters, watch this movie and forget about the book.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
137,darkjosh,"""It's Whoville, says Ron. God, What Has He Done?""",3,7 December 2000,"Ron Howard's take on The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a thoroughly uneven, much too dark, and often violent film that stumbles a fine line between cartoonish children's film and dark, adult comedy.Plot synopsis is unnecessary, because the story is extremely well known and the title says it all: a Grinch steals Christmas, only in true Hollywood fashion, the tale is trumped up with millions of dollars in special effects and elaborate production design, adding nothing to the story.  As the Grinch, Jim Carrey gives it his best, but he is hampered by unfunny lines and Ron Howard's stiff direction.The first half hour of the film lacks any magic or laughs; Howard doesn't seem to know how to unfold the story and instead relies on the twisted scenery and often grotesque makeup of Whoville and the Who's to give a sense of an imaginative film.  The set design seems more nightmarish than cartoonish however, and could easily have been pulled out of a Tim Burton film: curved, dark, twisted, and sparsely lit.  It just does not fit. Equally out of place are scenes of the Grinch chewing glass, popping a red hot screw in his mouth, and engaging in drunken driving.  At one point I was expecting to see Carrey actually murder one of the Whos in a blood bath.Then there's the little girl who portrays Cindy Lou Who, Taylor Momsen.  She delivers her lines as if she's acting in a school play: example: *in whiny voice* ""But Christmas is blah blah...blah blah blah...*  Haley Joel Osment she ain't.  SNL's Shannon and the always sharp and fabulous Baranksi are both wasted as two women who appear to be engaged in a bitter rivalry. After their first scene together, however, this apparent subplot goes nowhere.The Grinch is mired in scenes of grotesqueness and a truly nightmarish set design.  Ron Howard's inept handling of the classic Seuss tale can't even be saved by a tremendously make-upped Jim Carrey.  There are few inspired laughs, special effects to cover up the gaping holes in its pacing, and two very forgettable songs written probably to push the CD soundtrack.  It's a heartless treatment, and call me a Grinch, but the spirit of Christmas is dead in this heap.3 out of 10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
138,Hotoil,Make it go away...,1,7 December 2000,"I had hope.  I love the Grinch, and while I had my doubts about a live-action version stretched out over four times the length of the original, I knew it could be done and I know Jim Carrey was passionate about this project...But it stunk.  I was with my father and my sister, who both adore the story as well, and even they came out disappointed.  Aside from how ridiculous it was having on of the most over-budgeted, over-advertised and over-merchandised film of the year try and preach about commercialism, it just didn't work in it's own right.  A lot of the film was just down right spooky (the grinch as a young schoolboy, an over-the-hill Christine Baranski's breasts being shoved in our faces constantly) - they essentially made an average Hollywood kids movie our of a classic story that deserves better.  Most of the movie is an entirely new story, with few redeeming moments, and when the real Grinch story finally begins, about an hour and ten minutes into the film, it had already exhausted my hopes and interest.
There were a few good moments. Jim Carrey's version of the ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"" would be great if it wasn't trapped inside such a horrible movie.  But, during many parts, it seemed people around me were amused - even the millionth time they played the dog walking on it's hind legs for laughs.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

140,michaelgarykelley1994,"Plenty of Laughs, Plenty of Flaws",10,18 December 2013,"It's quite odd how we can enjoy a movie so much when we are a kid, yet find so many flaws and face-palms once we watch that very same film again as adults. Ron Howard's remake (or re-imagining) of Dr. Seuss's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is one of the best examples of a film I adored as a child, yet find many little problems with it now, at the age of nineteen. One of my best, most faint memories of my passed Christmases was my amazing grandfather taking me to the theatres to see this movie. I was excited because I knew the old short, and even owned it on VHS. My grandfather was excited to see more Jim Carrey comedy. We had a grand old time, I must say. To this day, we still have a spot in our hearts for this soft-hearted little film. Most people consider the greatest films on the planet are the ones that take us out of our lives and place us in a world that we've never experienced before. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is my favorite example of such a film.An unexplained green creature, called the Grinch, hates Christmas for the solo fact that it brings back the worst memories, which--in turn--made him the bitter, lonesome thing that he is. When on the parole to wreak a few mishaps in the town of Whoville before Christmas, he meets--and saves, as a matter of fact--a young girl named Cindy Lou. Cindy sees the good in the Grinch. Cindy believes that ALL people have good in them, but can sometimes be driven to bitterness through careless actions by others. This sets the film into motion, with Cindy Lou trying to get the Grinch to join the little place known as Whoville for a big, wonderful holiday bash.To begin, I must immediately state a major bravo for Ron Howard, for he has accomplished such a notable film for the Christmas season. As I have stated: there isn't many movies that take you into another world completely. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" succeeds phenomenally at that. Ron Howard's directing is excellent, with all the set designs extremely well-crafted and suitable for Whoville. Even the mountain the Grinch lives in looks fantastic.In this film, Jim Carrey gives one of the most amazing performances in history. From what I've heard, he had an enormously hard time dealing with the suit, claiming it was extremely painful and hard to move around in whilst wearing (take notes Christian Bale). Not only is he hilarious, but he even gets the emotional moments of the film down so well that you cannot help but be moved a little on the inside. When you see hope on the Grinch's face, it truly touches you. Another bravo to Jim. Another standout was Anthony Hopkins as the narrator. Anthony gives a fantastic reading for the film, and definitely adds his own charm to it. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I can't say too much. Every role besides the Grinch and Cindy Lou were tiny, partial roles, so many of the other performances just weren't too extravagant. Cindy Lou was played by a seven- or eight-year-old, so you have to let her bad moments slide a little. This young girl plays a fine role, for the most part, and even has her very own moments that considerably warm your heart. The one character arch I thought was a little pestering was the slutty Martha May. Dear Father in Heaven, let her hang from Wholimbs upon Whotrees within Whoville.The writing is very interesting, in my opinion. Many, many subplots were added to the old, simplistic, thirty-something-page story to make it a nearly two-hour-long film. Besides the irritability of Martha May, I found other characters more of a necessity for this expanded version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". The jokes, for the most part, are only funny because Jim Carrey breathes a LOT of life into them. I laughed aloud many times, that much is true. Jim really knows what he is doing. He also plays off of the other characters very well, like with the ""Cheermeister"" sequence. No matter what others tell you, there is a heart underneath this mass of skit-like comedy. Think of it as you do untangling the Christmas tree lights for decorating; it may be a bundle of mess, but giving it time lets you learn to appreciate it.The soundtrack has to be mentioned! I consider ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" to be a fantasy film, in a way. This soundtrack helps develop the tone and atmosphere so well, and I think it is a major plus the film has going for it.Overall, many people will be divided on this little Christmas candy, but I am definitely for it. It could be that I grew up with it. Nostalgia tends to grasp me when it comes to me reviewing movies. However, I don't think it is just that. I see a genuine attempt at a warming film underneath the bundle of story and characters. My score for Ron Howard's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a seven-out-of-ten stars. It it fun, but I do enjoy the original much, much more.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

But he seems to have taken an off day for the big-budget Dr. Seuss adaptation 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. 'Grinch' is a mess, drowned in special effects and gaudy production design, and it completely misses the point of the original story.Howard does something here I would never have thought possible: He makes Jim Carrey unfunny. I am not kidding. Carrey is just NOT FUNNY. Oh, he gives it his all, milking every joke 'til it's dry, but his performance, I am unhappy to report, falls flat. It's truly depressing to see a great comic actor in a spectacularly bad role.The overcompensating script by 'Roger Rabbit' authors Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman doesn't help matters. It tries to 'explain' the Grinch's antisocial behavior. I admire the effort, but that's just not a good idea. The movie does have one good thing in it: Taylor Momsen, who steals the show as Cindy Lou Who. Momsen is the only actor in the movie who understands what she's doing.Howard piles on the sap in the final act, and I groaned more than once during those last 10 minutes.

147,Denver53,Not much that is new,6,27 November 2000,"It's tough to rate a movie that tells a story we all know by heart. Knowing the story takes away from the surprise factor. The question is no longer ""what will happen?"", it is ""how will it be depicted?""In this big screen version of the cartoon many of us grew up on, there is an effort to provide some back story as to why the Grinch is a Grinch. But the effort is feeble, and hardly explains why this creature would remove himself from contact with others (aside from his dog) for years. Get mad, yes. Ostracize himself from ""whoo-manity,"" no, at least not without assuming some serious mental problems.The 'Hoos (or Whose, whatever) are an odd bunch. Some are tiny, but most are the same size. They have odd little pig noses and big ears. But really, they seem like regular humans in make-up. Shallow, uninteresting humans, but still human. This takes away from the sense that what we are watching is a fantasy world different from our own lives. There is an opening scene that brings us to the Hoo world (and out again at the end), and for all its effort to symbolize a journey to a magical land, it really seems like so much fluff and a half-hearted attempt to get us to buy into what we are supposed to believe.Jim Carrey is, well, Jim Carrey. I have a hard time picturing anyone else who could have been the Grinch. Carrey adds some heart to an essentially heartless figure, and some of his trademarked manic humor. I wish he had been allowed to use *more* of that, to make the Grinch seem a little mentally unbalanced instead of simply lonely and grumpy.The rest of the cast is essentially lost, with the exception of the little girl who plays the Hoo who believes in the Grinch. Her parents, the neighbor (inexplicably dressed in a cleavage bearing outfit, though she seems as asexual as could be), the mayor, and everyone else is interchangeable and unmemorable.I fear this Grinch movie will be one of those ""holiday family films"" that will show up each year on the networks (a la Home Alone). It probably deserves that fate. It is just interesting enough for kids to watch and not nearly good enough to be a must-see film (such as The Wizard of Oz).

Completely inferior to the animated original.For me, the animated Grinch special was a special part of my childhood, and yes I proudly count myself amongst the diehard loyalists who border on the word ""nerd"", that had a genuine dislike for this movie. Granted, it really is difficult to take a cartoon and spin it into an hour and a half feature, but the way this film is shot, is completely obnoxious in every sense of the word. You get the feeling that Carrey and Howard weren't proud of this film as it caused them to betray their artistic sensibilities in favor of a really big paycheck. ""The Grinch"" is a far inferior live action remake/adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss character where it's lead character is an obnoxious buffoon, it's Jim Carrey in green makeup. Jim Carrey living up to his persona of being Ace Ventura. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Carrey, but I can honestly say I despised this movie 100%. ""The Grinch"" is a movie that feels genuinely fake, where you can't take yourself away into imagination and fantasy because all you really see on screen is just a bunch of movie sets and some makeup, there's no connection to the material that makes it feel like the cartoon.

Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie ""Yes Man"" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show ""Gossip Girl"" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now.

The Whos, except for Cindy Lou, are a bunch of cold-hearted ugly-looking creeps - you'll actually wish that the Grinch succeed in his plans to ruin their Christmas.

Or Krusty the Clown as to why he let his name be attached to shoddy products?Ron Howard's 2000 film adaption of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic is an abomination. It takes an illustrated children's book and attempts to stretch its story into a 104 minute feature film. The concept was doomed from inception. Even the brilliant Chuck Jones' 1966 animated version was only able to get its 26 minute run time with the addition of songs and lengthened action scenes. So, imagine all the padding needed to stretch out this children's story into 104 minutes. It's not pretty. Watching a manic Jim Carrey mug for the cameras to drag out numerous scenes gets very tiresome.What sets it apart, though, from the other misguided attempts to adapt Seuss stories to the big screen is that it's a crass piece of Christmas commercialism based on a story that is against crass Christmas commercialism. ""What if Christmas, (the Grinch) thought, doesn't come from a store. What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more."" That's the message of both the book and its terrific animated adaption.

And it's all so blatant!Both Ron Howard and Jim Carrey have done far better work, and to their credit they've both expressed misgivings about this film. Unfortunately, this awful film stands as a major blemish on both of their careers.In sum: a film bereft of both artistry and a soul despite being based on one of the Christmas season's most beloved works of pop culture.

160,SwingBatta,"How ""The Grinch"" was desecrated: Carrey is buried in depressing remake",3,28 February 2002,"The 1966 cartoon special ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas,"" co-directed by recently deceased animation pioneer Chuck Jones, has stood the test of time for over thirty years. It's a freewheeling masterpiece about the eponymous yuletide-hating green monster (voiced flawlessly by Boris Karloff), who is so mean and grouchy and so lovable at the same time. He had no complicated reason for his disposition, and there were no forced morals woven into the plot. Sure, he changed his ways in the end, but it wasn't shoved in our faces. It was, and still is, just plain fun. And who didn't sympathize with his loyal yet long-suffering dog, Max? On the flipside, this inevitable live version, directed by Ron Howard, does one hell of a disservice to Dr. Seuss's story. Where do we begin? The weak, preachy script reeks of modern-day political correctness. The sets are poorly designed and claustrophobic. The supporting characters are meaningless. There's even a (gasp!) love interest. And yes, there is dialogue about how Christmas ""doesn't come from a store."" (Meanwhile, the movie opens to all of Whoville in the midst of a collective shopping spree. Hmm.) The convoluted screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, who both penned the still-unrivaled ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""Here, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) is a maligned and misunderstood recluse. The film explains his nasty nature in a very unpleasant and utterly pointless flashback scene, in which he throws a temper tantrum as he is teased by his classmates. The role of Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, in her film debut) is expanded simply because there has to be the obligatory lone character who sees good in the crabby Grinch. Speaking of seeing, some cartoons were not meant to be seen as live versions (this spelled the downfall of the two ""Flintstones"" films). With all due respect to Carrey's painstaking effort, which included three-hour sessions in the makeup chair, that company definitely includes the Grinch. Think what a live movie starring Bugs Bunny would look like, then immediately clear that sacrilegious thought from your mind.The movie is three times longer than the cartoon, and it resulted in a lot of excess baggage, particularly Carrey's overbearing yet familiar slapstick routine, which was used in order to fill screen time and perhaps take the audience's attention away from the script deficiencies. Despite having a Golden Globe Award to his name, Carrey's film career is in danger of being remembered solely for such minutiae instead of his otherwise solid acting.
By now, you may have already surmised that I'm in favor of the animated classic. (On a side note, I saw the trailers for ""Grinch"" while watching another animated classic, ""Chicken Run."") There's no gentle way to say it: this celluloid defecation is an insult to Dr. Seuss. I don't think I have to elaborate any further on that. Never mind the plot, the characters and the depressing atmosphere of Whoville; what viewers will find to be the most traumatizing scene in the entire film is seeing the Grinch in lederhosen. 3/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
161,FilmFreak94,Truth Be Told... I Like It,8,7 December 2011,"Ron Howard's interpretation of Dr. Seuss' classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" retells it in a sort of modern way. It draws a lot of influences from both the original book and the classic short from Chuck Jones.The basic premise is the same, the creatures called Whos all love Christmas, but The Grinch does not so he tries to ruin it by taking all the decorations and presents away. But there are a lot of tweaks they did to expand the story. This movie goes into detail of The Grinch's past, as a child he had a crush on a young girl Who and tried to impress her during Christmastime. But all the other kids laugh at him causing him to eventually snap and take out all of his aggression on the holiday. Not the best origin but it could've been a lot worse.We also get a sort of contest the Whos do every year at Christmas called Whovalation, which Cindy Lou invites the Grinch to. Without giving too much away(for those select few who haven't seen the movie yet)these scenes can either be viewed as a interesting interpretation of the original story or be seen as a blatant attempt to make the movie longer than an hour. In fact the Grinch doesn't don his infamous disguise and steal the presents until the movie is thirty minutes from finished.This movie is either a hit or miss for most people. For me, I thought for what it was it was a pretty good movie. Sure they could've toned down the adult humor(compared to Cat in the Hat though, it's nothing)but they did manage to capture the spirit of the book by the end of it. Jim Carrey does an acceptable performance of The Grinch while giving his own comedic flair into the character(which again is hit or miss). The rest of the supporting cast does well to give the movie a unique feel. The visuals of Whoville and Mt. Crumpit are very pretty and feels just like a live action Dr. Seuss book.Overall this may not be a movie everyone can enjoy but if you take it with a grain of salt and get past some of the crude humor you might have a good time with it.

164,director9ff,Jim Carrey wasn't in makeup; that's how he REALLY looks,2,18 October 2001,"Seeing as Christmas is approaching, and it's tradition for people to write jolly (or not) reviews for films, and Hollywood to make un-jolly films for them to review... hold on, I'm sorry, it's really approaching Halloween. But remember: This is scary!Anyway, I'd better warn you about something: Jim Carrey really looks like himself in this film. Those clips you've seen with him getting buried in makeup? Played backwards; they're putting makeup on him so he looks rubber-faced.Special effects look good in this film, but really, do you expect us to believe that there's a town inside a snowflake? No! Also with bad features:Jim Carrey's in it-enough said! Unneccesary subplots like Cindy Lou Who's biography makes the film go on for 13 hours! We can't believe that a tunnel will take you upward and harm you!More is that they do not change the ending. Come on, (spoiler) for one, it's telling you to give up on your dreams! I mean, Al Gore doesn't push the Christmas stuff that he stole from Whyville over the mountain! Don't tell me that it was in Dr. Suess' story; it still tells you that dreams are silly!Also, there is no point to remaking good films anyway. What do I mean, you ask? Psycho, Planet of the Apes, and now this piece of ****. And to think, we pay money to see CGI-and-nothing-else films like this!Rating: -86566/6PS: Notice that I never said one specific word from the title?

165,pleiades10,Excellent remake of the cartoon classic,8,15 November 2000,"I just saw ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" last night at a local Washington DC premier party. Overall... an great movie that will stand the test of time, much like the original cartoon special itself. Jim Carrey BECAME the Grinch, much like he throws himself into all of his roles (see ""Man In The Moon""). Lots of ad-lib-style comments from Carrey as the Grinch provided chuckles. The first half of the movie explains how and why the Grinch became bitter toward the holiday season, and establishes the mayor of WhoVille as a villain in his own right. The second half of the film catches up to the familiar gift and tree stealing plotline from the original series, and fleshes it out with more scenes. The sets are incredible to watch, and don't be surprised if there may be times when you don't catch some dialogue because of the scenery.
Taylor Momsen is delightful as Little Cindy Lou Who, the child who's persistence in discovering the good inside the Grinch, ends up saving WhoVille's Christmas. Jeffrey Tambor plays the thoughtless and subtly cruel Mayor of WhoVille to a ""T"", and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
Ron Howard also pokes fun at himself in several scenes, stealing notable images from movies such as Backdraft, and even having the Grinch direct his dog Max in a scene, wearing the same style hat that Howard wears when directing his films!I was surprised at the inclusion of two PG-13 style visual jokes (involving a female character's breasts, and a dog's rear-end), and for the parents of young children, these may be embarrassing moments that you may dread having to explain to the youngsters.But overall, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is an excellent movie that reminds young and old of the true meaning of Christmas in a pleasant and charming way.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
166,rams_lakers,Waste of money & time,1,2 July 2004,"I am totally embarrassed to have actually spent money to see this in the theater. With that said, I am shameful to admit having sat through it. Looks like I have nothing better to do at the moment than critique a movie most people have seen already. A horrible adaptation to the classic book I loved as a kid. It was Carrey mugging through the whole film. Carrey is a funny guy, but this was just overdone and lame. I got sick of his antics after 20 minutes. If they would have stuck within the limits of the book and done a half hour show it would have been better. Seeing stupid additional crap was blasphemy, who cares how the Grinch was as a kid. That stuff is better left unsaid. Why are people obsessed with having to know the entire background of a famous villain (Darth Vader, etc) rather than leave it in a shroud of mystery.The only thing that's worse than this movie is the soundtrack. Poorly made up songs with stupid lyrics. I wouldn't even let a 5-year old listen to it for fear of corrupting the poor child with stupidity. Stick to the cartoon and book, which are timeless classics.Most kids love this movie (do they know any better? They also love today's sorry cartoons) most adults and anyone with a full developed brain will hate it. I liken it to sitting in a room for 2 hours with Jar Jar Binks. You'd feel like strangling Carrey's Grinch!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
167,archiecm,Mostly funny but has incoherent nonsensical moment mid-film,7,25 December 2013,"I think the Grinch role is perfect for Jim Carrey's style -- overact and ham it up (when he's doing comedies at least). I have come to enjoy that from him. The Grinch story Dr Seuss wrote is genius. But there are plenty of praises already written among the 450 user reviews of this film published here. I had trouble with the middle part. Cindy Lou feels for him and invites him to town to receive an award. I don't think this was in the original story and the disaster that arises from this scene spoils a lot of the film for me. After getting a trophy and some praise, he is force-fed food and drink that he clearly doesn't like or want. His arms are nowhere to be seen and I have to assume that he is being restrained so he can't push the food away. It goes on for five minutes at least. At the lowest point in this torture, he has a tube jammed in his mouth and is force- fed such a huge quantity of liquid that he almost explodes. I found this unfunny. I found it repulsive and sick. That's no way to ""honor"" anyone. The Grinch reacts by throwing things around and calling them names and finishes by burning up their town tree. His anger is justified. What is Ron Howard trying to tell us? That the town that teased him as a kid still has a sadistic streak? That was never Dr. Seuss' message. For one thing it justifies his next act which is to steal Christmas. I think, therefor that it is a flaw in the film. It's still a good story. If one forgets that center lapse one can enjoy the rest of the film. It has a touching message: Christmas is in the heart.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
168,brianlion,HOW RON HOWARD AND JIM CARREY STOLE MY MONEY,4,10 November 2002,"Oh, good, Ron Howard and Jim Carrey are getting together for a remake of the Grinch! This is going to be movie magic. I loved the Grinch on TV! What-a-dis-a-point-ment! I usually love Ron Howard directed movies. And Jim Carrey movies are some of my favorites. This movie never gets off the ground. For starters, the town's people just don't translate well from the cartoon form. The mayor is just boorish and boring. Cindy Lou-who, so cute and innocent in the cartoon, has too many silly lines and dull scenes. I never bought the idea where the Grinch is honored by the town. Ron Howard should have realized that many people who take their kids to the movie, also watch the movie with them. I guess the standard set by the beloved cartoon could not be met by the movie. The movie sets are more goofy than charming, and so is Jim Carrey's performance. He had his moments, but weighed down by a bad script and a bad costume, he failed to add to my holiday cheer. You're a bad one, Mr Grinch!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
169,Ken-208,Excellent - One of this year's best movies,9,6 December 2000,"I really thought this was a great film.  I was expecting an average film based on the comments in IMDB but I was surprised by how good this film was.I think the purists are the people who criticize this movie. If you are expecting the movie to be exactly like the cartoon then maybe you won't like it.  Of course if they kept it excactly the same it would be a short 20 minute movie.I'm glad they didn't try to make the movie exactly like the cartoon.  I think some parts are better then the cartoon and this movie is certainly a lot more funny.  They have taken the story of the original cartoon and added a lot more to it.  If they had just done it like the original then there would not be much point in seeing the movie.  This movie has all the charm of the cartoon, plus you get to see what happened during the Grinch's childhood that turned him into the Grinch.This film also had more humor then the cartoon.  Some scenes were hilarious and some of the ab libs or creative ideas thrown in made the film very good. I'd give this movie a score of 9 out of 10 stars.If you like Jim Carrey, like special effects, or like to see creative films then see this movie.

It's not just the simple story of the grinch stealing Christmas... it's how he came to be and why he has so much hate in his heart. As serious as the movie is, it's also very funny and heart warming.

172,Speechless,Ugly and lifeless,1,5 December 2000,"There's nothing more distasteful than a movie that helps perpetuate the very evils it supposedly tries to protest.  With this live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for instance, we have a movie that, like the original cartoon, tries to launch a thinly veiled attack on the American consumer culture.  But this movie is a product of the very same ridiculous excess that Seuss tried to discourage.  It is one of the most expensive movies of all time, to the extent that it may just barely turn a profit if it makes more money than any other movie this year, but a huge portion of its budget is completely wasted.  Why hire such expensive actors if you're going to hide them behind those awful rat-nose prosthetics?  Why hire the $20 million Jim Carrey and then render him unrecognizable with 40 pounds of latex (and do half his performance with CGI anyway)?  Why even make the movie in the first place with a script this grating and unbearable?Watching the film, I got the impression that it would have been infinitely better if it had been directed by Tim Burton.  Just look at Edward Scissorhands, or his stop-motion masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas--Burton clearly understands the bittersweet 'feel' of Christmas better than any other filmmaker in Hollywood.  But then, of course, I realized why they went with Ron Howard.  They obviously approached Burton first, but he replied, ""A live-action version of the Grinch!?  Are you guys NUTS?""",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
173,waterman1976,Funny and heartwarming,7,12 December 2020,"Jim Carrey is excellent as the Grinch.

The fantasyland is like a big theater with all of its colours and larger than life villagers and the underlying story of greed and appearances doesn't take it too far. I hadn't seen this before, but I can imagine watching this next year again.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
174,ARTaylor,How Ron Howard Stole the Grinch,6,11 December 2011,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a film adaptation of the always memorable 1957 book by Dr. Seuss. The story was already adapted into the classic 1966 television special featuring Boris Karloff the Uncanny. How does it hold up compared to these and other Christmas movies? Not particularly well.To say something nice first, the film looks great. If ever you wanted to see a Dr. Seuss book come to life, this is it. The set design is terrific. The blend of miniatures and computer generated imagery is fantastic to the point where stuff looks very convincing. The make-up effects were good enough to win an Oscar.Jim Carrey does a great job. He obviously is having fun with the role, getting to play as over the top as he wants. His usual silly improvisation works well with the role. He also does very well in the make-up, able to perform many facial expressions that don't look real. That one iconic grin appearing to be digitally enhanced, though it wasn't. And once the movie gets to the book/special parts where the Grinch is actually stealing Christmas, Carrey shines and makes the movie incredibly fun.The rest of the cast is okay. They are all overplayed bordering on camp, but I guess that was what Ron Howard was going for. Taylor Momsen does a decent job in her first starring role, but Cindy Lou is portrayed as far too over-the-top sweet. Every scene she's in seems to punch you in the face with how sweet she is and how cute she looks. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as the narrator, but he's got such a good voice he could make the phone book sound interesting. This is about where the good stuff ends.The TV special had directly adapted the book, so to turn it into a full length feature extra content had to be added. Some is welcome, most is not. I do like how they expanded on the relationship between the Grinch and Whoville since the original story did not have much. The concept of why the Grinch hates Christmas is good in theory but the way it was done was lousy. The whole ""Made fun of as a kid"" thing has been done dozens of times before and doesn't help the original story's true message (more on that later). The entire Whobilation sequence is dumb, tedious, and seems to exist only to fill up space. Howard had some fun and Carrey got to be silly but it hardly helps the plot in anyway. You can skip past it and not miss anything.Ron Howard is mostly known for his dramatic movies. Backdraft, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, and even Parenthood was more of a dramatic movie with comedic elements. And he seems out of his element by doing this campy, silly style. He would have done better with a dramedy like Parenthood. But this just isn't his style and it shows. Other directors can pull off camp with style but Howard, like Spielberg, is better suited for drama with comedy added.The biggest problem with the movie is that it completely reverses the message of the original story. Originally, the Grinch didn't understand the true meaning of Christmas and it was the Whos who made him see the truth. In this movie, the Whos are over-commercialized gluttons who only care about material things and it is Grinch who makes them see the truth. What? Did the producers ever even read the book or watch the special? Didn't anyone involved ever say, ""Hey, you got this backwards.""? The reason the Grinch is a grinch is supposed to be because he just sees the material things and thinks that's all there is. Later, he realizes that stuff was only a representation of feelings. Here the Whos are all self-centered jerks, except for overly sweet Cindy Lou, who represent all the negative things about the Christmas season until the finale. As with any adaptation, fans will tolerate any change as long as the spirit stays true to the source. But this movie was not faithful to what Seuss was trying to say. If the movie had just stuck to the original story and just expanded on Grinch's misconceptions about the season, the movie would have done very well. After all, he's supposed to be the hero and villain whereas here he is simply this green goofball doing random things up until he actually performs the title deed.Children will probably enjoy the silly antics and goofy setting. Though my little brother (who was three when the movie came out but I don't remember when he did see it) was terrified of the Grinch for years after seeing the movie because Carrey can be intense for the younger ones. Adults will probably find the story to be dumb and full of fluff. Fans will enjoy how Carrey performs the role but may find the story to be too drastically changed. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, there's plenty better about finding the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the classic TV special is readily available wherever this movie is sold.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
175,foxhound-37781,Jim Carey's golden egg,9,4 February 2020,"You can look at this as a Christmas movie or you can look at this as a Jim Carey classic. either way you will love it from start to finish. The story of a young girl, Cindy, trying to get the dreaded Grinch in on the Christmas spirit in her local village of Whoville is something that's a recipe for laughs and chortles.Jim Carey is the WMD of this film, he is an absolute gut busting crackup as The Grinch, his on screen antics are relentless, intense and just pure gold, especially when Cindy first goes to visit him on his mountain and he's just screaming at her and insulting her at every turn and even if he's hidden behind 5 kilo's of makeup and costuming his facial expressions throughout the movie are parallel to none. He is absolutely hilarious all the way through and that's the only way I can describe him in ""simplest"" form.How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a full on slapstick/family style barrel of laughs. I work in retail so Christmas is always a bit of a stressful time of year for me especially with two young kids of my own, but I always look forward to seeing movies like The Grinch and National Lampoons and Home Alone when December rolls around again. They're always movies that remind me of the spirit of Christmas and that it should be a happy and entertaining time of year.

176,stiv-7,Why?,3,9 January 2003,"Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under ""Films that should never have been made."" This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special.

This in my opinion is one of Jim Carrey's best films, he is so darn funny and a comic genius. The film is obviously big-budget, but it works tremendously, especially the set design and the hairstyles of the Who's. It has a lot of humorous dialogue, and you don't catch it all until you see it a few times. The soundtrack is great, the acting is good, the scenery is spectacular. The storyline sticks to the original, and adds a lot of new elements, such as The Grinch's family backstory, a young girl who befriends him, and the evil Mayor of Whoville.

The plot is simply to thin and drawn-out. It circulates around the Grinch, a green monster who´s terrorising the peculiar citizens of Whoville. He simply doesn´t enjoy Christmas, but a sweet little girl tries to change his mind.Positive things about the movie are the set-pieces, costumes and the effects, they are well-made. And Jim Carrey, of course. He is perfect as the Grinch, even if his performance reminds a little too much of his role in ""The Mask"" at times. But the funniest scenes are definitely the ones with Carrey and his charmy dog. The rest of the characters are extremely irritating and thin, with the possible exception of Taylor Momsen´s Cindy Loo Who. If I got to decide how the movie ended, the citizens of Whoville wouldn´t get any presents at all.

186,Fredichi,How Hollywood Ruins Classics,3,28 November 2000,"There is so much wrong with the Grinch...but primarily it's just boring and unnecessary and that is the main feeling that kept coming up while I was sitting in the theater, watching this expensive experiment, waiting for it to find a point or direction. Did it want to be funny? Yes, most certainly so. Was it? It was about as funny as it looks, which is to say...not very funny...unless Jim Carrey squeezing everything he can out of a seriously not funny script...is funny. Whose brilliant idea was it to use a script penned by a team whose last effort yielded the disaster that is Wild Wild West? Come on. If you start with a bad script, which this definitely is, when do you ever get good movie? Seems like they purposely didn't write any jokes, figuring Jim Carrey would just improvise....It doesn't work well...actually not at all. One or two laughs...okay maybe three or four...But they aren't big ones. Howard stretches and stretches and stretches the story out....like it needed to be 1 hour 45 min. How about 1 hour 15...it could of been a nice short well paced movie and that was what you were hoping for the whole time. Unfortunately, the movie suffers the most from being just plain boring....everything good is buried under bad filler. The best parts are when it takes literally from the book...with Anthony Hopkins's narration and Jim Carrey's responses...although they never use it to it's full potential and it's too little too late. Another problem is the Whos...they're just obnoxious...you want the Grinch to ruin it for them. You want him to eat a couple maybe! You want someone to smack them in their ignorant and not so wholesome heads! Also there is this stupid subplot about what is Christmas...is it commercialism?...Hypocritical trash coming from a movie who has more tie-ins than most movies this year. Other questions that come up while watching (not after), which is a really bad sign:Why is the Grinch talking like that? Why is the Grinch manic?Why isn't the dog funnier?Why isn't the Grinch funnier?Why do the whos look like that? Why are they so annoying? Why does it look like they stole the Flinstones' set?Why is my foot itching? Am I still watching this? Is it over?I wonder how much this cost? Why is Molly Shannon in this? Why isn't she funny? Why oh why did they do this? Really so many other directions could of been taken and they chose no real direction at all. They touched on some. They teased you a bit but never followed any good ideas through. Well maybe half-ass spastic zannyness...they followed that through in spades, which was not what Dr. Suess was ever about. Suess seemed to be about dignified fantasy based on very real morals. Not Jim Carrey playing a bipolar fur ball, in Universal backlot heaven. Which leads to production design. The production design teeters between really good and god-awful. Whoville being a backlot seems to take most of the blame. The only winner here is Rick Baker's makeup...which sometimes is downright scary...it carries the movie.  Ron Howard really needs to find his own personality. He is always imitating someone else. First Spielberg with Backdraft, then Cameron with Apollo, and now Burton with this.  Should of left it alone. A story you all know and loved done perfectly as a cartoon which is probably why you'll spend the whole time picturing the cartoon and that great curly Chuck Jones smile that they gave the Grinch and of course the unforgetable voice of Karloff. Stop messing with stories we all love. Try thinking up something more original. If you want to pay tribute or homage to the stories you love, follow Burton's cue with Nightmare Before Christmas. A very original tribute to the stop-motion holiday specials...and look he didn't have to ruin a classic did he.Although Burton himself seems to be losing track of this idea. Sleepy Hollow... and now Planet of the Apes.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
187,ridiculonius,Wonderfully Funny and Heartwarming,8,13 August 2008,"I am not a huge fan of cliché, commercial X-mas films, but I saw this movie when it first came out, purely out of love for Jim Carrey. I was NOT disappointed! Sure, it is in possession of a Hollywood ending, and a romantic back-story to boot, but I found this both hilarious and touching.Following the plot of the original cartoon and picture book by Dr. Seuss, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the tale of one Grinch, masterfully played by Carrey as the bitter but witty green man, and his loathing for Christmas and all it stands for. The film goes deeper into his past, explaining that he was constantly mocked for his bitter disposition and hairy face as a kid, but when he finally got into the Christmas spirit and crafted a homemade tree angel for his heart-throb, Martha May Whovier, everyone simply laughed at his gift's lack of sparkles and beauty. Ashamed and heartbroken, the Grinch fled to Mount Crumpit, his only purpose in life to despise the holidays and all the Whos who loved it. Of course, this leads to his dastardly and outrageous plot to steal all the presents on Christmas Eve, therefor stealing the meaning of Christmas.I personally think that the movie, while embellishing on plots and characters like the darling Cindy Lou Who, had a good point to make; sometimes it seems like the holidays are nothing but material grab-bags for huge industries who take the opportunity to sell heaps of cheap junk to parents who are willing to fight to the death for their spoiled children. The Christmas ideal that is this rain of worldly wealth (oh, and a little good cheer) is happiness is sold to folk every day through advertisements and TV specials, and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the perfect stab back at those commercial standards.While this underlying message might detract from the overall plot and script in some movies, I think this one found a good balance; the kids can still enjoy the juvenile jokes and slapstick, while the adults can giggle quietly at the adult humour and the message.Overall, I found this a wonderful movie, not just at Christmas time, but basically all throughout the year!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
188,matt caccamo,** (2 out of 5 stars),4,24 December 2001,"Overdone, strangely unhappy film version of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (Theodor S. Geisel).  Jim Carrey stars as the infamous Grinch, who is so terribly sickened by neighboring Whoville and their Christmas spirit that he sets out to defraud the town and ruin their favorite holiday.  This film, while allowing Carrey to roam free and create some undeniable laughs, is overdrawn (and possibly scary to kids), and prevents us from using our imaginations like the original story did.  It does add some interesting background information about the Grinch (namely a rough childhood as a spurned outcast in Whoville), and provides some fun, festive moments. However, this is always diluted by the ugly appearance of the Whos in Whoville (were they pig-nosed and repulsive in the story-book?), and the Grinch's menacing demeanor.

They were quarried to make these sets.Ron Howard is a great director, but he hasn't got any unique style.  As much as I love Apollo 13, Backdraft and Ransom, they're not particularly exciting to look at.  He's just not the right director for something like this. Couldn't the idiot-execs look for someone else?  Tim Burton isn't the only guy in Hollywood with an imagination.  Okay, he probably is, but you'd think there'd be someone who can fake it better than Ron Howard.  In place of invention, we have only wonky camera angles.  `Hey, guys, put the camera on a 45 degree angle, that'll give it an other-worldly kind of look.'Jim Carrey, in the lead role, is as annoying as always.  Having toned things down for The Truman Show and even for Me, Myself and Irene, he's back to his old rule of comedy for The Grinch: loud = funny.  Look! at his arms flailing around wildly.  See! his face contorted into comical expressions.  Yawn! as you realise you've seen it all before.I haven't read How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so I can't say how this works as an adaptation, but I can say how it works as a movie.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work at all.  There's no magic, there's no awe or wonder.  And it gets the pace and the tone so wrong you'd think this was a first time director.  If this is how Ron Howard's movies are going to turn out from now on he'd better cross his fingers for a  Happy Days reunion.The plot, which is covered in 60-something pages in the book, is too thin for a hundred minute movie.  It is stretched more blatantly than Zsa Zsa Gabor's face.  The result is 50-tog padding, where the running time is allowed to drag at the expense of the pace.  The tone is lost completely. Most kids' movies have a few jokes that serve as a nod to the long-suffering parents in the audience, but the `adult' jokes here suggest that Whoville has racism, infidelity and wife-swapping parties.  Unbelievable.In place of charm, we get sentiment so cloying that tie-in sick bags would have been best-sellers.  The real meaning of Christmas isn't presents  it's about love, it's about being with friends.  The Grinch comes to realise this  an hour too late for my comatose backside  and celebrates Christmas in time for the finale.  Hooray!  We all come to realise that Christmas is about more than money and capitalism and commercialism.  The Grinch took more than 50 million dollars in its opening weekend. Merry Christmas, everybody!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
190,Grojniar,An Outstanding Family Film,10,24 July 2021,"Unlike most of my friends I didn't grew up with Christmas, I never even heard about it until I moved to Russia but even then I never concerned myself with it so all the knowledge I had towards it was from movies like this one and horror movie set in winter. Also despite my deep hate towards Dr. Suess he did give us, The Grinch, whom I honestly love as a character which my close friends are aware of. Regarding my lack of knowledge towards the holiday that this is based on I don't feel suitable to judge it's accuracy, but it's visuals, story telling and everything else is fair game. Visually it was done very well and the rendition of the story was nothing but an improvement. The casting couldn't have been and honestly I think Jim Carry was a perfect Grinch.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

192,l-62911,How can anyone even find this entertaining?,1,28 December 2016,"Wow, the summary title says it all doesn't it?Now as of me, I do enjoy a good Crimbo film every now and then. You turn on the telly, grab a nice drink of Cola or Coffee or even some random juice or something silly like that, and you enjoy a nice little film.Stuff like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Home Alone, It's A Wonderful Life, all that kind of wonderful stuff. These are beautiful Christmas films that has really good acting, some funny humour and of course something that'll tug your heart till you fall off your seat.Now you're probably thinking, why are you talking about other random Christmas films and not The Grinch my fellow bloke? Well, I say that because unlike all those other films I just mentioned The Grinch will probably instead immediately turn you into an absolute grouch by the time the credits start rolling.I'm dead serious, serious even to the bottom of my legs. I can not for the life of me stand this film whatsoever. Now before you all start chucking Tomatoes and broken TV's at me, I can STILL understand the appeal of this film so I'm not gonna whinge and moan at you all to not watch it because... you still can, I'm not greedy like that you know.What I am gonna do (for the others who don't wanna see it) tell you how awful this film is.First things first and probably most foremost, this is Jim Carrey at his absolute grating. Just look at him, look at him on ya TV screen. Running around, endlessly shouting, spurting out references the entire population will forget in under a second. Jesus, this Grinch gives the current CBBC presenters of today a run for their money.Another thing that's also foremost is Ron Howard's direction. (Spoiler alert: he's completely mis-directed) It feels off. Way too off for something like the Grinch, I can understand that he's going for a sort of wacky Burtonesque feel to it but in my eyes it makes the film look more tacky than it's supposed to be.Speaking of tacky, that sort of explains the jokes too. All tacky and rubbish like that crap joke you get in some cheap Christmas cracker. None of it stuck to me and I completely forgot about any of the jokes.And even at 90 or 100 something minutes, I honestly feel like the film's running 8 hours because everything is so loud and frantic you'll want to bash yourself on the head 8 million times and run around shouting ""THE NOISE! THE NOISE!"" so that the pain will stop.So any good stuff? Well, they kept that ""You're A Mean One"" song in (though it's a prime example I should be watching the far better Chuck Jones version instead).Ummm, Anthony Hopkins did a good job as the narrator. And Cindy Lou Who was the only one I even cared about, honestly I just wanted her to put the Grinch out his misery.So as you probably already knew, I hated this Grinch. Every minute of it was grating and I too now feel like a grumpy Grouch.BAH-HUMBUG! Yeah, you can all put it with your other Christmas classics, as for me I'm putting it in the bin with other Christmas clunkers like Jingle All The Way and Santa With Muscles so I never have to put up with anything like this again.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch the true version (Chuck Jones) so I can wipe those horrid memories away. Good day sir.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

194,homer_simpson91,A horrible movie,1,25 December 2001,"This terrible bastardization of the terrific original cartoon should never have been made in the first place. Right when Jim Carrey was starting to convince me that he could actually be a good actor (and sometimes even funny), he gives us this. Certainly his worst performance to date. Ron Howard's direction needed to be seriously toned down. The good makeup, the cute Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, and even Sir Anthony Hopkins doing the narration could not save this boring, deplorable and unfunny trash. Luckily, the original cartoon is good enough to survive total disgrace from this movie.2/10",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I assumed they were wrong but as the saying goes I made an ass out of u and me. Trying to take a 20 minute cartoon and stretching it out to 104 minutes just didn't work.

196,carlgt1,Shows how our society is continually dumbed-down,1,22 December 2000,"Well we have a dumbed-down president, and now we have a dumbed-down Dr. Seuss classic to match!  I don't quite understand the need to remake ""Grinch"" into a bad movie other than the corporate weasels needed to squeeze more out of the copyright & Seuss' estate (see the ""Tom Tomorrow"" cartoon). Jim Carrey shows that he is still desparately struggling to be a second-rate Robin Williams.  His ""ad-libs"" are predictable (scripted?) and useless -- they'll go over the heads of the kiddies but sensible adults will find them to lack wit and originality (unlike something cool like the original Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons).

198,toast-15,"It's not Dr. Seuss' Grinch, it's Jim Carrey's",7,24 November 2000,"I guess this movie is OK if you forget about the original and just go with the new one as if it were not a remake. My kids seemed to enjoy it but I just didn't. I tried to like the Grinch but it just didn't make any sense. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** They try to explain why he hates Christmas but even before anything malicious or cruel happens to him, we see him as an infant, bumping another infant out of the way, Then, as a baby, devouring a Santa plate with relish, then again as a small child drawing terrible things happening to Santa (which would of course, ruin Christmas for everyone) while he chuckles with glee to himself. In the book and cartoon, the motivation for why he acted and behaved deviously was never introduced so we never questioned it. But since this movie introduces the motivation, at least they could be consistent in the answer. But all they succeed in doing is showing him acting like a Grinch before he even becomes ""The Grinch"". When his heart grows, the Grinch goes into ridiculous contorted fits of pain and anguish, having the effect of ruining what could and should have been the most touching part of the entire film. At the end, when the townspeople finally accept him, he is still mugging and leering and just being a nuisance. ***END SPOILERS*** In the cartoon and the book (I know, I'm comparing...and that's where this movie comes up short), we end up liking the Grinch and accepting him. There is no motivation in this movie for anything like that and when we see others show affection for him, e.g., Cindy and Martha, there really is no explanation as to why...it's just in the script I guess. Come to think of it, the only people in the movie that I cared for at all were Cindy and the dog Max. Aren't there any likable people in Whoville? They look scary and act kind of mean.The set design was great though, although I found all the make-up distracting and I actually think it would have been better without all the makeup, even for the Grinch character. Jim Carrey has proved that he can do facial contortions, and the audience has the ability to use their imaginations, I think all those layers of makeup were just too much. Give some credit to the audience, we have imaginations too and we would most likely fill in wherever the overdone special effects were lacking but there was no need to do so. No need for imagination at all...everything was done already, whether we liked it that way or not. It could have been a great film, and maybe it is for some people, but I'm not one for all the glitz. Some humanity for the Grinch, especially at the ending would have been nice.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I have avoided watching it for years, angry that every wonderful little thing from the 60s must be redone and RUINED by Disney. This grinch is abandoned by his father because his mother slept with her boss? Really, this belongs in a Disney movie? Then he is apparently adopted, bullied in school and so runs away. Sweet little Cyndy Lu wants to save him and invites him down to town, and when he comes he sees his adoptive parents and says ""you're still alive?"" That's it! No emotions or love anywhere. Then, he morphs into an awful monster because of more bullying by the town. Got the message kids? Monsters are always created by bullying, never by wrong choices! If you can get past this you have a stomach stronger than mine.Terrible, terrible messages for little kids unfortunate enough to be subjected to this sad, long and terrible movie. The original animated one is lovely. THAT is the one that everyone should watch. Last, the movie suggests that you can be terrible, rotten, criminal and cruel for a long long time and it's going to be okay in the end. Haven't even finished the movie yet and shaking my head.

I unfortunatly bought into the hype and I spent eight dollars to see The Grinch.  This is one of the few times I should ave listened to the critics. This movie was AWFUL.  I don't remember in the cartoon Whoville being a dark and depressing place with no cheer.  The actors loked horrible with their makeup.  The first hour was a painful experience to sit through.  The first hour was the Jim Carey show and I did not pay to see Jim Carey walk around in the Grinch costume talking in a Sean Connery accent.  I paid to see The Grinch and it was nothing like it.  Where was the cheer?  Where was the colorful Whoville?  Why did Whoville look like a nightmarish place??? Your guess is as good as mine.,How the Grinch Stole Christmas
204,spirit11,Carrey's Makeup the Real Star,6,24 November 2000,"WARNING: These comments may reveal portions of the film plot.The big screen version of ""The Grinch"" works best when it sticks to the original story. While Ron Howard hasn't created a ""great"" film, it is still good, and most people will enjoy this diversion.STORY/SCRIPT: Howard had to build on the original 25 minute cartoon, so many things have been added to the original story you probably remember from your childhood. This isn't bad, since you learn much about what made the grinch, ""the Grinch."" But it also makes for a more sinister character -- one that eats glass, for example.SETS/SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow!!! Whoville lives! You'll see the color combinations, the animated effects, all brought effectively to life. And everything is seamless enough that you'll probably find yourself forgetting it is special effects. This is one very effective part of the film.MUSIC/SOUNDTRACK: Great fun. Especially effective is when the movie breaks into the classic, ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch..."" You'll want to sing along. But all the music is fun. Could the little girl have been dubbed? Sure, but why? Little kids are cute, and that includes their very off key singing, and I think that is what Howard was going for here. I thought it was fun.MAKEUP/COSTUMES: Here is where the movie excels. Carrey BECOMES the Grich. Not just a live version, but the actual cartoon version. When he smiles, it goes from ear-to-ear, just as in the animated version. And it works both as a sinister smile and a friendly smile. And the residents of Whoville likewise are impressive. Everyone builds on the characters in the book, makes them look real, yet lets the actors skills come through.ACTING/DIRECTING: Carrey is the best here. I found myself thinking of the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as ""The Grinch."" He shines through all those layers of makeup. The poor part is that the Grinch is either really bad or really good, and in the film becomes downright sinister. Result: he doesn't have many levels to play, so he doesn't. It's a bit flat as a result. Likewise, the rest of Whoville. The characters there don't quite make it either.PARENTAL WARNING: Parents, remember that this film is a bit meaner than the cartoon. This includes the acting, the story, and the directing. The littlest kids may be bothered by some of this.OVERALL: This isn't a classic, but it's not as bad as many have said. As one who went to see it to remember the cartoon, I found I should have stuck to the cartoon. That's okay. You'll probably have fun, you just won't need to go back to the film over and over.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

206,johnng45,Merry Christmas !,6,15 December 2004,"I watched How The Grinch stole Christmas. It's a good entertaining movie to watch this year. Ron Howard represented this colorful movie to his father. He remade this 1966 classic. Jim Carrey was chosen to be The Grinch. I think Jim Carrey was kind of odd and stupid in as the Grinch, but quite liked the clothes and the background made out by Custom Design and Art Direction and I found out that the Christmas meaning is not only the presents. It's about love. Family gets together for this wonderful Christmas every year. Family and family they sing the songs and eat foods. Christmas is for everyone including Grinch. Grinch looks ugly.

It suffers form stodgy direction from a usually reliable Ron Howard, and a dire script. However it has one factor saving it. Mr. Jim Carrey. The saviour of comedy. Even dressed up in green fur Carrey produces a magnificent comic performance, worthy of his recent Golden Globe nomination. Here's how it goes. Young Cindy-Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, cute but cringeworthy) is eager to find out why the Grinch is so hateful of Christmas, and tries to tell him that Christmas is not so bad. With a few bits of poetry by Anthony Hopkins, the narrator of the tale. I expected far better than this and while some parts raise a smile, especially when it's Carrey provoking them, it's still easily forgotten the morning after.

209,marcusman48,Watch the cartoon instead,2,18 December 2020,"Even though I've always loved Dr. Seuss, I was never particularly fond of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""; I was always more of a fan of ""The Cat in the Hat"" and ""Green Eggs and Ham."" And this film adaptation did not exactly cause my enthusiasm for ""The Grinch"" to increase.Both the original book and the animated TV special keep the story as simple as possible and get the lesson to the audience without any problems. But this live-action version is an incoherent mess; what's worse, it can't even get the personality of its title character right.In this version, we're supposed to view the Grinch as misunderstood and feel sorry for him - but Jim Carrey's performance makes that almost impossible. His Grinch, while not evil exactly, is one of the most uncouth and unpleasant individuals you'll ever see in a movie. To put it simply, he's a colossal jerk. Only a group of drunken college frat boys would find him anything less than extremely obnoxious. And what's worse, his aggressive behavior seems to stem from pretty much nothing; he's just a rotten person. With a personality this thin, the Grinch could be replaced with Oscar the Grouch from ""Sesame Street"" and the effect would be little different.And frustratingly, there ARE some good reasons to see this film. It's a joy to look at, and Carrey's performance is tons of fun for what it is. But the attitude you'll get from watching him is the same you get from watching Jack Nicholson as the Joker in BATMAN: he's full of energy and screamingly funny, but you never sympathize with him and if he were real you wouldn't want to be anywhere within shouting distance of him. Not very helpful when he's the main character and even the scenes in which he doesn't appear almost always focus on him.Making this film must have been like launching an asteroid at Jupiter: a tremendous effort put in to no satisfaction.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
210,Dorkboss,How the cartoon is superior than the live action version,2,1 September 2019,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on both the book and the short cartoon under the same name, by the author named Dr Seuss. Now If anyone who either read the book or watch the cartoon you'll know that both of them are completely under 1 hour, you can easily go through the story from beginning to the end around under 30 minutes, But how can an hour and 44 minute film do both the book and cartoon justice? (Spoiler: It doesn't)The jokes are both unfunny and awkward, the town known as Whoville looks cloudy and feels like the colors are muted almost if the camera lens has been wiped down by vaseline, the Whos looks weird and are competitive about Christmas and while the rest of the characters are uninteresting; Jim Carrey I can give him some credit for adding energy while wearing green latex, but for performance he's annoying.Overall I felt the movie was disimproving not only the book, but to the cartoon also, it felt unnecessary to add extra time to a simple short story that didn't have to be shown on a silver screen and that's why I consider the cartoon to be better.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Jim Carrey is Best Actor material for this role. It will take a whole lot to convince me that someone else is more worthy.  It is his best role to date.The Grinch is the best movie I have seen this year, and I have seen a lot. 
Ron Howard deserves a nomination at the least for Best Director. If this movie doesn't win Best Costumes, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Score, and Best Sound then they should shut down the Academy. NOTHING WILL TOP IT IN THOSE CATEGORIES.Of course, it's commercial success and the fact that the Academy seems to hate comedies and what it feels are crowd pleasing movies seems to point to them ignoring it completely.It is funny, it is uplifting, it is Dr. Seuss brought to life in the way we always wanted it to be.

I remember upon first hearing that Ron Howard was taking the Dr. Seuss book and creating it into a full-length feature I was shocked. Wondering how this could be done and thinking what a disappointment it would be. In reality how could you take such a wild story and cast it to remain true to the children's book which I love. After seeing the movie I was truly astounded at the awesome quality and I know that no one other than Jim Carey could have actually pulled off the role of the Grinch. As to all those who have rated this movie so mediocre and have called in overdone and blown out of proportion. I think perhaps they have lost their perspective in that the whole Dr. Seuss book is ""bigger and more imaginative than life itself"". To have produced this movie as a more ""down to earth, layed back and not overblown style"" would have been the tragedy. This movie is a joy to anyone who has never lost their childhood wonder and spirit of Christmas. If you don't love this movie I would ask myself, ""Where are you Christmas"".

The whole ""subplot"" was fine by me, even though it has purists calling for Opie's directing credentials to be handed over to the proper officials.I'm giving the Grinch 10/10 -- heck, even my eyes started leaking!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
222,TheDuke-2,Could have been better,6,10 December 2000,"Ron Howard generally doesn't disappoint me, but I think he cut too much out of this movie in the editing room then he should have.  There were people leaving the theatre asking themselves why didn't they have more scenes with the Grinch and his gadgets?  That is exactly my question, if he had allowed for another 15-20 minutes of the Grinch stealing presents this movie would have been that much better.  I guess I'll have to wait for the directors cut as always.  A decent kids movie for the holidays though.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
223,thebishop2,Errrr....it's okay.,5,28 November 2000,"If I come out of a movie, especially if it was hyped as much as this, and I can only say 'eh, it's okay' then it's really not okay.The film itself is visually rich. Everything is detailed quite nicely and the special effects are tremendous. Ron Howard is a director who's work I generally enjoy immensly. He tells a story well and usually gets the best out of his actors. Then comes this. The Grinch. I'll admit that I was looking forward to seeing it. I like Jim Carrey, most of his film except for Man on the Moon, but I'll save that for that review. The acting is good, You really can't recognize Carrey under the makeup. And he plays the part to a tee.But it's the storyline that bugs me. Why does Hollywood feel the need to center a movie around a kid? And then make them sing? Why add so much new story to a classic? I found myself almost dozing off right in the middle of the film. This movie would have been more enjoyable if all the children had been tied down and gagged. I like kids in real life, but not on screen. It's what I call 'Dan Ackroyd syndrome'. The formula doesn't always need a kid. The Pepsi girl isn't cute!! But I'm subjected to her before every film, just like these films do. maybe I'm just going off on a tangent because the film just didn't grab me. But if you see it for yourself, you'll see what I mean. I'm not saying it was bad, it's just not great. If I want to watch a christmas film, I'll watch the Christmas Story, at least the kids in that are real. They have defined personalities. Go check the Grinch, but at the dollar theatre if you can.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
224,jennifer-99,Merry Christmas to All...,10,27 November 2000,"I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months.  Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. 
It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

The Grinch and the Whos, even with their pointy noses, add to the immersion of the film.I lost a bit of interest around the middle (probably because I've seen this too many times) but the ending really pays off and is my favourite part of the film.

Jim Carey could have done such a splendid job of playing the Grinch; however, it seems obvious that Ron Howard allowed Mr. Carey to do his thing - unfortunately, it was severely over done! While I couldn't think of anyone more perfect to play the Grinch, someone needed to put a leash on Carey as he drastically overplayed and ruined this movie.

It was just a bizarre, poorly-written kiddie movie, which are among the worst kinds of movies. I'm surprise it did as well as it did. I thought it was pretty bad. There were almost no funny jokes, the Grinch was way too bizarre (the kid version of him was too sadistic also), and when those elements weren't being presented, it was filled with corniness often found in bad kiddie movies. The way the Grinch was written was what ruined the whole movie for me. He was just too bizarre and too sadistic. I'm sure Jim Carrey did what he could with it, but ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is one story that shouldn't have been made into a full-length, non-animated movie. I thought it should've stayed an animated, 1950s TV movie. This was an attempt at ""improving"" a beloved tale that failed miserably.

232,WWalrus,Awful slapstick version of a classic,1,26 November 2000,"The live action Grinch is so over the top it makes the eruption of Vasuvius which burried Pompeii look like a tea candle. It has so much unnecessary slapstick ""humor"" that the 3 Stooges seem like the height of sophisticated humor. It is like getting hit in the face with a 100 lb sledge hammer. The delightful story we are used to is gone except for a few minutes near the end. The Whos are made out as stupid nit wits who are more interested in how much they can spend on gifts and what they will get in return that I really didn't care if the Grinch did steal Christmas. The only decent, feeling Who is the little girl, Cindy Lou. The young actress playing her is wonderful. The only other decent character is Max, the dog, and he steals the show. Jim Carry is NOT the Grinch. He is simply Jim Carry in a green fur suit with lots of make up. He does not know when to pull back and let the story work. He always goes way over the line. But this is also the fault of director Ron Howard. He could and should have made Carry pull back.To give credit where it is due, the make up, set design and special effects are excellent. Unfortunately, the children today, raised on the violent cartoons of Saturday morning TV, will think this is the real Grinch and the classic tale will take second place to this misconceived mess.

Before I attack the character of The Grinch, let me state that I thought many things about this movie were very good.  The sets and lighting were wonderful, the little girl who played Cindy Lou was not annoying like most little kids are, and I thought that the story really moved along.  All of the things that were added to make this 1/2 hour TV special into a movie worked very well.Now, on to The Grinch.  This character seemed to be a culmination of every other character that Jim Carrey has ever played.  I saw pieces of Ace Ventura, The Riddler, The Mask, Andy Kaufman, etc.  This made it hard to determine what the Grinch was really trying to be.  Was he mean, nice, a comedian...what?  I think that if Jim Carrey had been a little less Jim Carrey than this movie would have been much better.  An understated Grinch would have had more impact than the overstated bumbling idiot that Carrey portrayed.  I'm not the world's biggest Jim Carrey fan to begin with, but by the end of this movie I was even less of a fan.  Three words:  Tone it down.I'd recommend seeing this movie, because it is interesting, and 'You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch' is a great song.

238,Low Man,Worth the price of admission.,7,2 December 2000,"I am, to say the least, not one of Jim Carey's fans, but he does a fine job as the Grinch in this film.I realize that extras had to added to this film in order to make it long enough to qualify as a feature film, and for the most part, the additions are fine.I am a professional musician, and what offends me most about this film is the stupid, sappy song that was inserted into things for no reason, apparently, other than to have a soundtrack to sell.  The song is sung by Cindy Lou Who, and it is as awful a song as has ever been written, not just because the child playing the waif has a bad singing voice, but because it is one of those plastic sappy songs that the public seems to buy in bag-loads these days.  Thank God that the Grinch Song (You're a mean one...Mister Grinch, etc.) from the original Chuck Jones film from the 60s was included, or I would have felt nothing but animosity towards this film.OK...that aside, I think this film does a fine job with the story.  A lot of the plotting as to how the Grinch got like he is, is predictable, but I can live with that quite easily.  Everything comes out fine in the end as it should, and we're left with a swell grin on our faces.  What more do you want from a shadow play?So...go see it.

Jim Carey is a master of physical control and exhibits it in this movie.  Perhaps I'm too judgemental just because it's based off Dr. Suess, but I just think there's something missing from the overall effect of the movie, and I can't put my finger on it.

Initially I thought it was just that old nagging nostalgia that plagues us all.  But I am not a huge fan of animated film, so this didn't seem to fit since I never really liked the cartoon version that well in the first place.  It hit me while watching the 1951 version of ""Scrooge"" starring Alastair Sim.  This version has little redemption!The back story created to fill time in this version ends up (possibly unintentionally) blaming the Whos for the Grinch's general grouchiness and meanness.  But deep inside we all want a truly evil creature (someone evil for no particular reason) to be redeemable.  It helps us feel that we are also redeemable.  This version of the story takes the typical Western ""politically correct"" position that no one is bad for no particular reason--that someone besides the perpetrator is responsible for the actions of the perpetrator.  But even Dr. Seuss seems to think that some people are bad for no particular reason as evidenced by the original version.Christmas is a time for redemption.  The whole reason for the celebration is the redemption of mankind.  And deep inside we all know that we need to be redeemed, even if we aren't as bad as the Grinch.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
244,pitfall_5000,An Outrage,1,16 December 2000,"First of all, I would like to say that I love Doctor Seuss, Ron Howard's films, and the stylistic acting of Jim Carrey.  Not even the three of them combined could make up for this film.The original Grinch is a classic.  No other word for it.  It stays true to the original Dr. Seuss story, and was very well done, from the animation to the performance of Boris Karloff.  Best Christmas special ever.  And, of course, when I went to this movie, I knew they would have to add a few things and elongate the story to turn this into a 90 minute + movie.  Fine. But I expected a lot better than what was presented to me as a viewer.I honestly can't find more than one good thing about this movie.  The special effects were lousy, the music was forgettable, and the sets were obviously cardboard.  Even the performance by Jim Carrey, hailed by many, was bad.  I don't see the Grinch as being eccentric, I see a grouch with no sense of humor, which is the exact opposite of what Jim gave.  Not only was his performance TOO over-the-top, the script was generally dull and boring. As you can imagine, I left the theater with a disposition that would make the Grinch look like a puppy in comparison.  I was also angered at the thought that thousands of children will be exposed to THIS Grinch before they see the original.And the original story was ripped to shreds.  The Whos are portrayed as being selfish and greedy.  They aren't in the Christmas spirit, they just want to outdo each other with decorations and presents.  Totally against the spirit of the book.  Dr. Seuss must be spinning in his grave.  Too much was added, in fact, so much was added, by the time they got to the main story, there was only 20 minutes left in the movie.  Then, they had to cram the rest of the story in, giving little credit to the actual story of the Grinch and his plot to ""steal"" Christmas.  There was little stealing, here.All in all, one of the worst, for everyone involved.  I don't think I'm being to hard on this movie, because it deserved it.  Maybe I should watch it again to see if I just didn't get it.  Yeah.  Or I could shoot myself in the foot. /**********     (0/10 stars)",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
245,lucas-42,The Holiday Classic Comes to Life,6,23 November 2000,"Alright, I've seen the 1966 cartoon over 100 times most likely... and I must admit, the more I watch it, the more I wish the cartoon was longer.  Well, this year I got my wish.  I will admit, that it isn't the easiest thing turning a short story into a two hour long movie, but Ron Howard pulled it off.  Yes, I do agree that Tim Burton should have been the one to direct the movie, but I still think that no one else but Jim Carrey could have pulled off the character of the Grinch.Carrey does lots of goofy things in this movie that you wouldn't have previously thought that the Grinch would do, but I think that if Carrey had made the character a little less goofy and a little more serious at the beginning of the movie, then maybe it would work.  Because the Grinch's character is supposed to just be miserable and grumpy, then when he's stealing the christmas presents, he could act a little more goofy because he's ""enjoying"" what he's doing.Either way, it's not Carrey's fault.  He does a flawless performance (as always) and can pull off an awesome grinchy smile.  Tim Burton would have caused the film to be darker and aimed more towards the adults.  This may have made the movie a little better (or worse, hey.. we can't prove Tim Burton could do it better) but that defeats the entire purpose of this film.It is not intended entirely for adults.  Yes, it was written so that it interests the adults as well.. but it was created for the kiddos.The beautiful world that Ron Howard created works perfectly though.  I loved Mt. Crumpet and Who-ville.  Who-ville is a town where straight lines don't exist, everything has to curve and bend (just like Seuss had always inteded) and that must have been quite a challenge for any director.  But he does pull it off nicely.The backstory on the Grinch (that explains why he hates Christmas) defeats the line in the poem ""The Grinch hated Christmas, he hated the whole season. Please don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason.""  But alas, they do give him a childhood and a love interest.  I don't quite agree with this aspect of the story, but it was interesting to watch and kept me entertained.The movie starts getting really good when it returns to the original story. The part of the movie where the Grinch prepares to steal Christmas. You'll note that Jim Carrey even sings the song ""Your a mean one, Mr. Grinch"" and does it really well.  Nice job!Jim Carrey seemed to give the Grinch an unusual accent in this film, it's like a bad Sean Connery.  I wasn't quite sure if it would work at first, but it does!The narration was down pretty well, but they did change up the original poem to work with the new story, so it's not exactly the same.All in all, this is a great holiday film.  It's not Ron Howard's best film, it's not Jim Carrey's best film, but it's a darn, gee-golly gosh, fun movie and I suggest that you give it a chance.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
246,cossallpsycho,Not as bad as it could have been.,7,27 January 2002,First of all I would like to say that this really isn't that bad a film. You've got to respect the makers for the amount of effort which has obviously gone into it even if the final product wasn't so good. Having not seen the original animated version I believe that I am able to give an un-biased opinion of this. Personally I think that Jim Carrey is back on top form with his highly amusing and eccentric portrayal of the Grinch. Admittedly some of the gags do the miss the mark but many hit the target full on and I found many suprisingly adult considering that this is a children's film. At this point in time I would like to congratulate the make-up department for their flawless effects and daring to make the big star of the film completely unrecognisable. 7/10,How the Grinch Stole Christmas
247,javold,Why the Grinch lived by a mountainside garbage dump,3,23 December 2000,"People seem to either love this movie or hate it.  I am in the latter group, because I love the story by Dr. Seuss and I cannot understand what Ron Howard has done to it.  In the original story, and in the cartoon that faithfully followed, almost no time goes by before the Grinch is cutting out his Santa outfit and trying to steal Christmas.  But in the film, quite a bit of new story is told before we start seeing ""How"" the Grinch stole Christmas, so much so that the film might be renamed ""Why,"" not ""How.""  And it isn't even a very compelling tale.  First, the Grinch moved to a mountain garbage dump because he was essentially driven away as a child by Whoville's mean-spirited youth.  Then, when he was invited to return, he was driven back to the mountain by Whoville's mean-spirited Mayor.  Where does all this come from?  Maybe the film's title should also recognize that there are in fact several Grinches in Whoville now.I much prefer Dr. Seuss's simple explanation, that the Grinch was mean because his shoes were too tight and his heart was too small.  After all, the story is not really supposed to be about the life and times of the Grinch but about the spirit of Christmas that overpowers even one as mean as the Grinch, a spirit so purely demonstrated, with and without the trimmings, by all the Whos in Whoville.The Whos in this film are not so pure: they drink booze, they envy their neighbor's Christmas lights, and they do say ""Boo-hoo"" on the morning after, at least momentarily, while the book's Whos are not even detracted from their singing.But maybe I am just ""bitchin',"" as Carrey's Grinch said when he slid face first into a Who girl's supple bosom.

248,Leahcurry,Cuter than I ever imagined (***possible spoilers***),10,25 November 2000,"I must admit, the only film I previously liked Jim Carrey in was ""The Mask"". Not anymore. I wondered if he was occasionally vulgar, but ultimately I thought he was cute and very funny. I thought the sets, makeup, and hairstyles were astounding, like the cartoon had literally ""come to life"". I didn't have a clue what the film would be like, and I wasn't disappointed at all. Jim Carrey's acting was inspired. I cannot compare Boris Karloff with Jim Carrey because they are both so different, but I like them both as the Grinch! I also appreciate that the quotes from the cartoon and book were in here too, but not so much that it got redundant. Jim Carrey was ""The Grinch"" as I never thought he could be!I thought that the way Ron Howard had lengthened the original story to fit a 2 hour movie was very good. Some of you, I know, will not think so, and to you who fit that description, don't be so hard on this movie. What else could they do but have a personal history of the Grinch if Cindy Lou Who wanted to find out about him? The cartoon should have been longer. The acting is almost completely over-the-top (except for the kind-hearted Cindy Lou Who, played by Taylor Momsen), but that is the way it should have been because this is a fantasy.The special effects Ron Howard also had a right to do. The Dumpit to Crumpit, Christmas light guns, flying sleigh, etc., were ingenious. You can't find special effects in the cartoon!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
249,dsl3001,how could there be a world inside a snowflake,9,11 March 2007,I really liked this film I think it is very very funny mostly because of Jim Carrey but it still has some funny parts with him not in it. I watched this film in theaters and I was only 10 years old at the time and I still liked it. though I was almost 11 my birthday is in January and I think this movie came out in November. I know that it came out in 2000 and I think it came out in November I'm not really sure but I'm pretty sure.If it did I'm very sure it should have came out at Christmas. first of all it is a Christmas movie with people who like Christmas and Christmas decorations and a Christmas feel to it. so if it came out in November it should have came out in December. The only thing I found weird about it is that it had all the things in the movie in a snowflake they had humans decorations creatures in a snowflake. If you don't like realistic worlds inside something that can't have a world inside of it then you should not watch this movie. but besides that I like it for other reasons.,How the Grinch Stole Christmas
250,Will_Scarlet,How the Grinch Stole the show!,6,21 November 2003,"I agree completely, this film looks extremely overblown, and it is.Though the sets and costumes are visually amazing, they go by too fast too be truly appreciated, and there is the feeling that it is too much crammed into too little.  Besides this, the supporting cast have very little to do, and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling.  Besides that, several weak story points are added, for instance, like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous.  However, if you want to see this movie, see for Jim Carrey, who steals the show as the title role.  He is simply hilarious!  He does, however, run a close race against Cindy Lou Who, who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie, and the cartoon, is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch.  In the cartoon, the Grinch is the villain, a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness.  The Whos, in the cartoon, are just simple, country townsfolk celebrating Christmas, and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas, he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life, and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie, however, the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character.  Actually, you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos, who, in this movie, are a grim reflection of our society, and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions.  The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them.  The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible, with their gaudy decorations and foods, and creepy, sugar-coated style.  Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own, and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday.  She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company, as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday, but to instead remember what Christmas is.  I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year, just to keep that image in mind.  But, if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos, or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes, watch it for Cindy Lou, or, if you don't like 'cute' movies like me, but like Jim Carrey's raunchy, slapstick, Marx Bros. style comedy, watch it for him.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

253,Towel Dude,Ron Howard's worst film,1,18 November 2000,"Opie's worst movie, and Carrey's least appealing performance since the Riddler.This movie has none of the magic, Xmas spirit, and abundant joy to found in Suess' book, or in the cartoon from the 60's.Yes, Ron has made clunkers before ( Grand Theft Auto, Willow ) but at least those films had some entertaining moments.  Grinch has none.  A stale, annoying, unimaginative unfunny miscalculation, on the order of past cinematic duds like Toys, Santa Claus:The Movie, and Howard the Duck.Jim Carrey and the screenwriters must share in the blame. Jim's antic schtick and one-liners fall deadly flat. And unlike Robin Williams' Genie from ""Alladin"", which was good fun and clever, Carrey's Grinch grows tiresome.What's most disappointing about Ron's movie ( and Carrey ) is that they commit the worst cinematic sin of all : they're boring.Add to that the most grating Xmas songs in recent memory.  James Horner seems to have channeled Barney the Dinosaur for inspiration.All the kiddies in the theatre seemed to share my view.

256,mcshermansmithy,My Guilty Pleasure,6,26 January 2014,"How the Grinch stole Christmas isn't great, but it's still enjoyable. Most of it comes from Jim Carrey, who steals every scene he's in as THE GRINCH! The girl who plays Cindy Lou is actually pretty decent, as with all of the actors in this film. The sets are pretty creative, so are the costumes, and the Grinch's makeup is pretty cool.Here are the downsides of this film: While the Grinch's makeup is spectacular, the Who's makeup are more creepy than cute. Also, some of the characters like Martha May and the Mayor of Whoville seem a little uninteresting and a little forced. Plus, some of the cinematography in this film is poorly handled. It's constantly moving and so you don't get to enjoy the sets as much as you want to. Finally, when the Grinch is stealing the presents, it feels like it's fast forwarding towards the end. That whole scene should have been a little slower and should've had played the ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch."" song in it.But all in all, the movie is still enjoyable even if it has problems. While the original cartoon is better than the live-action film, I still recommend it to people who love Jim Carrey, because he has a ton of fun in this film. Is it good? No, but it's not bad. It's a guilty pleasure.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

It has heart. Every scene with Cindy Lou who and the Grinch brings a sense of love in this move that yes, at times can be rather frantic.

259,WHCernan,Stunning visually; overlong; insincere in its message,5,27 November 2000,"Wow. Whoville lives. It sure looks like Whoville, and Jim Carrey sure looks like the Grinch, and the Whos look more like Whos than anybody could. The look, the atmosphere, the visuals are excellent. Can't complain about that.It's a tad overpadded, though. It starts to drag a bit and the major-league test of movie interest failed; that is, I looked at my watch during the film.Jim Carrey does a fine Grinch, but unlike most of the reviewers here, don't believe that Carrey is the guy who had to play this role; any decently physical actor could have done it. All he had to do was be relatively animated and convincingly emotional. In fact, post-production work sped up the body movements in many scenes to look cartoonish, so Carrey didn't really have to look cartoonish while he was acting. He was great, but they probably didn't need to get a guy who wanted a Carrey-sized paycheck.What spoiled it for me was the message. The story really made a point about the overcommercialization of Christmas that is both true and is not approached enough in film. The problem is that this movie is going to be sold through Happy Meals and toys galore just in time for the Christmas season, which is sort of sickening. It's about as hypocritical as you can get.I gave it a 5/10. Not a waste of money, but you could go see something else and get more entertainment, even if you are a kid.Finally, I didn't need to see a guy kissing a dog's rump, or the dog wiping its rump on the carpet, or any wife-swapping jokes. That content is just stupid (and disgusting in the kissing part) and doesn't belong in a Dr. Seuss picture aimed at kids. No wonder his widow disavowed this picture after seeing it.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
260,s511358,The Worst Christmas Movie,1,22 December 2020,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is an 'adaptation' of the classic Dr. Seuss book about a green curmudgeon who lives on a mountain despising Christmas and all it stands for until he realizes exactly why it meant so much to the people around him. This book was then adapted into a classic animated cartoon that I adore, and this adaptation was adapted from that cartoon.Let me make it clear: I did not want to see this movie, but my schoolmates voted on watching it in Freshmen year of high school when all work was done, and I thought, well, ""How Bad Can This Possibly Be? If everyone else likes it so much, it must have some value"" Oh boy how naive I was...There is only one good thing in this movie, and that is the fact that Jim Carrey is trying so hard to make you laugh. I can't fault him for that.Everything else in this movie is absolute garbage. The look of the movie is coated in a thick, dusty, foggy filter, like looking through a broken camera lens. The design of the ""Whos"" themselves are disturbing, the stuff of nightmares. The movie looks gross and almost nauseating, and a Dr. Seuss movie shouldn't look like a scary fever-dream you cannot wake up from.There are also some really inappropriate jokes in this movie, which are really not suitable for kids, and it disturbs me a little to know so many children adore this movie for its humor.The final thing that always ticked me off about this movie is the change in the theme. The original ""Whos"" had lots of things that made them happy in the original, but the ""things"" and the ""noise"" were not part of that. They were nice to have, but they were not necessary. Family and Unity were always what mattered. In this adaptation though, the ""Whos"" are capitalistic, and only Cindy-Lou truly sees the holiday as it should be seen, but that defeats the entire purpose of the story. The Grinch himself is a changed 'man' after seeing the ""Whos"" sing and gather together, but in this movie it means nothing. No character really has a moral compass except Cindy-Lou, who is a literal child. The theme of the original Grinch is not about innocence, it is about connection. This defeats the purpose of Seusses original intentions, and makes their whole reconciliation with the Grinch more their fault than his fault.In all honesty, this is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I have no idea why so many people like this movie non-ironically. I hope that someday, someone can explain to me why they like this movie in a way that makes any sense. Stick with the original cartoon.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

The whole point of the story is that Christmas (and the holiday season in general) is about more than flamboyant decorations and superficial gifts. It's about generosity, compassion, and kindness. I know it sounds corny, but I believe it and so did Dr. Suess. Yet, this movie made millions of dollars while saying in its script that money is not important.The charisma exhibited by the grinch in the book was not exhibited by the grinch in the movie. Cindy Lou Who became a type of ""good guy,"" constantly trying to edify the grinch. In the book, she is simply a symbol of innocence and childish wonder. That's already profound. She doesn't need to become a prostlytizer to proove anything. The simplicity of the Whos was also extracted from the movie. In the book, they had a wonderful appreciation of humility. In the movie, they, well, didn't. This holiday season, watch the animated movie version. Or, better yet, read the book to your kids.

263,mrforgetful,Jim Carrey is a genius,9,31 July 2005,"This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen in my life. Jim Carrey has that rare talent to do hardly anything at all, and make you crack up. He excels in this movie at doing that.For those who hated this movie, I have 2 things to say. Firstly, if you are some kind of Christmas movie purist who wanted this movie to be like the old animated movie, why did you go to this movie?!?! You knew it wasn't going to be that way because Jim Carrey is in it. Secondly, if you don't like Jim Carrey, don't see this movie, because he is the main star and about 98% of the funny things in this movie is him doing something zany. I'd like to see the original screenplay of this film and see how much Jim Carrey actually said in it and how much he just made up on the spot because I don't think Ron Howard would have been like ""oh, you should definitely bite this wine bottle"". It's those kind of things that makes this movie so hilarious though.One thing that no one can deny is the excellence of the production. The costumes and make-up are completely original and the set design insanely seusslike. If Dr. Seuss saw this movie and hated it (which i wouldn't deny would happen), he'd still adore the Whoville set and everything. It is awesome.I have such a good time watching this movie and sometimes I don't wait until the holiday season to watch this. And after seeing it who knows how many times, I still laugh at Jim Carrey's funny antics as the Grinch. At times is performance is reminiscent of his Tony Clifton in Man on the Moon. He talks with his gut sticking out and his lips projected to the side.This movie is the perfect way to get into the holiday spirit or just to have a good laugh. Like the book and original cartoon or not, there's no denying that the real purpose of this movie was to entertain and not to copy. Given that the movie is much longer than the half hour original, you should probably figure out that it's not supposed to be exactly like it, and should therefore stop trying to compare them.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

One must give Howard's film the credit that it was well imagined--the landscapes were grand, the makeup was well-done (thank you Rick Baker), and Carrey was as eccentric as ever.  But... The film failed horribly as a story.  The cinematography was childish (not that one should expect grandiose cinematography in a family film).  The plot was butchered, with the origin of the Grinch, a far-too-long delving into how the Grinch came about (a key party, no less), and a bad shave.  This simply wasted time. The movie was too much like Space Jam.  It took good characters and made them nothing more than billboards.  Suess' storybook fantasy was bastardized, and Universal made millions.

I had read Seuss as a child in the public libraries but this was the first time I had a chance to see the animated versions. The picture quality has been restored very well here on this DVD however the sound quality while is good at Dolby Digital Stereo quality is not remastered well enough coming without any DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 option although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better. This becomes apparent especially for the second great feature: ""Horton Hears a Who"" where the volume levels alternate from just right to too soft at various points of the cartoon. The special features here are very, very good with documentaries featuring great interviews with the voice talents and the composer Albert Hague who wrote the great music for the songs on the Grinch. Overall, this is a very good DVD of great value for money and I can only anticipate what a better restored version with enhanced sound quality perhaps on Blu-ray would look like and I await such a DVD with bated breath.

280,3s2m,"The 3 words that best describe this film are, and I quote, ""Stink! Stank! Stunk!""",2,11 December 2003,"(possible spoilers)Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today.

I have to say, I felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth, but this movie was a good full-lengthed adaption of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

And that is exactly what happened. I was cracking up during this whole movie. But there were some sad parts to it too. It turned out that the grinch dude wasn't so bad after all. He actually had a heart. If you want to laugh your brains out, I reccomend this movie. Even if you don't think this sounds like a good movie, you should still watch it. I mean Jim Carrey is in it. Jim Carrey= laughs, laughs= funny movie. So, if you like funny movies watch the-the-the The Grinch. If you don't think this movie is good, then I have only one thing to say... You're wrong-o.

They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did. It made my Christmas. The music in this movie brought it up, if just a little. It was nice, it was indeed. I am giving it 6 or 7 stars out of a possible 10.

288,DMoney1184,Dr. Seuss Would Be Out-Raged,2,25 December 2014,"Everything that is good, sweet and pure about the original is gone, replaced by a bloated, distorted and over-the-top mess. Jim Carrey does his usual schtick, mugging to the camera, acting so ridiculously over-the-top, he comes back around the other side and then over-the-top again. It's very reminiscent of his turn as the Riddler in Batman Forever. But Carrey is not the worst thing about this film. The entire film looks a little smug, like there was something on the camera lenses. All of Seuss' beautiful bright colors in the animated feature, gone. This movie has color but it's like viewing it through a dense smog. Because this is ""full length"" motion picture and the original animated film was only about an hour, we get an added hour consisting of why the Grinch came to hate Christmas and a Whoville Christmas Eve celebration that looks like something that came out of a nightmare. But the worst thing, the absolute worst abomination done to this generations-beloved story is the Who's themselves. They're materialistic and competitive extremists. What the heck? Seriously? These are the characters were supposed to feel sorry for as the Grinch steals their stuff? Plus, their characters are so over-the-top, it's almost like they're trying to compete with the Grinch character for the audience's attention. They're such awful people, I found myself rooting for the Grinch to take all of their stuff. Did the people who made this movie not get that the Grinch is supposed to be the villain of the piece? It's like they're all villains! Except for little Cindy Woo-Hoo. I get it, she's the innocent child who turns everybody else around, yada yada. But when the characters are so utterly detestable for the first hour and a half of the movie....uuuuhhh. In short, this film is....pretty awful. Yeah, once it ACTUALLY gets into the story we know, Carrey does a respectable job of playing the character we know and love. But why remake something that was so close to perfect in the first place? Do yourself a favor and sit down in front of the original: it's simple, to the point, has that great song--it should be a part of everyone's annual staple of holiday movies. This.....should just be forgotten about.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

We still enjoy it as separate but related to the cartoon (which only I appreciate in my family). Anyway, relax, rent it or pop it in, and have fun. Don't take yourself too seriously.

290,EdnaWelthorpe,Another horrible Seuss adaptation,4,15 December 2011,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a timeless classic. A simple story about a grumpy green creature who hatches a plan to torment the simple denizens of ""Whoville"" by literally stealing Christmas only to achieve a heartwarming epiphany in the end. It's a great children's book and the 1966 film captures the spirit of Dr. Seuss perfectly.The 2000 live adaptation on the other hand doesn't come close one bit.It is one of the more unpleasant and mean spirited movies that I have seen and since this is an adaptation of a holiday classic, the mean-spiritedness really stands out.What do I mean? The Whos are absolutely horrible! Materialistic, ugly both physically and morally, their unpleasantness is made more prominent by the rather smudged cameras (well they seem smudged anyway) and the scenery that could be described as ""polluted"". Oh and the numerous adult themed jokes that do nothing but make everyone uncomfortable.Jim Carrey tries hard as the Grinch which is unfortunately a problem as he continually goes over the top and swallows the scenery at every turn. He sadly makes up the high point of the movie.Overall, to the film's credit...it's not the worst Seuss adaptation out there and whatever dark forces were at work controlling Ron Howard, they seemed to be excised. But yeah, get the 1966 cartoon and pretend this movie never happened.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

When I was 8 I liked it and thought it was great But now when I look back I think This is one crappy movie. Jim Carrey is funny but he's not funny enough to be the Grinch. And they kind of portray the Grinch as some sort of a*hole in the beginning of the movie. It's like someone thought. ''Oh let's make this wonderful cartoon which many kids know and love and turn it into some sh*t load movie'' IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF Film What are they gonna come out with next. Rudolph? The year without a Santa Claus? Are they going to turn those into crappy real-life movies too?

294,Krud,"Chuck Jones, Boris Karloff, and other sadly missing influences.",7,19 November 2000,"Since this is a Christmas movie, I'll be as kind as I can while still being honest.I gave the movie a 6, but only because I felt the movie's production values off-set the disappointing adaptation.I think that most people, regardless of how they felt about the movie after seeing it, would agree on one thing: Jim Carrey is very much his ""usual self"" (think Ace Ventura, Mask, Tony Clifton, and a half dozen vague impersonations).  For those who are fans of Jim Carrey's manic over-the-top delivery, this is... fine.  For those who aren't, it will undoubtedly ruin the experience for them.Had I never seen the original ""Grinch"" book or cartoon, I most likely would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.  Unfortunately, I've read/seen them several times throughout my life, making it very difficult to separate them from what I was viewing on-screen.  Had I not been overly familiar with Jim Carrey's usual mannerisms, I would have been able to more easily lose myself in the Seuss-like environment.  Unfortunately, I kept seeing the Grinch bursting into seemingly un-Grinchy comedy bits.  (What did the ""Ron Howard as director"" sketch have to do with anything?)Now, the good points: the scenery, while not exactly natural-looking, definitely had that curvey, distorted Seuss-like perspective, with the occasional dash of Chuck Jones-ian skewed angles as well. The makeup was incredible on everyone, the computer animation segments were impressive enough to fool most people, and Anthony Hopkin's narrative portions were the closest one could get to the original story.--------------------- SPOILER WARNING: If you haven't seen the movie and you intend to, don't read the next paragraph.  Skip to the paragraph after that one.  Thank you.--------------------- A few gripes: Could they have come up with a more disturbing method to have the Grinch's heart grow two sizes? It looked quite painful.  Also, since when did the Grinch harbor Oscar the Grouch sensibilities?  His lair resembled a cross between Blankman's secret headquarters, Oscar's trash can, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  Max the dog, while well-trained, seemed a bit too much like Benji; and Cindy-Lou Who, who was ""no more than two"", is suddenly six or seven and more intelligent than the entire adult population.  At times I felt like I was watching ""Horton Hears A Hackneyed Cliche'"": the mysterious orphan in a basket, the alienated  child, the unrequitted love; at one point, I felt like I was watching Disney's ""Hunchback Of Notre Dame,"" when they gave the Grinch an award and ultimately humiliated him in public, much to the dismay of the secret love interest. -----------------------------For those of you who didn't read the spoiler, it's okay, I'm done ranting now.  I went into the movie really wanting to like it - expecting to like it, in fact.  I went away feeling a bit like Cindy-Lou Who did at one point in the film: Too much shallow sentimentality and glittery flash, not enough 'keeping it real'.  It's a cute Christmas movie, and somewhere in it there's a moral, albeit a muddled one; but if you're looking for a faithful recreation of a cartoon classic, you might have better luck with ""Popeye"", ""Inspector Gadget"", and ""Casper"".  (Then again, maybe not.)",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
295,BryMan-4,Sacrilege,1,15 November 2000,"Since seeing Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I have been trying to come up with alternate titles to describe how I feel about it.  A few came to mind:  How Dr. Seuss Spins in his Grave, or how about How Opie Ruins a Classic.  I wish someone can explain how a book with less than 200 words can be made into a feature film.  Even after seeing this movie, I still don't understand.  Howard has always lacked an identity as a filmmaker and here he does his best imitation of Tim Burton.  The film is a cluttered mess that is endlessly boring due to some invented backstory of how the Grinch became the Grinch.  Like I need to know.  I firmly believe that if Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel) were alive today, he would have denounced the crude humor of Jim Carrey who prompts the mayor of Whoville to kiss his posterior by holding a piece of mistletoe up to his behind while leering at the cleavage of Christine Baranski. Shame on Audrey Geisel for whoring out her late husband's work to Hollywood. Shame on Jim Carrey for being so crude and destroying a classic character. Shame on Ron Howard for making a movie that shouldn't have been made. Somebody stop them before The Cat in the Hat with Tim Allen starts production!!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
296,toyotamanus,Comparing this to the original...,9,20 November 2019,"Is a mistake! Do not go into this movie thinking that it will be anything like the original.For starters the original isn't really a movie - at only 26 minutes long it's a short film/story at best. Of course the original is great, don't get me wrong, but this version is not meant to completely capture the original in it's entirety.Jim Carey is over the top as usual, but plays the role very well. He's comedic evil, and pays an excellent tribute to the song ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".The overall message for both Who's & The Grinch tells what Christmas is supposed to be all about. In the original film, Who's were wholesome people, but that movie was made back in a time before Christmas became as heavily commercialized as it was in 2000. This movie gives nod to a commercialized Christmas with a Black Friday feel. It then turns this notion around for both the Who's and the Grinch himself.Take this movie for what it's meant to be - a campy, funny, happy, wholesome family movie with a good message. Anyone who analyzes this too much will not enjoy it, which can really be said for any movie.Most of the ratings under 5 stars, with negative commentary, are really reaching for something to dislike here.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

My mouth was watering.Sadly enough -- Well... Maybe, I was too anxious and my hopes were too high.  Yeah, the Grinch returns the Christmas presents by the end of the movie, but the movie didn't deliver the goods.I remember the part from the 1966 original so well -- the Grinch slapping antlers on his lil' puppy, and demanding him to pull the sleigh.  I couldn't wait for that part.  I knew that scene would leave me busting a stitch.  But that highlight was also humdrum.But I have to admit, though Jim Carrey's facial expressions were unbelievable, I felt the puppy was the star of the show!I wanted so badly to love and caress this movie.  I wanted to laugh aloud --  But I couldn't.  I remember when Jurassic Park first hit the big screen.  Everyone took there kids to see a pleasant Disney-like movie about dinosaurs.  But instead, got a movie that was so realistic and terrifying that kids were clinging to their parents.  Yes, Jurassic Park was phenomenal. But the Grinch isn't.Why?  Because you expect a T-Rex to be deadly.  And so be it. Throughout Jurassic Park, the T-Rex was a dangerous animal from start to finish.  The Grinch, however, was too much of a psychopath.  You're left wondering whether you can trust the Grinch even as the movie ends.Jim Carrey was awesome.  The back-drop was incredible. Even down to every detail having squiggly-shapes, with nothing having right-angles.  Even the ladder in the mailroom was crooked. A lot of attention was focused on the set, but the Grinch's script was too dark and too unsettling of a character.It was like a Disney set that was exploited by Tim Burton.

Since, Carrey's face is covered by the Grinch's mask it doesn't look as funny when he is doing his actings (minus 1). The character of the grinch is gross and Carrey plays that role nicely. He is gross and disgusting at times (minus two). He came back to his Pet detective type movies (minus one). The movie becomes tedious at times. Nothing like Liar Liar. (minus one).

300,filmdrift,Carrey makes the movie worthwhile. Just don't expect magic.,5,11 December 2000,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is worthwhile for its performances, namely by Jim Carrey as the Grinch.  I rated it a 6 out of 10.  I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss' books and the original Grinch cartoon from 1966, and I had high hopes for this remake.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie.  In particular, I felt that it could have been crafted a little better to be a ""classic"".  After all, the story and characters are timeless.  But a classic movie this was not.  The pace of the movie seemed to drag a little bit, the town of Whoville (frankly) seemed a little boring and unappealing to me. There were also a few too many modern-day-Hollywood-like-add-ins in the movie which (in my opinion) dated it and detracted from its impact.  I was also disappointed with the art direction and set design.  The illustrations from the Dr. Seuss books and from the original cartoon are unmatched in their creativity.  The movie dabbled a little, remaining true to the general feel of these designs, but it broke no new creative ground with its art direction and set design.  Ron Howard has done some ""great"" directing in the past.  His direction here was simply ""good""--not his best work.  But the movie is at its best when we are allowed to watch Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He was wonderful.  His performance is perhaps even Oscar-nomination-worthy, depending on the competition.  He is funny, menacing, sad and joyful; and I felt his character truly grew and developed throughout the film.  Carrey makes the movie worthwhile.

306,erthnvesl,Better than Advertised,9,24 November 2003,"Panned by critics and loathed by Seuss purists, this movie managed to capture just enough hearts to lasso in $260 million when it opened in 2000. Ron Howard's recipe for The Grinch is more of a smorgasbord, and as such, reactions were varied depending on who liked which parts.The visuals, a combination of elaborate sets and costumes and computer graphics, are a stunning replica of Seussian illustrations.  Buildings and walkways are odd-shaped, almost organic, and machines are crammed full of moving parts and oversized cogs.  The colors are crisp but the palette is somewhat muted.  It seems more natural for a Seussian world to look like a Technicolor musical but in fact the books were themselves simple and soft on the eyes.  The costumes are festive and creative, like Cindy Lou's family dressed up like a Christmas dinner, with plates and cookies and hats shaped like mugs of eggnog.  James Horner's score is par for the course, a mixture of the film's storybook mood and Horner's own penchant for stealing from his own work.The story is a melting pot of popular culture, borrowing heavily from the book, stealing settings from the Chuck Jones cartoon, and adding some modern flavor; some psychological background on the Grinch's troubled childhood mixed with a new twist on the Who's, who seem to have let their Christmas become commercialized.  Seuss purists may prefer to think of the Who's as being more innocent; after all, the Grinch learned his lesson from watching the innocent Who's without their presents.  Chuck Schulz probably wasn't happy, thinking he had the market on commercialized Christmas cornered with his classic Charlie Brown Christmas.  I'm not really thrilled with this twist either, but it's one way to take the story from a ten-minute book to a half-hour cartoon to a 90-minute film.Roger Ebert was a little hard on this film, saying it was too dark and focused on the Grinch's meanness.  I thought as one-dimensional as the Who's are in the story, they tried too hard to expand on THEM.  The Fat One is never wrong, but I have to say, the Grinch is the central focus of the story, and as such deserves every second of screen time he gets. Hollywood is a town that recognizes Jim Carrey's comic genius, but still doesn't quite know what to do with it.  Ron Howard is one of the more recent to try. Carrey is given all the comedic stylings he can handle; from a eerily good impression of Boris Karloff; to the Chuck Jones cartoon images of skittering on the floor on his fingers and toes, the old saw-the-floor-under-the-tree gag and the triumphant lifting of the sled on Mt. Crumpit; to physical gags of every variety (Carrey yanks a cloth off a table, leaving numerous pots and pans untouched, then returns to upset them all and tip the table); to spoofs of several popular movies (Chariots of Fire comes to mind); to other pop culture gags (Carrey checks an answering machine message, his greeting is ""If you so much as utter one syllable, I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND GUT YOU LIKE A FISH!  ... if you'd like to fax me, press the * key).  With the combination of voices, facial expressions and overacting, I still hang on every word he says; to this day I'm tickled when he puts on a Navy ball cap and spoofs his own director.His supporting cast is more than competent.  Christine Baranski, his unrequited love, is her typecast snooty self (and with a bit more cleavage than Seuss might appreciate).  Taylor Momsen is the quintessential darling as Cindy Lou Who, and her father (Bill Irwin) is both naive (The Grinch wraps her up in paper, her father says upon finding her ""You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping"") and heartwarming (the mayor yells ""What's the matter with you?!?  She's a child!"" and he says plainly, ""she's MY child... and she happens to be right."")  Molly Shannon is the standard annoying suburban housewife, Ron's brother Clint Howard steals scenes as the mayor's toadie, and the rest of the town is largely populated with stereotypes: old biddies, an Irish cop, a chunky self-important mayor, a prudish teacher, and so on).  The whole story is wonderfully narrated by the gentle, articulate voice of Anthony Hopkins.I'm one of maybe 7 people on Planet Earth that actually enjoyed nearly all the pieces of this muddled Seussian story.  But I recommend it all the same, no matter what the Fat One says.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I've read the other comments and I'm embarrassed of everyone that didn't like the film.  The irony is that they're the very essence of what the film was talking about - needy, greedy, ""what can you do for me?"" type people.  If the story doesn't tell you exactly what you want, then it's not good.  If Jim Carrey's voice isn't exactly what you want, then it's not good.  If the little girl doesn't sing exactly the way you want, then it's not good.I'm a filmmaker myself.  I've made three films which are found on this website as well and suddenly, I don't feel as bad about some of the comments I've received.The bottom line is Ron Howard, Taylor Momford (?), and Jim Carrey poured their hearts out for this film.  It is so evident.  Jim Carrey brought so much humanity to the role.  He was so likeable yet when he stood on that mountain staring down the ""whos"", there was so much pain and hate inside his eyes.  Having worked with actors, it's easy to see that Jim was coming from a real place.  The poor guy leaves everything on the set and he still gets criticised.  I hope to God that Jim stumbles upon this review (which I highly doubt he will) but he needs to know that his effort was noted.  But someone like Jim Carrey probably knows this already and steps on doubters like ants on the grass.I predict this movie will be a classic just like the Wizard of Oz and the Grinch television show itself.  It will transcend the doubts of the doubters and will reach generations far beyond the ones that didn't like this film.
Ron Howard this was your best work.  It was seamless.  The transitions were nifty and appropriate.  You kept Jim under wraps and never let Jim slip out too much.  Your choice of casting was excellent.  The sets, the hair, the music, the pacing, everything - A+.And the girl.  Oh my God the girl.  She changed my life.  I'm 32 without wife or child and she made me dream of both.  She was magical without even trying.  Her voice was pure and perfect.  How dare someone critique her singing.  She's just a kid and she was singing honestly and isn't that what it's all about!!!!!!?  She was an angel.  The way she smiled and laughed, and even better, the way she stood toe to toe with Jim Carrey.  One of the best child actors I've seen since Natalie Portman's Professional.What a message that movie sent!  Of course it was different than the TV show.  It needs to be.  We're different.  Times have changed.  We need to hear different things.  Years ago, Christmas was different so the Grinch was appropriate back then but now try going to a mall and tell me it hasn't changed.  Try giving your kid a hug and an apple for Christmas and see how he reacts.

310,nevsky41,"Abysmal, overblown Hollywood tripe",1,2 September 2003,"This quite possibly the worst movie Ron Howard has ever put his name on. I live action film based on Dr. Seuss's book would have been a good idea, if it had been executed better, and by a director more skilled at this type of movie.Ron Howard is not an untalented director, but this is not his type of film. He is not gifted at this type of ""whimsical fantasy,"" and it shows.  His effort at making this film work is apparent, as the sets and makeup are all very impressive, and evocative of Seuss's original illustrations. Ultimately tho, for all his effort, Howard's attempts to make all the disjointed parts of this film work falls short.The main flaws with this film lie in the script by Jeffery Price and Peter Seaman, and Jim Carey's misguided performance as the Grinch.  By expanding upon the story of the Grinch, the screenwriters could have done a much better job.  As it is, the fleshing out of the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who ends up coming off trite and forced.  I'm guessing the intent was to create sympathy for the Grinch, but his new backstory is rather cliched and comes off as uninspired.  The expansion of Cindy Lou Who's character is an admirable attempt to create a focal character at the other end of the spectrum from the Grinch, but by the end of the movie, despite the admirable attempt by Taylor Momsen, Cindy Lou Who has become a fairly annoying and irritating character.However, the true failure of this film lies in the hands of Jim Carrey's dreadfully awful portrayal of the Grinch.  Almost 180 degrees from the character's origins, the sullen, grumpy Grinch of the book and cartoon is replaced with a wise-cracking goofball who just happens to hate Christmas and the Whos.  The transition does not work.  Most of Carrey's scenes seem like they are meant to be funny, but end up being grating and unpleasant to watch.  The Grinch is so annoying in this movie, I find myself completely untouched when he has his change of heart at the conclusion.  Carrey's performance is irritatingly over-the-top, never letting down for a moment. This is not the Grinch I know, and as a result, it doesn't work for me. Carrey is definitely trying his best, but given the awful characterization of the Grinch he had been given, there's not much he could do to make the material rise above its own underachieving level.Overall, the film is unpleasant and not entertaining.  Watching it is more like an endurance trial than watching a movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone, especially anyone who loves the book and classic cartoon.My Rating (out of four stars): BOMB.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

In the UK it is largely unknown (as is Frosty the Snowman)and has been retitled simply The Grinch for distribution here. When Ifinally saw the cartoon in New York last Xmas I was disappointed by thequality of the animation, the narration and the crude black and whitemorality. I adored the movie, which greatly improved upon the narrative by making( spoiler alert!)  the Grinch's feelings partly justified and shared bythe little girl in the town, the mayor less likeable than the Grinch,and the Grinch the object of the town's most glamorous woman's love andlust! This broke up the cartoon's simplistic duality, so that the townand the Grinch learn from each other, and not all just one way. Packedwith hilarious adult jokes such as references to other movies (e.g. thecar-keys in a bowl  the Who community practice wife-swapping as in TheIce Storm) and beautiful on the eye. I entirely forgot that it was Careycapering before me on the screen. It was the Grinch, the real Grinch.However, almost all the things I admire about this are probably whatwill upset devotees of the cartoon. This will be the first encounterwith the Grinch for most British children, so I'm interested to see whatwill be the reaction of those I know on seeing the cartoon second. Iwouldn't be surprised if UK TV will start showing it on Xmas from nowon. I had just been given my first Xmas present so I fortuitously watchedthe movie with the wrapped box on my lap.

The few highlights for me were the costumes / sets, which had some clever ideas, and the twist of a capitalistic / materialistic townspeople who have lost sight of the potential of the holiday.  I thought Cindy Lou Who's acting was disappointing, as was much of the writing, especially the poor additions to Dr. Seuss' original poetry - it was VERY clear to me what was added.  Also, I think the changes to the story didn't serve it well for the most part and were not well thought out.  Carrey as the Grinch didn't have a lot to work with but I think he did the best he could - there were a few moments I couldn't help but laugh.

But is this new version really necessary?The emotional and moral core of this film revolves around the question ""Is Christmas all about presents (which can be extended to encompass commercialism and gross consumerism) or friends and family?"" The warm feeling you get when the expected conclusion is drawn (and not very well) is muddled by the fact that you've just watched a $100 million juggernaut steamroll your emotional responses. How can you resist the cute little residents of Whoville? How can you avoid letting that ""warm feeling"" spur you on to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of Grinch(tm) -related items?There was a turning point in the career of Jim Carrey. That fork in the road was called ""The Cable Guy"". Instead of making movies that could push the envelope and his audience, he instead choose to push the high-water mark for the highest paid actors in Hollywood.There are some funny moments with Grinch and his dog alone in their cave. But you've probably already seen them on TV as part of the marketing campaign for this film.Jim Carrey's talent is literally buried in this film. Even Carrey's irrepressible mania cannot claw its way out from under three hours worth of makeup.If you aren't taking a seven-year-old, don't go see this movie.

Therefore, when Jim Carrey did the Grinch, especially after seeing how it was advertised, I stayed away from it. It was inevitable that I should come back and watch it at a much later date since I am a Jim Carrey fan.  I found it to be done excellently.  Jim did a great job at portraying the Grinch, and for the first time, I found myself liking the story.  He made it believable, and he actually makes you feel sorry for the Grinch.  After all, he was mistreated; it is a wonder that he was not worse off than he was.  Being on his own for so long, it is also surprising that he was not a total, stark-raving, mad lunatic and that he did not do much worse to the town. My other favorite characters, who did not receive enough credit, were Max, the dog, and Cindy Lou Who who also made the day.  They both made the movie.  I highly recommend this movie, not especially to kids because kids could not quite comprehend a lot of the things in it, but most especially to teens and adults.

Plus, the little girl's triangle-shaped hair made me want to take a lawn mower or machete or just something to it to make it go away.But once I got past that, I learned to appreciate the humor Jim Carrey delivers as the Grinch.

328,Dastari,A bit mean spirited for my tastes,1,15 August 2001,"As a child I never understood why the name Grinch, and I'm equally stumped as to why the name Scrooge, has always been used to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit. It seems to me that if you call someone 'Grinch' it should be a compliment, not a detriment. When I grew up, and perhaps you can translate that into when I lost innocence, I realized the irony of the definition of the name Grinch. This character is supposed to be the isolated and lonely. It's supposed to be all of us from time to time. But the reality is that he does not represent the few, he represents us all. Why do we continue to use the name Grinch to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit when the lesson of the story is that the Grinch kept Christmas in his heart? The same goes for Scrooge who kept Christmas with him for the rest of his life. The reason is that because these two characters represent us all. Aren't we all these characters for eleven months of the year and only when we hit December do most of us dust off our liberality's in the name of righteousness? We forget that the Grinch became a being that loved Christmas, but only for the last few minutes of the story, or in our lives, December.So for me this film does not work. It is not set to the same time as is the Dr. Suess classic. It tries to give the Grinch a reason for his isolation and his loneliness and that doesn't need to be done. The point of Suess's story was that the Grinch was upset. He was angry and he was lonely and in the end he was redeemed. Period. This film tries to show us that he is worth redeeming because some children made fun of him. Isn't Christmas a time when anyone can be redeemed? Why tell me why someone is worthy of redemption. If the Grinch wasn't picked on as a child should he have been shunned by the Who's? If the spirit of Christmas, and indeed the Dr. Suess book, is so magical, why give me a back story? Even though Dickens does give us a back drop for Scrooge to hang his isolation on, we know from the beginning that everyone, regardless of Scrooge's story, wants Ebenezer to be part of their Christmas. Here we are given a reason why we should include the Grinch, and that goes against the point of the season. It once seemed to me that we needed to hold on to the magic of Christmas the whole year through. Now I would be excited if we could hold on to it if only for one night in December.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I wouldn't be surprised if children who read it, go around talking like it thinking it's the right way to talk.  But I've ALWAYS loved 'How the grinch stole christmas' ever since I was little.  I grew tired of all the other christmas shows like rudolph and frosty, and never grew tired of this wonderful classic so I couldn't wait to see it when it came out to film.I had gone to Toronto with my parents to visit my sister, her soon to be 5 kids.  While visiting, me being 19, took my two nieces (8 and 4) to the movies to see the grinch.  Of course, my father and sister came along as well.As soon as we stepped into the theatre and found ourselves seats, my 4 year old niece had her face glued to the screen as soon as she sat down (and this was when it was starting to show the movie (after the previews were aired, we never saw them).I absolutely loved it.  And so did my nieces.  Whether or not they caught the jokes doesn't matter because not everyone catches jokes or the meaning of things the first time through unless you're pure lucky.  But as long as you enjoyed it whatever your age is, that's the whole point of the film. I mean, who would want to go to the movies and sit through the whole thing only to not like it.I recommend it to anyone out there who likes the grinch.  My nieces loved it even if they didn't catch all the jokes but trust me, children laugh at things even if they don't get the joke.  Annoying, but true :P  But again, as long as they enjoyed it, that's all that matters.No one could have played the grinch like Jim and no one could have played Cindy Lou Who like Taylor :)  So adorable ^_^;But course...  *praise* my nieces are just as cute :D  *end praise* :)",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

The only common characteristic linking that fantastic little book and '66 special to this unfaithful pile of film is the title. First of all, this movie takes countless liberties for the sake of stretching the story out to an hour and a half. The classic line ""The Grinch hated Christmas/ The whole Christmas season/ Now don't ask why/ No one quite knows the reason"" is spoken in the film (by Anthony Hopkins, who does a great narration of the story the way it should be told), then contradicted entirely by a very clear summary of the Grinch's life. Then there's Whoville itself: In Ron Howard's movie, it's depicted as a corrupt, somewhat dark town of sex and alcohol. What book was Ron Howard reading?  There is no cynicism in Whoville! ""All the Whos in Whoville liked Christmas a lot."" Remember? Also, there is nothing in the book to imply that a shot of Christine Baranski's cleavage and Jim Carrey using the word ""bitchin'"" might help the story along. I won't even get into Jim Carrey's performance. TERRIBLE. He played himself, not the Grinch. The girl who played Cindy-Lou Who was cute and fit in with the story very well.

347,Pam in Massachusetts,"Great Whoville, but...",5,17 November 2000,"There's a reason why animation (i.e., cartoons) often succeeds where live action does not: if one can suspend disbelief long enough to interpret two-dimensional line drawings as ""people"", then the story is accepted by the brain, even if the ""people"" fly, change into rabbits, or turn purple. With live action, though, if all one can think of is, ""that makeup doesn't look right"", then one can't be drawn into the story. This is one of the major faults with this new GRINCH: disbelief not only can't be suspended; it can't even get into the harness. For example, it's hard to accept that with this picture's budget, they used sets with such glaringly fake snow and rocks.

349,The Divine Bovine,"Well-Meaning, Well-Made Movie Misses Mark",4,30 December 2000,"Ironic that Dr. Seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season.  The general gist of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen).  This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version.  Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly.  There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing.Succinctness?Soul?Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better.   I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of five.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

What we got was a roller coaster of fun.Jim Carrey (who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought this childhood movie to life.The story is based upon the story of the grinch. As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. But one little girl is going to change The Grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way.Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. She attempts to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.All up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. A SOLID 10/10.

357,brelanda,"Complete Rewright, Wrong",1,24 December 2017,"Here we have a holiday classic ruined.
 The original story was a display of someone who is an outcast from the mainstream because he does not, for some unknown reason, can't relate to his neighbors. So thinking that he can not fit in decides to ruin their fun so they will feel as bad as him at this time of year. As his plans come to fruition, to destroy their holiday, he realizes that the holiday is not about material things and thus gains happiness for himself and others.
 In this remake FORGET IT. Now we are surrounded by the most evil, vile and duplicitous race of things (think a race social climbing insects) whose only though is ""How can I show I'm better than you"". 
 This time we are given a history why the Grinch is a self imposed outcast, because of a bad childhood trauma, this is a nice touch. From this point on the film goes down hill and fast. Every person you meet is only acting for their self interest. What can I do to show how much better I am than everybody around me. Quite frankly if I was to go to this town and was around these people, even for a short time, I would get out of town as fast as the Grinch had. The only saving grace is little Cindy, the incorruptible child. Who sees the good in all and in the end helps all in the end come together.
 This film is a complete disaster, with the exception of filming some of the animated sequences in live action.

This is just heavy handed and makes this story into something it was never meant to do.This is a story about the spirit of Christmas. In the original story, all the Who's of Whoville are not phased by their loss of decorations, libations and gifts. They come together and through their genuine spirit of love, come together, and it is this that makes the Grinch's heart grow.The movie gives a background to the Grinch... and to boot blames the Whovillians for the Grinch's bad attitude. So wrong and flawed.The character of Cindy Lou Who builds on that and further impunes the citizens of Who-ville. tsk tsk tsk. That is not the innocent of the original story.The narration while interesting completely re-writes a beautiful story...tsk tsk tsk Dr. Seuss was right not to let this story be re-told.The odd thing is that this story could have been abstracted into something altogether different ... much like the re-telling of another Christmas classic...

Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor are also very good, as well as the supporting cast. Some minor qualms include the child grinch, which is played stiffly at best, and some of the liberties it took from the book. It basically includes all the essential elements, however, and is a very entertaining and funny family film. A lot of stupid children's films try and desperately show that they can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids, to try and increase their ticket sales.

But our local newspaper's film critic seemed to like it and compared it favorably to Jim Carrey's Grinch, more or less saying that Grinch was a terrible adaption of Seuss.Well, I remembered Grinch a little more positively, perhaps because I found Carrey's performance particularly outstanding.  By and large, you have to pay me to watch Carrey, he's just not my cup of tea.  But in Grinch he was perfectly cast to be the stinky old curmudgeon Seuss intended.
I dug out of the closet my kids' copy of the movie, watched it again, watched my kids' faces while they watched along and came to this conclusion: The movie captures the spirit and texture of the good Doctor.

380,tom865,Taylor Momsen & Jim Carrey,10,23 December 2000,"First an explanation on what makes a great movie for me.  Excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case en point:  Twister).  There are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a DVD or VHS tape?  Characters.  With that said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch.  Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey.  The rest of the cast was very good, particularly Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans.  But, every single scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and/or heartwarming.   Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon.  The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts, and a very good theme (I can't get started because I don't want to spoil it).  Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch-particularly when he interacted with Cindy.  And the music!  Wow! Excellent music by James Horner.  I loved his selection of instruments and the compositions.  Very good job Jim Carrey-I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen!  Whoa!  Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once.  On your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds?  Sounds like an F#?  That is an obscene range for a 7-year old (obscene meant in the best possible way).  Great job.  This is the best performance by a child I have ever heard in a movie(Taylor beat out the Von Trapp Children-no small feat!).  And now to the actors.  Jim Carrey was great, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this really showed through in his scenes with Taylor Momsen).  Taylor Momsen's unspoken expressions(one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong-she really becomes Cindy Lou Who.  And when she does dialogue she is even stronger.******************************danger:spoiler alert********************* ***********************************************************************Examples:  expression when she first sees The Grinch.  This is a classic quote (""You're the the the"" and then filled in with the Grinch line ""da da da THE GRINCH-after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by The Grinch).  The ""Thanks for saving me"" quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good.My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister.  This scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other.  Little Taylor Momsen completely holds her own with Jim Carrey in this spot.  I sincerely hope we see Taylor Momsen in many more films to come.  All in all everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses).",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

The characters and the plot line is so silly and adorable, it creates an atmosphere for which I can't say 'No'. The backgrounds, the special effects, the make-ups and especially Whoville is so precisely created that I simply can't believe it. And the most important of all...JIM CARREY! He was born for this role, he acts like he has always been the Grinch. I really like Max too, he puts an interesting twist into the movie, because he is the only animal (Okay, and the white cat, who becomes stolen by the Grinch).

Jim Carrey is at his annoyingest; Ron Howard shows glaring deficiency in basic storytelling; and the general plot is gaudy and ridiculous, not to mention risque and offensive -- wife-swapping at the party?  The Who children brutally mocking and ostracizing the young Grinch?  The buxom Whoville sex-pot?  A ROMANCE STORY?  Give me a green latex make-up-covered break.  The sets, make-up, and camera work were obviously meant to be stunning and grand.  Instead they came across as exaggerated and trite.  The Grinch's bat-cave-like home?  The nauseating use of tilted camera shots?  And oh, wow, what great latex noses. Brilliant.I physically shuddered as this atrocity progressed.  Commercial, soul-less, pathetic.The sky animation, though, was nice.Really, really bad.  My children will never see this film.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

It's the usual mix big budget Hollywood updates; we have Ron Howard at the helm trying desperately for a blockbuster, Jim Carrey almost manic in his attempt at comedy and a shamefully long-winded script.

Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show.

For me, considering that I don't give a snowflake about roots of this movie, it simply rocks. It is not overdone, it is quite long, but not so long as it could be; interesting costumes and hairdos, script is well balanced and full of enjoyable jokes and references, but in same time never letting carry the story away from audience. It is not perfect, but it is there.Yes, yes, it is all you can have in any another good movie with good supporting team, but this time, that all is just perfect add-on to one and one persona and character only - Grinch itself. You can hate or love Jim Carrey, but this time he has done it right. His spoof jokes, a little bit over-the-top emotions are right on target this time.And with all those jolts of fun and laughs, movie achieves to bring very simple and true message with it - Christmas and in fact, any celebration is about people, not goodies you get (common sense very frequently forgotten by children and their parents too).

I do think that the earlier Chuck Jones version is a classic in its own right and I enjoy it as well. I don't think one can fairly compare the two versions; this version has a much more involved back story which explains the Grinch's motivation, while Jones' version is much more taut due to its lesser running time.I found this to be visually very attractive, with excellent computer animation and an awesome job by the artistic director. There's a lot of boffo humor in this version as well with inside jokes galore. I'm mixed in my opinion of Jim Carrey in general, but this is definitely one of his best performances.

It only served to remind us who was responsible for this waste of film.This bore little resemblance to the book and is an embarrassment to the great Dr. Seuss.My wife hated it, my kids hated it and I hated it.  8 thumbs down.The only good part was an original song by Barenaked Ladies.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

This film is not for the very young as Jim Carrey's Grinch will no doubt cause nightmares but for those 10 and up it's an enjoyable dark comedy with the usual zany antics of Jim Carrey.

Boy were we wrong! This film was a total disappointment.  Jim Carrey was way over the top. It was more like Jim Carrey was being played by the Grinch, not the other way around.The costumes, make-up and scenery were beautiful. The soundtrack was very well done.  BUT WHO LET THE LITTLE GIRL SING?  It was horrible!  Her acting was very good though.  Why didn't they dub her voice? It ruined what would have been a great Christmas song.  I don't think anyone will remember it now.The simple tale has been completely bastardized.  The only part that kind of worked was the background as to how the young Grinch became the Grinch. As they needed to make a 20 minute cartoon fill an hour and a half they should have worked this angle more.The moral of this review, is to keep this picture from your view. It could have been better, even merry, but that would require a lot less Carrey. You should not have put up, nor been a coward. How could you do this Mr. Howard?",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

The STORY was essentially unchanged from the much loved book, and whatever additions which were necessary to flesh it out into a 2 hour movie were well done and not out of character. The VISUALS were beautiful and fabulous. The attention to detail was terrific and I will need to see it again to catch everything. I'm not one to fawn over Jim Carrey just because that's what everyone else does, but I have to say that he was absolutely incredible in this role. His body language is hilarious and he was a delight to watch. The little girl Who, Cindy Lou-Who is sweet and adorable. When she giggles while sliding down the shute I couldn't help but laugh along with her. I really enjoyed the way they put in the background story about the Grinch as a baby.

An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, astonishing variety of costumes. Wait, there's more to it than that - the story is very good, too. There's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers. Jim Carrey is top-notch. He is probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is real good. I'm sure she has some great future. The dog is cool. All in all, it's a very high quality Christmas fairy-tale. If you like fairy-tales, it's for you.

415,james.jensen,Jim Carrey makes a good Grinch,4,1 December 2000,"Ron Howard's treatment of the classic Dr. Seuss cartoon deserves both applause and a shame-on-you.  Technically, the movie is without flaw (as far as I could tell).  The story, however, suffers from two decidedly un-Seuss-like scenes which both involve the Grinch doing something VERY bizarre: in one scene, the Grinch gives the mayor a doggie-style moon pie kiss; in another, he gives Cindy Who a drink of water whilst standing behind a tree (the sound of a liquid falling into a glass is heard, and Cindy gives the contents a dubious look as she goes to bed).  The voice of the Grinch audibly changes during the course of the movie -- a sign that dubbing was involved.  But, this detracts only a little from the movie.Hardcore Seuss fans (and I am one) quickly noted the differences between the original cartoon and the movie.  True, the material with which Mr Howard had to work was sparse; it was disturbing, however, to see the Grinch stumble through a hairy childhood and become a reclusive miscreant after shaving his face badly.With the exception of the mousy makeup on most of the Whoville characters, the Whos were represented fairly well.  The hair styles were delightfully obscene, and the non-euclidian geometry of the buildings and streets was pure Seuss.I feel that the movie was not worth the price at the ticketbox and should, instead, be viewed when the DVD hits the rental stores.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

This ""Grinch"" just goes to prove that throwing money at something doesn't make it better.  My problem wasn't with Jim Carrey; he did fine considering he had to act under all that fake fur.

Fair enough I suppose, except the original Grinch tale was about consumerism, and the real point of Christmas being love and family rather than gifts. This Grinch eventually arrives at the same change of heart as the original, quoting the same lines that Christmas ""came just the same,"" before returning the gifts. But why? None of it jives with his poor treatment by the Whos earlier on. Unlike the original Grinch who was only obsessed with the gifts, this version gives no explanation as to why he should have suddenly forgiven all of them. The entire thing feels arbitrary and ill-fitting.Add that to the excessive runtime and the general unlikability of most of the characters, and we're left with a film that doesn't deserve a spot in the annual holiday rotation.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

While the Grinch himself looks fairly good, the Who's look like demons! They even act like demons! They are nothing like Suess envisioned them to be. They don't even act like the Who's from the original book! The settings (while fairly large) have bleak colours (colors if you're American) and some appear as fairly ugly.

The Whos are not very likeable and while Jim Carrey does a good job, you will find yourself disappointed. Do yourself a favor, buy/rent the video cartoon done by Chuck Jones (and the screenplay written by Seuss himself, as well as the songs) or better yet, read the book to your kids.

I liked the original.  I like Jim Carrey movies.  I could see children liking it, but there were so many inappropriate parts for young children (of course most parents these days don't seem to mind).  I haven't seen a movie I thought was this bad since Yor-Hunter From the Future.First, what made the original so successful was the rhyming in the background.  That is why the last half hour was tolerable because the narrator is reading the story and we are watching the action that goes along with it.  Without that, the story is just boring and it is for the first hour.Second, the original was pure.  It was a simple story about Christmas and the Christmas spirit.  In this they threw in a love triangle and a shaving incident gone bad that simply confused everything.  It was almost as if they were simply passing time.Third, the flash back scenes made no sense.  The Grinch was never a nice person, yet somehow they threw in other scenes that made it seem like the Mayor and his unrequited love were the reasons for his Grinchiness.I could go on, but I won't.  Like I said, some people liked it, so I wouldn't avoid seeing it just because I said so.  However, you can't say I didn't warn you.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Well, you know something, they're all right, but this is still a great movie that everybody can enjoy. Sure, it lays it on pretty thick, from the cute little girl to Max, the Grinch's loyal sidekick dog, but its a family movie, and its suppose to be like that.  Maybe its not anything like Dr. Seuss' original version, but I'm pretty sure that he's not turning over in his grave either.  I think that Ron Howard and Jim Carrey achieved their intention to make a fun movie that leaves the audience smiling in the end.  So for all you 'critics' whose hearts are a size too small, don't take things so seriously and enjoy.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I have watched the cartoon ever since I can remember, and I think that helped me to enjoy it even more than my kids did. There were so many funny lines I missed, though, so I will definitely rent or buy it when it comes out.  I have 2 complaints.  First, why did Jim Carrey have to talk like a bad impression of Sean Connery?  Second, Taylor Momsen is cute and a good actress, but why didn't they get someone who could sing ""Where are you, Christmas?"" or have the song dubbed in?",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

In the original one, i was under the impression that it was the Whos who redeemed the grinch, and made him realise the 'true' meaning of christmas. I walked out of  The Grinch with the impression that, by stealing all of their presents, Jim Carrey had redeemed The Whos, and made THEM realise the meaning of christmas, rather than vice-versa.

446,Jen Kindala,A Christmas Classic in the Making,9,7 January 2001,"How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing.  Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.Screenwriters Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to full life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show.Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story.  Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree.  The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story.  Indeed, it  enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was.*MILD SPOILERS*  (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school.  I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on.  I know I was... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through.And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending.  When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend.  If only everyone could have such an attitude.In fact, I think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content.  It was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.This one's well on its way to being a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

Even though you can't ""see him"" through all of the great makeup, you can hear his clever acting and it will have you laughing in every scene. Of course, there are some slow parts of the show.  It was to be expected when you are trying to make a respectably long feature length film out of a 30 minute cartoon.  Even though the supporting cast plays almost no part in the main part of the movie, Carrey picks this movie up on his shoulders and makes it one of the most hilarious laughs of the year.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

When taking a children's book which had already been expanded to a 26 minute animated film and expanding it to a full length feature film, something had to be added to fill the void. Carrey is also known for pushing the envelope on what is acceptable or funny, which is great for films targeted for adults, but not so great for a kid's flick. This film not only missed the mark on a G rating, but was given a PG-13 rating. I would rather have seen a film with less ass-kissing (yes, literally) and more appropriate for the 12 and under set for which the original animated cartoon is perfect. In the end, a very funny Grinch gets the girl, but doesn't seem transformed like the one we see in the cartoon version of the same story. Jim Carrey is the best part of this movie, but it still isn't enough to carry it through. I give it a 6 out of 10.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I am a big fan of elaborate children's movies, Labyrinth, the Dark Crystal, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc., that aren't always just for children, and found I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.I really can't understand why many critics disliked this movie.  Perhaps they were so wrapped up in picking it apart that they didn't take time to enjoy it.  Jim Carrey was fantastic, (little Cindy Lou was even better), the set was magical, the direction was great, the rhyming and who-ing all worked - all in all it was pretty spectacular.

Jim Carrey was his usual shallow self with the same tiresome expressions and antics used in Ace, Batman, Dumb and Dumber, and The Mask. The entire movie mean spirited from the Grinch right down to the people from Whoville, and your left with the feeling that neither has learned much from their experiences with the Grinch.  I took my 6yr old to see the movie thinking that Ron Howard would deliver a classic, but both of us were disappointed ( my 6yr old more than I).

Great makeup and creative props and sets, but the writers couldn't decide whether ""Grinch"" would be a children's Christmas movie or a pandering money-maker. The audience would have been as big without the crude dialogue, ""kiss this, Whoville,"" ""bitchin' ride,"" and a kiss on the wrong end of the Grinch's dog. My eleven year old son though these scenes, as well as the scene with the Grinch's head embedded between the breasts of his childhood love interest, were terrific.

I also have the original Grinch and was very skeptical about this modern version. Since my kids absolutely love this film (and that's what really counts, isn't it), I have had the opportunity to see it about 20 times - mostly out of the corner of one eye. Maybe that is the key - the film has grown on me. But, maybe not. I believe I liked it the first time even though I can't really remember.Some might complain that it doesn't stick to the original story and that it is a kind of blasphemy to update a Christmas classic like this. Although the Grinch was an important part of my childhood, I don't mind. I really like this film because it is one of the very few I see these days that makes me smile and laugh.

Now that I have see the ""Grinch"", I must push the Wizard aside.  The detail to the set as well as the costumes make this my new all time favourite.  Even the egg nog cup on top of Cindy Lou Who was incredible.  The liquid moved when she moved.  Thumbs up for all sets and costumes.  Ron Howard has given us his best effort to date.  All segments keep the audience glued to their seats.  Thanks for the great work Opie. (hope thats how you spell it)  And last but not least, (but he who is last shall be first) Jim Carey has once again brought total entertainment to another level.  He is just incredible. Thanks to Ron, Jim, the cast and crew.  I truly believe this is going to be a classic.  My only reservation is that I believe the level of humour might be above the comprehension of the little people.  The 6,7,8, and 9 year olds will not understand some of the humour.  I believe that the more mature adolescent and the adult kid (me) will appreciate the humour much more. But, the set and costumes will keep the little ones happy.

The gumby-bendy toy was disguised under a green suit, but the insufferable quips and 'ad-libs' make his identity pretty clear. Which is a shame. His 'bigness' and cartoon-inspired personality made him a natural for this, but as usual he sinks into cheap shots. The cultural references that took me out of the Suessian world were what bothered me most. I came to see the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as, well, a bad imitation of Jim Carrey.The cinematography was a mess too. The film had a chance to be visually stunning, but went for visual overload instead. Completely artless. I would have loved to see what someone with a real sense of style (ie. Tim Burton) could have done.While I'm recasting, Anthony Hopkins as the Narrator was a huge mistake. His voice is dull and uninspired.

If there was as much substance to the story-telling in this as there was substance to the extravagant scenery, it might have been worth watching.  I do, or did, have some respect for Jim. He does tend to put his heart into his roles, and there were moments, when I did feel like I was looking into the eyes of that old green cartoon character.  However, a few less sarcastic one-liners might have been a bit less distracting.  Overall, I feel that this is yet another Hollywood rip-off.

The pace all feels wrong--there are times of almost excruciating slowness or just plan inanity. Jim Carrey can not carry (sorry) this movie. It seems like he's struggling to put his stamp on the Grinch and Howard offers no help. Speaking of Howard, I actually saw a clip if him comparing this movie to ""The Wizard of Oz."" What audacity! Combined with a sledgehammer marketing campaign to reap in the bucks now repeated with the video/DVD release,  I feel insulted that a perfectly good piece of entertainment (the original Grinch) has been co-opted.

If you love Carreys style you'll love him in this movie, and I think he pretty much nails the title character on the head. Unfortunately Ron Howard and the screen writers are way off the mark with the rest of the movie. Anyone who has read the original Seuss story or watched the 60's cartoon understand the who's are a selfless fun loving race as opposed to the Grinch who is mean for meanness sake ""No one quite knows the reason"" Is the quote in the written work that describes him. But here the who's aren't the lovable diminutive creatures from the book, instead they resemble deformed humans and they are a mean spirited shallow lot, who celebrate Christmas for all the wrong reasons. As spiteful as the Grinch is he is at least honest about who he is and you almost root for him to destroy whoville and swipe all the presents from those snotty jerks! Add to that the unsettling camera work and visuals that depict whoville as not a happy little town but a carnival from a nightmare.

I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly, it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast/character depth and development. I have to admit, there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill.

The one thing that might have rescued this movie is if the whole of Whoville and all the snotty Whos were bombed into oblivion by the Burger Meister Meisterburger.

487,Jokerman608,Is this movie really that bad?,9,15 January 2005,"I don't know why this movie only has a 5.7 rating! Do people hate this movie that much? I mean maybe Jim Carrey overacts just a tad, but he is still funny as hell! The costumes, makeup, art direction were all great! Especially James Horner's music was fantastic! As well, when I was growing up (reading the book and watching the cartoon version) I never quite understood why exactly the Grinch hated Christmas, but thanks to this film, I know. It gives more character depth, meaning, and more of a plot! It may not be as classic as the 60's cartoon, but it's still a worthy blockbuster hit! It certainly deserves more than a 5.7 rating! I mean it's better than the movie version of The Cat in the Hat.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

489,king_lugg,"Great when you're down, great when its Christmas, great whenever!",9,8 November 2005,"This film needs to be seen for what it is - it's not a Mystic River or a Midnight Express! It's a Christmas family comedy, and you need to remember this. If you do, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it. Jim Carrey is unbelievably hilarious as the grumpy Grinch, his physical performance, vocal performance and facial expressions are out of this world, along with the excellent lines he has; ""6 o'clock? Dinner with me, and I can't cancel that again!"" Even the angelic 6-year-old girl is hilarious (and actually cute, not irritating) as the most mature character in town, ""Dad, don't you find Christmas a bit superfluous?"", who brings the Grinch back to town for the hilarious montage of Who-bilation events.The film is incredibly cheesy and emotional, but in an amazing way! The shocking Faith Hill song is entirely brilliant for its terribleness: ""Where are you Christmas/Why have you gone away?"" Eh?! (Then again, it is co-written by Mariah Carey, so.....) But its Jim Carrey that makes the film so numerously re-watchable as you'll notice more and more side-splitting things with every time. It's also unbelievably uplifting when you're feeling down, so I completely recommend you buy it!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
490,kksmithfilms,Couldn't Believe The Changes,5,18 June 2017,"Overall, the movie was a fine movie to watch with the kids during the holiday and Christmas season. However, these additions, noted below, to the story line made me miffed and was definitely not appreciated resulting in the 5/10 star rating. 1.) Implied Adultery: I couldn't believe the Grinch was noted to possibly have come from his mother's an adulterous affair. 2.) Lying: having the politician lying in public is probably a truism to be noted from real world but in a Dr. Suess novel it seems shameful for that character to lie to Cindy Lou Who even though he is a politician and that is expected behavior from a politician. 3.) Stealing: having one of the Whos portrayed as a thief was just over the top slap in the face. I also missed the part from the original animation where the dog pulls the sleigh. I am sure p.e.t.a. would not have appreciated a real dog doing that stunt, but it was one of my most favored action sequences of the original movie and I missed it.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
491,mail-1315,Stay with the animated version,1,13 March 2005,"Visually this is beautiful, they stay with Seussical architecture and the Who look for makeup and costume. Hopkins does a wonderful job as a narrator, which won't surprise anyone.But don't bother watching it to see that. It's not enough to make this a worthwhile viewing experience. When you see this, you'll see elements of why The Cat in the Hat tanked at the box office. They don't how to take a short animated feature and extend it to the length of a movie, and in adding to the story, they add garbage and ruin it.Adding to that is Jim Carrey once more forgetting he's supposed to be playing a new character (the Grinch) and instead repeats a performance from his past (the Mask). Makeup and costume doesn't change that fact. I liked the Mask, but this is a different movie and a different character. A real actor wouldn't give the audience a repeat of old material. Stay with the animated version to experience the Grinch and the Whos. You'll get the best version of this story.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

494,alona1512,My personal opinion on the Grinch 2000,10,29 August 2014,"The BEST movie ever! I don't understand why there are so many unhappy reviewers on this magnificent film. Ron Howard, if your reading this, please please make another one but you got to use Jim Carrey as the Grinch again, he was extraordinary. And to add the icing on the cake, what about an actual Whoville Village filled with actual running stores and candy shops at Universal Studios, YEAH!! (I'm not loosing it people, I'm actually a very intelligent person with a huge imagination). I feel Ron Howard brought this amazing animated all-time classic to life. My daughter LOVES this film (and she's a teenager). So everyone ignore the negative reviews and if you haven't watched it, its a must see and I hope you enjoy it as much as the rest of us Grinch-Lovers. Way to go Opie/Richie!",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

But, I just cant watch it comfortably, it's the village peoples (Whos) faces. They just make me cringe to the point where I have to turn it off. Which is annoying because I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss and I wanted to enjoy this film. Apart from that, it's not too bad. Prefer the book (for once).",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
497,iandcopsey,A tale of humanity,10,25 December 2015,"I first watched this movie some years ago. My wife told me that I hated it. During the years since I have learned much about trauma and the resultant impact on those who have suffered from trauma. It is blatantly clear that if a young life is rejected and unloved, there is a significant impact on that victim. I have read so much about how this story is about the spirit of Christmas but from my viewpoint it is a story about how a society cannot tolerate a person who is different to them. They scorn, they reject and push a person away. This generates anger in the recipient, imposed by that rejection.That a young girl identifies the Grinch's vulnerability is a view of a compassionate mind. She understands his vulnerability and seeks to heal. While the Grinch has become accustomed to being rejected he, himself, does not understand either until she encourages him to return the Christmas gifts to the village and, at the same time, exposes the village mayor as a self centered  err arseThe story, whether realised by Ron Howard or not, is a tale of our current society that cares more about protecting ourselves and rejecting others that are less fortunate. It demonstrates our own vulnerabilities.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I'm glad I watch this movie at cinema at the first place... I think the Grinch is way underrated because this movie 12/10 for me... Today was my 19st time, next year it will be 20st anniversary and I can't wait even now... Thank you for leave a mark on my childhood, it became everything more easy, even for just one day...

501,leezasmith,Jim Carrey's genius makes the film,5,11 December 2005,"My daughter is seven years old and watched this with my husband and me. I am glad my five year old played in the other room since parts were a bit dark. I feel an hour would have been plenty for this film. The music was also a bit much for children. I understand that movies these days have adult references to keep parents interested but I feel there are hardly any movies just for kids anymore. Having said this, Carrey pulls off almost a Faegen-gone-mad character from Oliver Twist with a humorous twist only he can provide. The make-up people did an incredible job with his facial mask without inhibiting Carrey's multitude of expressions, they poured through his eyes, nose and mouth without inhibition. In the end? I think it's a great flick for 9 years and up, mostly we parents get a kick out of the humor intended for us.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

505,marthashaunessy,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,9,21 December 2017,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is such a great and heartwarming story! Jim Carrey gives an amazing performance as the Grinch. He is so funny and brings so much joy to every moment that he is on the screen. How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a story about a Grinch who never really fit in with his town and because of that he lives apart from all of the Whos down in Whoville. One Christmas he meets a Who named Cindy Lou Who. Cindy invites the Grinch to come down off of his mountain and join the rest of the Whos at their big Christmas celebration. While at the celebration the mayor of Whoville gives the Grinch a present that reminds him that he is not really apart of Whoville and that he is an outsider. The Grinch is outraged and decides to steal christmas from the Whos. With help from Max, his dog, Grinch's steals everything that is reminiscent of Christmas from Whoville. He takes the tree, food, ornaments, decorations, presents, etc. so that Whoville won't be able to celebrate Christmas. Much to his dismay, the Whos manage to celebrate Christmas without the presents and decorations by remembering that the most important thing about Christmas is who you are with and not what you have. Cindy Lou Who goes up the mountain to invite the Grinch to celebrate Christmas with her. While she is there, she is nearly crushed by the sleigh that the Grinch used to steal all of Christmas. The Grinch saves her and together they go back down the mountain. The Grinch apologizes for stealing Christmas and is forgiven for stealing Christmas. He then spends the rest of Christmas with the Whos.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
506,millerlc-15354,Stick with the Christmas Classics,1,21 February 2018,"Depending on why you've decided to watch this movie, you'll either love it or hate it. For me, I was looking for another fun Christmas movie to add to the list because it's my favorite time of year. Man, was I disappointed. Although the plot is obviously well-known, the incorporation of human characters made it more frightening than memorable. On one hand, I will admit that the make-up and costume department did a phenomenal job, but on the other hand, I found the whole cast to be more likely to be seen in a horror movie. I was unable to connect with the characters because I simply felt repulsed by them throughout the entirety of the film. Beloved classics like ""Where Are You Christmas"" sung by Cindy Lou Who were cringe-worthy instead of charming. The best movies for me are the ones where you're transported into that reality and for the duration of the film, you forget where you are. Throughout How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I was looking at my watch rather than glued to the screen. Although, I will say that Jim Carrey did a phenomenal job embracing the character and making it his own. Unfortunately for me, I found the Grinch to be dull and not as comical as he was meant to be. If you come into this movie looking for nothing more than background noise to open presents to, then this is the movie for you. I found it to be neither emotional nor exciting, adventurous nor inspiring. The main character, the Grinch, summed up my feelings about the production with a perfect quote, ""Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, double hate, loathe entirely.""",How the Grinch Stole Christmas

I have watched this movie so many times, and know all the words! i have always loved this film! It's my go to film, just because its a Christmas film doesn't mean you can't watch it like i do ALL year! Jim Carrey is the prefect Grinch and play's this character very very well! the whole movie is Brilliant and the cast bond well together! I can not believe how this film has such a poor score on IMDB have you even seen this film before rating it!? it's pure brilliance and is the best film Jim has ever done!

The comedy was off, he eats GLASS, and a live-action grinch movie isnt really that appealing in the first place. To top off that, a lot of characters act like grown ups with much ruder jokes when the grinch is clearly a concept aimed for kids. F- for this one, and im not even sure thats a thing.",How the Grinch Stole Christmas
