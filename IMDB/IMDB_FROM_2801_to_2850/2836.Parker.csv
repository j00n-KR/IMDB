0,Leofwine_draca,Undemanding fun,7,21 December 2013,"Yeah, I'm an undemanding movie fan. I just need a film to have stuff going on, stuff that interests me, and I'm happy. Jason Statham has been churning out action film after action film these past ten years, and I've liked most of the ones I've seen thus far, to greater or lesser degrees. PARKER, as it turns out, is one of the very best, thanks to a combination of strong writing and strong direction.It's not a great movie and it has one major flaw, but other than that it all runs very smoothly. The plot is more complex than you'd expect from your average Statham movie, and the sun-drenched Florida locales make for a nice change of setting. The opening heist set-piece is thoroughly engaging, as are the subsequent twists and turns. The action is really well handled and sometimes blisteringly exciting, augmenting CGI and stunts very well.So what's the problem? Around the hour mark, the narrative suddenly changes genre and this becomes a light romantic comedy. You half expect Cary Grant to show up with a twinkle in his eye. Statham takes time off from chasing the bad guys to romance an admittedly pretty Jennifer Lopez, and the pace slows right down and the storyline is forgotten. What happened? Still, half an hour later it does pick back up, rolling along merrily towards the predictable but satisfying climax.Statham acquits himself well in a role which can hardly be said to be a stretch for him, although Lopez has one of those token love interest/slightly demeaning parts and the scene in which she's forced to strip to her underwear is more than a little offensive. Keep your eye out for an almost unrecognisably aged Nick Nolte.",Parker
1,SnoopyStyle,Love Jason Statham as Parker,7,3 January 2014,"Parker (Jason Statham) is a thief who a code. He does what he says, and he expects others to do the same. So when his new crew try to kill him for his take, he is obligated to take them on even though they are connected to a big Chicago mobster. The crew's next target is a big take in Palm Beach, Florida. Parker goes to take his revenge with the help of a local real estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez).I love Jason Statham as Parker. I like this character for him. He isn't a strictly good guy. He does questionable things all the time. I even like Jennifer Lopez. She's not just some sexpot. There is an actual character here. The crew is led by Michael Chiklis and includes Clifton Collins Jr. They are all great actors.The missing element is a better caper. When the country fair happened, I thought it has a good feel to it. The Florida caper seems too much like the Oceans series. It is not the same. There are questionable logistics happening. It takes away from the reality of the movie.",Parker
2,boblipton,Statham Makes a Great Parker,8,26 January 2013,"As a fan of Donald Westlake's writing -- he did the Parker books under the pseudonym of Richard Stark -- I have long been bemused by the inability of film makers to adapt his work for the screen. Westlake wrote for the screen himself, and the Parker books are nothing but action and plot. Yes, there's character, but you figure it out from what Parker and his associates do.With this, the fourth attempt to film a Parker novel, the film makers have found a practical if surprising choice for the title role. Jason Statham is not an actor of great oratorical powers, but he is a great physical actor, and he moves constantly like an angry tiger in a cage. The choice of a caper which is set largely in Palm Beach, with its artificial, pointless display of wealth and no other reason for existence is the perfect backdrop for the ferocity of Parker in his battle with Michael Chiklis' Melander; Jennifer Lopez' clueless Leslie, who gets caught up without understanding what is going on, gives the audience a good point of view.Director Taylor Hackford is not a great director, but he is a highly competent one. Sixty years ago he would have been a major director for a studio, setting and working in the house style. Give him a story he can work with and he will hit all the notes, efficiently and effectively, and he has done so here. If the Parker of this movie is different from the Parker of the books, a bit more philosophical (although it comes down, in the end, to the tigerish ""Do what I tell you and I will devour you last"") we need to remember that a movie is not a book. This is not Donald Westlake's Parker, nor even the Parker I see when I read the books. However, it's still a very good one and worth your attention.",Parker
3,Prismark10,Payback,3,12 August 2016,"Director Taylor Hackford has really become a hack now with this dull action non-adventure film starring Jason Statham as a principled thief called Parker who is left for dead by his gang led by Michael Chiklis as they need his share of the cut as seed money for their next heist.Luckily Parker is found by a passing farmer and taken to hospital where he escapes from. With the help of his fixer, Nick Nolte he tracks down the gang in Florida where they are planning their next big job and Parker aims to get revenge with the help of Jennifer Lopez who plays a down on her luck real estate agent. It is a mundane action film, not original even though it is adapted from a book by Donald Westlake and was previously made by John Boorman as the far superior Point Blank. The film is too generic, overlong and the action scenes are flat. The film needed to be tauter and sharper and Statham who plays better when his films are injected with comedy is all wrong here. J- Lo's character is just pointless and there is no frisson between her and Statham.",Parker
4,nogodnomasters,NOBODY LIKES CHAOS,6,26 May 2019,"Jason Statham plays Parker, a thief and sometimes killer with his own set of ethics. After he is double crossed and left for dead, he decides to go after the clowns that did him wrong. But ZOIKS! The really bad guys have major Chicago gangster connections. He is advised against the action by his silent partner Nick Nolte, whose daughter (Emma Booth) Jason has a relationship.On the trail of the bad guys, Parker uses Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) a down on her luck, cut throat, high end real estate agent, who also likes to play amateur detective. Parker is resilient as bullets, knives, jumping out of a moving vehicle, and broken ribs only slows him down a step. Classic Statham ""performance"" for better or worse.I don't need to mention the no surprise ending. It's a Statham film. The fun part is the tough guy getting us there.Parental guide: occasional F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Jennifer Lopez bra/panties. Jason and Emma in shower together with discreet camera angels and arm placement.",Parker
5,kosmasp,Not a love story,7,10 August 2013,"While I wasn't aware there was already a ""Parker"" character (in books that is), I was more drawn to the movie because of the director. Taylor Hackford has done some extraordinary work. Be it ""Officer and Gentleman"", ""Devil's Advocate"" or my personal favorite ""Blood in Blood out"". But you can't compare this to any of those movies of course. I was however surprised seeing him working with Jason Statham. A man more known for his action filled roles.And while this might not be one of the better works of Hackford, it still is good action cinema. Michael Chiklis has been better though, although he doesn't get much to play with here. Jennifer Lopez gets to play in a good movie too for once (after U-Turn and Out of Sight), but don't expect to see too much of her here. This is the Statham show and that is pretty obvious.",Parker
6,classicsoncall,"""It's not the size, it's how you use it.""",7,30 January 2021,"This is a gangster revenge flick, and you find yourself rooting for Jason Statham's character Parker, not because he's a good guy, but because he's taking it to the criminals who double crossed him and left him for dead when he turned down a second heist. I'm coming to like Statham more and more as I watch his films, he exudes the kind of cool menace that's appealing to action/adventure fans. Leading the criminal bunch in this one is Michael Chiklis, who doesn't really have an outsized role in the story, but does bark orders expecting his men to jump at his command. In any other picture, Jennifer Lopez might have provided a romantic angle for the story's hero, but here, Parker fends off her advances to stay on track with his plan to derail the bad guys. Besides, he has a gal of his own (Emma Booth), and it would be unseemly for him to cast her aside, especially with her Dad (Nick Nolte) feeding him information to turn the tables on the thugs. Not a lot new here considering the genre, but there is a sit up and take notice scene when Parker takes a knife right through his palm and doesn't flinch, while hanging off a balcony no less. Just another day in the life, I guess.",Parker
7,jboothmillard,Parker,5,28 November 2015,"I have a mixed opinion about the leading British star best known for the Transporter films, he does the same thing almost every film, but I do quite often like them, and I was sure this one would be the same thing, directed by Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman, The Devil's Advocate, Ray). Basically Parker (Jason Statham) is a professional thief with a conscience and a code, he will not steal from the poor and hurt innocent people, his latest job is joining a crew of four men he doesn't know: Melander (The Shield's Michael Chiklis), Carlson (The Wire's Wendell Pierce), Ross (Crank: High Voltage's Clifton Collins Jr.), and Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman) in taking the gate money from the Ohio State Fair. They are successful, but Parker is disgusted when an innocent man is killed during, he sees it as unprofessional standards, he refuses to do another robbery with them and demands his cut, the crew refuse and decide to shoot Parker and leave him for dead. The crew are unaware that Parker is found by people passing, in hospital he has survived his beating, being shot, thrown from a moving car, and being shot again, after recovering he makes his way out of the hospital and vows to get back at the ones who tried to kill him, another one of his codes. Parker poses as a wealthy Texan businessman looking for a new high-price property, he hires real estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) to show him around Palm Beach, Florida, in fact he is searching for the crew from a lead from his mentor Hurley (Nick Nolte) to a new heist they plan. Parker finds where the crew are holding up and plans his plot to get them, but they learn he is alive and contact the mob they are now working for, they send hit-man Kroll (Daniel Bernhardt) to take care of him, and Parker's girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) gets herself caught in the middle as well. Leslie also finds out through researching that Parker was not who he said he was, she is intrigued by him and follows him, she is keen to help him in any way he can, not realising Parker plans to kill the men who betrayed him. The crew pull off another big robbery of valued jewellery, but Leslie and Parker find their hideout and the thief is able to kill the four men, he promises to help Leslie and her family get a better life, and in the end, months later she is shocked to have a delivery of thousands of dollars from Parker. Also starring Patti LuPone as Ascension, Leslie's mother and Ant- Man's Bobby Cannavale as Jake Fernandez. Statham does his usual hard man seeking vengeance well, Lopez certainly has the looks and curves, and Chiklis does well as the meanest of the villains, there is nothing new here, a man wants revenge on those who wronged him and kills them, but there are still some great bone-crunching fight and action sequences, it is a likable enough crime thriller. Worth watching!",Parker
8,Tweekums,A solid Jason Statham crime thriller,7,18 September 2017,"Parker is a thief with his own moral code; he won't rob from those who can't afford it and he won't hurt anybody unless he thinks they deserve it he also does what he says he will do and expects the same of others. His father in law sets him up with a reputable crew to rob the Ohio State Fair; things don't quite go according to plan and afterwards this crew tell Parker that they intend to use their million dollar haul to fund their next job. Parker wants out so they shoot him and leave him for dead. Of course he isn't dead and he is soon on their trail; he intends to find them, wait for them to do their robbery then take their spoils before killing them. This takes him to Palm Beach, Florida, where he poses as a wealthy Texan looking to buy property. Estate agent Leslie Rodgers shows him a variety of properties including some that have recently sold one particularly interests him and sure enough it is the one the gang are using as their base. When it becomes clear that Parker is alive the gang's mob connections send a killer to deal with him.If you are looking for something deep and meaningful then you are likely to be disappointed but if you want a solid crime caper with Jason Statham doing his thing then this is rather fun. In many ways Parker is like most other characters he plays; tough and almost certain to come out on top even after he has taken a beating. There is plenty of great action and a few shocking moments; most notably when Parker gets a knife through his hand. Jennifer Lopez does a decent job as Leslie; it made a refreshing change that at no point did was there any romance between the two leads. The rest of the cast were solid enough; especially Michael Chiklis who was believably menacing as the chief antagonist. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you are a fan of Jason Statham or enjoy the genre.",Parker
9,paul_haakonsen,"Entertaining, but not extraordinary...",5,17 December 2015,"The storyline in ""Parker"" was adequate, but it was a bit too ordinary and mundane, and something that has been done too many times, and that is what ultimately made the movie mediocre.The story is about a heist gone awry and the mind behind it is betrayed by his fellow criminals. Leaving Parker behind for dead, the gang moves on to their next big heist. But Parker is not dead, and no one double-crosses Parker and walks away.The action sequences were good, but they couldn't pull up the mediocre storyline. And as such, this wasn't one of Jason Statham's better movies.As for the acting, well it was good. And Michael Chiklis delivered a good performance alongside Jason Statham. I can't claim to find Jennifer Lopez to be a talented actress, so casting her for this movie was beyond my comprehension. There are far better female talents who could have delivered so much more to the movie by having a knack for acting.""Parker"" is a good enough action movie, just weighed down by a mediocre plot and storyline. And as far a Statham movie goes, then it was something he could do with his eyes closed.",Parker
10,blanche-2,"so many murders, so little time",7,9 October 2021,"Jason Statham stars as ""Parker"" from 2013, also starring Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Nick Nolte, Bobby Cannavale, Wendell PIerce, Patti Lupone, and Emma Booth.This is one of those macho films where there is enough blood, shooting, strangulation, knifing, and punching to make five movies. It was relentless. Not to mention the explosions. And we get to see Jennifer Lopez' beautiful body as she has to strip down to prove she's not wearing a wire.As Parker, Statham survives shootings, knifings, kicking, punching, and enough blood loss to fill a blood bank and just keeps on going. As part of a successful robbery, he just wants to take his cut and go. But the head of the team, Melander (Chiklis) has another idea. He wants to invest some of the money in another robbery that is going to bring them millions each instead of a measly $200,000 each.Parker refuses and shooting begins in the car. He jumps out, landing in the road, and one of the other robbers is sent to kill him. He shoots him, Parker rolls down the hill and manages to live.After almost strangling someone with a chair, he finds out Melander and his team are in Palm Beach. Posing as a rich Texan, he has a real estate agent Leslie (Lopez) show him some properties, all the time looking for the gang's hideout.Miserable with her life, Leslie checks ""Parmitt"" out and finds out he's a complete phony. She tells him she wants in on whatever he's planning.Good cast, and I enjoyed the last few scenes the most. This is the type of movie where you can just shut off your mind and watch. On that level, it's non-stop action, and you really do pull for Parker.",Parker
11,Quinoa1984,"sometimes very good, and sometimes not.",6,29 January 2013,"Parker, Taylor Hackford's adaptation of the Donald Westlake character (aka 'Richard Stark' creation), has about 45 minutes to an hour of a very good crime/heist flick with Statham performing surprisingly decently as the titular character, made iconic by Lee Marvin in the masterpiece Point Blank and memorable (in some circles) by Mel Gibson in Payback. The story is still kinda familiar if one has seen the other major Parker movies - Parker does a job, gets screwed over by his partners in crime, and now wants payback. But instead of being an adaptation of 'The Hunter' as those other films, this claims to be an adaptation of... I forget the title right now, yet it still retains that feel of being the usual Parker flavor in the first half. Which, actually, is okay since Hackford direct these scenes and this set-up with some excitement and some dark humor, and Statham can be compelling even when he's just, like, speaking (as opposed to his usual beating up people like a superhero). But when it gets to the Jennifer Lopez plot line about halfway through, she's a) miscast, and b) just not that important to the story, until maybe later on in the tale. This could have been cut down and given to a younger actress and it might have worked much better. As it is, I just couldn't really take Lopez seriously (for the most part, some scenes she's okay), and it detracted from the rest of the heist in Palm Springs and the revenge unfolding. It's sometimes better than it has any right to be, and disappointing in how it could have been better - probably not 'great' at any time, and with some shots Hackford just seemed to want to take in Palm Beach locales as opposed to the actors. I wish it just weren't so darn 'cute' for much of the second half, where it turns into a wacky buddy-comedy when its not still a super-violent spectacle. I'm still waiting on the day when a filmmaker can rise to the challenge of artistically getting up to what Boorman did with the first Parker flick. This time around as the first ""official"" film (author Donald Westlake didn't allow the name to be used officially, and now he's dead so whatever), Hackford via the Hollywood machine keeps some of the grit intact, but also is diluted by Lopez and a tonal shift that's too jarring.",Parker
12,Theo Robertson,Didn't This Star Lee Marvin ?,5,3 September 2013,"It doesn't take much for Jason Statham's agent to pitch a script to him "" Okay Jase this film sees you play a bit of a tough geezer . You play an international criminal with a London accent and you've got to beat up and shoot a lot of bad criminals . Lots of action , some smart one liners and you get a babe , so what'd ya say ? "" Statham doesn't do Shakespeare or Dickens , he does action but even so you might have expected him to diversify a bit before now . I mean he's surely paid off the mortgage and doesn't really need the money and PARKER is very run of the mill lacking any of he full blown bravado of CRANK and if anything resembles the classic thriller POINT BLANK That's maybe the problem and that is PARKER resembles POINT BLANK a bit too much . It's called PARKER after Statham's character could easily be called WALKER after Lee Marvin's anti hero from the 1967 classic . It lacks something of the hard edge of POINT BLANK which in its own way was a ground breaking movie acknowledging New Hollywood was on its way and in when you've got Hollywood bringing out these type of thrillers for the last 45 years a film like PARKER seems a bit old hate . The truth is when you've seen a Statham movie you've seen most of them",Parker
13,LeonLouisRicci,Not Better Than Point Blank (1967) or Payback (1999)...But Very Good,7,16 August 2013,"In this incarnation Richard Stark's prolific Parker Novel Character is a bit more musclebound. There is more Code than codification, but the basic Persona comes through and this unflinching juggernaut is determinedly visible in the form of multiple, ugly scars.This is more slick and surface than the Norish Novels but manages to keep the Parker Persona alive on Screen and that's a good thing. Statham is acceptable and appears more soft-peddled than Mel Gibson, and not as complex and conflicted as Lee Marvin, but it works.The Violence is more personal and gritty than most of the Action Stars other Vehicles and He is a better Actor because of it. Lopez is an underrated Actress and has a presence and a natural delivery that is missing in a lot of Bimbo Beauties.Overall, this is a welcome continuation of Paperback Pulp and is a refreshing relief from Digital and a return to more Personal Pain without all the over the top CGI Clichés and the Star's usually ridiculous Kung-Fu choreography.",Parker
14,CinemaSerf,Decent escapist crime drama...,6,2 May 2020,"Jason Statham once again proves to be very dangerous fella to double cross. This time, ""Parker"" meticulously plans a heist that nets him and his gang a million bucks. They are greedy, though, and when they want to use their ill gotten gains to stake an even bigger robbery - which our man ""Parker"" isn't so keen on; they dump him on the roadside, left for dead. Bad move! Once he is back on his feet, he works with the frankly annoying realtor Jennifer Lopez to thwart their proposed robbery. As you would expect, there are loads of fisticuffs, gun battles and plenty of bloody noses in this action-packed crime thriller. It will not challenge your little grey cells in any fashion; nor will the dialogue stimulate a heated debate over coffee and cigars afterwards - it is a fun outing for Statham, aided by Patti LuPone and Nick Nolte on occasion and is precisely what you should anticipate it being...",Parker
15,zardoz-13,Revenge with Honor,8,26 January 2013,"The brawny Jason Statham crime thriller ""Parker"" qualifies as uneven but entertaining. Too many characters converge in this above-average revenge melodrama. Hispanic diva Jennifer Lopez plays one of those extraneous characters in ""Black Swan"" scenarist John J. McLaughlin's flawed screenplay. Cast as a divorced, debt-ridden, real estate agent, Lopez never gets intimate with her rugged ""Transporter"" star. Instead, she is stuck in a supporting role and lends only minimal sizzle to ""Blood In, Blood Out"" director Taylor Hackford's otherwise high-octane actioneer. In one scene, she strips to her undies for our suspicious protagonist to see if she is wearing a wire. Meantime, our hero has somebody else, in an even smaller role, who attends to him after he's been shot, stabbed and beaten up. Nevertheless, when Lopez isn't chauffeuring Statham around scenic Palm Beach, Florida, she is meddling with his carefully laid plans the same way Lucille Ball used to interfere with his Cuban band-leader husband's nightclub show in the ""I Love Lucy"" television comedy. This energetic R-rated epic follows the exploits of a tough-as-nails professional criminal named Parker who lives by a strict code of ethics that reflects his principles. He doesn't harm anybody who doesn't ask for it, but robbery is still his bread and butter. When an armed guard nearly succumbs to a heart attack, Parker calms him down while he steals from him.Statham isn't the first actor to incarnate Parker. If you're counting, ""Parker"" marks the sixth time Hollywood has adapted the late Donald E. Westlake's crime novel that he penned under the pseudonym Richard Stark. Initially, French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard changed the sex of the role for actress Anna Karina who played Paula in ""Made in USA"" in 1966. Lee Marvin took a bullet as the same character with the name Walker in director John Boorman's violent shoot'em up saga ""Point Blank"" in 1967. Jim Brown played him as McClain in director Gordon Flemyng's account of a hardboiled hold-up in ""The Split"" in 1968. Robert Duvall landed the role as Macklin in director John Flynn's ""The Outfit"" in 1973. Finally, Mel Gibson appropriated the part as Porter in director Brian Helgeland's gritty, bullet-riddled ""Payback"" (1999). If you haven't seen these previous adaptations hardboiled melodramas, you should put them on your wish list. ""Parker"" opens with an explosive heist at the Ohio State Fair. Parker (Jason Statham of ""Safe"") supervises an elaborate heist with his four partners with whom he has never worked. This quartet masquerades as either clowns or cops, while he dons the collar of a clergyman. They plunder the concession booth and make off with hundreds of thousands of dollars. A case of arson designed to distract the authorities so the gang can make a quiet getaway concludes with the tragic death of an innocent bystander. No sooner has this criminal quintet fled with their ill-gotten gains than Melander (Michael Chiklis of ""The Fantastic Four"") insists Parker chip in his share of the loot so they can finance a $50-million haul in Palm Beach, Florida. Naturally, since our hero doesn't trust his accomplices, he refuses to join them. Melander pulls a gun on Parker, and they careen recklessly down a public highway trying to control Parker. Parker beats them up and then bails out the window. He slams into the asphalt and lays there stunned. August (Micah A. Hauptman of ""S.W.A.T.: Firefight"") shoots him once and disposes of bloody corpse into a ditch. Miraculously, Parker survives this near-death ordeal and lucks up when a family stops to help him out. Our hero awakens in a hospital as the police are making inquiries about him. He manages to elude them despite the trauma and a gunshot wound he has experienced. He sets out to track Melander and his duplicitous cronies down to sunny Palm Beach, Florida. Parker's escape from the hospital and his improvised methods of stealing cars and money along the way is fascinating stuff. Not long after Parker arrives in Florida, he hooks up with Lesley (Jennifer Lopez of ""Enough"") and sets out to find where his ex-partners are holed up. ""Parker"" loses momentum at this juncture, before it recovers with a suspense confrontation between our amoral hero and the dastardly quartet of hoods. Despite the alluring attraction she provides, Jennifer Lopez could have been deleted entirely from the movie. After all, what is the point of having a looker like Lopez if she is not the hero's romantic interest? Meantime, Hackford and McLaughlin confine Parker's girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) to the periphery with little to do aside from fleeing from his assailants and nursing our hero's wounds. She doesn't have enough time to make much of an impression. Michael Chiklis, Clifton Collins Jr., Wendell Pierce, and Micah A. Hauptman are thoroughly convincingly as ruthless criminals who leave Statham for dead on a road with a bullet in him. Unfortunately, we don't learn much about these thugs since Hackford and McLaughlin concentrate on the plight of Lopez' hard luck character. Looking way past his prime as Statham's mentor, Nick Nolte spends most of his time growling his lines of dialogue as if he were recovering from a hangover. One of the best close quarter's combat scenes pits Statham against Swiss actor Daniel Bernhardt, who replaced Jean-Claude Van Damme in the ""Bloodsport"" franchise. For the record, Statham and Bernhardt performed their own stunts in a knock-down, drag-out, brawl. This bruising man-to-man knife and fistfight qualifies as one of the highlights of ""Parker."" Clocking in at just shy of two hours, ""Parker"" could have been leaner and meaner had either Lopez's scenes been trimmed or the two women had been merged into one. Nevertheless, die-hard Statham fans will enjoy the white-knuckled shenanigans in this muscular melodrama.",Parker

17,neil-476,Crime thriller which keeps its schizophrenia under control,7,15 March 2013,"Robber with morals Parker (Jason Statham), shot and left for dead, wants only to recover his share and teach people how to behave properly. Having tracked those who owe him money down to Palm Beach, he poses as a Texan businessman in order to get a real estate agent to help him identify the property they may be using as a base. He may not have reckoned with the real estate agent having her own agenda, and the crew who owe him money having high powered connections... This crime caper movie starts off firing on all cylinders. It opens as a robbery gets under way and then stays in full action mode for the best part of an hour. Then Parker arrives in Palm Beach, encounters Jennifer Lopez's hard-up real estate agent, and something really weird happens. You can feel that, at this point, the film badly wants to become a comedy. It never does - it remains a violent, hard boiled crime thriller throughout, but there is always this strong urge for it to be something lighter and frothier whenever Lopez is around.For all that, I enjoyed it especially given that it didn't always do what I expected it to. It was, as always, a mistake to get Statham to do accents - as well as a generic American accent, he is saddled with having to have a go at a Texan accent, and accordingly he wanders around all over the place - US tough guy, Texas, and (mostly) London, sometimes all in the same sentence. The action sequences are well staged (Statham exhibits powers of recovery on a par with Wolverine's healing factor), with one especially satisfying moment during a fight which produced an audible, ""Oof!"" from the cinema audience. Good fun, if a little odd in places.",Parker
18,Uriah43,Betrayed and Left for Dead,5,29 April 2021,"This film begins with a small group of men successfully carrying out a dangerous plan to rob the finance office of the Ohio State Fair and making off with a sizeable amount of cash. During their escape in a car immediately afterward, the other four members of the team ask ""Parker"" (Jason Statham) to contribute his share of the stolen loot to help finance an even larger burglary worth several millions of dollars. Angry with the manner in which the first robbery was handled, Parker refuses and as a result his fellow accomplices proceed to shoot him and then leave him for dead along the side of the road. The problem is that Parker isn't nearly as bad off as they imagined and after being treated for his wounds manages to escape from the hospital. From that point on he is filled with rage and becomes determined to have his vengeance upon those who betrayed him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been a very good film had the director (Taylor Hackford) used a bit more common sense and made things more realistic. Instead of that, however, he chose to have the lead character shot, stabbed and beaten a number of times with few, if any, significant damage to him. Only in Hollywood. Likewise, I didn't especially care for the manner in which both Emma Booth (as ""Claire"") and Jennifer Lopez (""Leslie Rodgers"") were cast as rivals for Parker's affection. In any case, while this wasn't a bad film necessarily, I thought it should have been better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Parker
19,ferguson-6,It's just like a Jason Statham movie,5,27 January 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. By now, we know what to expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching fist fights, big guns, fast cars, pretty girls, and wise cracks. Hope and expectations were a bit higher for this one since it's a John J. McLaughlin (Black Swan) screenplay of a Donald E Westlake novel, and it directed by Taylor Hackford (Oscar nominated for Ray).Statham plays Parker, a masterful thief with a straightforward code that he isn't shy about sharing. His partner/mentor is played by Nick Nolte and Parker finds himself knocking off the Ohio State Fair with a group of guys led by Michael Chiklis. Things don't go well and Parker finds himself left for dead.It starts as a heist film and transitions into a revenge flick. Of course, there are some Statham style romantic elements included. Emma Booth plays Nolte's daughter and Statham's love interest. Then, we get Jennifer Lopez as a down on her luck Realtor who lives with her mom, but somehow manages to figure out that Statham's character is not as he appears.Lopez and her hyper over-acting don't play well with the stoic Statham. She does, however, get to flash her best known ASSet. Nolte's character gets lost in the shuffle, which is a shame. More scenes with Nolte and Statham could have proved interesting. Also, there is an odd story line with Bobby Cannavale as a Sheriff who has the hots for Lopez. With the exception of a brief interlude, this promising story line just disappears. Lastly, the film's big Palm Beach heist seems extremely amateurish and pretty difficult to believe.Basically, Statham is the best thing about this Statham movie. The rest is pretty messy and disappointing ... especially considering the DNA that this one offers.",Parker
20,anaconda-40658,Park-er Somewhere Else!,2,29 April 2015,"Parker (2013): Dir: Taylor Hackford / Cast: Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Emma Booth, Nick Nolte: Routine and deplorable action film that seems to applaud the theory of robbing the rich to benefit the poor. Jason Statham has a by the numbers role called Parker who pulls a heist with four other guys. After the operation he is asked to join in another heist. Parker refuses and as a result he is faced with fending off shotgun brandishing villains that leave him for dead at the side of the road. Needless to say he doesn't die and he sets out to learn what the next heist is and get revenge. Jennifer Lopez enters as a real estate dealer who lives with her mother and is struggling with the result of divorce. Eventually the two end up hooking up and she gets involved and who gives a crap? Taylor Hackford has made good films such as Ray and Dolores Claiborne but this is Hackford at his worst. Plot is standard and structure becomes even more ridiculous as it goes until arriving to a conclusion where theft is applauded. Statham sleepwalks through familiar material while Lopez ranks this amongst her worst performances. In fact, her big scene seem to be a scene where she is required to strip in order for Statham to see whether she is wearing a wire. Michael Chiklis is wasted as a thug villain. Emma Booth plays a girlfriend to Parker who is constantly patching up his holes. Nick Nolte is wasted as the guy who sets Statham up with a group of thugs that will eventually turn on him. While the Palm Beach, Florida scenery is fetching, the rest of the film is about as fetching as a punch in the face. Score: 2 / 10",Parker

22,gradyharp,"""I don't steal from anyone who can't afford it, and I don't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it.""",6,26 May 2013,"The quote at the top is the unique code of thief Parker (Jason Statham) and that code along with genuine concern and appreciation for those in need is what makes this character an interesting diversion from not only Staham's usual roles but also brings a sense humanity to the role of criminal that is embedded in the Parker character from the double named author Donald E. Westlake/Richard Stark has created in a series of books. The concept works and gets us through an otherwise rather repetitious, excessively long on action/short on plot movie. Taylor Hackford works with a fine cast but the characters from John J. McLaughlin's screenplay could have been cast by far less expensive actors and no one would have noticed the difference.Parker is asked to join 4 other guys - Michael Chiklis, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins Jr. and Micah A. Hauptman – to pull of a theft during an Ohio State Fair. They pull off the job flawlessly and Parker wants to part ways with them. But because he refused to join them for another job (one involving stealing millions of dollars of diamonds to be auctioned for charity) they try to kill him. They dispose of his body but a sweet country couple finds him and he is still alive and takes him to the hospital. After recovering he sets out to get back at the ones who tried to kill him, another one of his codes. He learns where they are (West Palm Beach) and poses as a wealthy Texan looking to buy a house. He hires a Realtor, Leslie Rogers (Jennifer Lopez) to show him around (Lopez silly cranky mother is a bit part for Patti LuPone). He is actually trying to find out where they're holed up. And when he finds it, he sets out on his plan to get them. But when they learn he is alive, they contact the mobster to take care of him. So he sends a killer to take care of him.One of the puzzling sidebars is Parker's relationship with his girlfriend Claire (Emma Both) whose father Hurley (Nick Nolte) seems somehow involved and approving of Parker's occupation. The presence of Claire prevents any love relationship with Lesley and that rather negates the need to have cast Jennifer in a fairly flimsy role. Adding Bobby Cannavale (a fine actor) in a toss away bit part also makes little sense. But the film is like that – motivational elements are often missing or contradicted making the plot a bit difficult to follow. Couple that with the fact that view of the actors enunciate clearly enough to understand what they are saying and those are some of the reasons the movie just doesn't make it big. For fans of Jason Statham action flicks this will satisfy. It just could have been tighter in budget with unknown actors in most of the parts and edited down a step to maintain the audience's attention span. Grady Harp",Parker
23,mm-39,Pay Back is better!,6,28 December 2014,"Parker is set in a 1970's profession criminal genre aka Charles Bronson style. Statham is typecast-ed like Bronson in a professional criminal role. Strong, silent, intense with a soft spot for the right people. I believe we will not be seeing Statham in a comedy or romance! Parker's story is interesting in the beginning with the character development robbery, and ends strongly with another robbery/revenge conclusion. Regrettably, Parker's story falters with the Jennifer Lopez character. Why would Parker trust the character, which disjoints the story. I thought Lopez's cop friend would create a interesting plot twist, which never developed. The action scenes, and acting was good, but the director lost the feel and energy for Parker with little character development. Compared to Porter in Payback or Driver in The Driver, Parker is missing the synergy of strong characters intermixed with the movie's story. Parker reminds me of the one of those 1970s Charles Bronson films (Mr Majestic) which is more formulated and loses movie chemistry in the process. Six out of ten.",Parker
24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Parker,7,17 February 2013,"Cinema audiences have in recent months been introduced to literary franchises such as Lee Child's Jack Reacher series with Jack Reacher, and now Richard Stark's Parker novel series hits the screens with Taylor Hackford's Parker, with Jason Statham in the starring role of a professional thief who lives by his uncompromising moral code that he imposes on his partners, only to soon find himself being double-crossed, and through a stroke of luck in surviving what could have mortally finished him, returns to exact a cold and calculating revenge. And yes, it certainly did seem like any other Jason Statham action film out there.But as a fan, I guess that's exactly what one would be asking for, since if it ain't broke, why fix it? Casting Jason Statham in an action role will only mean some elements of characterization staying consistent (and that's why he's casted, right), as someone who is as much of a lone wolf as he is a team player, talks less, delivers much, and doesn't waste time nor BS in dispatching opponents. Being a real tough guy, action sequences get crafted to his strengths, together with his reputation of doing his own stunts bringing some authenticity to the characters he plays. Some may find fault with his acting chops, but face it, you don't come to expect much of that in a Statham marquee action film.The plot is kept fairly simple. We get treated to a major heist at a carnival with Parker and a new crew introduced by Parker's mentor Hurley (Nick Nolte), which came with a bad after- taste when Parker's rule gets a little bit compromised when one of the four members deviated from their established plan and put strangers in harm's way. But more deviation from the original intent came up, as Melander (Michael Chiklis) suggests they reinvest their earnings to prepare for a much larger job, and with Parker's refusal, he gets gunned down and left for dead. But you can't keep a good man down, and before you know it, he's back plotting off the heels of his ex-crew, to steal what they had stolen from him and more, but not before they send a hit-man Parker's way.Action sequences here are stylishly created, bloody and violently executed to perfection. Statham versus Kroll (Daniel Bernhardt) was a highlight, in their close quartered combat in an apartment, coupled with the finale which was what Statham normally does best when in character - quit the talking and get down with the executing. A few scenes allow Statham to show off his usual physical moves, which are usually impressive treats that Statham has to pull off to cement his action star status.And lucky for Statham, he gets romanced by two ladies in the film. There's Emma Booth playing Claire, Parker's love and daughter of his mentor Hurley who naturally becomes a target when Parker's life is at stake, and Jennifer Lopez as a desperate real estate agent who gets unwittingly caught in Parker's revenge plans. Lopez doesn't act in too many movies these days, but she plays the perfect fodder opposite Statham, lending good comedic timing to an action film that's serious from the get go. The romance didn't really work too well since it's unrequited love that's adopted here, and somehow these scenes felt too laborious, necessary to set up how Parker is a loyal one woman man, but is largely unnecessary to the main plot on vengeance.Director Taylor Hackford, who had done an action thriller with Proof of Life, could have improved the pace of what seemed like a fairly straightforward film instead of having its middle act sag on the weight of an inconsequential romantic focus and repertoire between the two leading characters - yes we get that engaging a star like J.Lo would be wasteful if scenes do not exploit her physical presence - and having more challenging villains would have helped Parker cement that his mission wasn't that easy a walk in the park. Still, for Statham fans, this is once again an automatic must watch, just to see how many iterations of the same film can he get to do, time and again. Let's hope he keeps it varied enough to avoid a career like Segal's!",Parker

Not really anything wrong with that, but fans of the Richard Stark novels will be disappointed.And even though there are plenty of punches and flying bullets, the movie doesn't really have any spark; which is the primary reason for my disappointment.

Jennifer Lopez always seems to come in for criticism and whilst I wouldn't go out of my way to see a film she was in, I've always been impressed when I have watched her. But then I'm the only person in the world who loved Gigli! Having recently read Flashfire by Richard Stark (Donald E Westlake, I was keen to see this adaptation. Actually I was so impressed with the book and it's cinematic possibilities I was all set to pen a screenplay myself when I discovered i'd been beaten to it. This is a good solid thriller that, yes, also includes a bit of this and that. As with the book we go house hunting in Palm Springs and at first have little idea why, again the female attachment appears to be a hindrance but then pays off. My only real criticism is that the Stark books are so full of small details and a seeming intimate knowledge of criminal activity. Naturally in the bold sweeps of a movie this tends to get left out. In the book Parker seems to spend half the time hid out in the house, here just a brief scene. Do yourself a favour and give this a watch.",Parker
27,siderite,I really wanted to like it,6,4 May 2013,"I wanted to like this movie so much, because I really think Jason Statham has some serious acting skills and he deserves some good scripts. Also the story is based on a book, so it should have been good.Alas, it was not to be. And it has almost nothing to do with J-Lo being in the movie. The characters are bland, illogical in almost everything they do, even Parker, the Statham's character. Worst than that: they are unsympathetic. You have a lot of greedy people, some of them evil, some of them stupid, and apart from them is Parker, who is not greedy, just stupid. He puts everybody at risk for his own principles, he gets beat up and shot a few times and somehow he still walks. It's like Crank, but without anything fun in it.I have to say I am a fan of Michael Chiklis, from Vegas, but his role was small and two dimensional. One dimensional, really, but I was going with the cardboard metaphor. You wanna know who was the most clear cut character, the one that did the job and was consistent? Daniel Bernhardt in the role of the Mafia killing machine.So, bottom line: a waste of time and of good actors.",Parker

31,Hellmant,A good but routine Jason Statham action flick and it's definitely no 'PAYBACK'!,7,14 February 2013,"'PARKER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Jason Statham plays Parker, the lead character of Donald Westlake's (going by Richard Stark) action/crime-drama novel series. This film is based on the 19th 'Parker' book titled 'Flashfire'. Other films have been adapted from the novel series but the name 'Parker' has always been changed. The first book in the series ('The Hunter') has been adapted into films twice; once in 1967 starring Lee Marvin ('POINT BLANK') and once in 1999 starring Mel Gibson ('PAYBACK'). In this film Parker is out for revenge against the heist crew who double-crossed him. It co-stars Jennifer Lopez and Michael Chiklis. The movie is entertaining but also pretty generic Jason Statham action fare. Parker (Statham) is a crook with a code of ethics (he doesn't hurt people or steal from the poor). He's asked to do a job, with 4 other guys he doesn't know, by his mentor Hurley (Nick Nolte) and reluctantly takes the offer. The job goes well but when the crew asks Parker to do another bigger heist with them and he refuses they shoot him and leave him for dead at the side of the road. He's found by commuters passing by and taken to a hospital. Once he's recovered he flees the hospital before being questioned by the police. He then makes it his mission to get revenge on the crew that betrayed him, who are led by Melander (Chiklis). He tracks them to Palm Beach, where they're performing their next job, and poses as a Texan wanting to buy a house, in order to scope out the place Melander and his men are staying at. Lopez plays a Realtor named Leslie who shows him the house. Leslie's depressed, lonely and desperate and quickly intrigued by Parker. The movie was directed by Taylor Hackford (who's directed such classics as 'AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN' and 'RAY') and written by John J. McLaughlin. It's adequately directed and the action scenes are brutal and entertaining but the story is pretty predictable and unoriginal. Jennifer Lopez has gotten good reviews for this (for doing something different and better than she usually does) but she's still nothing special in the film. She's funny and nice to look at but when she started out she used to take a lot better roles (like 'OUT OF SIGHT' and 'ANACONDA'). It's nice to see her doing something different for a change though. Statham is good and does what he does best but he's no Mel Gibson. Gibson brought a lot of character to the same role in 'PAYBACK' and that film was funny and had a lot of style. This is a good but routine Jason Statham action flick and it's definitely no 'PAYBACK' (or anything special you might expect from a Richard Stark adapted 'Parker' film).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5qSQfmiLqM",Parker

Directed with brio and panache by Taylor Hackford, the film features Jason Statham as a big-time robber who's left for dead by his cohorts (Michael Chiklis, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins, Jr., and Bobby Cannavale) after a post-heist falling out, proving once again that there is no honor among thieves. Statham spends the rest of the film plotting his revenge against the men, employing real estate agent Jennifer Lopez as an unlikely accomplice to that end.While I probably could have done with a bit more of Chiklis and company and a bit less of Lopez, I must say that ""Parker"" has enough energy and spirit to ride up and over most of its shortcomings, including succumbing to that third-act curse that afflicts far too many action movies these days. The film is just offbeat enough to be engaging and wise enough not to take itself too seriously. The action moves at a breakneck pace for most of the duration, with the few lulls serving to provide amusing commentary on that action.

But then, the creators of Parker thought: Why not add an extra 45 unnecessary minutes of an absolute terrible script, predictable twists and J.Ho and ultimately, completely waste everyone's time?One can accept a Jackie Chan movie or a Fast & Furious chapter the same way that this movie began. If you know it's just dumb action, so be it: do the obligatory 'leave your brain at the door' and just have fun. So why did they need to change it? Why throw in horrible side stories, make Statham's Parker a less charismatic and aimless Porter (Mel Gibson's 10x more enjoyable character from the 50x more fun Payback) and waste Statham's small window of time to be the great action star he could be?Even when Statham shows signs of not knowing how to fix this mess, at least he's still minutely enjoyable when his roughly 4 scenes of absolutely uninspired action appear in this overlong 2-hour film. And, admittedly, the movie is shot gorgeously at spots. Yes, these are postcard images of South Florida, but it's still very beautiful and this commercial certainly does take you away from the waste of all talents involved.Basically, the movie starts off with Parker getting his Transporter rules broken after a small(er) heist and then he turns into, again, Porter from Payback so that he can claim his ""rightfully"" stolen $200,000. First, it's about principal and he needs to track down the bad guys. But, then it's about revenge and safety of his loved ones. But, then it's about saving one barely intelligent and financially unstable female. But, then it's aboutYes, the movie continuously shifts gears in what it wants to be about and spends way too much time with mediocre scenes and ideas, boring characters, heists and worst of all: the dumbest robbery and ""climax"" in Statham film history. Make that: a five-year-old could construct the big-movie-heist and getaway far better than this writer.The movie lacks heart, charm, good action scenes and editing. Truthfully, it's not the absolute worst I've seen from any of the players involved, but it's an absolute skip.We should all listen to the average moviegoer from time to time. If they don't like something, it's even worse than someone that has seen and reviewed just shy of 100 movies by a year's fifth month's closing.",Parker

This is something his associates, lead by the ruthless Melander (Michael Chaklis) fail to adhere to on their latest job with him, after which they leave him for dead and make off with the loot. Parker survives, and learns from his mentor Hurley (Nick Nolte) that Melander is more powerful than he first seemed, and is planning another big job in Palm Springs, where Parker aims to settle the score, teaming up with down on her luck estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) to get a piece of the score.Jason Statham is an action hero for the modern age, who's a pale reflection of those from years gone by including Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, but who nonetheless has carved himself out a solid CV of disposable action flicks that have enjoyed a steady theatre showing each time round. Obviously, seasoned director Taylor Hackford felt that such was his mark on modern cinema, he deserved something with a bit more meat on the bones and cast him in this ostentatious but totally flat and unexciting no hoper that never gets off the ground once during it's nearly two hour running time and remains as dull toward the end as it does at the beginning.It feels like Hackford got an idea of what an average Statham film was like and wanted to make his own, only with a little more edge and bigger in scope. And so we have some flashier co stars, including Lopez as the reluctant love interest who takes nearly an hour to make her appearance, and a very aged, ragged looking Nolte, whose best days are clearly well behind him. With regards to J Lo, it's like he's trying to drag out the suspense and make a big entrance for her, but it's not like anything leading up to it gets you up for it, with a laborious, overly complicated plot line and intermittent action that sets the tone all wrong and leaves you short changed.It would have been better if Hackford hadn't set his sights so high and just made another forgettable, hour and a half Statham movie. This pretentious, self aggrandizing misfire is just proof that by trying to give Statham something with a bit more depth and substance, Hackford has just made a Hack job. *",Parker

Parker is your run-of-the-mill action heist thriller and it's essentially a rehash and it has a predictable outcome. That being said, I happened to be a Jason Statham fan so I knew I would enjoy this. I liked how it doesn't take itself seriously and it has Jason Statham doing what he does best. The consensus is if you like Jason, you'll like the film. If not, it's best that you avoid it.Taylor Hackford directs a film about a thief who lives by his code of ethics which is essentially don't steal from poor people and don't hurt people who don't deserve it. While on a mission, he gets double-crossed by his own people and as an act of revenge he decides to take on a bigger score in West Palm Beach.....the same score his people are going after.As for the acting, you get what you'll expect. Jason Statham is on full display with his action skills and that is to be expected. His female companion in Jennifer Lopez is okay. J.Lo isn't the best actress but she looks very good for her age. Does Michael Chiklis make a good baddie? Eh, not really. But this movie is about Statham, not about the bad guy.Overall, Parker ended up being a decent movie more in the lines of past Statham films. Don't expect anything new or fresh, but do expect a fun time. I got what I was expecting and thus I was overall pleased. I rate this film 8/10.",Parker
38,A_Different_Drummer,Interesting Movie ... but nothing to do with Parker,7,4 January 2014,"A long time ago in a place far away (the 60s) there was a bestselling writer of thrillers who was at the top of his craft. But that was not enough for this writer, he had a secret urge to write a different kind of novel, a kind that really had been seen since the 1940s. Dark. Fast. Efficient. Lacking any moral center. And he did, using a pen name. ""Richard Stark."" They were called the Parker novels and they are considered today the best of their kind ever done. Even other writers go nuts for these. Then Hollywood came knocking. Attempting (repeat, attempting) to bring the essence of Parker to the screen, some 6 times so far. And succeeding -- maybe -- twice. The Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson versions were not half bad. Which brings us to the 2013 attempt. Yuck. You would almost suspect that the reason they chose a one-word title - ""PARKER"" -- is that, without the title, most people would not know or suspect the connection to the above-mentioned series. As a thriller, it is weak, boring, derivative and barely useful for cable. As a Parker entry, it is a bad joke. As a pre-audition by Jennifer Lopez (the older, slimmed-down version) to get the lead in a future biopic of the Natalie Wood Story, it is however compelling.",Parker
39,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Pen Guy,4,23 February 2020,"Parker has existed as a movie character for quite some time now, just never as his proper name. Donald E. Westlake's famous anti-hero has been in many movies ranging from Point Blank (Walker) to Payback (Porter), with a few others in between. And, honestly, you're better off with any one of those as this is a very lazily-produced potboiler.Jason Statham is the now English Parker who has been betrayed by his latest criminal cohorts and left for dead, so far so familiar. Quickly regaining his strength he sets about exacting his payback (!) by usurping them on their next jewel heist down in Florida, recruiting desperate real estate agent Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) along the way. The action is exciting and well done, and the movie is fun, but...wow...does it look terrible.Adapted from Westlake's novel Flashfire and directed by Mr. Helen Mirren (Taylor Hackford, a veteran filmmaker who should know better) you'd be forgiven for refusing to believe that this cost $35,000,000. Where did that money go? It's not up on screen. Shot in 5K resolution but then edited in 2K, thus losing 60% of the detail in the process (why???) this movie is filled with harsh color boosting and hard contrast. The aerial shots of sunny Florida look like they were shot in 144p. It really is the ugliest mainstream movie I have seen in the past decade.It seems that since the advent of digital cinematography that production standards have suffered. Shooting digitally tightens the schedule as less time is needed between takes. There's no more loading, cutting, and printing, and this removes vital down-time that would otherwise be used to enhance the production value. For example, there is a scene where Jennifer Lopez is checking out Jason Statham's ass and is hungry for him. All I saw was an actor wearing a crushed suit that he appeared to have slept in. They didn't even bother ironing it! Imagine if they got that lazy with James Bond.Parker looks like they just chucked the camera down, shot the scene with absolutely zero thought given to atmosphere or composition, and then quickly moved on to the next one. Look at Payback from 1998. The original cut of that movie looked very noir, while the 2006 ""Straight Up"" cut with different filters and lighting looked like a gritty 70s thriller. Any random episode of Neighbours or Home and Away looks better than Parker. An extremely poor effort that spoils the whole movie. It's simply not pleasant to look at.It's so strange that Jennifer Lopez is the best thing in this, easily outshining the actress/character who is playing Parker's boring, flat wife. Having previously been a drag with no charisma (Money Train, The Cell, Ben Affleck) she's definitely become more entertaining and interesting since becoming a MILF.You'll never come back to this movie, which is a shame as I often enjoy either cut of Payback and Lee Marvin's Point Blank is a classic of 1960s cinema. This movie will never achieve such status and it's poor production value is to blame.",Parker
40,cosmo_tiger,Statham's best movie in awhile. Not quite another Transporter movie but it's nothing that new either. Worth seeing once. I say B-,6,7 May 2013,"""We got someone on the inside, it's the score of a lifetime. Guaranteed."" Parker (Statham) is the best at what he does. After leading a crew during a robbery he gets double crossed when he refuses to change his rules. After being left for dead Parker has only one thing on his mind. Revenge. I will start by saying that I am a Statham fan, but lately he is beginning to repeat himself. He started off strong with Lock Stock and Snatch then hit Transporter and decided I'm gonna do this guy all the time now. I do enjoy his movies because they are entertaining but you can only see the same thing so many times. He has been trying to break out of that role little by little and this is his biggest departure. Don't get me wrong, this is still a Statham movie but its not wall to wall ass kicking like most of his stuff. All that said I was really trying to like this movie but there was just something about it that kept me from really liking it as much as I wanted to. The last twenty minutes are really good and action packed but the time up until that time its a little less interesting and a little draggy and repetitive. All that said though this is his best movie in awhile and it is worth seeing, but really only once. Overall, Statham's best movie in awhile and is worth seeing, but I'm not sure about buying it. I give it a B-.",Parker
41,callanvass,"A thoroughly routine vehicle for Jason Statham, and dare I say dull?",4,18 September 2013,"Jason Statham has been contributing apathy as of late. He's a very charismatic action star, and he's old school in his approach, but his recent movies have left me feeling flat, aside from the highly entertaining Expendable movies, and the surprisingly enjoyable Safe. He hasn't done a lot of entertaining stuff these days. Parker continues that trend, unfortunately. Parker doesn't really have that much action in it, and that's why I like Jason Statham. Aside from a bloody and intense fight scene that takes place in a hotel, this has a disappointing amount of action. I respect that he wants to expand his range, but this isn't the way to do it. He needs to start picking better scripts. He plays a great anti-hero as usual, but the script doesn't back him up. Jennifer Lopez is probably the best thing about this movie. She has really improved over the years when it comes to acting. She was funny and sympathetic. She does have a few good scenes with Statham as well. Michael Chiklis is OK as the villain, but nothing special. Nick Nolte provides solid support, but he doesn't have much screen time. Final Thoughts: This is average stuff. It's worth a watch if you're a big Jason Statham fan, but you could do a lot better. Action junkies will most likely be bored. It's just rather mundane4.9/10",Parker

Only in here uses stealth more than action.Parker talks about the usual revenge story under the baritone of disguise & principles. The characters are deep except for the one portrayed by JLo. She is the comedian but I think she over-acted. Supporting cast is good.Screenplay has some issues in the beginning, but in the second half, it does entertain. The plot (which over time gives you an impression that it was all cooked up, taking extra care into plot details) has nothing new to provide as far as the story is concerned, but it did entertain me with good locations & setup. I may not cherish this movie, but was a good one-time watch. CGI is very good and it has its moments.

44,Floated2,Standard Statham Action Film,8,16 October 2013,"Parker is another film starring Jason Statham as he plays the lead crook in an action crime thriller. Parker tells the story of a man who goes undercover with several identities where he follows suit with his crew but then later he realize they were only using him for no good. The first scene shows Parker (Jason Statham) as an undercover priest attending an amusement park where he plans his first heist. It is a well done opening scene as it grabs your attention and keeps you on your feet.Parker is filled with a lot of great action scenes, fight scenes and the violence is top notch and realistic. As seen in many Statham film, his characters get into trouble and when it looks as if he is left for dead, he makes a remarkable comeback. This is no different. Co Starring along is Jennifer Lopez who plays a Real Estate woman helping Parker with housing, who then gets dragged in his business. At first it was seen as unbelievable but she held her own and wasn't turned off her acting.In Parker you see Statham shoot the villains in their heads, stab them in their chest and head, and him taking quite a few of tough hits (including one where a knife gets wedged in between his hand). However he is a warrior and it all makes it believable. As a rewatch 05.13.17' Parker delivers on all counts of action, story and revenge. One of Jason Statham's better more recent films. 07/17/18' a second rewatch Parker remains a high interesting action film. Recommend",Parker
45,johnnyboyz,"Not the sort of adaptation we would have hoped for, as plastic action and rushed storytelling dominate.",5,30 December 2015,"To be blunt, ""Parker"" doesn't work. It isn't thrilling enough to be the crime thriller it evidently wants to be and is not satisfying enough to be the rock-'em sock-'em actioner it seems to want to in part be as well. Its pace is unmeasured; its narrative loses us too many times; it doesn't seem to know what to do with its supporting characters and isn't funny when it's trying to be. Jason Statham is the titular Parker, a thief with very little background to him other than the fact he is English; possesses a vast experience in engaging in heists and is married to a woman who is the daughter of an elderly gentleman that seems to know the ins and outs of the coast-to-coast American criminal underworld. Aficionados will already know that he is based on a character going on 60 years old: Donald Westlake's (writing under the penname Richard Stark) rouge gangster-cum-thief Parker, who first appeared in the novel ""The Hunter"" and the film ""Point Blank"". Back then, he was played by Lee Marvin but has, over the years, undergone an array of modifications that has seen him depicted by people as somewhat diverse as Mel Gibson and Peter Coyote. Indeed, the last we saw of him was in 1999, when a troubled picture by the name of ""Payback"" was shoved into cinemas off the back of changes at the very top and a variety of re-shoots. In the meantime, he has appeared in a series of Darwyn Cooke graphic novels in the late 2000's which, from what I have seen, caught the mood and tone of a lot of what Stark wrote. ""Parker"" is brighter and breezier than much of its preceding kin; it is fluffier and more throwaway. The film, itself an adaptation of a book entitled Flashfire, which I have read, seems to be aware of who all the characters are but doesn't have the faintest idea in how to direct them around the screen. The opening heist is at an Ohio county-fair, where the money made on the day is targeted by Statham and four other goons: a black one; a balding sociopath; a wormy one who's only there because of who he's related to and a demolitions expert, whose role is much smaller than in the novel upon which this is based. We are informed fairly early on that Parker is not an animal, in that he takes time to calm down a nervous hostage where another may have killed them on the spot. From here, violent disagreements (unrealistically played out in a moving vehicle) lead the others way with Parker's share to another job they need the total haul to pay for, and this causes Parker to have to start from scratch in getting over an injury; finding clothes; a car and whatnot so as to eventually find his share. Statham, the wrong choice for the role, struggles with a character that is one-dimensional; flaccid and needs various shots of his scars to develop character. Stark's novel, neatly unfolded and indelibly written, provides all these people with the room they need to breath: the ditzy estate agent whose down on her luck looking to 'pull' the lead; the local Florida policeman who fancies her and thus threatens to rumble the plan she has with Parker the more he follows her around; the Latin-American forger who has his own problems; the gang of four who betrayed Parker in the first place and are now busy planning a new job; the anonymous assassin sent by the mafia to kill Parker after he interferes with their circles of influence.Taylor Hackford looks to paint a canvas of similarly broad scope of these characters; people and scenarios, but does not manage it. His film constantly feels as if it is in a rush to get where it's going, when tone and mood are what characterise film-noir. Parker's relationship with Jennifer Lopez's estate-agent is not tense or teasing enough to have us genuinely feel like he is torn between falling for this woman and remaining faithful to his existing partner, who are very much into one another. Its centrepiece, this quite gruelling fight scene in a hotel suite involving knifes; shower curtains and all the other elements, merely reminds you of a better crime film in ""Eastern Promises"". The great, overbearing thing hanging heavily over this film is the quite brilliant 1998 Steven Soderbergh film ""Out of Sight"" which, like ""Parker"", depicted a likable villain amidst a sea of psychopathic ones; provided its protagonist with an unlikely love interest and saw events dart from bleak industrial cities to sunny Florida hotspots. The casting of Lopez in this sense was poor judgement on the producer's behalf, who must have been aware how akin to Soderbergh's piece ""Parker"" would represent and that she played a role in making it as god as it was. I wanted to like ""Parker"" more than I did, but its existence is a sign of the times: flashy, shiny and colourful crime fiction featuring people ill-suited to the roles provided and unsure as to how to unfold a burning story because this is not the age of narrative film-making. If there is to be another Parker adaptation in the future, which I hope there will be, I would hope few people involved in this one have any say in how it turns out.",Parker
46,leonblackwood,Typical Statham Movie. 3/10,3,13 July 2013,"Review: This movie is just your usual Jason Statham movie, where he goes around beating up on people for revenge. It did start off OK but then it went downhill when they tried to moralise the whole thing. It then got worse once Jennifer Lopez got introduced, which I think, was a bad choice because we all know that she isn't as dizzy like she is in this role, so it wasn't that convincing. The director wasted a lot of time with the planning of the whole heist, which made it drag and you just wanted them to get on with it. Some of the fighting scenes weren't bad, but we have seen it many times before in Statham's movies. It was could to see Nick Nolte in his couple of scenes and Michael Chiklis, from the Shield, played his part well, but the whole thing was very average.Round-Up: I seems like Statham is really trying to follow the steps of Seagal & Van Damme, but look what happened to there careers. The older that Statham gets it the more silly his movies are going to become, of he doesn't start trying to cover avenues. I think that I prefer his acting when he isn't in a leading role like in Snatch or The Italian Job, because he style is very limited. Judging by the money that this movie made, even with Lopez as his co-star, there is definitely some work to do with the roles that he picks. As for Lopez, I honestly think that she has been out of the game, way too long and that its going to take a massive movie to reboot her career. Not like Nick Nolte who just seems to breeze from movie to movie, always giving a good performance.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $17.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Statham movies, with loads of action and not that much thought to storyline. 3/10",Parker
47,TheMovieDiorama,Parker grabs his violent vengeance by teasing an unsympathetic estate agent.,4,25 February 2020,"Palm Beach, Florida. A secluded island lavished with intimidating properties and aromatised in money. Where freshly cemented streets are illuminated by golden lights. Island access only possible via a drawbridge, enhancing the security of its inhabitant. The perfect yet improbable location to steal a myriad of jewellery worth millions of dollars. Well, not for Parker. A meticulous criminal who constructs elaborate plans to steal cash, often wearing questionable disguises. But before Palm Beach, there was the Ohio State fair. His recruited greedy peers left Parker for dead, and now he wants revenge. Who's the man for the task? Jason God damn Statham. That's who! The only actor who churns out the same broody character and yet somehow magnetises his performance with bravura.Hackford's adaptation of the nineteenth book in the Parker series (no idea why that specific one) started with much promise. The state fair robbery was packed full of energy, entertainment and as much mediocrity one can expect from a straightforward Statham action flick. The double crossing within the tightly confined SUV was palpable, with McLaughlin's plot moving briskly onwards. New identity created, lover's house invaded and now permanently ""off the grid"". Parker's violent stance gradually diminished over time. Then, we're introduced to the elongated Palm Beach scenario that seemingly does not end. Cruising around the island searching for houses, Parker encounters estate agent Leslie Rodgers.Ladies and gentlemen, this bring me to Parker's inherent issue: Jennifer Lopez. Now, it's not so much her. She's fine. Passable. A characterless object for the camera to zone in on her legendary cheeks. The problem is her character. This depressing, self-loathing, pessimistic, whiny woman who we, apparently, need to feel sorry for. The whole ""I'm tired of helping the rich when I can't afford the lease on my surprisingly expensive car and still live with my mom!"" thing. If her character had any personality, other than smelling of desperation, then perhaps empathy could've been produced. Leslie was an incredibly irritating one-dimensional beast, that clearly had ""no chance"" with Parker. The shift in narrative focus towards her pretty much slaughtered the entire second half. Parker is no longer the main event. It's Leslie. Should've just called this ""Leslie"". Heck, I'll even take the choppily edited bloody balcony brawl over Leslie!Regardless, it's an ""action"" film with Statham in the lead role. You know exactly what you are getting yourself involved in. Watchable and dare I say decent in some parts, despite Leslie's existence, but utterly forgettable the next day.",Parker

49,Vartiainen,Enjoyable,6,1 February 2021,"A Taylor Hackford film, starring Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez. The story revolves around Statham's character, the eponymous Parker, who's a high level thief, much sought after in the criminal underworld for his cool demeanour and ability to think on his feet. But then a job goes sideways and he's betrayed by his supposed partners in crime. He survives and vows revenge.It's not the most complicated plot ever, but it has its basic building blocks in a neat row and knows what it's doing. A film like this is pretty much destined to the B movie pin, but there's something to be said about the charisma of Jason Statham. And J.Lo, for that matter.What's most enjoyable about this film is its heist hijinks. Whenever Parker is smooth talking his way through red tape or conning people into doing whatever he wants, the film soars. Whenever it's doing anything else, it's pretty banal. J.Lo's character is admiringly grounded and you get her blight. But at the same time, she's perhaps too grounded for the film's style. If you catch my drift. I'd much rather see this type of character in a psychological crime drama or something like that.Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching the film. A good film to check out if you're a fan of Statham or lighthearted heist films. And if you're not, it's still a pretty slick experience.",Parker

As for Parker, everything is at least okay with those: the director Taylor Hackford is an accredited creator and names like Jason Statham, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Lopez are certain signs of quality and non-boredom. They are pleasant to follow even in less interesting and less veracious scenes.Well, the script is probably the weakest part of the movie: too much predictability, excessive sections (e.g. Parker-Claire, prolonging the duration to almost 2 hour 15 minutes) and trivial ending (unlike in movies by Guy Ritchie, for example). Nevertheless, Parker is still an above-average A-movie, qualifying well for a sociable entertainment.",Parker

52,alindsay-al,A below average typical statham film,4,25 May 2018,"There are so many Jason statham action films out there that it is crazy, this guy will always have a steady paycheck and that is credit to him. I have just watched Parker and this is one of the more forgettable films he has done for sure. The premise of the film sees a thief with a code betrayed and left for dead, do he has to go after the ones who turned on him. Now Jason statham was okay in this movie because he played the same character that he does in everything so it works in this film. But his character has this code and he just ignores it for the majority of the movie and I just don't understand why you're really meant to root for this guy that much as he isn't shown to be a good person. On the positives Michael chiklis is actually quite entertaining in his role and you can tell he is having fun in this role. But everybody else is just so boring, Jennifer Lopez is a one dimensional character that is as cliché as you can get, same could be said for Bobby canavalle's character and I could barely understand nick nolte half the time he was on screen. The story should have been a simple one of a revenge thriller but it tries to be too much and introduce other plot elements that you just don't care about or want to see in this movie. By the time the film focuses up you will have lost interest in what is going on. The script surprisingly had some decent humour in it, and some one liners that actually worked because of what type of film this is. But the dram is awful, I didn't care when I was supposed to and it hurts the film as it leads to you not really rooting for the characters. The style has some pretty brutal action scenes in it and I liked some of the heist elements of the film. Though I noticed that the editing of some of the fights was really jarring and hard to follow as it cuts so many times. Also the pacing of this film is not good, I would have preferred it to have been easily 15/20 minutes shorter then what it was. Overall safe is another statham movie but unless you are a huge fan of his I reckon this is one to ignore.",Parker
53,pixrox1,"""Nothing but bills . . .""",8,1 February 2013,". . . is the funniest line in a movie that has more than a few. Delivered by Jennifer Lopez as a struggling Boca Raton, FL, realtor in the second of three postscripts to the main story, it reflects the matter-of-fact tone tinged with a touch of irony that pervades director Taylor Hackford's screen version of the Richard Stark novel Flashfire. Unlike, say the recent Schwarzenegger vehicle THE LAST STAND, Parker is NOT a movie which defies common sense from the get-go. Parker is not a cartoon (except for the implausible number of injuries the title character played by Jason Statham is able to bounce back from in the span of 2 hours; but given the level of abuse his character took in CRANK #1 & #2, Parker is at least a little more convincing). Parker's mentor Nick Nolte and his ad hoc partner Leslie (played by Lopez) are on-screen just enough to balance Parker's character with a check here and there, but not too much. Ditto Emma Booth as Parker's lover (and frequent nurse) Claire. The opening set piece filmed at the Ohio State Fair is more fun, perhaps, than the later jewel auction heist, but at least neither scene has viewers cringing for the safety of an aged retired California governor. Two thumbs up!",Parker
54,estebangonzalez10,"Rather than Parker, this film should be titled Statham",4,25 September 2013,"""I don't steal from anyone who can't afford it, and I don't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it.""The title of the film is based on the main character who is a thief with a set of moral codes which he never breaks. Oddly enough, Parker resembles every other Jason Statham character played on film, more than the character he was based on in Donald E. Westlake's novel ""Flashfire."" If you aren't familiar with the novel, you might be familiar with the 1999 revenge film, Payback, starring Mel Gibson. Despite not being called Parker in that film, Mel's character is supposed to be the same one played here by Statham. If you've seen both movies you will discover that they are completely different, so fans of Westlake's novels featuring Parker might be disappointed if they expect to experience that action hero, because all they will find is another Statham movie. I don't have a problem with Statham, I think he has great charisma on screen and has made some good films, but his act is wearing out if he doesn't try something new. This is the kind of film that he can make with his eyes closed considering he doesn't have as much fighting scenes as he usually does. The same could be said for director, Taylor Hackford, who has made some really strong films in the past like Ray and The Devil's Advocate, but this one is simply another generic and predictable heist film. John L. McLaughlin adapted the novel and this is also one of his weakest efforts considering he has written strong screenplays before (Black Swan and Hitchcock). This film didn't bring anything new to a genre we've seen played out a million times before in even straight to DVD movies. I could probably come up with a list of dozens of other revenge heist films that stand above this one. Parker was simply too generic and poorly executed with a character playing a thief with a strong moral code (which really never seems believable). Parker (Jason Statham) is working on his next heist after his long time partner, and now father- in-law, Hurley (Nick Nolte) recommends him and introduces him to four other thieves for an apparently easy heist: Melander (Michael Chiklis), Carlson (Wendell Pierce), Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.), and August (Micah Hauptman) who has close connections with the mafia in Chicago. After the heist the five thieves easily escape with the money, but instead of splitting the 200,000 they had all agreed on, Melander asks Parker and the rest of the gang to invest it in another heist in which they could all walk out of with a couple million dollars each. When Parker doesn't agree and asks for his share of the money, the rest of the members of the team shoot and leave him for dead. Parker survives and sets out to get back at these men because he believes in his set of ethical codes and they have broken it. It is not just about the money anymore, and he doesn't care how connected these men are with the mafia, he is out to set things right. After learning about their whereabouts in West Palm Beach he takes on a new identity and hires a real estate agent, Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez), as an excuse to look around and find these men. The only problem is that they know Parker is still alive and have set the mafia after him as well.Parker is supposed to be an anti-hero, but it really doesn't play out like that in this movie. I couldn't identify with him and never found his set of moral codes really believable. Statham has charisma, but it just didn't play out that well with his character Parker. This felt like just another heist film where the audience is sort of forced to pull for the bad guy simply because he has a good heart. He only kills people when they don't do what they are told, he only steals from rich people, etc. He simply doesn't pull it off here and I couldn't root for his character. The film tries so hard to justify his actions in such a way that it never feels authentic. I also found Jennifer Lopez's role pretty pointless. Her character doesn't bring anything to this story and at times her life feels like a soap opera. There were so many pointless things going on in this movie that could've been left out. The longer the film played out the more and more I disliked it. There are no thrills, the love triangle is hardly developed, and not even Statham's classic action scenes save this movie. Parker is simply too formulaic and very forgettable.",Parker

56,sauravjoshi85,The movie has nothing new to offer.,5,19 August 2020,"Parker is an action thriller movie directed by Taylor Hackford and stars Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Emma Booth, Nick Nolte and Michael Chiklis in the leads.Whenever you watch a movie with Statham in the leads you expect some fireworks with action, stunts, car chases and lots of fight but this one is a disappointment.The plot of the movie is repetitive and nothing new is offered and also the execution is also a big disappointment.Acting is average as only Statham is the saving grace. JLo was unimpressive and rest characters were equally bad. The pace of the movie is uneven and hasn't much fuel to keep your interest running.Screenplay is average, direction is average. Climax is predictable but good. The length of the movie is also a problem because as said earlier the movie is not that gripping.Overall much was expected from the movie but the movie is a serious disappointment.",Parker
57,juneebuggy,Decent revenge thriller for Statham fans,8,5 April 2015,"This was pretty good, especially if you're a Jason Statham fan and just sit back and enjoy the ride. It was actually better than I was expecting in some respects since I wasn't to keen on the whole Jennifer Lopez aspect going in but she plays a desperate, past her prime sort of character and thankfully not a love interest, so that worked for me.Not as many flashy fight scenes from Statham here but still enough good ones with unique aspects (knife through hand, chair to trachea, dive out car window) to keep me more than interested. He gets beat up real bad a couple of times here with a serious amount of bloodshed.I also had to laugh at his attempt at being a Texan, yeah the accent was terrible but I think it was meant to be.Statham is a professional thief here, an anti-hero with a unique code of ethics who is double-crossed and left for dead by his former partners, then spends the remainder of the movie seeking revenge (and to hijack the crew's latest heist) while getting help from a real estate agent (Jennifer Lopez).This was kind of a long movie, going to multiple directions and several locations, and with a plot that wasn't as predictable as most action/ revenge thrillers tend to be, so I enjoyed those aspects. Nick Nolte plays a small role as Parkers girlfriend's dad, a career criminal, and the band of bad guys was atypical but still decent and entertaining for antagonists. I liked the opening heist scene at the fair, where Parker is a priest (he dons several different disguises in this) which was amusing. 3/22/15",Parker
58,davispittman,Had potential to be better.....,5,13 November 2016,"Parker (2013) did have the potential to be a better film than it turned out to be. I watched this movie because I am a Jennifer Lopez fan and I liked the sound of the plot. The casting was done well, I enjoyed Jennifer Lopez and Jason Statham in the starring roles. Both Statham and Lopez portrayed their roles well, Of course for Statham this kind of role isn't anything out of the ordinary, or something he isn't familiar with. Lopez doesn't normally play these types of roles, but she did well with it none the less. The action sequences are pretty run of the mill and what you would expect, nothing new on that front. The plot is alright, kind of the same thing as the action scenes. Script is good at times and kinda lackluster at other times. The movie also seems sort of disjointed sometimes, moving slowly and losing the audiences attention. That is always very bad, maybe even the worst thing for an action film. It's not like that the entire runtime, but the times when it is that way makes you feel like you want to fast forward. 5/10 for Parker.",Parker
59,TdSmth5,Lots of fun,10,24 September 2013,"Parker is a meticulous criminal with a heart who works complex crimes. He lives by one standard that is that he does what he says he will do and he expects others to do the same. He doesn't like to kill or injure innocents.His friend/handler Hurley puts him in contact with a gang of criminals and they pull of a theft at the Ohio State Fair. It doesn't quite go as planned and there are injuries and one death. As they make their getaway the gang proposes Parker that they all invest this money for a future crime that will yield them several millions each. Since that was not the original deal, Parker isn't interested and they try to kill him instead leaving him injured by the side of a road.Parker escapes the hospital and starts working on revenge to honor the original terms of the deal. He gets new papers, money, cars, weapons, and starts investigating where he might find the gang. That takes him to Palm Beach where they are planning on stealing a collection of jewelry with some inside help during an auction. He pretends to be a Texas oil millionaire looking to buy a mansion. Lopez plays the real estate agent showing him around. She's in financial trouble, lives with her mother, and also falls for the rich charmer. In reality he is scouting the place where the gang might be working and which they will use to lay low after the crime. But she has her suspicions and looks into his financials and discovers he basically has no history. She goes ahead and tells him and even offers to participate in whatever he is planning for a commission. He agrees of sorts. But by then a contract killer hired to kill him and his loved ones (his girl Claire and her dad Hurley) finds him and a violent fight ensues.The next day the crimes happens and Parker has his revenge all planned out but didn't count on Lopez's character showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time.I guess people think of Statham movies as an action film subgenre, even though they are all very different. What they have in common is Statham's fighting style and that they are all very good. Parker, too, is excellent and I enjoyed every minute of it- the story, the settings (Ohio, New Orleans, Florida), and the entire cast. It's always great to see Chicklis; I haven't cared for Nolte in the past but he's good here. While people seem to have an issue with Lopez, I have nothing against her as an actress or dancer- as a singer, that's a different matter. Unfortunately they made almost no use of Lopez's most charming feature- her smile; and what's with the awful, distracting, giant eyebrows? She plays her role mostly for laughs, which adds some lightness to the serious and violent movie. And it's very cute to see her character try to seduce, beggingly, the unavailable Parker.Parker is a great, mature action movie for adults with a rich story, good characters, and a terrific cast. Direction is perfect, unintrusive, not desperate to inject personality, quirkiness or, annoying music.",Parker
60,ShelbyTMItchell,Typical Statham Movie!,7,18 August 2013,"Statham in order for him to really breakout of action type roles and he can act, is really to choose from different roles in order as he seems to have played the same character despite different movies like ""The Transporter."" Here he is Parker a thief with a heart of gold who does not rob from the poor or kill without a conscience. Left for dead when he is asked to do something that goes against his beliefs. After being left for dead, he awakes to find the people, led by Michael Chiklis and track them down.Jennifer Lopez in a comic relief performance as the clueless Realtor who helps Statham and finds out who he really is. After playing with a Texas accent, does not fool her. As she proves to be a reliable foil but nothing romantic.Parker's girlfriend Claire is wasted in a one-dimensional role.

Emma Booth, who I have not seen previously, was also good as Parkers's girlfriend, but I think I would have switched for Lopez myself.Anyone familiar with Payback is going to know the whole story here.

62,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Boring plot & characters,3,19 July 2014,"Jason Statham so far hasn't lost his knack to find a cast in need of an agile and athletic action star. There really is no need to explain neither why he's cast in these movies nor why people flock to go see him. As a whole he's a good actor but there are moments where an actor should see the flaw in a production they are looking to work with. I guess he didn't read the script over enough times because this action piece doesn't contain much substance or emotion that assists it in its cause to create memorable entertainment. Even worse is that the supporting cast was made up of other decent actors and they fail to compel as well. I just don't get it.To begin with, Statham plays almost the same type of character he usually plays - a vigilante. OK, so he begins as a leader to a thief group, but later turns vigilante when his partners ambush him when they let him in on another plan that'll bring in more money when he disagrees. But this is by far one of Statham's worst roles. The man he plays is a professional thief with an ethical code - alright. The only ethical code I know that he has is making sure to stick to and follow through with the plan. So exactly why he turned down his group's offer is obscure. Information that is also obscure are the names mentioned throughout the movie. Besides the main characters, all the other names mentioned have no purpose. The audience either will never see the person certain characters mention or it'll be real late in the running time and who cares by then?As for Statham's group ambushing him, the plot just turns into a cat and mouse run of the mill. There is nothing special about it. All Statham does is swap out from car to car until he gets where he needs to go. The key flaw here is convenience. Either Statham's character has a serious eye for open opportunities (which I doubt) or everyone in this particular story is extremely absent minded. Does everybody leave his or her cars unlocked? I expected more from writer John J. McLaughlin, the writer from Black Swan (2010) and Hitchcock (2012). Did McLaughlin just get bored with this one? It kind of shows too because there are scenes with respectable actors but they only show up for half the movie - beginning or end.You have Nick Nolte playing a good friend of Statham's character. Nolte's character gives tips and hints on what to do, Statham's character disagrees and then Nolte is out of the picture for the last half. Then there's Jennifer Lopez who plays a frustrated land agent in Palm Beach. She has no purpose in the plot until half way in the movie when Statham goes to Palm beach. Supposedly she states that Statham can't make it on his own. Right,...he got around just fine stealing unlocked cars. How could anyone in Palm Beach be anymore naive? Surely there must be some idiots around town too. Lopez has no purpose in the story. She doesn't excel the story nor is she utilized to any degree that entertains. Yeah so there's a scene of her in only underwear, but that's not utilizing her talents.The main antagonist is played by Micahel Chiklis best known for playing The Thing in The Fantastic Four (2005). Here Chiklis isn't much of a likable villain. He yells and curses a lot with no real purpose. He always looks and sounds mad too. The action in the film is OK. Some of the bloodier scenes look real while others look digitally enhanced, but there's nothing that's special. A lot of the action feels dragged too, its pacing is bad. David Buckley's music to the film isn't any better. It works with the provided scenes but none of it feels authentic enough to think that it belongs to an orchestra. The music was just blahh. If you're a true Statham fan, there should be no problem viewing this but as whole, the film wastes time.Credit can only be given for having a decent main cast, OK action and the standard Jason Statham formula, but that's it. Its music is derivative, the characters are uninteresting, the story drags and is too convenient for its own good.",Parker
63,Kingslaay,Easy and fun viewing,6,5 September 2021,"Another nice action film that is brought home by Jason Statham. The plot is very thin and easy to follow. There are some other big names in the robbery in the crew who betrays Parker. Also I thought J Lo should have been his love interest. The love interest in the film serves close to no purpose, she could have easily been removed without affecting the plot.",Parker
64,Rob_Taylor,Yet more typical Statham fare.,6,6 May 2013,"A decent, solid action/heist movie that suffers a little in places due to a variety of things I'll note below. On the whole, however, it is a decent movie and way better than the last Statham movie I saw - Blitz - which was a little dull.What you get is Statham being Statham. You know what to expect with his films and he doesn't disappoint here. Fight scenes tend to be quite well done and there was an attention to small details that I found refreshing.For instance, in one fight, Statham is wrestling with a thug for a gun. He ejects the clip, grabs it and stabs it in the guy. I doubt that is terribly realistic, but it was funny. Where the scene worked was that the gun would still have a round chambered. Some gun scenes are just deplorable in movies, but they used this fact to good advantage in the scene and Statham finished off the bad guy with that chambered round. He then pulls the clip free, loads it in the pistol and works the slide to chamber a new round. I know this might not sound like much, but the number of times I watch a film where the gun mechanics are hand-waved away is ridiculous. It was nice to see them actually get it right for once.If the movie has any real faults it is in the pacing. The film bogs down in a couple of places and perhaps a more aggressive edit might get rid of some of the unnecessary fat in this movie. There's not a lot, but what there is slows things down a little too much.The other thing I took issue with are the thugs. One of them is supposed to be the son/relative of a big Chicago mobster. Yet the rest of the gang treat him like an idiot (he is) and give him precisely zero respect. I couldn't help thinking every time I saw this... ""All he has to do is pick up the phone and complain to daddy and these guys are history!"". Apparently it was a thought that didn't occur to either the thug gang, or the mobster's son, and it seemed just plain wrong that they would be dumb enough to treat him like that.All in all, though, Parker is entertaining fare. I won't say it's Statham's best movie by a long way. But it is also a long way from his worst.Worth a watch.",Parker
65,bob-rutzel-1,Good Action Thriller,7,23 May 2013,"Parker (Jason Statham) is a thief with codes to live by. He is left for dead by his cohorts in crime when he refuses to join them for another heist. He vows to go after them and get what is his. Seems that some big stars want to hitch their wagon to a profitable venture such as any Jason Statham movie. Here we have Jennifer Lopez doing that and when I first saw her name associated with this I knew 2-things: She would get a lot of screen time and many, many lines too. Okay, 3-three things: this won't be as good as other Jason Statham movies. I was in cringeville. And, then I watched the movie and was wrong, wrong, wrong. She did good. Who knew?However, there was a difference with this movie. Most of the time Mr Statham's character goes about his business cutting down the bad guys without any real complication, but in here he meets his match with some bad guys who kind of beat the hell out of him. He still wins, but it's not easy. Some of the fight scenes were too real for me and I had to check myself into the local ER to make sure all was okay. I am fine. Thanks for asking. Add to the beatings, we have Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) getting in the way of Parker's plan to take out the bad guys. Okay, we knew something like this would happen and we cringed for a bit, but we were pleasantly surprised that she did good. Who knew?All in all a good action thriller as we would expect from any Jason Statham movie even with a star who hitched her wagon to a profitable venture..but did good. Who knew? Nick Nolte and Michael Chiklis also star.Will we see other big stars hitch their wagon to other successful ventures: Matt Damon, Bruce Willis, Arnold (hey, is he back?), Sylvester? Time will tell. We can only hope the scripts will be as good as this one was. Kudos. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, briefly, 2-times.. Language: Yes, not much.",Parker
66,quincytheodore,"Brief excitement from the two leads and some action sequences, although the material drags too long for its own good",6,25 May 2015,"If Jason Statham has been stuck in one-dimensional roles, he's not going to make any breakthrough at Parker, despite having southern accent and hair at the first scene. A bit of action, more of heist thriller, Parker is overly long and awkwardly paced. Fight scenes are sparse, for those who hope for high octane skull mashing, this probably won't meet such expectation. Addition of Jennifer Lopez adds some light humorous touches, warranting her appearance more than just an eye candy.Parker (Jason Statham) is a man betrayed by his teammate after completing an almost botched heist, he was shot and left to death. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't die and vows revenge instead. Most of the movie is cat-and-mouse plots as he chases them across countries in not so exciting pace. There are a couple of fights in between, although the amount feels lacking for a movie led by Jason. For these few scenes, they are done quite well. Unbarred bone breaking punches, kicks and other assortments of nearby potential weapon swinging are viscerally entertaining.The rest is a bare heist plot, which really won't hold a candle compare to more cerebral crime action movies. Pacing is undeniably slow, most of the things happening on-screen, even some with both leads appearing, are somewhat lackluster. The movie has about two hours in length and frankly with this long dragging set-up, one might expect some clever scheme building up towards the end, but it is not so. Without spoiling anything, the pace is equally stale from start to finish.Jason Statham bring his usual screen presence, he's a rugged, honor bound thief who keeps his principles religiously. When he threatens or hurts someone, he does so very earnestly, at that regard, he fulfills his role. However, there's little difference from other Statham's movies. Jennifer Lopez as Leslie is actually quite good. For someone who has superstar fame, she acts as poor people convincingly. There are modesty and honesty when she appears as well, making her likable to the audience, aside for her popularly known hind allure.The two leading actors do their parts well, however the script and direction are mediocre. Parker is a bland movie, which has brief excitements across its lengthy run, albeit barely enough for the whole.",Parker
67,valadas,Good performance,6,2 July 2019,That's the best part of this movie. All the actors and actresses do an excellent job with a particular mention of Jason Statham as Parker the main character. The story itself is nor very interesting nor very thrilling. The simple plot of a man who despite being a professional thief has got his ethics and soon enters into conflict with his gang partners after a successful heist. This leads to him being beaten and shot by them who leave him on the field almost dying on a field by a road where a passing by family lifts him up and takes him to hospital from where he runs away soon after being conscious again (we doubt how a so badly wounded man can recover so quickly but there is no explanation for that in the movie). Then the rest of the movie shows his actions to meet the other guys in order to take his revenge. Meanwhile he meets a girl who helps him about his purpose. And that is all.,Parker
68,inspectors71,Way back before . . .,4,29 March 2016,"Mel Gibson's career exploded, he did a remake of the Richard Stark novel about a thief who is double-crossed and rains down vengeance. It was called Payback. Payback was a remake of John Boorman's superb Point Blank (1967) with Lee Marvin. There's another remake out there with Robert Duvall called The Outfit.To paraphrase George C. Scott in Hardcore, ""Turn it off! For the love of God, turn it off!""It was a great story, originally. The Boorman movie was surreal and psychotic, at least until you realized you were watching a ghost story. There were parts of the Duvall flick that were pretty good. Watching Sheree North parade around in that little bathrobe thingy comes to mind. The Gibson flick was good until we got involved with a weird black van filled with ninja hit-people socking and punching in the street.But stop the remakes, alright? I was sort of involved in this absurd actioner (absurdity, defined as watching Jason Statham jumping out of a car at 55 miles per hour, getting shot, and getting better) when up pops Jennifer Lopez, a woman who can act, but apparently chose not to here. When realtor Lopez shows up, the movie crashes, and never recovers.The crimes themselves are big, splashy heists that stretch the viewer's tolerance of absurdity to the limit. Statham sleepwalks through everything he does, except for when he adopts a ridiculous Texas drawl (when he slips, Lopez chirps, ""I just knew you weren't from Texas!"").Michael Chiklis and Nick Nolte are wasted in their parts, and the character list in general is so murky that the viewer has to accept that somebody got peeved when somebody did something to somebody else, and where the Hell did Statham get those guns after he gets fished out of a canal after being shot and stabbed and gored and mutilated and made fun of by his nasty compatriots?Am I, possibly, overthinking here?Yup.Suffice it to say that if the mere thought of shooting and stabbing and goring and mutilating is all you need in a movie, Taylor Hackford's 85th remake of a crime novel written once, Parker, will be all you'll ever need.",Parker
69,SanteeFats,Okay at best,5,23 May 2013,"I watched this with my son when I visited him in Kentucky. At first I thought it was a pretty good movie. As the movie progressed though I began to find problems. I do not think Jason Statham's character could still be physically effective after all the punishment he took, shot several times, knifed, beaten from the road jump and by the hired killer. Emma Booth played his girlfriend but was not all that impressive in this role. I must admit that I was very surprised by Jennifer Lopez in this movie. I think she did a very nice job of acting. Chiaklis was his usual bad ass self. The ammo clip to the neck was a real I don't believe it. The scene in the house when the cop shows up is decent, the dog tracking in the blood and the mom being so cool was nice.",Parker
70,adamscastlevania2,Entertaining but hardly anything brilliant,6,3 October 2014,"(56%) For a movie that didn't go over all too well with both critics and audiences, I kind of like it. Unlike certain action stars Statham is better than he needs to be, while Lopez fits into her role really quite well. This has an older feel to the way it is put together, as its pacing is somewhat steadier, and the plot unfolds not by action set pieces, but the characters themselves. With that said this is a 90 minute movie stretched to near 2 hours, and it does make a meal out of its telling of a very simple story. Overall it is worth a look as a sort of entertaining time passer as the good out weighs the bad, resulting in a decent, and quite bloodily violent action crime flick.",Parker

Everybody wears a black hat all the time. They are all detestable,brutal,scheming, unpleasant people. Even the cop is more interested in sexual predation than law enforcement. A splendid cast of role models for aspiring crooks, punks and goons. The graphic violence surpasses even the worst ""spaghetti western"" and the ""f-word"" is fired again and again and again. Movies are the literature of a modern society. This cinematic excrescence both portrays and contributes to the dangerous and degenerate moral swamp of modern American society.",Parker
72,carbuff,Neither Statham or Lopez has the range to pull this off.,5,10 May 2015,"Jason Statham is type cast for a good reason. He has a limited acting range and unfortunately he tries to stretch it a little too far in this film. I was looking forward to a typical Statham film, and this is not really that bad, but it's messed up some by Statham attempting to reach depths of character that are beyond him. ""A man's got to know his limitations,"" and Statham usually does, but not quite here. Jennifer Lopez is another big letdown. She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Also, jeez, when she whines about the obnoxious behavior of the spoiled mega-rich it's just too much, given that she herself in real life is very well known for being utterly insufferable and bizarrely demanding. (These complaints voiced from her character make it hard to sustain any suspension of disbelief. Maybe her unconvincing down-to-earth act was supposed to be ironic or meta or something?) On the positive side, Statham is his usual indestructible self and the plot is workable, although there are a lot of holes if one stops to really think about it. Even allowing for all of my grouses, there is probably enough ""Statham action"" to satisfy all but his most die- hard fans, so this effort squeaks by with a passing grade. Perversely, if this film had tried to be less, it could have been so much more.",Parker

And Parker does not fail on that account. Else where though, and mainly through slow moments and the god awful acting of Michael Chicklikukalus and his team, Parker falls behind a few steps from being a standout film.Oh yeah, and then there is Jennifer Lopez... doing what any actress could have done, and delivering nothing special.Parker is good though.

I came to the realization that I watch most of his movies because he plays a character type we like, whether we admit it or not, at least those who don't dislike him.If you read the IMDb storyline, you basically get the idea for the thrust of this movie. Jennifer Lopez adds a dimension that was interesting and I still find her hot, but that just might be me. Not all Statham movies though are in the same category; take Killer Elite, the 2011 flick, had a better plot and a damn good cast, so you should have a look at that one if, as I said earlier, you don't dislike Statham.The first half, well maybe the first third of the almost two hour long flick is the best part because it is the most unpredictable, as the rest is.

77,CANpatbuck3664,A Decent Statham Vehicle... Not Much Else Though,6,28 March 2019,"When Parker came out, I was ready to catch any Jason Statham led vehicle in the theatre or on DVD. I saw the trailer for Parker, and I was into it. Jennifer Lopez and Michael Chiklis were interesting casting choices and Nick Nolte had just helped make Warrior one of my favourite movies ever. Add in some fighting and gunplay and an anti-hero with a code and it looked like a drink at the bar specifically mixed for me. I had no knowledge of the previous Parker movies or the character from the graphic novels, so I just was going on the cast and the trailer. There was little else to distinguish it from other characters Jason had played but he very rarely lets me down, so I was prepared for that leap of faith.We're used to seeing Jason Statham doing all manner of dangerous stunts and elaborate action set pieces. The key question about Parker becomes does the movie Parker bring anything new to the table to distinguish it from other Statham features? The answer is sadly no. The fighting is gritty, but it's firmly grounded in reality. The scenes don't disappoint, and I concede that Parker doesn't have to go to the levels of Crank or the Transporter series to provide an entertaining product. I was surprised at how typical and indistinguishable the fight scenes were. To be fair, this is a heist movie as well instead of just an action flick but instead of giving the audience something to talk about with people being stabbed and shot, the movie is content to fill the quota instead of expanding on it. From the action aspect, it reminded me of a not as well shot Jason Bourne where everything is quick and fast, punches are thrown and land, but you don't get the wincing from the audience or the development of Bourne as a character to make you feel that right cross instead.The characterization goes a little deeper than normal (compared to your average action movie) for the character of Parker. We get to know Parker, his code, his friends and his relationships with the women in his life. These are all good things, it counts because the movie doesn't have much else to lean on. The problem is that there is little development for the supporting characters. Leslie's back story is told through exposition and after Hurley and Claire are introduced, they're just dropped. We also don't get much depth into Melander other than he's a no-nonsense type who will do anything to get his way. Giving Parker depth was a good decision, but a better movie would make you invest in the other characters as well even if Parker is still clearly the centre of the flick.Looking at the cinematography and the locations where the movie was shot, it seemed like it was done pretty cheaply but the movie did have a fair-sized budget. After nixing that theory, the conclusion I came to was that I just don't think that there was a lot of extra effort put into it. It's kind of generic for an action movie and a little goofy for a heist movie. It doesn't strain plausibility more than any other studio budgeted film, but it's got a slapped together feel and could have used finer brush strokes. The final heist seemed to come together a little too easy and the scene following was a little anti-climactic. But I also concede with so many action movies coming out, to create something ground breaking can be difficult so there are obstacles to overcome.I get a little tired defending Jason Statham sometimes. He does have some acting chops, the Bank Job, Snatch and even Crank all show that he does have range even if he doesn't often get much of an opportunity to show it. He has a ton of screen presence and an intricate knowledge of how to perform interesting action sequences. But much like the action sequences in Parker, his acting job in Parker falls in the middle of the pack. He shows up to work and goes the motions but whether it's how the character is written or what they decide to shoot, the other facets of Statham's acting don't come across. To be fair though, there is a point where Jason has to do a Texas accent and it's as bad as you expect it to be. Jennifer Lopez tried her best with a character that didn't seem very organic to this plot. Her character motivation changes on a dime and the movie can't decide how proactive she wants to be in helping Parker. She is sexy but I found it weird how the movie played up the romance between her and Parker (it amounts to nothing in the end). Rounding out the important players, this wasn't Michael Chiklis' best work. I found it hard to take him seriously as a threatening villain, I don't know if that's because he shows up as a clown in his first scene, but I didn't think it came across well regardless. It also didn't help that his henchmen were caricatures, it only made the movie rely on him more.There isn't too much more to say about Parker. There is a saying that it's easy to review the best and the worst but hardest to review what falls in the middle. That would sum up my feelings about Parker, it's not all that good but it isn't bad either. There are decent action scenes, okay acting, spotty characterization and mildly diverting plot elements. It all adds up to a 6/10 from me.",Parker

It has a Great Cast and a Pretty Cool Story Line. At the beginning the TOUGH MEN THOUGH OH WE KILLED HIM. Ok Dummies Nope he was Saved bye a really nice Farmington Family. So he goes out for Not so MUCH the MONEY BUT REVINGE. It was pretty Cool the Way he did it. Love the part he is all Bloody again. Sitting at a Chicks and Mom's back Yard. And there Cute little Doge is Sitting on the Big Tough Man's Lap Lol. It was kind of Adorable. Yup all banged up, bloody, and the little dog is cuddling with him Lol. It was just a cute and funny part. The old lady kind of just said. Oh zess what can I get you to eat. And he said Soup. I just Loved this Film it is a Fantastic Film. Not alot of Foul Words. That part was pretty Clean. They didn't use the

79,cinematic_aficionado,Mediocre with some pluses.,6,9 March 2013,"Whilst admittedly I did not have a great deal of expectations, it seemed that my judgement had failed me, or so was the case in the beginning and for much of the start.The acting was good, the sequences well made and the plot delivery surrounding the robbery was very believable unlike what we see in many similar films. This remained the case until the gang had a fallout as they were escaping.In the time following this sequence, the film somehow fell flat and action was reduced to zero. Whereas the storyline never remained idle it ceased to be an action film up until almost the concluding 30 minutes, perhaps even less.The shortness of steam aside, another letdown in this film is the part of Jennifer Lopez. This was more the case than the rather exaggerated survival skills of Jason Statham. How can someone who appears to be so dim witted and yet ends up being crucial to a suave criminal is just laughable, not to mention the bit were her mother started treating a badly bleeding stranger whom she found in her bathroom.A movie that has things going for it, has been ultimately let down by poor execution.",Parker
80,christophe92300,Enjoyable,5,31 August 2013,"Jason Statham is true to himself in this ultra conventional, unsurprising and a bit long movie, that however is surprisingly pleasurable thanks to a certainly very classic and predictable story but that is sufficiently well packaged to entertain the viewer. Of course, the flaws are obvious, from the sometimes muddled cinematography especially during the fight scenes, to the rather uneven rhythm that drops significantly once in Palm Beach, to the under exploited cast or the disappointing final heist, the list is long.

Whether they are pigeonholed in these genres or simply hide their limitations as actors is of no importance, because the movies are watchable.However, Parker seems to be a brainchild of the production team. It is a rather tasteless cocktail of two-thirds of action movie with Jason Statham and one-third romantic comedy with Jennifer Lopez.What sits well on other occasion is driven to excess here and simply not interesting. Jason is invincible, pursues his goals but remains loyal to some kind of moral code. Jennifer is troubled and falls for him, but there is no chemistry among the two on screen.Parker is not worth watching...",Parker

This is a simple action film with explosions, guns and fight scenes which is what you want in a film like this right? The reason why I titled it that is that I feel there was a little more of Statham's character than usual. Yeah sure he's his typical rugged self, but I enjoyed the arc of him being nice and polite to everyone else whilst being this strong fighting type still. Makes it a bit different to an usual Statham film.It's only a 7 because it's average. Plot doesn't scream anything new and it won't blow your socks off.

But sometimes that works out okay, that is what we want, just be on the sofa, soak in mindless action that entertains and passes the time.I would have loved something new from Jason, but maybe it is kind of Jean Claud Van Damme, it becomes the same thing in a bit of different clothing each time.",Parker
84,lagudafuad,This is nonsense,3,5 February 2013,"If you have close to 2 hours to spare try reading a book (not the book this movie is based on), or taking a nap because Taylor Hackford owes me my time and money back for making me think this was a movie worth watching. What I can advise any intending watcher is to Google the spoiler, watch an extended preview of the movie then move on with your life, because there is nothing to see here.The movie drags, it is sloppy and it is amazing that pointless situations and acts that feature in this movie could drag for such a lengthy period. I think some directors and studios have a wish list of doing a movie with Jason Statham, because that will explain all the action anti-hero movie he has been doing that aren't worth your time. The only good thing in the movie and I'm surprised to be saying this is Jennifer Lopez, she was the only thing that made sense and her acting and comedy addition to this flick was impressive.Taylor Hackford (Ray (2004) and The Devil's Advocate (1997)) directing skills is not in question in this flick, it is the story and the plot that takes you by storm on how dumb and boring it is for an action film. The movie plot is about a man named Parker (Jason Statham), I'm pretty sure you would have guessed that. Parker is a professional thief with morals as he doesn't steal from the poor or hurt the innocent. He was sent on a five-man job that was successful, the leader of the five-man crew asked Parker to go further with another plan that will earn them millions. Parker's refusal to go ahead with their plan led to him being shot and left for dead at a lake. But Parker survived (miraculously) and started to plan his revenge.During his tracking down of the men that betrayed him, he came across Leslie Rogers (Jennifer Lopez) and she somehow got involved in his plan for revenge.The movie is based on a book called Flashfire, and most definitely I may not be reading this book in the near future. Whacky as it is, Parker makes you wish you can rewind time and undo watching the movie because even at the end of the movie, you are unhappy that the hero survived.My conclusion is there is a better way to waste your time, other than watching this movie.",Parker
85,stevenrotherforth,A film that's about as good as Statham's Texas accent!,3,15 August 2018,"ParkerWhat starts out to be yet another bland but entertaining Statham actioner, soon descends into a real borefest.
Jason Statham is one of those actors that you could watch attempting to make paint dry.
However in Parker not even Statham's abundance of charisma can keep this movie about a left for dead thief out to get revenge seem interesting.Sharing top billing is Jennifer Lopez who adds nothing to this tedious movie other than flashing a little flesh.
In fact it's probably where her character is introduced that's where the film begins to descend.
In all fairness this is nothing to do with her performance yet the films slow pace.
With a runtime of 1 hr 58 mins I forget just when Miss Lopez actually makes her first appearance. It was well into the movie and by then I had lost all investment in proceedings.Not even the action has any memorable scenes. Odd for such a action legend like Mr Statham.
His fight scene with Martial arts movie veteran Daniel Bernhardt is lame and not to both actors usual standards.
Couple this with Parker's seeming invincibility and the movie can't even be considered to be mildly believable.
The guy gets dumped from a fast moving vehicle, shot multiple times,
stabbed in the chest and hand, punched, kicked, thrown around like a rag doll and he doesn't so much as faint from copious amounts of blood loss.
Eventually I just gave up on this movie and turned it off.
I consider myself to be a Jason Statham fan but my interest just bled out.With a strong support including Nick Nolte, Clifton Collins Jr, Michael Chiklis and Glitch's Emma Booth you'd think something special could have developed here.
Unfortunately this one won't stay in the memory banks for twenty four hours.
In fact the only thing that may haunt me from this movie is Statham's hilarious Texas accent!",Parker
86,LloydBayer,Parker suffers from a disappointing script and a tapered ending that not even Oscar-winning director Taylor Hackford can fix.,4,30 May 2014,"Back in 1999, Mel Gibson played the leading role in a film called Payback — a noir crime thriller about a criminal who exacts revenge on the people who double-crossed him. Based on Donald E. Westlake's crime novels The Hunter and Flashfire, Gibson's anti-hero returns to the big screen, this time closer to home but retrofitted by a new actor. Played by Jason Statham, the titular Parker is basically the same character as Gibson's Porter; however, the plot similarities in Payback and Parker are offset by notable levels of disparity in adapting the same character for two different films. Years from now only one of these films will remain in memory.As a generic assumption I'm willing to wager that not every Jason Statham fan out there is also a fan of Westlake's books; especially the twenty-four novels he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark. As a crime novelist, Westlake can be credited with conceiving the anti-hero in literary fiction — a badass who eventually charms the reader (in this case the viewer) into cheering for him despite his ruthless modus operandi. And so we have Parker, a professional and meticulous criminal with a code of honour: he doesn't steal from those who can't afford it and he doesn't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it. While that code sounds like the one practiced by the legendry Robin Hood, Parker is known for getting the job done as long as his crew remains loyal and sticks to the plan. After a near fatal mission arising from a crewmember's negligence, Parker decides to quit the gang for said reasons. Consequently, ring leader Melander (Michael Chiklis) shoots and leaves him for dead. Obviously, Parker survives, now hell-bent on revenge, finds his former gang in the playground of the rich and famous: Palm Beach, Florida. Sporting a Texan accent on the pretext of buying a lavish house, Parker meets Leslie (Jennifer Lopez), a realtor behind on her bills. Together they discover Melander's next big heist but not before painfully learning the latter's connection to Chicago's equally ruthless underworld.What follows is a classic case of the hunter becoming the hunted. The problem arises when we realise that Parker and Melander switch positions ever so often. Even if you accept this goose chase as a plot twister, you still have to deal with the film's two-toned mediocrity. Having previously penned the Academy Award winning Black Swan, John J. McLaughlin's disappointing script is a vehicle with just two gears: fast and neutral. If action is what you want, you won't be disappointed with well-executed heists and bloody fight sequences wherein characters use improvised weaponry, everything from guns and knives to shower curtains and toilet seats! For Statham, it's business as usual when considering the fact that almost every leading role he has played to date is an ""anti-hero"". On the other hand, scenes with Lopez stagnates the pace and tone with awkward moments of flat humour. This of course will not prevent swarms of male viewers from happily paying the price of admission to have a glimpse at J.Lo's posterior and marvel no longer at why it is her most prized ass-et.For a film that starts off well, Parker suffers from the above problems and a tapered ending that not even Academy Award winning director Taylor Hackford (Ray) can fix. Bullets fly and blood is spilt, but Jason Statham's Parker cannot match up to Mel Gibson's Porter and neither can Hackford hold a candle to Brian Helgeland's Payback.",Parker
87,Magow-Intermean,Parker Review,9,30 March 2019,"Shot and left for dead after a daring heist, Parker (Statham) tracks his fellow thieves to Florida's wealthy Palm Beach, where he assumes a disguise and plots to steal the haul from their latest robbery with the help of a local estate agent (Lopez).
Jason Statham is a reliably unreliable action star, shooting three misfires (Death Race, Killer Elite) for every bullseye (Snatch, Safe). Having succeeded Charles Bronson in a recent remake of The Mechanic, Statham now takes on the role of Richard Stark's (aka blacklisted writer Donald E. Westlake) eponymous master thief, previously played by Lee Marvin (Point Blank), Robert Duvall (The Outfit) and, most recently, Mel Gibson (Payback). This 21st-century take on the character, overseen by journeyman director Taylor Hackford (aka Mr. Helen Mirren), fits Statham like a jewel thief's glove; after seeing him in action, it's almost impossible to read a Parker novel without hearing The Stath's inimitable Cockney rasp. Characterised more by actions than words, Parker's hardness is established by the fact that even his girlfriend calls him by his surname - and that, at one point, he pushes his hand onto a knife to stop it being stuck in his eye.The film opens with a daring daylight robbery at the Ohio State Fair, followed by a cheeky reprise of the plot of The Hunter (the basis for Point Blank/Payback), with Parker double-crossed and left for dead (again). From here, the script largely follows the plotting of the source text (the 19th Parker novel, published in 2000), fleshing out the supporting characters, notably Jennifer Lopez's loopy estate agent. With her arrival, 30 minutes in, Parker takes a surprise left turn into caper territory - although the film's violent tendencies (it will go down a storm with the NRA) flare up periodically to remind us we're not watching The Thomas Crown Affair. Lopez, who hasn't made a good movie since Out Of Sight, is an inspired foil for Statham, her character's klutzy nature nicely juxtaposed with Parker's cool reticence, and it's rare to find a fully fleshed-out female character in an action thriller. Hackford's reach may exceed his grasp, but this is a skilful execution of a minor Parker novel.Fifty years after he first appeared, Donald E. Westlake's antihero may have found his perfect avatar. Like Parker's robberies, it isn't entirely successful, but Statham and Lopez make enticingly mismatched partners in crime.",Parker

No crime action flick needs to top an hour and forty minutes. This one had loooooong stretches of nothing going on. And I don't mean just ""not action."" I mean, there were sequences full of cars pulling into driveways, people prepping for future events in uninteresting ways, repetitive dialog--just wasted storytelling time, etc. Stuff that should've been left on the cutting room floor. Did Hackford not use an editor?Also, why did they waste Jennifer Lopez in the female lead? The way they used her, that part could've been played by any competent Hollywood actress who was good looking and the right age. Lopez was natural in the part, and very good looking, of course. But she was given practically nothing to do. Come on! If you're going to cast J Lo, make her character interesting. And bring her in earlier! And while you're at it give her some personality other than being attractive. They should have either hired a lesser actress and made the part much smaller, or written a decent part for Lopez and beefed her part up. As it is, I kept asking myself-- why is Jennifer Lopez in this at all? Bad screenplay and weak editing.",Parker
90,adi_2002,Steal from the thieves who took your money,6,14 September 2013,"A professional thief Parker who has a few rules such as not to steal from the poor people and not to make any victim. One day he goes out a plan with his teammates but is betrayed by them after he isn't agree to give his part of the money for an even bigger heist. He is shot and left at the side of the road but it has good fortune and some farmers see him and takes him to the hospital to be able to receive care. After he recovers, leaves the hospital and wants to make those who stole his money to regret and from the brother of one of them finds that the gang is in Palm Beach and preparing to give the great robbery. Got here he claims to be a rich man from Texas in search of a house and so knows Leslie a realtor that will form an alliance and Parker needs her help because it knows well the city is attractive, beautiful and smart. He manages to get revenge and rewards those who helped him when he needed.The film has everything it needs to please the viewer who likes this genre and that has a chance to see Jason Statham dressed in priest and with gray hair. J Lo is doing good job although at the end of the film I do not understand with what she wanted her to help Parker by going on the house where were all the thieves with handguns and she a female alone and unarmed. We are already familiar with Jason Statham as the one that beat all bad guys till the last whatever it's going to pass and this film though is almost two hours long manages to not be boring and the story is well outlined.",Parker
91,squirrel_burst,"It has it's moments, but not very memorable",5,12 October 2014,"""Parker"" has its moments and overall it's OK, but no one here is breaking new ground. The film follows Jason Statham as Parker. He's a thief with a code. He never steals from anyone that can't afford it, never hurts anyone that doesn't deserve it and always keeps his promises. He's brought in with 4 other guys to do a big job at a carnival where they steal thousands of dollars. That's where the trouble begins. The guys need the money to put together an even bigger job but when Parker wants out, they leave him for dead. Parker pulls himself back together and starts working his way up the chain so he can track down the ones who wronged him. Now Parker wants to get the money that was owed to him and get revenge for the betrayal. Along the way he meets up with Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) a down-on-her luck real estate agent who figures out what Parker is up to and forces her way into the scheme.There are quite a few fun moments throughout the movie. Parker is an anti-hero that's fun to follow due to his rigid code and later on when we meet Leslie, her character is an underdog that you cheer for as well. The villains are menacing, if only because you know how ruthless they are and they outnumber our protagonists two-to-one. The heist elements of the film are also interesting, with several capers throughout and, like all good heists feature multiple, complex steps for them to be pulled off. Sometimes it's just Parker getting the best of a couple of security guards, sometimes it's an elaborate display of smoke and mirrors to get millions of dollars worth of jewels so there's a nice variety too. There are some snappy bits of dialogue (Leslie asks Parker how he sleeps at night, knowing what he does. He replies ""I don't drink coffee after 7:00"" that's some good stuff) and overall it's an entertaining movie. It's just missing that little something to make it a great movie. Leslie's mother for example is a one-joke character that at times acts really illogically for a woman who spends most of her time watching soap operas, taking care of her dog and going out with her girl friends. At one point she finds Parker, all beaten and bloody in her house and she really under-reacts to seeing this stranger. It's that kind of little flaw that doesn't quite bring down the movie in itself, it just feels a little disappointing when placed right next to the really solid stuff. This is particularly noticeable in the fact that there really isn't very much that's memorable about the film, particularly when you consider that we've seen this character in movies before, notably as played by Mel Gibson in ""Payback"". In retrospect, I don't know what they were thinking with Jennifer Lopez's character here either. She belongs in a totally different movie.I'm finding it hard to write a lot about the film and I feel like this gives the impression that the movie is either bad or really awesome but flawed. It really isn't either. At times it might be unrealistic and there are a couple of events that are awfully convenient for the plot but it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, just not a terribly memorable one. That's perfectly OK though because if you're a fan of Jason Statham you'll enjoy watching him do his thing and if you're just in the mood to kill an 118 minutes, this is a pretty solid way to spend your time. It's the kind of movie you rent or go to the movie theatre and enjoy, you recommend to your friends but you won't rush to the store and buy or be in a hurry to watch again. Still, it's worth seeing if only to see Parker get back at the people who wronged him. When the movie works, it really works and satisfied. (On DVD, July 2013)",Parker

93,martinrobertson300482,"Same old, same old",4,20 March 2013,"I'm long destined to be dragged too every Jason Statham movie, now that my usual collection off cinema going friends are big fans off his. The Big man has had his moments it has to be said (Snatch, The Bank job) but for every good movie this tough, hard working British actor makes, there are a couple off average same old,same old action movies, and with a tagline like ""payback has a new name"" you'd be right in thinking that ""Parker"" is one off those.Statham plays a tough guy ""Robin Hood"" style robber, screwed over by his partners in crime, and heading out on a vendetta too get his usual tough guy revenge. Now, if the film had simply focused on this, then it could off been better (albeit, slightly). But the second half off the movie throws in Jennifer Lopez, as a random estate agent, who randomly decides shes bored with life, and throws herself pointlessly into Stathams plot. Then she does nothing much but do silly things, complain, and (in one scene) show off that famous award winning ass off hers.So, ""Parker"" will no doubt bore a lot off people in different ways. Those wanting an interesting story, will probably be fed up with Stathams slow seeking revenge, and those going too see it for Jennifer Lopez, will find that her being in the movie serves merely too kill time, and drag it out long enough to be a feature length revenge story. On top off that, flick is ridiculously over the top. With Statham managing too keep going in typical action movie form. Even when he throws himself out off cars, gets a knife through his hand, and breaks 4 off his ribs, with one character assuring us ""Oh, he'll be fine, this is what he does, he's had worse"" hahaha.On the upside though, there are some decent action scenes, and a sprinkling off good one liners, for those in search off such things. Fans off Statham as an all out action star will probably be best pleased, but anyone else should probably stay clear.",Parker
94,ghost_dog86,The Ballad of J Lo's Butt,4,6 February 2013,"And the verdict is: Michael Chiklis still hasn't given a performance worth watching since he starred in ""The Shield"". Directed by Taylor Hackford, who actually directed ""Ray"" (oh, how the mighty have fallen) and starring Jason Statham as the same character he plays in every movie, and Jennifer Lopez playing a sort of love interest character, who reeks of desperation (art imitating life perhaps?) ""Parker"" is neither a bad nor a good action film, but more so a forgettable one.OK, so I won't bother with a synopsis here, or a critique of this pretty flimsy storyline, or discuss how Statham and Lopez have absolutely no chemistry, or even touch on Statham's horrid Texas accent, because in all actuality, nobody reading this cares; when a majority of audiences (men primarily) probably paid top box office prices for the sole purpose of catching the shot of Lopez's butt, which had been teased in the trailer. In fact, in the theater where I saw ""Parker"", soon after the scene in question (which occurs about an hour in) and this is no joke, there was a mass exodus consisting of male audience members, who undoubtedly saw what they came to see and were satisfied enough to go home without any interest in watching Statham do one of his Statham-esque, shoot everybody in the room more times than necessary, endings. So let's talk about that for a second: the rather gratuitous butt scene only lasts for all of a second, in a long shot no less (meaning, from pretty far away). So while you do see her butt in some polka dot underwear, the consensus has to be that if you were one of those who paid 10+ dollars to see this scene in particular, you may come out of ""Parker"" feeling more than a little cheatedand probably ashamed.Final Thought: If this is the type of movie that Jennifer Lopez is reduced to starring in, then it is no surprise that when recently confronted by Latin periodicals as to her level of interest in playing Jenni Rivera in the sure to be forthcoming biopic, her answer was resoundingly positive. I'm sorry to break this to all of the J Lo fans out there, but the simple truth is, at this juncture of her life, it would seem that she simply can't afford to turn down ANY ROLE presented to her.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

95,gabriel_sanchez,A bit more serious action movie with Statham. Good watch.,8,8 February 2021,"Jason Statham is well known in the action genre. His movies are often full of crazy stunts and a lot of fighting. This is not one of those.Parker is a burglar with moral conduct. After being double-crossed by his partners in a seemingly easy safe-breaking, Parker wants to take matters with his own hands, especially since now he being targeted by a dangerous mob boss.It would seem like this is the recipe for an action movie with a lot of testosterone and non-sense stunts, and you would be right. However, Parker (2013) left most of that out of the plot and focused on trying to be serious.Trying to be serious needs to be taken into consideration. Trying is the best word here. Even though it takes itself seriously, there is some humor going on when we are following the steps of the main targets. Sometimes, I think they are just loonies for no reason, like a bunch of young men full of liquor at a huge college party.The action scenes are as realistic as they can be. I can't even call them fighting scenes. There is gore and they end up in a bad shape after a serious beating. Then again, they are fine the next day, at least fine enough to continue their quest. Parker would definitely need more than a couple of days to recover from his injuries after his partners betrayed him.Parker is what you would expect from Statham. He is always serious. And he has this whole moral speech going on too. It only happens a couple of times throughout the movie, but it sets the tone just right for who Parker is.The plot is straightforward. There is no real plot twist that happens or anything. You just watch Parker on his revenge quest.The ending is enjoyable. Not much to it.Overall, OK action movie.

But there was too much graphic violence and it was too unrealistic that Parker could still be walking around fighting after all his injuries.

Westlake. As if Statham wasn't enough to bring this cool character to life, he's bringing an interesting cast along with him including Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Clifton Collins Jr., Wendell Pierce, Bobby Cannavale and Nick Nolte, but is enough to make the film work?Parker follows a a thief who lives by the code that you do not steal from those who can't afford it or hurt people who don't deserve it, but clearly his crew doesn't share the same code and steals his stash and leave him for dead. Parker returns taking an unlikely partner and devising a plan to hijack the score of his old crew, take them down, and get away clean. Payback was such an awesome movie with Gibson delivering a great performance really making you root for a bad guy. Here Statham adds a bit more likability to the character and he just doesn't deliver the same effect. While this was a bit of a disappointment, Statham is also the only reason this movie works for all because for the most part he is running around through crap. Jennifer Lopez is not only horrible in the film, her character really offers little to the story. The usually fun to watch Chiklis, Collins, and Pierce failed to offer much more. They did OK with what action they had, which isn't much, but their dialogue felt forced and unnatural throughout. The story was simple enough but had numerous useless moments that caused it to drag a bit. There is an entire sub-plot that seems to be leading somewhere and then is suddenly dropped and forgotten. What little action there is here works well enough thanks to Statham's ability to deliver, but it's just not enough to save the overall product.While Statham is usually a sure bet for a fun action film Parker is just a far cry from his previous entries. You may not get the full on action you might hope for, he still delivers in the way that makes him so cool to make this way better than it deserved to be. If you're a fan of Westlake's character then it's not a complete waste of time but you would probably be better to go back to watch Payback instead.",Parker

It's about a thief betrayed by his crew working with a woman on the inside to take his ex-crew's next score.The Plot: Heist/revenge stories are hardly original yarns and this one is no different. It's been spun time and again, but Hackford's pulpy lead character manages to keep eyes on the screen for most of the runtime, occasionally losing control of the details in the latter half. Parker's (Statham) leading a heist of the Ohio state fair with Melander (Chiklis), Hardwicke (Hauptman), Carlson (Pierce), and Ross (Collins Jr.) that mostly goes to plan, but when the rest of the crew demands his money in preparation for another job; Parker wants no part of it. Shot for his denial, he's picked up and recovers, now leaning on mastermind Hurley (Nolte) who somehow doesn't know what went down; Parker's out for blood, money, and to save his girlfriend Claire (Booth) by putting her in needless danger. There's plenty of holes to poke in the plan, especially once Parker partners up with Leslie (Lopez), but the movie moves fast enough to avert attention from them. It's good escapist fun.The Characters: Again, all of these things, these characters, they've been done innumerable times before; but the script by McLaughlin does a solid job at giving the movie a handful of memorable ones alongside an upper-tier Statham protagonist. Parker himself is the most vivid of the bunch even though the movie doesn't dive into him. He's by no means a flawless man, but he does have some sense of right and wrong, he distastes killing even if he has no reservations about thievery or maiming (as is well-depicted in the opening heist). And there are people he likes, even if he puts them in danger. Leslie is refreshing in that she may be in the presence of a good-looking and well-trained guy, but eschews a would-be romance subplot by just being in it for the money. She's occasionally annoying but much less than expected. The baddies are solid fodder too, with greed at their centers, but it's different since they want to do something aside from robbing and running. They all do just enough to set themselves apart.The Action: Hackford stages a few fun action sequences throughout the course of the movie. From the opening credits there's a unique sense of place, using a state fair, in the midwest no less, is a rarity in movies; and an added touch of neo-noir (in the first act anyway) only raises the bar for later. Fisticuffs and gunfights are much punchier here than in other post-Taken, pre-Wick action romps too (excluding series like the Expendables). Statham gets plenty of time to show why he's in demand, and the baddies (even the nameless one played by Daniel Bernhardt) put up some good resistance. Some of that brutality gets lost in choppy edits, probably hiding people that aren't Statham; or just in an attempt to manufacture more of a rush. Still, while a lot of what's being shown is reminiscent of other movies, the stuff that's original is enjoyable.The Technics: More than just kinetic fluidity was lost in editing, with the location whipping around like a lion tamer and the script insisting on playing the ""last name game"" throughout the runtime. Melander adopts a fake identity that's only explained when Parker infiltrates the place the crew are hiding out in, the location changes from Ohio to Kentucky to Texas to Florida in 20 minutes, give or take; and despite a few run-ins with Claire, she never feels like anything more than a tacked-on trait of Parker's. With all the bouncing around, there's plenty of scope to show for it. And while most scenes are high in adrenaline, it's still easy to appreciate the sights on display, from the set design to the locations, to Lopez's cleavage. While the editing does a number on the cohesion of the story and the action, the cinematography itself never suffers.Statham and the whole cast (possibly barring Lopez) slip into their roles with ease while the momentum hardly lets up, making Parker a fun sit even if the details get hazy and the logic goes limp thanks to a woeful edit. Parker may not be the freshest of action films, but it hits the right spot.70/100.",Parker
100,deacon_blues-3,"For me, Stratham is the perfect Parker!",8,27 January 2014,"If you're a Richard Stark (a.k.a. Donald E. Westlake) fan, Jason Stratham is the perfect Parker.There have been some very nice films based on Parker novels, but none had captured the actual character of the lead role before now. Parker is the ultimate no-nonsense, cold, calculating professional thief. He makes no small talk, does not understand sentimentality, yet has a rather firm sense of justice and fair play, and he's willing to put himself on the line to enforce it too! I enjoyed this version of a ""Flashfire"" by Stark, and I'm very glad that sequels are in the works. Westlake stipulated that no film adaptation of his writings could use the actual name ""Parker"" for the main character unless they agreed to also produce sequels to the first film, so that means that more perfect Parker is in the cards for the future of all us Westlake fans!As Parker would say, Good!",Parker
101,jaxbubba,It's your typical Jason Statham film,5,5 February 2013,"'Parker' is everything that you have come to expect in a Jason Statham film. A badass central character with vengeance on his mind, after being wronged and left for dead in the film's opening sequence. This is not Shakespeare here, you know exactly what you are getting from the moment that you purchased you ticket. A totally predictable film, that leaves very little for the mind to decipher. However, I happen to be an avid fan of Jason Statham, and though I have some serious casting and character choices that writer John J. McLaughlin (Hitchcock / Coma / Black Swan) had decided to add to this film as a whole the film does seem to entertain and amuse on a very moderate level.Parker (Statham) is a thief. He lives by two rules: (1) only steal from people who can afford it, and (2) no one (innocent bystanders) gets kills or injured during one of his capers. As the film openings, Parker is part of a five-man crew with intentions to knock off a local fairground. However, after successfully executing the heist, an altercation ensues after plans for a second endeavor does not sit well with Parker. Shot and left for dead, Parker's new mission in life is retribution!!The film introduces Jennifer Lopez (Leslie Rodgers) as a possible love interest for the Parker character, which makes absolutely no sense to the film's plot because Parker is happily involved with Claire (Emma Booth), the love of his life. Leslie (Lopez) is a down on her luck real estate agent, forced to live with her mother, Ascension (played wonderfully by Patti LuPone). Lupone steals every scene that she is in. Leslie is at the end of her means, willing to do anything in order to change her current life's path. When her flirtations toward Parker do not get her desired reactions, she decides to delve into the pseudo-background established by our reprisal seeking protagonist. The Leslie character is just fluff and filler to this whole escapade. Someone pleasing to the audience's eye who can get into dubious situations in which the Parker character can come to the rescue for. The film would have been 1000% better without the Jennifer Lopez character.Not one of Jason Statham's better pictures; however, it does tick all the right boxes for an action adventure. If you are a fan of the genre and/or actor, I am sure that this film will satisfy you cravings for the action medium. This is without a doubt, a totally predictably, rock 'em sock 'em, shoot 'em up flick; and Parker is unquestionably one bad mother trucker However, I would highly recommend waiting to see it on DVD.See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel""",Parker
102,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: PARKER (2013),4,28 January 2013,"Terribly clunky and painfully routine, Taylor Hackford's big screen adaptation of the late novelist's Donald E. Westlake's PARKER (who died in 2008) is nothing more than your typical, undemanding Jason Statham-centric crime thriller.The movie opens quite promisingly with Parker (Jason Statham), who is put in charge by veteran thief Hurley (Nick Nolte) to lead a crew of four: Melander (Michael Chiklis), Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.), Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman), and Carlson (Wendell Pierce) -- for a big heist at the Ohio State Fair. The heist is successful, and they manage to get away with more than $1 million in cash. However, things get out of hand when Parker respectfully refuses Melander's offer to invest their take in an upcoming diamond heist that would net them a bigger payday. A violent shootout ensues, and Parker ends up being shot and left for dead. Fortunately, Parker is lucky enough to be alive after he is rescued by two kind strangers. After Parker is slowly recovered from his bullet wounds, he's determined for payback time against Melander and his gang. With the help of Hurley and Hurley's daughter Claire (Emma Booth), Parker subsequently discovers that the gang's next heist will take place in West Palm Beach, Florida.In order to carry out his revenge plan smoothly, he travels there and disguise as a wealthy Texan seeking to purchase a new home. There, he gets to know a struggling real-estate agent named Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez), who gradually learns the truth behind Parker's motivation and demands to get a fair cut from him as well.On the surface, putting a respectable Hollywood veteran like Taylor Hackford and BLACK SWAN screenwriter John J. McLaughlin on a task to adapt one of Westlake's most famous characters, one might easily assume that PARKER is going to be a great hard-boiled crime thriller. Unfortunately it's a big surprise that the movie turns out to be a ho-hum experience. McLaughlin's adapted screenplay is bloated with too many excess baggage, particularly in the long-winded middle section involving Jennifer Lopez's character. Problem is, the casting of Jennifer Lopez is the main reason why the movie drags a lot. It's also pity to see Lopez nowadays isn't a worthwhile actress she used to be, as she comes across more of a window-dressing part than a necessary character (how else would you explain that she is mostly showcased as a sex object where the camera simply loves to focus on her butt than her acting talent?). Another problem is Hackford's uneven direction. After a promising start, he quickly loses steam midway with his erratic pacing and barely recovers ever since. It's also a shame that most of the supposedly first-rate cast (notably Nick Nolte and Michael Chiklis) are neglected to strict caricatures.Despite most of its glaring flaws, PARKER remains a fairly decent time-waster. Jason Statham is suitably cast as a no-nonsense criminal vows to seek vengeance. While his character as Parker is more of the same cool-mannered role we used to see him from other movies, he's always entertaining enough to watch for especially when comes to action sequence. Speaking of action, this is where the movie often comes alive (even though they are not barely enough to justify this as a satisfying whole). Earlier in the movie, an ugly shootout inside the moving fan is truly an exhilarating set-piece. Some of the brutally realistic fight scenes are well-choreographed as well, even though there are times the editing tends to get too frenetic until it's hard to distinguish what is really going on.",Parker

Jason Statham does fine, Jennifer Lopez is decent, nobody is acting terribly but we aren't getting any Oscar worthy performances either.

105,cattjones,Parker is Predictable,3,26 January 2013,"The main reason that I wanted to see this film is because of Jason Statham. I really didn't expect any mind-blowing twists or extravagant plot; and that is exactly what I got. The film centers on a gang of robbers that knock off the state fair of Ohio and then ditch Parker for his share of the loot and pretty much leaves him for dead. That is really when the story starts to get mildly interesting. Melandes (Michael Chiklis) is conveyed as the leader of the foursome and is ruthless in his pursuit of greater endeavors. This film is very predictable and the addition of Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) who weaves herself into the situation as a down and out real estate agent, doesn't really add any value to the film. She seemed to me to be really flat and somewhat of a busy body. In my opinion, she was just in the way. Also I am not sure why Jake (Bobby Cannavale), the local cop on the beat, was even in the film. He spent all of his time lusting after Leslie and that was about it. They could have left him out all together. Although Parker is one of the bad guys, he is a crook with a big heart and apparently has a strict set of criminal ethics where it's not always about the money; it's the principle. So this film is really about one bad guy going after worse guys and you really want the worse guys to get what is coming to them. It has the same theme as all of those Ocean movies with George Clooney. The one thing that I was impressed with in this film is how beautiful West Palm Beach, Florida is. I have got to get down there for a vacation one day. To sum it all up this film was kind of like reading the book and then seeing the film; you know exactly what is going to happen and now you get to watch it play out. The fight scenes were well choreographed and Jason did a good job in the role, but other than that I am not sure if this was worth the price of a ticket. I would have probably waited until it came to a movie channel. But if you are bored and looking for something to do, then I say go see it. I am giving this film a dimly lit amber light.",Parker

He has a great wit to go with his usually decent fight scenes.
This one stands out as one of his better movies it's smaller scale and he acts more like a human that a one liners and power kick machine a bit like he does in expendables but what this one has above all the others is it's actually pretty clever and well made with decent shot fight scenes that's my main problem with most statham flicks the fights are there but they are either poorly shot, edited or just no one really cared enough to make them entertaining when he fights the Rock or Vin Diesel in fast 7 it's really well put together and you feel the weight of it.
This is turning more into a Jason statham review so I'll end by saying watch Parker it's more than your average mediocre statham films it's definitely on par with death race, its not exactly as cool or clever as snatch though.",Parker

Going into this one I was somewhat apprehensive as Jason Statham movies miss more than they hit, and when you throw Jennifer Lopez in, I was really quite leery and afraid this one was going to be stupid and a typical Statham slam-fest....WRONG!! I've got to give it to both Lopez and Statham for pulling off not only a entertaining movie, but for also doing really quit a good job of selling their respective roles. The storyline has been done before, but there are enough twists and turns in this movie to keep it fresh and not totally predictable.

I got a kick out of him doing the cowboy drawl since most of his flicks don't have him doing that kind of thing. It has some interesting turns in it and the guys find out that he's stalking them and it comes down to the wire. If you like Statham, you'll like this flick..",Parker
112,rtp4242,Movie Review: Parker (2013) Park this one in the trash can.,1,15 September 2013,"Parker (Jason Statham) is a thief with some ethics, he won't hurt anyone while conducting his robberies. He plans a robbery worth one million dollars with four other crooks at the Ohio State Fair. One of the crooks, August Hardwick (Micah A Hauptman) is supposed to set a fire at the fair as a distraction, he sets it too close to the fair-goers, and that makes Parker angry. The others ask Parker if he wants to come in on a jewel robbery worth two million, he says no, a fight ensues, and Hardwick shoots Parker and leaves him for dead on the road. Parker doesn't die, and as soon as August finds out he's alive, he sends out Danziger (Kip Gilman) to kill Claire (Emma Booth) Parker's girlfriend. Claire escapes. Parker gets out of the hospital and gets a new id as a Texas oil millionaire, and tracks Hardwick's gang to Florida. In Florida, Parker meets real estate agent, Leslie Rogers, (Jennifer Lopez) who thinks she's landed a rich client. He tracks Hardwick's gang to the house where the jewelry heist is about to take place. Parker finds out that Leslie is facing financial problems, and agrees to steal the jewels from Hardwick's gang, and split the profits with Leslie, but before that happens, Leslie gets trapped in the house with Hardwick's gang. Does Parker rescue Leslie? Does Parker kill the members of his former gang? Or does the assassin sent to Parker kill Parker?The answers to the questions above are fairly obvious, and that's one of the many problems with Parker, from the first frame of this film, everyone knows what is going to happen. Another problem with this movie is that it's too complicated, there's the main plot with Parker and his gang, the assassin chasing his girl, Parker's new identity and move to Florida, the real estate agent down on her luck. An action movie is supposed to be short and simple, this one is two hours long, and has far too many characters. And Parker is a robber, as much as the writers try to make Parker Robin Hood, it I really hard to feel sympathy for somebody who steals from others. This movie is also far too violent, it's not cartoonish violence or something that can be excused, it's just pointless senseless, bloody by the bucket violence and it's inexcusable.The acting adds to the misery. Statham gives a dull, dry humorless performance, and the key to a good Statham movie like Crank, or even the Crank sequel is humor. Statham can be funny when he has the right script, but he's too busy bloodying people and getting bloodied to crack jokes. And who's idea was it to give Statham a Texas accent? He went through half the movie with a bad Southern accent, layered onto a British accent, which is like layering an ice cream sundae with onions and garlic. JLo just acts annoyed in a bid to cover up her bad acting, I know she's supposed to be in the middle a comeback after her stint on American Idol and releasing a new album but this performance ought to stop the comeback in its tracks. Lopez looks good, but she always has. The direction is slow, the movie is way too long, and the writing is full of plot holes, and amateurish. Skip this movie, you're not missing much. It's rated R for prodigious amounts of bloody violence and nudity. Kids should not watch this movie for any reason.

The Novels would make an amazing movie if the producers did not ""transport"" Parker in the future. Parker is a character taken straight out of Sin City. He reminds me of a tank that crashes everyone on his path. He does not have a girlfriend as far as I know, and no one cares about his love life.Overall, the movie is not bad at all.

As he goes through this far-fetched and forgettable story, he meets Jennifer Lopez, a woman who is a desperate female willing to do anything - and I mean anything - to land a few hundred dollars to make her car payments.Not very good butt kicking. Lots of incredibly stupid dialog. The only thing that would have been worthwhile would have been to make this into a threesome and a more restricted rating.

116,jefflouvre-435-77367,JLo must wish she's acting with Clooney rather than static Statham,4,25 January 2013,"THERE is a trend in violent films that makes it excusable for the protagonist to go on a killing spree, regardless of the damage that he inflicts on people and property. For example, vigilantes are given permission to exact revenge to fulfil their desire for blood, while criminals can cause wanton damage because they strive to keep the body-count low.This trend continues in producer-director Taylor Hackford's Parker, about a robber who is cheated of his share of the loot by his crew, and is left for dead. It's a miracle that he survives the attempt on his life, and it's a surprise that he can still walk after the innumerable shootings, stabbings and knocks he receives.He then plots to get back what belongs to him because ""it's the principle"". Nothing can stop him from his determination to regain his money. If the number of bodies rises, so be it.Viewers go to see a Jason Statham film not because of its intellectual superiority, but because of his superior reflexes when it comes to dealing with villains. Statham's preferred method of settling problems is to either whip out his gun or to whip the enemy to death.He plays the titular character, Parker, with his trademark blank look and gruff voice. Parker's crew is robbing the cashier's department at the Ohio State Fair, and during the heist, a guard has difficulty breathing. Parker asks the guard to calm down and asks the latter to think of his girlfriend.The film cuts to a scene of Parker in an intimate moment with his own girlfriend. This is supposed to assure viewers that Parker is a robber with a big heart.The crew has an altercation with Parker, but he recovers from his near-death experience, has time to commit another robbery on his own to obtain money and then tracks down the crew, which is preparing to commit a heist in Palm Beach, Florida.The film's sole moment of wit takes place when a killer is sent to dispose of Parker's girlfriend, Claire (Emma Booth). He trespasses on the property, with a knife in hand, but Claire, who hears him entering the house, hides away, also with a knife in hand.She runs out of the house but has the temerity and calmness of mind to slash the tyres of the killer's SUV, parked in front of the house, before making her escape.So far, everything is proceeding according to plan in a Statham film: high on violence and low on mental stimulation.The introduction of Jennifer Lopez is a welcome distraction. Her character, real-estate broker Leslie, injects an iota of intelligence, humour, sexiness and, perhaps, a touch of reality.Leslie says that she's fed up driving rich playboys to see homes that she can never afford. At the same time, she must fend off their gropes, all for a full commission.The sexiness part comes in when Leslie has to strip to her underwear for Parker's viewing pleasure. Lopez is 44 this year, but she's still muy caliente.Lopez's marshal character in Out of Sight (1998) is probably her best performance. Her chemistry with the fugitive (played by George Clooney) is amazing. With Statham, she's acting in front of a statue.www.jeffleemovies.com",Parker

118,octopusluke,"Silly Stath, smash things",4,6 March 2013,"There's always something devilishly exciting about a new Jason Statham movie. Sure, it's no Shakespeare, but the baldy British action star has enough charisma and faux-Cockney swagger to make films like The Expendables and the ludicrous Crank series entertaining, in that silly, popcorn-chomping sort of way.Parker is no exception. Based on the novel 'Flashfire' from Donald E. Westlake's hardboiled crime series, The Stath stars as the eponymous, hard-as-nails master thief with a questionable moral compass and a hulky scarred torso. After leading a successful million dollar heist on a local Ohio state fair, his crackerjack crew turn against him, leaving him bloodied, wounded and left for dead by the roadside. Unfortunately for them, Parker is seemingly indestructible, and limping with a vengeance. Deserting his girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) and her Mafioso dad (a cameo from the gravelly voiced Nick Nolte), he hunts them down to the lavish Palm Beach Florida, and enlists a fledgling realtor Leslie (Jennifer Lopez), together they hatch a plan to catch his former crew whilst they undertake a jewellery auction heist.The first thing worthy of mention is that the plot, like all good/bad action B-movies, is utter balderdash. What could a shrill real estate agent know about the criminal underworld? How could The Stath survive a point blank bullet wound to the chest. And, most preposterous of all, how could anyone ever believe the Brit's lame Texan accent? Parker is the sort of film where you need to leave such questions of plausibility at the door, and just enjoy the gaudy action spectacle.Helmed by the Oscar nominated director of The Devil's Advocate and Ray, Taylor Hackford blends grisly film noir tropes with ultra-violent action set pieces. Getting off to a rollicking start, as the narrative takes prominence, Parker sluggishly tumbles through the two hour running time. It needs a good edit. Although J-Lo's screen presence is magnetic, her character is entirely superfluous, attractive window dressing.Is it a 'good' film. Of course not! The plot is derivative, the 'stick 'em up!' dialogue cringe- worthy, and the characterisation ignominious. Nevertheless, it's mindless entertainment, which you can't help but succumb to.More reviews, interviews and other bits at The Frame Loop www.theframeloop.com",Parker

Donald Westlake) 'Parker' books and this movie pretty much captures the essence of the character. This is not Shakespeare folks. The morality is pretty black and white in these books and Taylor Hackford and the screenwriter captures what this character is about very well. The only thing I found awkward in this movie were the flashbacks in the first third -- but that's a screenplay structure issue, not directing issue. Acting-wise, thought everyone did very well with their roles. No, there's not a lot of depth to anyone, except for perhaps Jennifer Lopez's character who makes it clear she's stuck in a dead-end life post-divorce and needs an out. All in all, a very good, entertaining crime thriller. I won't remember this years from now, but it entertained me and kept my attention throughout. And aside from all this, Stratham makes for one good badass! If you like this, definitely check out ""The Bank Job"" that he starred in: he really shows his acting chops in that one.",Parker

After a successful heist our man is left for dead by his partners. The movie has good action throughout. lots of hand to hand combat, and violent ones at that.

Jsaon Statham is the gentleman thief Parker, whose is his typical tough cool guy with a heart of gold character, chasing down some incompetent crew members who shot him after robbing a state fair's admission revenue while dressed like clowns (I wish I joking about that). Parker gets over his injuries and goes after the men that left him for dead, helped by Nick Nolte's paternal mentor/future father-in-law character and putting his girlfriend, and Nick Nolte's on screen daughter, at unnecessary risk. Jennifer Lopez seems to be thrown in almost at random as a flirtatious almost booty call for Parker but she is gently rebuffed. Jason Statham is okay, not good or bad, just watchable. Jennifer Lopez needs to quit acting, she's shown glimpses of real talent in Selena and Out of Sight, but is too boring or lazy to bring anything other than a pretty face and curvaceous figure to film. Mel Gibson played the same character in Payback and it's a much better revenge drama with an excellent cast and story. Lee Marvin was also Parker in the 1967 film Point Blank and Robert Duvall takes on the role in The Outfit from 1973, both really good crime thrillers with great actors.",Parker
124,bmennen,A 'must see' for Jason Statham fans...,8,25 January 2013,"Well, SURE, there are places where you must suspend disbelief (it's not THAT easy to steal a car, is it?), and SURE there are plot holes, and SURE there are times when you say to yourself ""How did he know to go there?"" BUT...this is one enjoyable movie!The acting, the action scenes, and the eye candy (Statham for you XXs, and J-Lo for us XYs) are all great. Oh...and a word about J-Lo. While I've never been a great fan, the poor reviews she received made me curious. Well, she was excellent...and hot as a pistol. That woman has more sex appeal than 5 centerfolds. Patti Lupone plays her mom...very well, I might add.Statham plays Parker and Parker-like characters in an intrinsically believable manner; that is, marginal characters who live on the edge of the law or beyond it (think ""The Transporter"" series) with an honorable streak. He slips into this part easily, and like his ""Transporter"" character, Parker seems little interested in sex. No...he has a singular purpose here as he has had in previous movies: get the job done, and no time for recreation. And once again, his singularity of purpose rings true.There is, of course, violence, but we all have seen worse; my wife only had to look away twice, and she does not enjoy these types of movies, but goes to humor me (I agreed to see that dreadful ""Moonrise Kingdom"" after all). But she liked ""Parker""--her direct quote was ""It kept my interest""--and that was high praise for this kind of flick.And as Tosh might say: ""And for that, we thank you.""",Parker
125,ashwinrajan-175-992599,Good action movie!,8,26 July 2020,"The story starts with a heist crew killing one of their crew members overwhelmed with greed. The supposedly deceased crew member identified as Parker goes on a hunting spree of his former killers. Meanwhile his killers get the news that Parker had survived the ambush and is somehow living. The killer's chief Danzinger sends a hitman after Parker to completely get rid of him. The hitman somehow finds Parker's girlfriend Claire and attempts to kill her. Fortunately Claire anticipates the attack and outwits the hitman. She later informs Parker about the impending danger from his former colleagues. Parker tells her to stay out of his path and sends her to a safe location. Parker obtains a new identity as Mr.Parmitt and goes after his former colleagues in his new identity. He tracks their address from Hardwicke's brother at a bar and finds their location to be Palm Beach, Florida. Parker meets a real estate agent Leslie and gets put up in an apartment near the coastal zone. Parker also gets to know that his former colleagues Melander, Ross, Carlson and Hardwicke stay somewhere close to the coastal zone. He pays them a silent visit while they were out and somehow sabotages their guns and leaves their premise before they return. In the meantime Leslie also realises that Mr.Parmitt is not what he seems to be and has hidden something from her all the while. The crew members decide to carry out one more heist from a business tycoon while his jewelry gets set on auction.The hitman unsuccessfully attempts to murder Parker and instead gets himself killed in the process. Parker goes to Leslie's place to lay low and get his wounds treated. The crew members become more aware of Parker's exploits on hearing the death of Mr.Danzinger's hitman. They carry out their final heist of the jewelry and get to their hide out. Leslie follows them suspecting foul play and ends up getting captured as their hostage. Parker lurks into the crew's hide out and takes out Ross. Later he sneaks to the door way and signals to Leslie about the hidden gun under the table where she was held at gun point by Carlson. Leslie silently picks the gun and empties the cartridge on Carlson. Melander spots Parker and gets into a scuffle with him. Parker kills Melander and goes after Hardwicke who takes Leslie as hostage. When Hardwicke tries to shoot Leslie he realises that the fire plug was pulled out and the gun had been sabotaged. Before he could do anything Parker puts a bullet into Hardwick's head. He later tells to stash the jewelry on to a vent where he would get them liquidated for her in order to clear her mortgages and save her financially. Then the scene switches over to Chicago where Mr.Danzinger gets cornered by Parker at his office. Before Mr.Danzinger could strike a deal with Parker, he gets shot and the scene forwards to six months where Leslie gets a package from an anonymous name. When She opens the package, She finds bank notes neatly bundled. Leslie delightfully accepts the gift realising that it must be from Parker.",Parker
126,Marthian80,Boring yawn fest with horrible acting,3,14 February 2017,"Parker is a movie with a simple revenge driven plot about a thief- with-codes named Parker (Statham). The movie opens with Parker doing a job with a five-man crew who he doesn't know. The job goes well, but the other gangsters double-cross Parker and leave him for dead. Parker barely survives, and with the help of real-estate agent Leslie Rogers (Lopez) he makes it his mission to get back to them. Anyone familiar with Jason Statham starred movies knows not to expect much but there's usually decent action, funny one liners and spectacular car chases. Unfortunately, this movie has none of that. We get an incredible boring movie that is to long where nothing happens between the opening and ending scene. We get Statham going 'undercover' as a rich Texan (with the worst fake accent ever) to buy real- estate, just to force Jenifer Lopez character into the movie. It is pointless when he can also just go over to his former crime buddies place and blast them all apart. I'm of the opinion that Jenifer Lopez is not a good actress and this movie is no exception to that opinion. She is just horrible and her character makes absolutely no sense to be in this movie. My final complaint is the ridiculous amounts of damage Statham's character get's to endure that he can just shake off. He get's thrown out of a car driving at least 80 km/h while he is shot multiple times, and still lives! Even Arnold's Terminator had trouble recovering from that amount of damage. Watch Blitz or Killer Elite instead if your in for an evening of mindless entertaining with Statham and avoid this boring slug-fest like the plague.",Parker
127,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,Jason Statham's Weakest Film Yet,2,29 January 2013,"I generally enjoy Jason Statham movies and even though they have been getting more and more generic as they go along, I still tend to enjoy them for the most part.Unfortunately, this is not the case with Parker.Based on what I had seen from the trailers, I didn't go into Parker expecting it to be great, but at least decent with some good action scenes in it. Even for a Jason Statham movie released in Janurary, Parker is surprisingly awful. I felt like I was watching a T.V movie. Statham gave a lazy performance as Parker and nothing about his character was interesting. The directing was really poor and whoever was directing really was just doing this for the paycheck. THe writing was even worse. It went between being a brutal revenge story and a crime caper action comedy too much and felt really unbalanced. The story was boring and played out like the most generic of these types of films. The action scenes weren't terrible, but they were very run-of-the-mill and there was nothing about them that made them exciting or entertaining to watch. What made the film even worse was that there were visible errors in the film that any director should've been able to notice such as an early scene in the film where Jason Statham is walking in the rain and you can clearly see where the hose is moving over Statham to make it look like it's raining. It only gets worse once Jennifer Lopez's annoying one dimensional character gets introduced.Parker should've been a fun movie and there's really no excuse for it being as terrible as it is. After seeing this garbage, I honestly don't have any desire to see a Jason Statham movie again for a while (Unless it's Crank 3).The tagline for Parker reads ""To Get Away Clean, You Have To Play Dirty"", and thats exactly what the people behind this film did.",Parker
128,starcraftbw88,One of the stupidest films he's made,3,13 June 2013,"It's a revenge film, so it's predictable and you know the story before seeing it, but it makes Kill Bill look like a masterpiece. The guy who was supposed to kill our protagonist shoots him and kicks him off the road... but he doesn't shoot him fatally or, you know, in the head, or even check if he's dead - because that would've made sense. And why is JLO in it. Her side story is an amazing waste of time and her character makes no sense. In one scene she's some hungry real estate agent trying to get a big sale, in the next she's a detective 'cause can, then in the next she's an emotional mess after she gets herself kidnapped. Than she tries to save the protagonist by... snooping around a house where she knows a bunch of criminals are at... and proceeds to get herself kidnapped again, but it's okay because Statham conveniently taped a gun under the table for this exact situation... What. The. Hell. *SPOILER*! Statham channels the healing powers of Wolverine and kills everyone.",Parker
129,flitz35,Fall asleep every time...,3,25 January 2014,Obviously this is a mainstream theater movie. Good acting is about the only thing this movie had. Parker had a story that started in a good direction but strayed several times and that's when each and every time I try to give this movie a chance there goes my eyes then I start snoring each time. Yes Jennifer Lopez looks beautiful as always and gives a great performance. Jason also always shines but the movie went in different and confusing directions without ever truly grabbing my attention.

I laughed almost the whole way through.It's so so very bad with possibly the worst screenplay imaginable, terrible acting from all involved, and I mean all. Every scene is stupid. Every piece of dialogue is stupid. The editor has great comic timing though (it seems that he also thought that this was a comedy). Was Tommy Wiseau involved in this production as an uncredited script consultant?I had to give it an 8/10 as a comedy so long as I can imagine that Tim and Eric directed it.Here are some more lines as apparently being succinct is unattractive.Apparently woodworking can improve posture and cure headaches... who knew?",Parker

A couple rather unnecessary scenes of nudity aside, and the obvious stretch of believably concerning the stamina of Jason's character, this ticked all the boxes for a rainy afternoon movie.",Parker
132,manusanchez90,Excellent action thriller!,8,11 April 2013,"""Parker"" is a thriller made for the thrilling action movies fans and specially, for Jason Statham's fans. It is an enjoyable thriller full of action and violence. First, I must state that I did not read or know the novel it is based upon, so my review does not compare the book with the movie. ""Parker"" does not add anything really new, but it surely entertains and has some solid script and plot as well as a nice photography of Miami. Statham delivers a very good performance, but nothing different of what he always does. Jennifer Lopez worked very well in this movie, as well. The problem is that they work better when separated than when together. This means that they are both good actors who do a good job in ""Parker"", but they do not have any chemistry together, unlike Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", for example. The action scenes are rather realistic and very violent (specially one in which the protagonist is beated up by his own colleagues and another in the balcony of a hotel). The director Taylor Hackford has done a very good job because the movie amused movie during its entire length. Although the end is quite predictable, the movie contains some interesting twists. The cast is focused on both Jason and Jlo. The other actors simply did a fine job. In conclusion, this is a very recommendable movie, specially when you just feel like action, entertainment, a nice city to watch and attractive people like Jason Statham and Jlo. Do not expect anything very profound! 8",Parker

134,nerfball_king,"Like watching a ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game",5,13 May 2014,"""Parker"" starts out OK, although the movie itself is totally unbelievable. It's difficult to explain, but I'll try: There are people shot at point blank range, critically stabbed, thrown out of vehicles traveling at high- speeds and rolling a dozen yards on the blacktop, thrown off balconies, etc., yet in the very next scene they look and act like they can run the New York City Marathon while dressed up in a snazzy outfit. No limping/lack of use of a hand or foot, need for recovery, etc. Additionally, vehicles are left running and stolen in broad daylight, there's a network of cash, firearms, private nurses/medical care that makes house calls. It's very similar to missions in one of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" games, so if you like those and are able to take your brain out to lunch for 2 hours, you'll like this film.",Parker
135,flatrich,Bad casting - a waste of good actors,5,10 April 2021,"Read the Parker novels (over two dozen out there) and forget this movie. It's based on one of them and steals some bits from others and it's not horrible, but it's not Parker. I blame the casting. Statham is okay, but he's British and Parker is definitely not. Parker is an American career criminal. A professional thief. Very American. Statham plays him more like James Bond. Jennifer Lopez is a good enough actress but her character in this one is actually (in the book) more like the actress playing her mousy blonde friend at the real estate office. And Claire, Parker's woman friend, is a tough ""moll"" in the books, not the ""frail"" in this movie. When I read (Donald E. Westlake aka) Richard Stark's Parker books, Parker is Humphrey Bogart and Claire is Lauren Bacall. Yes, they're both unavailable to make Parker films nowadays, but so is Donald E. Westlake and the last Parker novel was written in 2008, just before his death. The first was written in 1963 and Parker is very much a guy from the past. Read and enjoy the books.",Parker
136,robojames,Get To The Point,6,9 March 2021,"If you're going to have a wafer-thin plot you should keep it brief and action-packed, but this film doesn't do that. It's just too long and spends too much of its runtime developing characters that, predictably, only exist to facilitate Statham's violent outbursts.I'll definitely give a Jason Statham film high marks if it keeps me engaged but this one didn't quite do it for me. Statham's the same as he is in everything so the problem isn't with him, nor with Jennifer Lopez. It's more that Parker doesn't succeed in doing what it sets out to do: be consistently exciting.That said, the start of the film and set-up is very well done and some of the action sequences and one-liners are satisfying and it definitely wasn't bad enough that I wanted to turn it off. If you're only going to watch a couple of Statham vehicles, of the ones I've seen I'd go for Crank or maybe Safe over this. If you're a fan of his, this will have enough to keep you happy.",Parker

However, in general, it is ultimately just a vehicle for Statham to play his usual super cool, super competent, anti-hero. If you've see any of his movies you've see this one. Unlike some of his other movies, this one doesn't quite deliver. Statham seemed to be largely going through the motions and the rest of what should have been a great cast were largely just propping up his character. Ultimately, it was a waste of good talent. I am somewhat surprised that Lopez, Chiklis, Nolte, and others were willing to be part of a movie where their characters were so underutilized.I quickly recognized this was more or less a remake of the Mel Gibson movie Payback, which I remember as being much, much better.",Parker

142,didonatope,Jennifer Lopez Steals The Show,6,30 January 2013,"Despite my expectations of seeing a standard Jason Statham action movie, I can still safely say that ""Parker"" honestly entertained me. The main premise of the movie is that after being double-crossed by a gang of thieves that hired him, a man named Parker (played by action superstar Jason Statham) decides to steal the bounty of their next heist as revenge. Meanwhile, a bankrupt real estate agent (played by entertainer Jennifer Lopez) gets herself involved in Parker's plan in exchange for a share of the money. With a premise as simple as this, I was rather surprised that I ended up enjoying the film. Don't get me wrong, it's still flawed in several ways. A lot of the characters like the gang's leader Melander (played by Michael Chiklis-famous for playing The Thing in ""The Fantastic Four"" movies) and Parker's girlfriend (played by Emma Booth) are underdeveloped and not given enough screen time. Moreover, Parker's girlfriend's father Hurley (played by Nick Nolte) seems to be an important character in the beginning of the film (giving Parker advice and having a substantial amount of screen time), but he disappears about a half hour into the film and is never seen again. The main character Parker also seemed a bit too strong, recovering from very serious injuries rather quickly. However, these flaws really didn't bother me as I was watching the film. Though I'm sure they would if this was an ordinary Jason Statham action movie, there was one certain element that grabbed my interest and honestly made me smile.Without a doubt, Jennifer Lopez's character Leslie Rogers (see below) stole the show. She is first introduced as an attractive late-thirties real estate agent who just can't seem to sell a house. She also has the misfortune of being routinely hit on and ""groped"" by clients. This role could have been you're average Mary Sue, Lopez gives conviction and dedication to the role that honestly made me like her character. I wanted Leslie to succeed at helping Parker steal the bounty. Her character was also quite humorous. One moment that comes to mind is a scene where she sees Parker badly injured and freaks out despite him constantly saying he's okay. Her reaction felt real and that's what made the character so likable. In Jason Statham's case, his performance is pretty much on-par with nearly every one of his other roles, but there are a few things that made his role here superior. Since this movie is rated R, the action set pieces are much more brutal and bloody, giving Statham a chance to better showcase his talents as a stuntman and real life martial artist. Plus I just can't help but say that his witty, quick line delivery still hasn't gotten old for me. In a few scenes, his character puts on a fake southern accent while in disguise and it did show some comedic promise for Statham. So is Parker a wonderful, groundbreaking action movie? No; the story is still pretty standard and there are a few flaws overall. Is it worth the discounted $5 ticket I bought. Of course! In fact, I would happily recommend it to hardcore Jason Statham fans as well as Jennifer Lopez fans. Overall: not half bad.",Parker

I even thought it was a remake, but it was slightly different.But then they put J-Lo in the play and everything went awry. Trying to make any sense of her appearance in the movie they had to reduce Statham competence and professionalism, so she could help him, but it looked so... out of place and at the end she didn't help him anyway.All in all, not a bad movie to watch and much better than some other post-Transporter Statham's works, but could've been even better.Recommended",Parker
145,mynameisibrahim,Parker Review,4,16 March 2013,"Parker is a revenge saga about a highly principled thief, essayed by British actor and former International diving star, Jason Statham. The premise follows the eponymous title character who is the subject of a misconception following a premeditated heist at an Ohio State Fair. He is deemed expendable in the aftermath of the larceny and is literally left for dead by his perfidious team members, led by the double-dealing Melander, played by Michael Chiklis. Following his disposal, he is immediately rescued by a family and miraculously manages to recuperate.Parker harbors an unconventional code of conduct: he aim to avoid robbing those he considers destitute and innocuous. Unbeknownst to his deceptive former team members, he locates their whereabouts and sets out to exact revenge from those who wronged him, which represents another one of his morals. He also enlists the assistance of real estate agent Leslie Rogers, enacted by Jennifer Lopez.Parker is an adaptation of the novel Flashfire, the 19th of 28 novels written by the late Donald E. Westlake, under the alias Richard Stark. It is also the latest endeavor of Oscar winning director Taylor Hackford, perhaps most conspicuous for being the husband of fellow Oscar winner, Dame Helen Mirren. Hackford has delivered acclaimed movies such as Ray in the past. However, in this instance, he is unable to make Parker an engaging affair. He exhibits some erratic direction in specific scenes. Perhaps the screenplay by John L. McLaughlin, responsible for helming Black Swan, is reprehensible in this regard. Nonetheless, a better collective may have yielded a more captivating thriller.Jason Statham excels as the namesake in a role where he has managed to carve a niche for himself. He exerts considerable energy and exudes intensity and a victim seeking vengeance. The feasibility of the entire premise hinges firmly on his depiction and he is able to use his significant experience in action movies to his advantage. His delineation is strikingly similar to his work in recent movies, such as Safe, Crank and the Transporter series.Jennifer Lopez is assigned the task of adding the beauty quotient to the film. Sadly, she is unable to contribute to the cause. Her appearance is lackluster, combined with her bland acting skills. She plays a distraught damsel but her execution is devoid of any palpable emotion. She is miscast in the role and is bereft of any tangible sensibility. She represents the most wince inducing aspect of the movie. The antagonist is enacted well by Michael Chiklis, known best for his stint on the award winning television series The Shield. He is the epitome of charisma as the villain. Unfortunately, he is afforded scarce screen space to leave a greater impact.The fight sequences, especially a hand to hand combat between Parker and the contract killer Kroll (Daniel Bernhardt), are well choreographed and of a brutal nature. The caper is set predominantly in Miami and the environment is captured quite well. The coup de grace could have been more interesting instead of being prone to predictability.In conclusion, Parker is not a distinguished thriller in the same vein as the Die Hard franchise or the Bourne trilogy. Statham is the stereotypical action hero in this run-of-the-mill affair and Parker is tantamount to nothing more than a routine, run of the mill flick. It is lamentable that justice is not done to the work of prolific crime fiction author Donald E. Westlake.",Parker

147,Buscatcher,Its THE STAFE 'nuff said.,5,12 March 2013,"Is there any need to read or write a review for a film featuring THE STAFE? Well I'm sort of going to anyway.Parker opens at the Ohio state fair the camera follows a dog- collared, bespectacled silver haired chap around the fair. But wait that ain't no ordinary padre its THE STAFE, who along with a motley crew that look like they may have spent a good portion of childhood on the naughty step are going to take every nickel from these good folk at the fair. We are now in the getaway car and THE STAFE wants his cut, alas these chappies are a bunch of meanies and want to double up by investing the ill gotten gains in another more lucrative spot of mischief. Guns are produced, blood is shed and THE STAFE is forced to leap from the moving vehicle giving himself a nasty bump on the noggin. The wussyest baddie is despatched to finish him off and kick his body into the swamp. Now as you can guess THE STAFE hasn't gone to meet his maker (he'd only give him a slap anyway) and is jolly well miffed about being taken for a right pratt and no doubt feels a bit of a silly Billy. We can now settle back, get right stuck into the popcorn and watch our gravel voiced U.K export get pwoper nawty getting his own back on the sneaky beggars. Next we get to see quite a bit of J Lo's bum in tight fitting skirts and her undies as she helps our cultural attache to the states, wreak havoc across Florida. Best of all we are treated to the Great Brit wearing a stetson; which can only mean one thing; oh yes, THE STAFE'S Texan accent.Fisticuffs and shooting aplenty take us towards the conclusion, with our anti-hero acquiring quite a number of nasty bumps and grazes along the way; those knives are bloody pointy and the bullets really sting. The moral of it all seems to be you can be a nasty, vicious, uncaring, selfish, murderous and vindictive swine but its all tickety-boo if you're THE STAFE.

I read these reviews before I pick the movies to go see and some reviewers like to really dwell on the same thing that professional reviewers deal with. What I like to read, is real people and how these people enjoy the movie as entertainment. This movie will not disappoint you if you like Jason Statham movies.

I didn't finish watching the movie, because I sort of understood how it will go, I guess it can entertain you for 2 hours if you have low expectations and play the movie just for the heck of it, but expecting some big thrill from this is just out of the question, its instant entertainment lasting no more than it plays, the moment it ends, it will fade away in your mind.Jason plays out his usual self, tough guy, fighter, the rest of cast did an OK job, apart from Michael Chiklis who's acting skills were really unsatisfactory.5/10",Parker

153,onetogrowon,"Standardized, homogenized, McStatham Movie",3,3 May 2013,"Parker is a thief vs. thief action flick, with a core theme of principles and honor (in this case honor among thieves). It is difficult to accept such gallantry from a hero, who rides into the sunset with millions, earmarked for the local community and this conflict between, adherence to the social contract, as opposed to, breaking it for personal gain, is never resolved. Parker, is one of the few movies where crime pays.(Note: There was interaction between, Ms. Lopez and a clearly smitten cop, that dead ended. I would bet that somewhere there is an alternate ending where Ms. Lopez takes the moral highground. Those who embrace the pseudo Robin Hood fantasy of Parker (Real Robins give away the bounty), would be better served watching the true story, Pain and Gain.) Mr.Statham plays his standard rough talking bad ass, with Terminator like resiliency, and Ms. Lopez plays a convincing dumb bitch. There was an attempt to construct a love triangle but, with the lack of character development, between Mr. Statham and his ""wife"", only thing built was ambivalence. (Up until the final scene, I was anticipating the revelation that the ""wife"" was actually Parker's sister, (Parker's family having some boundary issues) thereby opening the door for a Mr. Statham/Ms. Lopez couple.)If you are a fan of Mr. Statham and have nothing better to do, this might be worth a cheap rental or to watch, when it is picked up by late night TV.Complete time waster, nothing more, and I like, and gave an extra star for, Jason Statham.",Parker

The writing and direction of this film was one of the worst I have ever seen. Don't waste nearly 2 hours of you life on this movie. It was phoned in by everyone involved. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and the dialog was utter slop. It was so bad, we actually laughed through most of it.

159,m-atanasoff,Every other Jason Statham film ever made,3,10 February 2013,"Parker, a.k.a. ""Every other Jason Statham film ever...but this time with a ten gallon"". I won't be going in a detailed review, because if you've seen one Jason Statham flick you've seen every Jason Statham flick. Don't believe me? Here are some common trends I've noticed across his other films also present in this one: 1. Obligatory scene where he runs away from the hospital, minutes after waking up from being shot, beaten and/or mauled by a bear - check. 2. Semi-anonymous protagonist that is just a ridiculous badass for no apparent reason - check. 3. Whatever dubious activities he takes part in are explained to the viewer as honorable in a ""everyone gets dirty"" kind of way, because you know, JS has a code he adheres to and that automatically makes crime acceptable - check. 4. Women are magnetically compelled to his junk by his mere presence - check. Fast and fancy cars, because. (No I didn't forget the rest of the sentence) - check. 5.Walking around seemingly unfazed with broken appendages, ribs, collar bones, multiple gunshot wounds, knife stabbing wounds and/or bear mace - check.All and all it's an okayish film, if you've never seen another Jason Statham flick before, but at this point it's just stupid to keep casting him in the same role, in the same film, over and over. It's obvious he's not a brilliant actor, but he has a lot more to offer than what is currently being churned out. Speaking of acting don't get me started on Jeniffer Lopez - her acting is just wince-inducing. Apparently the director thought the same and cast her in the film as a walking butt to centre shots around in the time Jason is off screen, presumably to make JS' male fans feel less awkward and have an excuse about having an erection throughout the movie, because we all know how unsure of themselves ""bros"" are.It's a completely forgettable film you will probably regret paying actual real world money to see, because you will feel like you've seen this film at least 4 other times.",Parker
160,sean-cowan1,"Standard Statham Vehicle, Entertaining",7,14 September 2013,"A standard type of movie you would expect Jason Statham to make, not much store, great action scenes.Personally I enjoy the type of movies he often makes and while they are not going to be award winning or particularly memorable films they are always great to sit down kick back and just watch some action. Nothing fancy here, just a good run of the mill action film.Jason has four movies in 2013, Parker, and Fast 6 are the standard action films, Hummingbird and Homefront are the ones that show of his acting ability alongside his stuntmanship. If you want the thought-provoking performance, pass on this one, if you want the type of fast paced action we expect from him you will enjoy this.",Parker
161,Natsu21,Had potential,3,15 May 2013,"When I started off watching this movie I was enjoying it a lot, sure it looked like it was going to be the same cliché stuff we have come to expect from Statham aka him kicking serious amounts of ass and showing why you should not f*ck with his character. Once we hit about the 30 to 40 minute mark though something terrible happens, Jennifer Lopez. There is no reason what so ever for her to be in this movie and she just throws the whole vibe this movie had right out the window and what started as a ass kicking action movie is now a movie about a down on her luck real estate agent who just needs a break in life so she can escape the rut she is in. Also they try and make her a romantic interest for Stathams character, except well they just spent the first 45 minutes setting up his love interest aka his girlfriend and now they seemed to suddenly have forgotten her, even though they gave her decent amount of screen time and flashbacks to show that Stathams character loves her. This movie brought in a pointless character late into the movie for no reason and proceeded to destroy the vibe this movie had set. There are other plot holes in the movie like Statham hiding guns in the bad guys house and then leaving them there for at least over a day in what? the hope they don't need to at any point look under the tables they sit at? The action they did show was good though and was the only redeeming quality of the movie. This is pretty much a movie you should watch if it's on T.V at some point and isn't worth the rental.",Parker
162,tomigarciap,Plain simple,5,26 June 2013,"This is not a bad movie, but it's quite forgettable. This movie provides an extremely basic plot in an unoriginal way. It's a plain vengeance- among-thieves tale, and that's all there is to it. That's why it's not transcendent, it doesn't stand out in any of it's elements. Take for example Kill Bill by Tarantino, it deals with vengeance in its purest form. It's the central motive of the movie. However, it presents this vengeance in an unique and unprecedented way.The movie fails at the attempt of creating a relentless ""Parker"", a master in the craft of thievery and stealth, when he also ends up trusting his vengeance master plan to a random mansion sells-woman. I mean, we are talking about the same guy who switches car like 15 times in his runaway not get caught. One should be able to tolerate some holes in the plot of a movie, but there has to be a limit.If you are a fan of Jason Statham, go ahead and watch it, you won't have a bad time, but to the ordinary man I would suggest to use his time in some other film.",Parker

The action and violence it did have was well done, overall film was well produced. Jason Statham's character was interesting in that he's a thief but reveals touches of goodness a few times in the film, unlike the villains (also thieves). The villains were not outstandingly memorable, but adequate. Story kept moving along, didn't waste time. One strange thing that stands out: in the beginning, villain tells an assassin to shoot and kill Statham while he's lying on ground. It shows the gun firing, but not where the bullet hits. Later Statham ends up in hospital. He's bloody and beaten, but it doesn't look like he's been shot in the head. Why didn't the assassin know enough to shoot Statham in the head?",Parker

It was full of action, excitement, martial arts, fighting, explosions, bad guys, and also had a damsel in distress. Who could ask for anything more?? I also enjoyed the one-on-one scenes Jason had with Jennifer Lopez. If his character was not already involved with Claire, he would have easily began a romance with Jennifer. But being the ethical man that he was, he did not want to cheat. That is what I really call a hero. The movie stars Jason Statham so everyone knows the type of characters that he portrays....a guy which draws down action, action, shooting, guns, martial arts, more guns, explosions, fighting, and chase scenes. The movie won't win an Oscar, but who really cares, it was a movie that entertained and kept its audience awake.The movie also had a soft side to it. Here was a man who was a very highly-skilled criminal, but he did not want anyone to be harmed. He was upset when the fire at the Ohio State Fair was not set according to plan. He wanted to use his portion of the money from the take to simply disappear. And of course, his partners had to get greedy. Not good. However, as expected, it worked out in the end for Jason.Why are some reviewers moaning about the movie, when they knew what they were going to get whenever they see the name Jason Statham??

""Parker"" is not all that exciting due to the prolonged script with a lot of useless added scenes but still brings a surprise here and there. This betrayal and payback type of movie has been done multiple times, however, Parker will exceed your expectations. The downfall of this movie ultimately came down to the predictable aspects of the film. Another thing is that I hated the character Jenifer Lopez played. She is an amazing singer in real life, but lacks the ability to take on as large of a role as she did in Parker.

Living in the Palm Beach area, which has it's own special situations for logistics, I thought they had a good plan and worked it well.I thought J-Lo was terribly miss-cast in this movie.

The plot was interesting and centered around Parker's vengeance. While the acting was on point, I did feel that there was something lacking from the fight scenes. Entertaining at best but I'm used to a little bit more martial arts from Statham. Also, they used all digital effects in some of the actions scenes, particularly those including gunshots wounds.

Okay, so we aren't really referencing garbage - or roses. But the point here is that Parker delivers yet another blow to American cinema in the sense that it, well, blows.Atrocity abounds in every, and I do mean every, facet of what makes a movie good or even watchable. Statham is flat, Lopez is a lingering fart that just won't dissipate, not enough rehab in the world for Nolte, and the rest of the cast just might fare better as extras in a late night Cinemax special. Booth, however, was honest in her abilities, though brief, and therefore both believable and likable; for that a score of two is afforded. With all the roving talent in today's world, it shatters the mind as to how amateur hour consistently triumphs over acceptability with each passing year.

175,iamstephenbourne-568-171804,Parker a clunker,2,27 January 2013,"Review: Parker (2013) USA, 118 minutes, Rated 14A (ON) 13+ (QC) Reviewed 01/13, © Stephen BourneJason Statham is out for blood and back for revenge as Parker, a for-hire criminal left for dead in Ohio by his heist team when he won't agree to use the thousands of dollars they've just stolen to fund hitting a West Palm Beach jewel auction worth millions. In Florida, disguised as a house-hunting Texan oil baron, Parker meets divorced and deflated rookie real estate agent Leslie Rodgers (played by Jennifer Lopez) who quickly figures out what Parker's really after and offers to help for a cut of the take. This offering from director Taylor Hackford had so much going for it: A great cast led by Statham, who's tailor-made for this role. A gritty crime story full of intriguing twists and wonderful low-lifes. Punchy dialogue and action handed to screenwriter John J. McLaughlin on a silver platter. With all of that, Parker should be an intensely riveting flick for big screen action-lovers. Unfortunately, it's not.The movie is adapted from prolific American crime author Donald E. Westlake's 2000 novel Flashfire, the 19th in his 24-book Parker series begun in 1962 with The Hunter. Several Hollywood films have either been based on or inspired by Westlake's Parker books over the years. Point Blank (1967) starring Lee Marvin, and Payback (1999) starring Mel Gibson were both based on The Hunter, for instance. However, this 2013 adaptation of Flashfire is the first where the main character is actually named Parker. And, according to Westlake's youngest son Paul who blogs about his father's lit legacy, this movie is ""mostly true to the book."" I guess that's code for all the book's good bits were left out.Parker, the film, drops the ball at virtually every instance of potential greatness. Continuity gaffs abound. The editing is hackneyed, completely botching key scenes that should feel intense but instead are laboriously boring. You have characters shooting guns mere inches from each other yet repeatedly missing their targets, making those scenes laughably nonsensical. McLaughlin's script merely has Statham spit out the same tired lines heard from his past few features, to the point where it's easy to forget this is a new release. On-screen moments with a deathly ill-looking Nick Nolte as Parker's trusted mentor Hurley, and Emma Booth as Parker's clothing challenged girlfriend Clare don't much help this forgettable stinker.Frankly, the only notable highlight is Jennifer Lopez' obvious efforts in actively fleshing out her character throughout as being more than a contrived and vapid one-dimensional role. It has little to do with the main story, but the subplot between her and Bobby Cannavale as lovesick local Sheriff Jake Fernandez is a refreshing treat. Sure, fans have seen better performances from Lopez, but it's clear what you see here is her natural talent shining through despite the lazy screenplay and lame editing. You'll find the usual info, photo gallery and video sections at the nicely designed official website, as well as a series of free games that include Safe Cracker Cash Grab, Parker's Escape Driving Game, and Parker's Revenge shooter game. The games are definitely a highlight of the site, well worth checking out.Statham fanatics will likely keep this boring, poorly cobbled actioner in theatres much longer than it deserves. However, apart from Lopez' comparably impressive performance, you won't see anything you haven't seen before or really need to pay the price of admission to sit through. Yawn. Reviewed 01/13, © Stephen Bourne.Parker is rated 14A by the Ontario Film Review Board for occasional gory/grotesque images, coarse language, sexual references, nudity in a non-sexual context, occasional upsetting or disturbing scenes, embracing and kissing, tobacco use, violent acts shown in clear, unequivocal and realistic detail with blood and tissue damage, and is rated 13+ by la Régie du Cinéma in Québec.",Parker

The film accomplishes creating a down to Earth thriller with the dramatic ups and downs of a well written story.In today's movie world, most movies create thrill by just using special effects that show cars being blown away, chases, and gun battles. Special effects are fine and thrilling, but a movie created by computer effects is devoid of real creativity.In Parker however, the thrills come from the characters' interactions and situations. Now, you really need imagination and creativity in order to accomplish such level of reality.The film presents the two main characters in a very realistic way. Furthermore, the female lead played by Jennifer Lopez, is played to perfection.It is very sad to observe that this film did not get proper distribution here in New York City. Originally, the movie was going to be shown at several AMC Theaters including the Lincoln Square 13. While it did play in several AMC Houses, it never played the Lincoln Square 13. The Lincoln Square 13 seems to be the AMC Flagship here in NYC. In my opinion, the fact that this movie did not played in that house hurt the movie at the box office.All-in-all, I hope there is a sequel to Parker with the same actors playing the lead roles. I also will like to see the sequel promoted and distributed more efficiently.",Parker
184,lracosta,Jennifer Lopez Saved This Movie,6,15 June 2013,"I am going to be brief. I read a couple of reviews and most of them are correct when they state that is another Statham flick, full of action, killer fight, scenes, grand theft auto etc. I personally didn't know it was based on a series of books. It is entertaining, but I am glad I waited for the DVD release (or BD on it's defect).All in all it is just about an anti hero seeking revenge out for those ""crooks with no ethics"". Though it was certainly long it does give some insight of the secondary characters in the movie and their intentions. The most surprising performance was of Mrs. Jennifer Lopez, I have never been a fan of hers until now; she plays a down to earth character yet is a damsel on distress still got the balls to do what is best for her.In my opinion she saves the film by bringing that relatable character to life and believable, she the true underdog of the film.In the end if you are a fan of Statham you'll love this film, and if you are a fan of Lopez you'll be glad she took this role.",Parker

Sadly I have to disagree entirely. My attention was held for probably about half the movie, around the time that Jennifer Lopez started to come into the movie.Another review mentioned the apparent ease with which ""Parker"" steals cars in the movie. I am not sure whether reading that review prior to watching the movie made me a little more sensitive to it or not, but it was a constant feature of the film. Lean down under the steering wheel, then cut away to car driving off mere seconds later...I would not be comfortable recommending this movie for a watch, even if you have nothing better to do. Even as a bad movie it's not bad enough to make it worth a novelty viewing.The acting was generally average and the special effects just silly.

That is of course until you add a ridiculous Mexican housewife and her shenanigans.The first 40 minutes is really good actually, I was starting to enjoy it. But then things somehow take a terrible downturn. Its almost like they blew all their budget on the first 40 minutes (and with it Nick Noltes lack-luster acting) and then scrambled some rubbish together for the rest of the film. Now look, I didn't walk into the cinema expecting an Oscar winner, I went in expecting a movie where Jason Statham shoots bad guys. And for the most part that is essentially what happens, but when you have a plot that was to all observations written by monkeys and determined by alphabet soup, along with some of THE WORST acting I have ever seen in my life and finally a misplaced comedy aspect that misses its mark in every aspect; you land up with Parker. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Although Statham, and J-Lo's wasn't all that bad, their performance is marred by what is pretty much a cluster-f*ck of a movie.All in all, don't watch this. Please.And to Mr Statham: Is this what you want from your career?1/10: Putrid.",Parker
187,xoramos,Boring and predictable.,2,18 June 2013,"I'm always up for an action movie. Even predictable ones, provided that have okay acting and alright action scenes. Unfortunately this movie is sub-par on both fronts. The acting is meh, a lot of it relies on mean faces and swears - no depth. A few scenes feel really awkward and amateur, like a high-class student film, or something with a budget of ~1m at most. J-Lo wasn't anything special and she felt 'thrown in' to increase the names attached to this film. Average film, wouldn't pay to watch it, but give it a year when it's on TV and you have nothing else to do, or you're doing something else while watching it in the background...then sure I guess.",Parker
188,adiadr,awful,1,5 May 2013,"just a awful movie a complete fiasco, I hope I get amnesia and forget this piece of crap, its staring j-lo, may I need to tell anything else???, it really looks and feels like the devil himself came up whit this movie to offer us a free sample of hell, its like a generic Jason Stanton movie, but made like it is a parody, lame, awful, and stupid... I keep t fighting whit myself to continue watching this min after min, during the time it played I could feel my I.Q drop... You will hate yourself after this movie! It's possibly you star bleeding from all your cavities at some point during this movie! ps I really like Stanton, but whit this ultimate crap is like a love hate relationship",Parker
189,der_mimo,Typically Statham!,7,5 October 2013,"If you like the Statham movies, you will also like ""Parker"". Jennifer Lopez is not a great actress, but she fits pretty good in the role of Leslie.In times where good fighting movies are rare, Statham is one of my last hopes for simple and good fighting action-movie. Thats maybe one of the weak points at this film: Even in the uncensored version, the fighting scenes have a poor cut. I want to have more good fighting scenes with Statham as in ""Crank"" or ""Transporter 1"". Also for this plot the movie seems to be quiet to long. I expect more character detail in a movie with a duration of 118 minutes.",Parker
190,michael-yingling,Jason's worst movie since in the Name of The King,2,5 July 2013,"As I stated in the previous review, I do not often give bad ratings since every movie can be a work of art in some way. However, Parker (2013), was Jason Statham's (Parker) worst movie since ""In the Name of the King"". His movies have never been Oscar worthy but are usually fun and entertaining. I found myself constantly checking the remaining time on this movie. Now a movie ""whore"" ,such as m, usually never watches the clock and enjoys a flick through on to the special features. This was a rare moment when that did not happen. This is a film about a bad guy who gets betrayed by the other bad guys and wants revenge (thus making him the ""good guy"" of the movie, even though he is still a bad guy). So he hunts them down to seek his revenge in a beautiful rich Florida city where a cheap house is a million bucks. I give the film a 2/10 just because Jason's acting is still awesome but the movie has the standard of a six dollar Saint Louis Hooker. Yes the film is unbelievable but that is what makes Jason Statham movies fun is the craziness. However, in this case, nearly all other performances in this film were cringe worthy. I was especially disappointed in Michael Chicklis' (Melander) performance. If you have seen him in ""The Shield"", ""No Ordinary Family"" or ""Fantastic Four"" you know he has SOME talent. He really was not convincing as an ""Evil Guy"". Wendell Pierce's (Carlson) acting was probably the worst in the whole movie. His lines seemed like he was reading them for the first time off a queue card. Micah A. Hauptman's (August Hardwicke) performance was actually believable. He was the, ""surprise I can act"", actor in this film. He has not been a main character in many other films worth noting. Nick Nolte's (Hurley) voice is so annoying I kept waiting for him to ask for a Richola to clear his throat disgusting throat. Parker's (Statham's) wife/girlfriend/love interest Clair (played by Emma Booth, it is not really explained their exact relationship status that I can truly remember) is so underdeveloped you do not care if she dies or not in the film. I found myself actually hoping she would be killed so Parker could get with another more developed character. The ""Heroine"" of the movie (not really a love interest but almost one) is Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez), a failing and broke real estate agent that lives with her over trustworthy mother with a never ending bad hair day. I never considered Lopez much of an actress and I will not do her any favors here. I think she really stands in as eye candy for those who like that sort of thing. Her character is almost put in there just as a plot device. All in all,this movie that is somewhat bearable to watch while on 10 ML of Roxicet and no sleep in two days. If in any other condition do not waste your precious time.",Parker
191,wmilesiv,Are you all on drugs?,2,14 March 2021,"What movie are you all watching that is so great? I feel like I'm living in an alternate dimension from every other reviewer. The acting, the writing, the random flashbacks, the knife hand - just not good. Not good at all. This is madness.",Parker
192,gabbiemurphy1985,Jason Statham - boring,1,28 January 2013,"I first saw this movie 11 years ago, it was called ""The transporter"" back then, I then got to see the same film again, a couple of years later, with a 2 on the end.The 3rd time i saw this film, it was called ""crank"" in 2006, and the year after i was blessed with seeing it again in crank 2, followed by another screening a year later with the transporter 3.So having to sit through this same film, for the 6th time, i found it pretty boring. ""A thief with a unique code of professional ethics""Same rubbish, different film.and the worse part is, this isn't even remotely better then the other versions of this movie i listed above.",Parker
193,baracuda_hemi,A revamp of Eastwood's the Gauntlet.,6,26 January 2014,"I liked it. As my summary states, this is a revamp of the Gauntlet. Nick Nolte sounds, looks, and acts just like Eastwood's partner. Only, this isn't about a cop. A man with the same principles, yes. Yet not a drunk and not a cop. Cops in this flick depicted as they are: boneheads. I hope this is long enough to satisfy IMDb's arbitrary minimum. A revamp of Eastwood's the Gauntlet. Perhaps better, as the lead isn't a po-ho and we see Chiklis (best known from The Shield) play a douche. I need two more lines of text. I need two more lines of text. I need two more lines of text. I need two more lines of text. I need two more... that's getting old.",Parker
194,erinirelandgirl,Very disappointing,1,19 March 2013,"Yes, it is true, Statham follows a formula, but it has been for the most part workable and successful so far. This film is convoluted, and is lacking a certain something. You don't really care about the other characters and the plot just doesn't grab you, entertain or deliver the usual thrills that go with a Statham vehicle. Let's hope for a better script next time. If you loved The Mechanic, Safe, Blitz, the Transporter series, Chaos, or even the Expendables, you will find Parker disappointing and flat. It reminded me of Killer Elite in that a certain tension and workable plot were missing. And that was a complete waste of De Niro's talent. Again, with Parker, Jennifer Lopez and the other talent in this film were wasted too.",Parker
195,JoelMoriasi,Another Jason Statham Film,5,31 October 2013,"Jason Statham is great. Not the best actor in Hollywood but one of the best in the type of character he plays in most of his films. And this one is of no exception. I felt like I have watched the film all along simply because it is just another Jason's film. If you have watched any other of his flicks you will probably find this very familiar. This review is more of him than of the film because after the credits all you will remember about it is him. And yea Jenifer Lopes flashing her goods too. I think it is just another popcorn film, good for passing time with some action on the screen, flashy cars, Palm beach and Jennifer Lopez doing bad acting.",Parker
196,mihai751,Title should be: Parker and his giant Texas hat,2,3 May 2013,"This is the most boring, pointless movie I have seen in a long loooong time. The storyline sounded like it could be a cool film noir sort of flick, and it could have been, but I'm still stunned from the utter boring crap this movie is from start to finish, especially the finish...and middle, and everything except the first 5-10 minutes.Yes, the only thing that makes this movie somewhat bearable is Strathams ""effort"" to speak with a Texas accent, while wearing an even bigger cowboy hat than Woody Harrelson in No Country for Old Men. This is the movies unintended comic relief. While he tries to speak in texanish, you can hardly understand what he's saying, not that you'd care. You understand even less than what Nick Nolte is trying to say in this movie. Oxygen! Someone give him oxygen please!! Lets decompose the plot so you know what you're missing: ""A thief with a unique code of professional ethics"" Just so the viewer is not at all confused with the complex character Statham embodies, he even SAYS during the robbery that he doesn't steal from people who can't afford it, and he doesn't kill people. Thank you nice robber pointing gun at me, I feel so much better now. OK, so now we have a deep understanding of his character, cool. But then his fellow not so nice robbers double cross him, and his ""professional ethics"" tell him to find them and kill them, without giving a second thought to the fact that this will mean the mafia will probably kill his girlfriend, and her father. So Stathams character is basically a nice guy but if he wants revenge, then he doesn't care what happens to anybody else, he must do his thing, because ""if people don't stick to the plan, then this leads to chaos, and no-one likes chaos"" <-actual movie dialog.""Assuming a new disguise"" See above regarding giant cowboy hat and mumbling in texanish.""and forming an unlikely alliance with a woman on the inside"" This alliance is actually formed by Lopez character simply saying (in another ""deep"" intimate moment of the movie) that she is tired of seeing all the rich people in Palm Beach (while she has to deal with the horrors of living with her TV soap obsessed mom), and that ""whatever you're here to do, kidnapping, extortion, robbery...I'm in""! <- actual movie dialog But then her character is later shocked when she realizes that...he intends to kill those other guys! Confusing...Another interesting tidbit of cinematic trivia - I think we see at least as many shots of Lopez ass in this movie as we see of her face. I didn't time it exactly, but it seemed so.""he looks to hijack the score of the crew's latest heist."" And boy, what a great heist it was - those diamonds and jewels worth 75 million dollars, put in display cases with glass so thin you can shatter it by throwing large peanuts on it (or so it seemed, granted they used much more sophisticated hardware than peanuts, such as axes and tire irons...).The ""hijack"" part is utterly boring with no surprises at all and it all takes place in the bad robbers house....bang bang, dead, bang bang dead, bang bang...dead.But wait there's more! 30 seconds more. 6 months later, cut to Parker walking in on the big mafia guys office in Chicago, bang. Then cut to Lopez character getting her share delivered by express mail (not making this up). Hooray, no more living with my mom, now I can also buy a house and live in the pink hell that is Palm Beach. I'm so happy.THE END",Parker
197,cesareroma48,Wonderful,10,12 May 2013,"simply it's a wonderful movie .. one of the best movies for Jason :) Parker is a thief who has an unusual code. He doesn't steal from the poor and hurt innocent people. He is asked to join 4 other guys one of whom is related to a known mobster. They pull off the job flawlessly and Parker wants to part ways with them. But because he refused to join them for another job they try to kill him. They dispose of his body but someone finds him and he is still alive and takes him to the hospital. After recovering he sets out to get back at the ones who tried to kill him, another one of his codes. He learns where they are and poses as a wealthy Texan looking to buy a house. So he hires a Realtor, Leslie Rogers to show him around. He is actually trying to find out where they're holed up. And when he finds it, he sets out on his plan to get them. But when they learn he is alive, they contact the mobster to take care of him. So he sends a killer to take care of him.",Parker
198,ganapathy51,Failed to Grip,5,29 May 2013,"The screenplay could have been more thrilling with quite a few surprises which would have held the audiences at the corner of their seats and thus creating a feeling of ""what happens next?"". The film was rather narrated in a very dry manner and failed to impress unlike other crime stories. The movie as a whole lacked the flow of a storyline, actually the story seemed to begin only halfway through the film. The efforts of Jason Stathom and Jennifer Lopez went in vain. There's not much that u can hope, if you would like to watch this movie. The presence of some high profile actors, gripping background scores and screenplay with more suspense might have worked. The only highlight of the movie is the beautiful landscapes particularly that of the beach resort and everything around it is a treat to your eyes.",Parker
199,simpsonhb,Another version of the Hunter,6,11 October 2015,"Jason Statham does the best he can with a story told twice before.Lee Marvin killed it in Point Blank, and Mel Gibson was ?? in Payback.Jason does the best he can and if you like him (I do) or Seagal (again I do) then you will not be disappointed, but it is the action for both of these actors not the story. (See Point Blank for a version with depth). The action is as good as it always is in Jason's films - violent, fast, understandable, but overall the story is old without surprises'Jason's best was Transporter (for Action) and Revolver ( for plot) in my opinion. He could do with better story lines, but is as good as he can be. Watch it as I do as good old fashioned hokum and it is fine.",Parker
