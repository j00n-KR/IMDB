0,bkoganbing,Shooting Aborigines Down Like Game,8,7 August 2008,"The sad thing about Quigley Down Under is that had this been done thirty years earlier the film would have warranted a major release the way a John Wayne or a James Stewart western would have had. Personally when I look at Tom Selleck and the way he plays the title character, I think James Garner. Selleck plays Matthew Quigley in the same dry, laconic manner that Garner patented.This western is about as southwest as you can get without dealing with penguins and icebergs. Selleck has come to western Australia in answer to an advertisement by a local rancher requiring a skilled marksman with a rifle. He takes the three month voyage from San Francisco and arrives at Alan Rickman's local Ponderosa. Remember this is Australia, a place settled by convict labor. On Rickman's spread it's mostly Scotch and Irish. But Rickman's problem isn't with them, it's with the aborigines.Which brings us to why he wants Selleck's services with a long rifle. Essentially he wants Selleck to hunt them down and kill them at a distance, a bit of ethnic cleansing. Fighting Indians was up close and personal at times. But just shooting people down like game, rubs Selleck the wrong way. He tells Rickman no with vigor. And that vigorous no gets Selleck and Laura San Giacomo a woman not playing with a full deck beaten up and thrown out in the outback with no means of survival. Of course they survive and we learn a lot about San Giacomo. The reason for her insanity, it's more of a defense mechanism to keep out the world, because she's done something terrible that her conscience won't leave alone. It's a beautiful performance, probably the acting highlight of Quigley Down Under.Of course there's plenty of action to satisfy any western fan on any continent. Alan Rickman is an especially loathsome villain, he makes his Sheriff of Nottingham in Kevin Costner's Robin Hood film look like a Girl Scout.And the aborigines do learn to appreciate Selleck and the payback he exacts. They come through for him at critical times in the film.Tom Selleck is a perfectly cast western hero, the kind I used to spend Saturday afternoon's watching.",Quigley Down Under
1,Leofwine_draca,Routine Australian western with a few interesting elements in the story,5,8 February 2017,"QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER is a straightforward Australian western starring journeyman hero Tom Selleck as an American gunslinger who arrives in the rural outback in order to take a new job working for rich landowner Alan Rickman. Selleck's skill is with a super-powered rifle which can hit targets over 1,200 yards away.The problem with this film is its predictability. It's obvious from the outset that Rickman will be the stock villain of the piece and so it transpires. Rickman was going through a string of villainous turns after his appearance in DIE HARD in 1988 but is rather subdued in this film and was much better in the following year's ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES in a pure pantomime performance. He was the main reason I tuned in, anyway. Cult favourite Roger Ward plays a henchman alongside a young and ginger Ben Mendelsohn, a Hollywood treasure these days.Inevitably this film deals with racism in the treatment of Aborigines by the white settlers. The scenes with the Aboriginal characters are among the best in the movie and there are some pretty shocking violent moments in a film which otherwise has a TV movie feel to it. Selleck falls foul of the bad guys but you just know he'll get revenge come the stock climax. One interesting thing about the production is its depiction of mental illness, something that writers and producers usually shy away from, but it's handled quite sensitively here.",Quigley Down Under
2,SnoopyStyle,old fashion western,6,8 November 2015,"Sharpshooter Matt Quigley (Tom Selleck) travels from Wyoming to Western Australia hired by ranch baron Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman). He rescues Crazy Cora (Laura San Giacomo) from a bunch of rough men. She keeps calling him Roy. It turns out that the men work for Marston. Marston reveals that he needs Quigley to hunt down Aborigines which Quigley takes offense to. Quigley and Crazy Cora are left to die in the desert.This is an old fashion western out in the Australian outback. It's a bit too old fashion. Quigley is impossibly good especially for a gunslinger. What did he think he was going to do in Australia? For a man who shoots for a living, he objects to the job too quickly. He should at least shoot somebody first. Maybe Marston's men try to kill him for the gold in the Outback. Maybe he refuses to kill the children. These are the nuances this movie needs. Selleck is playing too much of a hero and too simple. He lacks the complex characteristics to filled the big screen.",Quigley Down Under
3,classicsoncall,"""You got one shot left in that shooter, make the most of it.""",8,8 July 2006,"Up till now I've avoided Tom Selleck's Westerns, and really with no good reason. I was genuinely surprised at the characterization he gave to Matthew Quigley, a transplanted Wyoming cowboy answering an ad for a job in Australia. But let me get this straight, his intended employer wanted him to KILL native aborigines. Not relocate them, scare them away, or find a way to civilize them into the nineteenth century. He wanted Quigley to KILL them! Now it's not like land owner Marston (Alan Rickman) would ever need even a part of the entire desert landscape he owned that took more than a few days to ride across. Marston is simply an evil person who deserved his initial trouncing by Quigley, thus setting up the eventual final showdown.The early appearance by Crazy Cora (Laura San Giacomo) makes one wonder what her eventual role in the film might be, and it turns out to be a good one. Cora delights in calling Quigley 'Roy' for no apparent reason, but her looniness just might have a purpose. That scene in the desert cave against the dingoes was scary enough to complement a decent horror flick, made all the more horrific by actually being believable. When the moonlight hits those canine eyes, the resultant reflection makes you jump with anticipation.In it's own way, perhaps the real star of the film is Quigley's lever action breech loading Sharps rifle. Now the experts can have their say, but here's what this layman's takeaway is. When Quigley first demonstrates his ability with the weapon, he mentions that it's range for accuracy is about three thousand feet. Always one to question numbers thrown around in any context, a quick mental calculation pegs that at a fair range OVER half a mile. Today while on a flat stretch of highway I fixed my gaze on a location I deemed to be about a half mile away, and believe me, if there was a wooden bucket on the side of the road I would never be able to see it. However with an open mind, I'm open to referrals and demonstrations.At least 'Quigley' prompts me to seek out some of Selleck's other Western fare since his story here is suitably impressive for a 'spirit warrior'. And wouldn't you know it, Laura San Giacomo would find steady work in a comedy TV sitcom almost a decade later in a show ironically titled ""Just Shoot Me"".",Quigley Down Under
4,gavin6942,One of the Better Australian Westerns,6,17 August 2009,"Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) sails three months to Australia to fill a role as a sharpshooter. But once he finds out that he's been hired to kill off the aborigine population, Quigley turns on his new boss (Alan Rickman) and brings his own particular brand of justice to the outback.Alan Rickman makes this movie, hands down. Selleck is fine, but Rickman's voice and mannerisms make him the perfect villain. It's no shock he was given such a prominently dark role in the Harry Potter films or presented as the voice of God in ""Dogma"". I'm not so sure about ""Space Quest"" (not a fan), but Rickman is the man you want in your film, along with Gary Oldman. Together they would be an unstoppable force, stronger than Pacino and DeNiro.The biggest complaint is that this film should have been maybe twenty minutes shorter... the end drags on for some time. Okay, so you have thugs attacking you and you're a sharpshooter. I get it. Stop these endless skirmishes and just kill the bad guy. Please.Those who love Tom Selleck and his mustache should watch this film, perhaps as a double feature with ""Gypsy Warrior"". But even those who don't particularly care for Selleck may enjoy Rickman's performance as the evil thug master. Aside from his weird snarl, he easily steals the show.",Quigley Down Under
5,ccthemovieman-1,"A Memorable Western, Eh Mate?",8,14 April 2006,"This is a bit a twist: a western in which the setting is Australia, not the United States. Yet, the film features two American characters, played by Tom Selleck and Laura San Giacomo. It's a simple, well-done revenge story with a nice slow-developing romance as the subplot. Meanhile, Alan Rickman, who was good at this sort of thing, plays the hated, despicable villain.The movie is appealing because it has a good mixture of action (and that is mixed, too, not just the same kind of fistfights or gun battles), romance, nice scenery and a little comedy thrown in. There's also a little PC thrown in as the good guys help out the downtrodden Aborigines, victims of racism by Rickman and his henchmen. Warning: this a rough film in parts with a couple of harrowing scenes, such as people being pushed off cliffs, Selleck brutally beaten several times and wild vicious dingoes threatening San Giacamo and a little baby, but the action never goes on too long.All in all, I found it one of the more memorable westerns I've watched. If for nothing else, the awesome sound of Selleck's Sharp Calibre .44 rifle makes this film hard to forget.",Quigley Down Under
6,rmax304823,Entertaining Western.,6,17 August 2015,"Alan Rickman, a British actor of considerable talent, was so effective as the toothy, treacherous villain in ""Die Hard"" that he gets to play the same role here. This time he owns a huge ranch in Australia, has convict laborers, a gang of henchman, and bothersome Australian Aborigines who butcher an occasional cow. They're savages all right, just like the Comanche, but they're smart enough to stay just out of rifle range.Rickman is clever. None of these sneering, ruthless villains is ever truly stupid. He hires Matt Quigley, Tom Selleck, as an exterminator, although Selleck didn't know what the job entails. Selleck simply is the best long-distance shooter in the world and has a long, heavy, modified Sharps carbine to prove it. Why, with his supercharged cartridges and his complicated sighting mechanism, he can shoot holes in objects that are so far away that they're beyond the curve of the horizon.But when Rickman reveals the mission for which Selleck was hired -- namely killing every black man, woman, and child in sight -- he wordlessly scowls and throws Rickman through the dining room window. Now, Selleck is an engaging, lightweight actor, but this part -- the taciturn man of principle with unimaginable skills -- belongs to John Wayne.Rickman has his goons beat hell out of Selleck. They throw in a beating for Laura San Giacomo, who is there only to prove that Selleck is heterosexual. The two unconscious good people are taken by wagon a day's drive from the ranch and dumped to starve and die of thirst. The last of the two ruffians who have transported San Giacomo and Selleck makes the mistake of getting too close to Tom and bringing that big Sharps rifle. One hooligan down, by force of hidden knife. The other takes off at full speed in the wagon, while Selleck spends an agonizing minute or two getting himself together, loading the rifle, taking aim, almost passing out, and finally firing at a target so far away that it shimmers in the heat, like Omar Sheriff riding out the desert on his camel. Does Selleck hit his mark? Right through the head.There follows a drawn-out intermittent battle between Selleck and the girl, on the one hand, and Rickman and his snarling gang on the other. At one point, Selleck and San Giacomo fall exhausted into the dust, dying. They are rescued by Aborigines who apparently have the same spiritual healing power as the American Indians.The Aborigines have made Selleck and his rifle into an icon because he's protecting them from the predations of Rickman's men. Knowing this, Rickman baits a trap for Selleck by herding dozens of Aborigines to the edge of a cliff and kicking them off to their deaths, in hopes that Selleck will show up to rescue them. I realize this is so brutal that it sounds like a contrivance but it isn't. Check the fate of the aborigines in Tasmania, the ones who didn't survive to be kidnapped and transplanted to Flinder's Island, the ones who were rounded up and shot like animals in an attempt to exterminate them.Well -- why go on. I always get a kick out of a story about a man with almost superhuman skills. I identify with him because I have so many superhuman skills myself. And when Selleck's rocket-powered bullets hit those distant targets, there is a loud WHAP, the victim is yanked from his horse, and is dead before he hits the ground. Of course the bad guys do a lot of shooting too but they always miss.I don't think I need to tell you how it ends. Guess.",Quigley Down Under
7,michaelRokeefe,Resurgence of the good western movies.,8,13 September 2016,"Matt Quigley (Tom Selleck) is a former buffalo hunter from Wyoming looking for a fresh start from regretting starving out American Indians. His guilt leads him to taking a job offer from an Australian rancher named Elliott Marston (Alan Rickman), who wants a sharp shooter to kill dingoes on his property at a distance. Before Matt can put his replica Buffalo Rifle to good use, he discovers Marston's real targets are the Australian Aborigines. After Quigley refuses the mean-spirited rancher, he is left for dead in the outback, where he rescues the fetching Crazy Cora (Laura San Giacomo), who insists in calling him Roy. Matt's only fault is always doing the ""right"" thing.Wonderful scenery of Down Under. Simon Wincer directs a story by John Hill that you can't help but stay interested in.

Other players include: Ron Haddrick, Tony Bonner, Ben Mendelsohn, Jerome Ehlers, William Zappa, Steve Dodds and Conor McDermottroe.",Quigley Down Under
8,hitchcockthelegend,Matthew Quigley: Sharps Shooter.,8,6 August 2011,"Quigley Down Under is directed by Simon Wincer and written by John Hill. It stars Tom Selleck, Laura San Giacomo and Alan Rickman. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by David Eggby. Plot sees Selleck as Matthew Quigley, a Wyoming cowboy and sharp shooting rifleman who answers an advertisement to go to Western Australia as a hired sharp shooter. If proving his worth, he's to work for Elliot Marston (Rickman), but when Marston outlines his sick reasons for hiring Quigley, the pair quickly become on a collision course that can only see one of them survive.It was written in the 1970s by John Hill, where it was hoped that Steve McQueen would take on the lead role, but with McQueen falling ill and Clint Eastwood allegedly passed over, the project sat on ice until 1990. In came Selleck and the film finally got made. Just about making back its money at the box office, Wincer's movie deserved far better than that. It's competition in the Western stakes in 1990 were Costner's beautiful and elegiac Dances With Wolves and the Brat Pack bravado of Young Guns II, both vastly different films from each other, and both considerably different from Quigley Down Under. If those two films contributed to the average response to the Selleck picture? I'm not completely sure, but viewing it now one tends to think that the 1990 audience just wasn't ready for such a delightfully old fashioned Oater, one that features a straight and simple narrative to tell its tale.It's safe to say that anyone after deep psychological aspects will not get that here. There's some serious themes in the story, such as the horrid genocide towards Aborigines, while the deft kicks at the British are fair enough even to a British guy such as myself. But in the main this is old time Western fare, where it may be as predictable as a horse doing toilet where it pleases, but it's fun, brisk, gorgeous to look at, and there's never a dull moment within. Wincer (Lonesome Dove) directs with assuredness and the trio of cast leads are great value. Selleck cuts an impressive figure of a tough guy high on principals and with a comedy glint in his eye, Rickman is suitably attired all in black and bang on form for sneering, cocksure, villainy, while Giacomo is pretty and works neatly alongside Selleck as a spunky, lively, sidekick type who carries along some sad emotional baggage.There appears to be quite some division amongst fans and critics as regards Poledouris' (Conan the Barbarian) score. Whilst I agree that it does at time veer close to being too boisterous, it sits well within the type of film the makers are going for. It carries with it a sort of Magnificent Seven flavouring, imbuing the story with a rightful sense of adventure. It also flows freely with Eggby's classical capturing of the Western Australian locations. Eggby (Mad Max/The Man From Snowy River) utilises the scope format on offer to deliver some truly gorgeous back drops, while the brown and yellow hues are most appealing to the eyes. Costuming and sets are spot on for period detail, and Quigley's Sharps Rifle is an absolute beast of a weapon. The simple structure and telegraphed nature of the story stops it from being a true classic of the genre. But it's got so much going for it and is high on rewatchability factor, to make Quigley Down Under (not the best of titles either) essential viewing for fans of old fashioned Westerns. 8.5/10",Quigley Down Under
9,lastliberal,Anyone who believes in magic is crazy.,6,4 November 2007,"I have a thing for Alan Rickman. I have loved him in everything I have seen him in and am certainly looking forward to Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. He does not ever disappoint, and he certainly didn't her in a film I have ignored up to now.I have to say that Tom Selleck and Laura San Giacomo were also interesting, though Selleck pretty much belongs in the western character he played. Giancomo was superb as a lass that was a couple of beers short of a six-pack, but you really couldn't blame her for why she was off.There is always a great deal of pleasure in a movie when the racist jerks get what they deserve.",Quigley Down Under
10,zardoz-13,"""Tom Horn"" goes to Australia!",7,25 June 2011,"Emmy award winning ""Lonesome Dove"" director Simon Wincer teamed up with ""Magnum, P.I."" star Tom Selleck to make three westerns. ""Quigley Down Under"" was the first of their collaborations. ""The Crossfire Trail"" (2001) was their second, and ""Monte Walsh"" constituted their third outing. These two sagebrushers were made-for-TV, while ""Quigley Down Under"" was a big-screen, theatrical release. This overrated but entertaining oater set in scenic Australia follows a rugged Wyoming cowboy who is a crack shot with a Sharps lever-action Buffalo rifle. The eponymous protagonist has crossed the Pacific Ocean in a sailing ship to help a rancher eliminate predatory dogs gnawing away at his livestock. At least, this is what Quigley is led to believe when he shows up at the sprawling ranch of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman of ""Die Hard"") who has hired him primarily to slaughter the native Indigenous Aborigines. As it turns out, Quigley (Tom Selleck of ""The Shadow Riders"") doesn't share Marston's racist sentiments. The two men tangle in a brawl on the first night that they meet,and Marston lets his men gang up on Quigley and beat him senseless. Although the setting is Australia, Wincer and ""Heartbeeps"" scenarist Joe Hill have appropriated every western cliché, so nothing really comes as a surprise in this predictable morality tale about good versus evil. An amiable if sometimes unsavory shoot'em up develops between Marston and Quigley. The body count goes into double-digits as Marston sends his men to kill Quigley. When our hero isn't swapping lead with the villains, Quigley gets involved in an amusing relationship with a prostitute named 'Crazy' Dora (Laura San Giacomo of ""Suicide Kings"") and she takes a shine to him. Indeed, she refers to him as Roy and this becomes a running joke throughout the action because they have never met. Basically, Quigley considers Dora an annoyance.Tom Selleck looks every inch the role of a frontiersman with his Buffalo Bill facial hair. Moreover, he decks himself out in chaps, suspenders, and a ten-gallon Stetson that virtually makes him look the spitting image of Steve McQueen from ""Tom Horn."" Mind you, ""Quigley Down Under"" surpasses ""Tom Horn"" because our hero is the sympathetic underdog who takes on an army of gunmen and never stops no matter what the odds. Instead of the U.S. Cavalry, Wincer gives up British redcoats riding Western Australian outback. Rather than redskins on the war path, we are given the equivalent: largely peaceful Aborigines. Marston's treatment of this ethnic group is nothing short of vicious. In one scene, Marston's riders drive several Aborigines to their deaths when they run them off a mountain cliff. The Aborigines die while Cora watches and Quigley loads up his long gun and begins picking off the riders. A furious Marston offers 50 pounds of gold to anybody who can take care of Quigley. Earlier, Marston's men had gotten the better of Quigley and had planned to deposit his unconscious body in the middle of the desert with Cora and let Mother Nature relieve them of Quigley. Our hero is far from dead when he is driven into the wilderness and awakens in the back of a wagon with Dora alongside him. Marston's men have brought along Quigley's rifle. According to Quigley, he can hit bull's eye from 900 yards out. Repeatedly, after Dora and he struggle to return to civilization, he must shoot two or three secondary villains.""Mad Max"" lenser David Eggsby captures the rugged splendor of the Australian outback. The most memorable thing about his Aussie oater is composer Basil Poledouris' fantastic score that has touches of Elmer Bernstein and Jerome Moross in its majestic theme. After a while, things get a little drawn out until the end when Marston's men get the drop on Mathew Quigley and it looks for certainty that he has met his match. Throughout ""Quigley Down Under,"" Marston and Quigley argue about guns. Quigley prefers rifles while Marston fancies himself as a Western gunslinger. The only surprise occurs in the concluding showdown where Quigley demonstrates his speed and accuracy with a firearm other than his Sharps. Rickman excels as a treacherous villain who hates the Aborigines. ""Quigley Down Under"" qualifies as a fun western with some violent moments.",Quigley Down Under
11,neil-476,Excellent and unusual Oz western,8,4 February 2014,"Sharpshooter Quigley travels to Australia to respond to a newspaper advert.

Having been dumped to die in the outback along with Crazy Cora, Quigley finally makes his way back to Marston's ranch for a showdown.This unusual Australian western benefits from a number of things. One, the setting is both unusual and enormously photogenic. Two, the film is always fun and engaging and has a number of excellent action sequences and some terrific lines of dialogue.

12,HotToastyRag,Cute adventure comedy,6,20 June 2019,"Tom Selleck stars as a sharpshooter in this adventure western that brings a comic slant to the Australian Outback. When he's hired by Alan Rickman to come to Australia, he thinks it'll be just another job. When he teams up with the wild Laura San Giacomo, who's given a Southern accent rather than an Australian one, nothing goes according to plan. Amidst violence and narrowly squeaking past dangerous situations, there's a bit of romance, since it's Laura San Giacomo. It doesn't matter that they didn't like each other in the beginning; when they're all alone in the middle of the Outback with no other company, they might change their minds.If you like adventure movies with lots of jokes and tongue-in-cheek acting styles, like Silverado and Indiana Jones, you'll probably like this one.

Laura San Giacomo is also on hand as Crazy Cora.""Quigley Down Under"" (1990) is a Western taking place in the desert wilderness of Australia. The title suggests that Quigley was meant to be a Western character in the manner of Indiana Jones with sequels of him visiting other continents, such as ""Quigley in Africa,"" ""Quigley in South America"" and so on. Unfortunately, its lack of success at the box office put the kibosh on that.It's not as goofy as some of the Indiana Jones yarns and I appreciated the realistic vibe behind the typical hero shenanigans. For instance, we know personal hygiene wasn't the best in the late 1800s and, especially, in dry areas of the Old West and most of Australia where washing clothes was infrequent; ""Quigley Down Under"" shows this reality.Selleck of course makes for a great Western protagonist, likewise Rickman as the odious antagonist. Meanwhile petite Laura San Giacomo is an amusing spitfire.

15,Mr-Fusion,Definitely one of the better modern Westerns,7,8 May 2013,"""Quigley Down Under"" is one of those movies in which a few seemingly ill-fitting pieces come together and form a pleasing whole. Magnum P.I., Hans Gruber, and that chick from ""Pretty Woman"" in a Western? In Australia? What brand of voodoo is at work here?But it works, and as it turns out, it's a fine movie. This is partially due to casting, with Selleck riding comfortably in the saddle as the self-assured title character, Alan Rickman as the sinister Aborigine- hunting smug prick, and Laura San Giacomo who possesses her own daffy likability (which gives way to a very scarred character). But also partially the gorgeous (and well-shot) scenery, the sense of throwback to the really old Hollywood Westerns, and some pretty nice shootouts. It's a thrill to watch Selleck work that enormous Sharps rifle, and Basil Poledouris' heroic score is surprisingly remarkable (probably the most rousing use of the banjo I've ever heard).

Sometimes they make em look like something else. For example, Joss Whedon's Serendipity, an astonishing sci-fi film, and considered a true ""space western.""

When a film is really really really superb, a one of a kind, I am reluctant to give too much away (spoilers or no) for fear of depriving a future viewer just one moment of pleasure from the experience. So I will say this -- acting is awesome. Selleck was just beginning the transition from the boisterous TV character he was known for, to the quieter thoughtful type he would later portray in TV movies. Brilliant, engaging, fun. Rickman practically invented playing bad guys (see Die Hard) and San Giacomo, no spring chicken here, has to provide the romantic interest but, because of the story, is given only a few lines of dialogue at most to work with. And whatta tale. In my other reviews I have emphasized the importance of staging these stories the way you would build a wedding cake, one layer at a time. And the story is perfection. It builds and builds and builds. In the best Jimmy Stewart tradition, Selleck keeps trying to avoid trouble, and only gets in deeper. The ending, the showdown, is superb and also dripping in irony.

The gentle romantic sub-plot helps smooth the rough edges, and Selleck's ironic wit acts as a cushion to those sometimes gritty scenes wherein the action can get a bit rough.This film also lends a hand at showing the world that the Australian Aboriginies were (and still are) treated pretty much the same as the Native Americans were.I enjoyed this one, though there are Westerns out there I like more, but this has a great deal of original creativity, which makes it a must see for fans of the American western, regardless of the fact that this is set in Australia.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Quigley Down Under

An American, Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) answers his advertisement, believing he is to hunt and kill the wild dogs called 'Dingos' Quigley arrives, but is uninterested when Marston explains his job is to murder the native peoples. Confrontation explodes as Marston is thrashed out of his own house and Quigley is badly assaulted and left to die in the vast outback of Australia. With him is 'Crazy' Cora, a female convicted of murdering her own child, now a common prostitute. Among the many obstacles Quigley must contend with aside from Cora, are the wild animals, the immense untamed and often uncharted territory and British Major Ashley-Pitt (Chris Haywood) who reminds him that 'Americans are uncouth misfits'. Learning Quigley is not dead but has sent word, that Marston's days are numbered, Marston put a bounty on his head and offers $1,000 pounds to the man who kills the individual, whom the Natives call, 'The Spirit Warrior.' Now it becomes a test of wills between the powerful land baron and the American who doesn't carry a side arm. The conflict is not a new one, but the battle between right and wrong is foremost and the actors are all to be commended for the success of this incredible film. Highly Recommended for all audiences. ****",Quigley Down Under
22,XweAponX,Excellent Cinematography,10,15 April 2010,"Great mostly due to the incredible scenery, Tom Selleck stands up with veteran films actors like Alan Rickman and Laura San Giacomo and holds his own. His Magnum PI Style mixed with a small amount of ""Robert Mitchum competence"" gives him a bit of flair, and contrast to the Australian actors.The feel of this film is that of a big-time Hollywood western, this is about as far west as one can get. Along with the familiar horses and guns, there are also dingos and kangaroos. Instead of Native Americans, there are Native Australians, and there is as much of a parallel here as there is with the western United States. Alan Rickman is the quintessential bloated bad-guy.The score by Basil Poledouris is very ""Magnificent Sevenish"" - You can hear strains of Quigly is Basil's other work, like Starship Troopers- Actually, a LOT of Quigly's themes were reproduced in Starship Troopers, but this is why I liked Composers like Alfred Hitchcocks Bernard Herrman and Sergio Leone's Ennio Merricone.The director of Lonesome Dove Simon Wincer sells the story, written by novelist John Hill...And all of Australia is the set.Favourite quote from the film is ""Got no use for a Colt, never said I couldn't use one"". One very pleasant moment in the film is where Quigley makes a very Clint-Eastwoodish/Josey Wales gesture by spitting on the ground- Watch for that.",Quigley Down Under

26,barnabyrudge,"Routinely plotted western, boosted by an unusual locale.",5,10 August 2007,"A most curious film to have emerged in the 1990s, Quigley Down Under is an interestingly relocated western which passes a couple of hours harmlessly enough. While the setting is rather unusual for the genre, the story itself sticks generally to formula. In fact, rumours abound that the script had been in existence for the best part of 20 years - originally the film was planned as a Steve McQueen vehicle in the early '70s but for one reason or another never got made. One suspects that the script was hardly changed when the project got the green light in 1990.In the 1860s sharpshooter Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) leaves his home in Wyoming and makes the long voyage to Australia. He is in search of a job and makes the journey in response to an advert placed by a sheep rancher and land baron in the Outback. Upon arriving at the remote home of his new employer Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), Quigley is shocked to discover that he has been hired to use his long range rifle to wipe out Aborigines in the area. Viewing the work as nothing more than genocide, Quigley refuses to have any part in Marston's dirty scheme. Enraged, Marston has Quigley tied to a crazy woman, ""Crazy"" Cora (Laura San Giacomo), and exiles the pair of them in the wilderness where they are left to die. Quigley and Cora begin a long and arduous trek through the wilderness, attempting to survive against the hostile environment and its many hazards. After various adventures they make it back to civilisation, where Quigley quickly sets about having his revenge against the ruthless Marston.Despite the agreeable freshness of the locale, Quigley Down Under remains a very routine western with all the usual elements present and correct. The plot is a barely disguised revenge story of a type seen many times before (Blood On The Moon? The Bravados? Hang 'Em High?) Selleck plays the hero quite well, handling danger with the sort of laid-back resourcefulness that Hollywood demands of its traditional good guys. But the film mainly belongs to Rickman, delivering the bad guy routine with lip-smacking relish while acting his co-stars off the screen. Basil Poledouris adds another rousing score to his oeuvre, and David Eggby's excellent photography captures the vast empty landscapes very effectively. But there's nothing in the story to set it apart from a thousand other genre potboilers, and it's this lack of invention that ultimately hurts the film. Watching Quigley Down Under is not in any way an onerous challenge, but once you've seen it it's hard to think of many reasons that make it worth watching again.",Quigley Down Under

28,Samiam3,A reasonable Western from the other side of the world,7,10 October 2009,"You ever heard of a Western in the East?. Quigley Down Under takes us to a corner of the world that is about as far as you can get from where Westerns are traditionally set. When the opening credits kick off, we are in Colorado. When they end, we are on the coast of Western Australia. The one taking the journey is Mathew Quigley, a renowned sharp shooter who has been hired by cattle rancher Elliot Marsten to help take care of a dingo problem. On the evening of his arrival at the Marstn ranch, Quigley finds out that he was hired in a lie. It is not dingos that Marsten wants dead, his real intentions have to do with his grudge against the local aboriginals. Embarrassed and infuriated, Quiqly declines the offer quite blatantly, (and by blatantly I mean with physical means) Marsten orders his goons to dump Quigly in the middle of the desert and let the heat kill him. With the help of the Aboriginals, he survives and he teams up with them to fight Marsten. Also on Quigley's side, is a bizarre little woman called Cora who has followed him all the way from the docks thinking that Quigley is her long lost love (she addresses him as Roy)Quigley Down Under manages to be a stable entertainment, but it is not without problem. The plot is schematic and uninventive, and some parts are not properly thought out. Cora in particular, is a clumsy creation. Her character motivation is so poorly presented that when I first saw the movie, I didn't know whether I was supposed to think she was crazy or selfish, or just dumb. The truth about Cora is revealed a little too late in the story. As a villain, Marston is close to cardboard, and there is no great sense of menace to him, but Alan Rickman as an actor is smart enough to do him a little justice. As for Quigley, he's just a cowboy and Tom Selleck is just a cowboy actor, so there is no major problem there.I wouldn't say that this is a memorable film, but it is not every day that you see a western in Australia, and it does make a difference. Just because the story is six thousand miles from America, doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching if Western is your kind of genre. It offers everything one would expect from a western, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more.",Quigley Down Under
29,aimless-46,Solid Acting - Weak Story - Pacing Problems,5,3 October 2007,"1990's ""Quigley Down Under"" is basically a western parody of ""Die Hard"" (1988) , so if you liked ""Die Hard"", then you are this film's target audience. I would have liked it a lot better if I was sure that it was an intentional parody but I suspect that the director blundered around with little focus during production and the parody elements just came out accidentally; probably unrecognized by anyone but the editor. On the other hand, the fact that Alan Rickman simply reprises his Hans Gruber character lends support to the possibility that much of the parody stuff was intentional. If you view the film you will have plenty of time and mental energy to explore the intentional vs unintentional parody question because the running time is long and it drags in many spots. Also there is no effort to incorporate suspense into any of the story so you will rarely get so caught up in things that you lose the detached perspective of a viewer. Some mental energy is required to suspend disbelief at the extremely contrived story elements and implausible action, but this will only be necessary for reasonably intelligent viewers (fortunately they are the ones with enough functioning brain cells to expend the mental energy). ""Quigley Down Under"" stars Tom Selleck, as the title character-basically playing a gritty version of his Thomas Magnum character. Quigley is an American sharpshooter who goes to 19th century Australia in answer to an advertisement placed by a rancher named Marston ( Rickman). Things get very ""Joe Kidd"" (1972) at this point as Quigley has moral objections to his new job duties, exterminating (at long range) the local Aborigines who regularly rustle Marston's cattle. Of course there is no plausible reason for Marston needing a long-range rifleman for this activity (mounted men could easily catch a running Ab), but the less logical thinking you do while viewing this film the more you will like it. Quigley throws in with Crazy Cora, (Laura San Giacomo) a ditzy American with a tragic past. She really is crazy but gets better when they fall in love. I liked both their performances. Quigley is invincible against a sea of bad guys (the movie is simplistic good vs evil). The only times he gets overpowered is when someone sneaks up on him from behind and knocks him out. The director apparently thought the shock to the audience from the completely unexpected conking was worth losing any suspense factor from the stalking-it wasn't. Any suspense anywhere would have been a welcome ingredient. Also bleeding out any suspense is a tendency to have the bad guys pontificate endlessly when they have the drop on the hero. The problem is that the outcome of such a scene is a foregone conclusion and the speechmaking just makes you tired. Finally there is an overworked tendency for the bad guys to try one final trick after they appear to surrender. Which rapidly gets old, lame, and stupid because it is entirely predictable. Again, they don't set these up to build suspense; instead the action comes out of nowhere; substituting a shock factor for a suspense factor. But it doesn't shock. The good acting and production design is wasted. If only the producers had expended a few more resources in pre-production to make the film smarter and more original. And then done some major trimming in post-production to pick up the pacing. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Quigley Down Under
30,winner55,grand traditional Western!,10,23 January 2009,"The low scoring of this movie at IMDb only reminds us: It wasn't the traditional Western that exhausted itself in the later 1960s/ early 1970s, it was the audience.This is an old-school traditional Western that happens to be set in Australia. The story, cinematography, music, pacing, characterizations, dialog, all are reminiscent of those we came to expect from Hawks, Hathaway, Sturgis. Yet there is no attempt to slavishly imitate the work of such past masters of the genre, but to add to the genre using a cinema vocabulary they would easily have recognized and appreciated.It's quite alright to say, 'traditional Westerns are not my cup or tea,' but it is not appropriate to slam a genre film for being true to its genre. And this sweeping adventure story is so true to its genre, if one didn't know when this was made or who these actors were, one could easily think it a product of the late 1950s or early 1960s, the last golden age of the traditional Western, the era of Rio Bravo, the Magnificent Seven, The Sons of Katie Elder, The River of No Return. While not strictly realistic, it presents a world that is three dimensionally realized - The heat is real, the wind is real, the old houses look like they've been standing for years, the people inhabiting this world are flesh and blood.One can easily imagine John Wayne speaking Tom Selleck's lines, but Selleck does an admirable job speaking them, and finds his own voice doing so. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Since this is a traditional Western, some of the actors are stuck playing stereotypes, but as did their '50s-'60s counterparts, they work hard to bring these alive, to add the quirks that give them individuality, enough so to move the story along in fine dramatic fashion.And I think it a fine genre story, filled with wonder, suspense, thrills, drama, romance, humor. Pretty much the 'complete package' we came to expect Westerns to deliver back in their last golden age.We often say, ""they don't make them like they used to."" Well, here! They did it! They made one like they used to! Instead of complaining we should celebrate.",Quigley Down Under

He is the backbone of this movie, making the PC nature a little more palatable. A less actor would come off as preachy or dull. His antagonist is none other than Alan Rickman who always brings depth to villains. His character is underwritten, but Alan matches Tom in presence. Laura San Giacomo receives good reviews for this movie, but she annoys me. There is something fake about her smile to me. She is a convincing wacko though. The score soars thanks to Basil Poledouris who should be more famous. His work brings the movie to life such as after Quigley is dumped in the desert for dead. I love the piece of music that plays as Quigley prepares to fire on his dwindling target.

With modern styling, this will grow on you if Westerns haven't been your brand. It deserves high merits for top-notch costuming, make-up, and scenery that gets all dusty and brown. Acting is extremely well done, considering the late stage it's in. ""Crazy Cora"" is a cheerful rendition to lady-pokes everywhere in Western cinema, and one who keeps calling ""Roy"" all the time, plus Tom Selleck shows us what a true cowboy should be like. The orchestrated music will stick to your mind in years to come. One familiar old problem that Westerns would normally have is being more like the rest of them, but then again, this film provides testimony that there is great need of reviving the Western genre, which would still be hard to appease today.

There really isn't enough I can say about Alan Rickman!  He always plays the perfect antagonist! Maybe it's his voice, maybe it's the way he acts, I'm not sure, but all I know is that he is a great actor!  Laura San Giacomo does a good job in the film too.  Her character was a very strange one put in the film, but there is a reason for her strangeness.

The piles of dung that receive nines and tens are absurd. I can only think of a mere handful of movies worthy of that sort of praise, and they're thrown around on here like confetti at a wedding. Anyway, this is no 10, 9, 8 or even 7, which isn't to say there are some genuinely enjoyable moments throughout. The Australian vistas and landscapes are stunning-wish we got more of them. The production is top notch, and the era the film is set in seems adequately captured. The sailing ship at the beginning was absolutely beautiful. This film needed more Alan screen time, and a lot less Laura screen time. She was definitly a rather annoying distraction, yet still eye candy in a way. I like her, but she was miscast here. I think her whole character was completely unnecessary, actually. Just my take. She really added nothing worthwhile to the script other than a pretty smile. There's a fine line portraying someone as bit slow/nuts and outright dumber than wood. She ended up being wooden to a fault. Plus her ""condition"", never fully explained, came and went at will it seems. The aboriginals were portrayed in typical Hollywood fashion, but had an authenticity and manner that was one hundred percent believable. The problem I had with this movie was it's tendency to slip into farcical slapstick, complete with Keystone Cops music and everything. All this managed to do was remind the viewer that it was only a movie, and didn't let me get immersed into a plot was really rather gripping in concept. Of course there's the ever present plot holes and eye rolling yeah right that would never happen stuff which is to be expected. Tom Selleck. Forever Magnum. Here he was Magnum on a horse rather than a Ferrari. I realize it's not his fault he's type-cast forever, but it's impossible for me to watch anything with him in it and not see Magnum. That's probably a fault of mine but can't be helped. Drags in the middle, and I mean drags and drags. It's good enough for what it is I suppose, but falls short of it was striving to be I'm sure. But the majority of the viewing public eats this stuff up like cake, so I think in that regard it was successful. If it appeals to the masses it has to be dumbed down a degree, and directors know that. After all they're in it to make money, not please everyone. More discerning viewers will recognize that as the average dramedy it is. Normally this would get a 5 for plot, cinematography, Alan's acting and Laura's beauty. But sometimes a rating needs to balance out the ludicrous and unwarranted praise heoped upon such contrived titles with ham fisted directing.",Quigley Down Under
40,dimplet,Why don't Australians watch Quigley Down Under?,9,7 October 2011,"Quigley Down Under has one of the most descriptive, poetic opening scenes under the credits since Hitchcock's Rear Window. Without saying a word, we are told who this fellow is, and where he's going. The oddly metered music by Basil Pouledouris gives the story an other-worldly feel. We soon see the hallmarks of colonial Australia, convicts in chains, soldiers, a rag tag assortment of British frontier characters and whores. A fight soon breaks out, as though a natural extension of macho Australian manhood. I have asked several Australians what they thought of this film, and not a single one had heard of it. It has an Australian director, Simon Wincer, but the stars are American and British, and Selleck, the American cowboy, is clearly the hero. Could it be that the Aussies are a might touchy about the portrayal?Having seen some wildly distorted, negative portrayals of America by foreign directors and writers that foreigners seem to take as gospel truth, (examples: The Patriot, starring Aussie Mel Gibson and directed by German Roland Emmerich; Cold Mountain, directed by Anthony Minghella and starring Jude Law, both Brits) it is interesting to see the shoe on the other foot. I can assure you that I do not assume that all Australians are like Alan Rickman's sadistic, racist character, or were, historically. As a reasonably intelligent adult, I view Quigley as entertainment, not a documentary, and I do not assume it is an accurate portrayal, then or now, beyond what I know, otherwise, of history. What Quigley is, is entertaining. I read Hal Hinson's scathing review in the Washington Post with some bemusement. These reviewers have to write at the moment of release. With the hindsight of two decades and several viewings, I can attest that Quigley is a well-crafted, entertaining movie. The acting by Selleck, Rickman and Laura San Giacomo is outstanding. Rickman plays one of the most deliciously snide villains since James Mason in North By Northwest or Frank Langella in Dave. San Giacomo proves her chops in an emotionally intense, complex role. We see a real chemistry between her and Selleck develop. The impression of Australia I come away with from this movie is how beautiful the enormous outback is. It is a positive impression. I don't judge a country by a fictional movie, and even if some of it is true, it is ancient history, and not relevant to judging the Australians today. What is true, is the Sharps buffalo rifle really existed.Sure, Quigley is a variation of the American Western set in Australia, one of the few places you can transplant the genre to, believably. The essence of the Western is the lone individual pitted against the bad guys and a hostile countryside. It is a test of character. As such, Quigley is an excellent, creative addition to the opus of Westerns. And it shows that Australia and America have something in common, historically. Ultimately, the movie is uplifting, espousing justice and appreciation for the aborigines. There is goodness in the world, including among the white Australians. While there are good guys and bad guys, you do not feel manipulated by simplistic stereotypes. At the time, some were skeptical of Tom Selleck as an actor. I think he has since proved himself to be a first-rate actor, not just a pretty face, and Quigley is proof of that. But his 2003 performance in Monte Walsh, also directed by Wincer, shows greater depth and maturity as an actor. Roger Ebert says the story is weak, which I find odd. There are plenty of novel, interesting twists. Try comparing this to Avatar, which has some similar elements, particularly the appreciation for protecting an indigenous culture. Take away the special effects of Avatar, and what is left is relatively weak, forgettable story and dialogue, though it is still good enough. Quigley, by comparison, has nothing to apologize for.The bottom line: Quigley Down Under is a fun, beautiful, entertaining movie you can watch many times over the years.",Quigley Down Under

Tom Selleck, in my opinion, was born a couple of decades late. It's too bad the romance with westerns has passed on, since Selleck could have easily been a contemporary of The Duke. His easy-going, ""down home"" style and charm work well in the western genre, and with the exception of Robert Duvall and Sam Elliot, I can't think of another star who fits the ""cowboy"" persona better. Well, maybe Eastwood.Laura San Giacomo works beautifully as the films female love interest and comedy relief, since neither Rickman or Selleck offer us much in that way. She gives us her story in brief episodes, the returns to the ""Crazy Cora"" persona long enough to convince us it isn't all an act. Or is it? Alan Rickman plays what he plays best, an arrogant ass with money and power who enjoys pulling the wings off butterflies when he isn't shooting down people for the fun of it. He uses money as his weapon, and indulges himself whenever possible. Since most of his men are conscripts from the local prison, Marston is of the belief he is untouchable.The aborigines have no lines in English, and are pretty much the window dressing of the film, although there are some interesting scenes where Selleck and the aborigines interact.Overall, the film has plenty of flaws and lapses, but they are easy to look past when you watch the action scenes. And neither Selleck for the ladies or San Giacomo for the gentlemen are that hard to look at. Rated PG-13 for violence and sexual innuendo, the teens in the house will have no problem with the plot and the adults will enjoy the various quibbles between the principles. Not sure if this is all that collectible, but I have a copy. Like I said, I like westerns, and I like Selleck.",Quigley Down Under
46,merrywood,A Latter Day Diamond Among Westerns,8,10 October 1999,"It's stunning to finally see a great western made decades after the fading of the era of American Westerns, beloved throughout the world.
Everything is in place here, despite the underrating by some smug critics who do not really understand the soul of the genre.Supporting player Laura San Giacomo is lovely and a most wonderful performer.  Tom Selleck, here, matches and often surpasses the best stars of our Western era in every way.   As a Western Star, for example, he is better looking than John Wayne, more personable, warmer than Gary Cooper and equally effective in his heroic portrayal.For those who love the genre, this is a keeper.",Quigley Down Under
47,extravaluejotter,"Oh Magnum, what have you done?",1,29 January 2006,"I can't believe that this film has an average rating. Poor Tom Selleck smiles grimly as he stars in this predictable plod through cliché, stereotype and mawkish sentimentality.Laura San Giacommo's character is as 2-dimensional as the paper the script was written on. She tries to compensate for this by overacting wildly, which only makes her character less appealing. In the scene where Cora collapses in the outback, Quigley retrieves the cartridge belt that she was carrying for him then walks off, stops, looks pained and goes back to pick her up. I was willing Quigley to just carry on walking after he'd got his cartridge belt and leave the annoying shouty woman to the dingos.Alan Rickman has the sole entertaining role in this movie, playing a thoroughly unpleasant rancher. Unfortunately, he's only on screen for about 15 minutes! Everyone apart from Quigley gets a rough deal in this film. The Irish and Scottish ex-convicts are all mercenary scum, The English are all ruthless imperialists and the Aborigines are all little ""Noble Savage"" cut-outs.By the way, I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure that a perfectly circular 3-inch grouping at 900 yards is impossible, whatever rifle you have in your hands. Trying to hit a bucket at about 300 yards is roughly the equivalent of trying to shoot the head off a match at 10 yards. I suppose that's possible if you have a modern sniper rifle with a telescopic sight and a bipod...You should have ditched ""Magnum"" and gone for ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", Tom.",Quigley Down Under
48,cutter-12,You sure look pretty in the morning sun.,8,31 October 2001,"Underseen western which , after a few theatrical misfires (though I also enjoyed him in High Road to China), gave Tom Selleck a role which suited him perfectly.  A role which, as a previous comment stated, John Wayne would have been right at home in.  It can be argued that this is just a politically correct revisionist western wherein the American witnesses injustices on aborginals in a foreign land and is outraged to action despite the utter mistreatment of native Indians during this same period back home. Some may say it is so, but I prefer to think of Quigley as a man who came to Australia BECAUSE of the injustices he's known back home and is looking perhaps for something better.  Selleck represents, as did John Wayne, the decent and noble side of America, and there is no doubt that this is a man given to stand up and do the right thing no matter where he is, Wyoming or Fremantle.This aside, Quigley succeeds most as a light romance amidst the traditional shoot em up scenario.  In fact, the love story is what drives it along most and provides it's most special moments.  During a heartfelt speech beside the campfire, Cora relates how heartbreaking it was for her to have her Husband Roy, who blamed her for the death of their child, put her on a ship to Australia and walk away from her life not looking back.  This is what matters to her most, as it matters to Quigley that she call him by his right name or he won't share his bed.  When presented with their first parting, Quigley leaves Cora and the Aborigine baby in the cave and though assuring her he will return for her he rides away, without stopping to look back.This is mere oversight on his part and it leads to the most moving scene in the film, one which never fails to bring a tear to my eye - when they are again about to be parted she asks him ""I'll never see you again, Will I"". He can't say because of what's ahead for him, but he puts his hand on her cheek and says ""You sure look pretty in the morning sun"".  As he mounts his horse and rides off Cora watches after him  wondering, as we are wondering, if he'll stop and look back.  And then he does.  It's one of the most thoughtful and emotionally fleeting moments in movie history.  Too bad it hasn't been seen and appreciated by more people.  The musical score, by Basil Poledouris, is also a treat and it hits all the right notes.  His score for Conan the Barbarian is an acknowledged classic but here I think he goes a step better.  It truly is a nice piece of music to hear amid the action and quieter moments.Quigley is a very good modern day western.  It won't fail to entertain and it must surely be a film which both men and women can enjoy together. If they made more of these kinds of movies I definitely wouldn't complain.",Quigley Down Under
49,flimbuff,A PASSABLE WESTERN,5,27 April 2002,Not the worst you will see and Seleck is watchable and pleasant as usual.

50,Mickey-2,An American marksman goes to the land down under for a job which turns out to be something he was not quite expecting.,9,4 March 2006,"""Quigley Down Under"" is the story of an American marksman who takes a job in the land down under, Australia, at the bequest of one of the local land barons. With his saddle and custom-made rifle in hand, Quigley lands in the land of Australia, gets entangled with one of the local ""ladies in waiting"", and ends up with a complete distaste for the reason he answered the want ad in the first place. Quigley played by Tom Selleck, thought he was being hired to exterminate the local wildlife from the cattle ranch of Elliott Marston, deviously played by Alan Rickman. Marston makes it clear that Quigley's job is to hunt down and terminate the local natives of Australia, the aborigines, whom he considers a nuisance. That prospect sickens Quigley, he and Marston have a falling-out, and Quigley winds up on the Australian wild lands, beaten-up, no water, and a half-loco lady, who keeps calling him by another name.Selleck is able to give the role a fantastic reason for watching the film over several times, because it seems to fit him so well. He is a moral individual, who will do the job called for, as long as it is in no way a compromise of his own personal principles. Marston represents the complete opposite of those guidelines, and the two eventually end up in the confrontation that stamps movies of the western genre.Selleck and Rickman do very well in their parts, and Laura San Giacomo plays the loco lady that Quigley has to take under his arm, as if he does not have enough to deal with. The lands photograph well, and the tone is a film worth having in a person's own collection. Enjoy the trip to the Land Down Under, Mate!",Quigley Down Under
51,rollo_tomaso,Affable Australia-based oater,7,27 August 2000,"Although not especially intellectually stimulating, this eager-to-please Australian-set western is easy to enjoy on its own terms.  Selleck's hero, San Giacomo's heroine and Rickmian's sinister villain all mix perfectly in terms of chemistry.  The cinematography is both luxurious and creative, and the soundtrack is quite suitable.  When you wish to relax, Quigley Down Under offers terrific mind candy for the occasion.",Quigley Down Under
52,ericjg623,An overlooked gem,8,25 March 2002,"This movie isn't the best Western ever made, but it's a solid creative effort that brings out many of that genre's most appealing aspects. It has romance, gunplay, wonderful scenery, and, most importantly, a solid hero and a solid villain. Westerns are, by nature, a morality tale. There's a Good Guy and a Bad Guy, and in the end, the hero prevails through a combination of courage, fair play, and ingenuity. And that's exactly what happens here.
The three principal characters are Quigley, an American sharpshooter hired by an Australian rancher, Marsden, and Crazy Cora, a woman shipped off to Australia by her ex-husband after accidentally suffocating her baby to keep him quiet while hiding from raiding Comanches. Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an expert long range marksman who has been recruited ostensibly to shoot dingoes, but, as he finds out after his first night with Mr. Marsden (Alan Rickman), his real targets are to be local Aboriginies. This leads to a rather violent falling out between the two men, which sets up the basic conflict in the movie. Marsden wants Quigley dead, and has numerous ranchhands to get the job done. Quigley has the shooting skills that allow him to pick off Marden's men pretty much at will. An uncredited ""star"" of the film is Quigley's Sharp's .45 calibre rifle, a gun so accurate it can kill a man from nearly a mile away. Anyway, the movie proceeds in a more or less conventional fashion. After a big fistfight at Marsden's ranchhouse, Quigley and Cora are left for dead in the Australian outback. They are rescued by a band of Aboriginies, then quickly return the favor by picking off Marsden's men as they try to massacre more Aboriginies. Along the way, Quigley slowly falls for Cora. She may be nuts, but she's also charming, resourceful, brave, and beautiful.
In the end, Marsden gets what he deserves. Cora regains her sanity. And Quigley gets both the villain and the girl. Like I said, it's a Western in the classic tradition - well told and with great visuals.

53,seveb-25179,Magnum Down Under,7,31 October 2019,"Despite the unpromising title, this is a pretty decent Western (set so far West it's in West Australia).
Featuring some very ""confronting"" scenes of how badly the Aborigines were sometimes treated back in the day (I don't know enough about it to say how common this sort of atrocity was).
I venture to say more confronting than any equivalent American Indian depiction out of Hollywood has dared to be?
Fortunately in this case Tom Selleck is on hand to ""lay his vengeance upon them"" wrong doo-ers with the aid of his ""le long carabine"".
""Them"" being the always incomparably fiendish Alan Rickman and his crew of unwashed Australians' sporting various degrees of bad Irish accent.
Tom puts in another solid performance, although his American accent is perhaps to East Coast for a cowboy role and he could have done with adding a bit more Southern spice too it, like Laura did.
Laura San Giacomo is surprisingly good as the feisty love interest, although she and ""le long Tom"" make an strange pairing height wise.
Of course what little Laura lack in height she makes up for in other areas of her anatomy...
The Aboriginals are treated with respect and get to save the day for Tom, when the odds get a bit to long even for him.
As usual in Australian movies, the British are all obnoxious and one dimensional.

Like good SF, the setting in a western is sufficiently divorced from current day reality that its lessons are more easily assimilated.""Quigley"" is every inch a traditional western in most respects. Only in its setting, Australia, does it stray from its roots. Anyone who's read the synopsis or seen the trailers will know the basic plot - western sharpshooter Quigley is brought to Austraila by evil land baron. When Quigley arrives, he finds he's been imported for some particularly nasty blood work and that sets the dramatic events in morion.Tom Selleck is charming and personable as usual, even with the scruffy accouterments. Alan Rickman does his usually expert job of playing an amazingly 3-dimensional sociopathic villain. The weakest link in the cast is Laura San Giacomo, but that's largely the fault of the script and not her acting.In summary, if you like traditional westerns (or just like Tom Selleck, as my wife does), this is a film you should see.",Quigley Down Under
57,wlb,If you like the classic western you will like Quigley,8,28 June 2008,"It will surprise many Americans but Australia had a ""wild west"" like America. One can read up on Ned Kelly, for example.

And I have been to some deserts around the world. Kudos to the Aborigines for actually knowing how to survive in such a place.So, add this with a hero (Selleck) who comes from Wyoming answering a somewhat vague ad from our urbane villain (Alan Rickman) who is a station (ranch) owner in the outback. Rickman wants a sharpshooter for a job unspecified. When Selleck learns the true purpose for his hiring he decides to right some wrongs.It's a classic western of the solitary hero who stands up to evil and defeats it. The Sharps rifle is one of the stars, too.And to some of our reviewers who think this shooting is a bit unbelievable, there are a handful of people who can shoot some long distances with just iron sights.I have seen them.If you like westerns you will like Quigley.",Quigley Down Under

64,hondo551,My personal favorite of all of Selleck's movies,10,13 January 2006,"I have always loved and always will prefer a nineteenth century story of a man with a gun and a horse riding to destiny in search of justice. It may be set a few thousand miles or so farther west than normal, but Quigley Down Under quickly became and has remained my favorite Selleck film of all time. The story gets a little slow, or long, about half way through it, but when it picks up again it takes off like a racing stallion. Selleck is as charming as Quigley as he was in Magnum, P.I., with none of the occasional cloying silliness that was found in some of the Magnum shows. Selleck here is the embodiment of all great American western heroes; he is Duke Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Gary Cooper all rolled into one neat package and stamped with Selleck's personal charm and roguishness. It's the rousing story of a man hired to kill varmints who changes his mind when he finds out the varmints are Aborigenes, almost pays with his life, and then seeks justice from the villainous Allan Rickman for all the wrongs done to him, his female companion played by Laura San Giacoma, and the local Aborigenes. Along the way, Quigley battles with the Australian army, Rickman and his desperadoes, San Giacoma's mental illness, the Australian desert, and anyone wanting to collect off his wanted poster, in a story so well written that a rather innocuous statement at the beginning of the film becomes not only one of his best lines in the movie, but also the haunting last line delivered to Rickman near the end. The Australian scenery is as grand as Monument Valley or Sedona, Arizona, and the music by Basil Poledouris is as memorable as anything done by Elmer Bernstein for any of Wayne's westerns. And with a great eye for detail, the makers of this film gave it a very realistic look by using only weapons and equipment that would have existed during the time frame of the story. I spent quite a few years remarking that no one in Hollywood was making films like this anymore, and then Selleck had to show up and make a liar out of me. I, and anybody else who loves westerns, owe Tom Selleck and the cast and crew a debt of gratitude for making this one come alive.",Quigley Down Under

People call it a Western, and I guess that's fair, as it is set in Western Australia. However, it is probably my favourite Western. It has so much. Laura San Giacomo lights up the screen as Crazy Cora, Alan Rickman hams it up magnificently as the despicable villain, a very young Ben Mendelssohn plays a nice cameo, and Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as the sharp shooting leading man.
As has been mentioned, there are some harrowing scenes that depict a dark time in my country's history, but they are not overdone and fit in with the narrative, and play a large part in the way that the story ends. The mix of serious and humorous is nigh on perfect.

68,gatsby06,Hits the mark every time,10,23 February 2007,"If I were an actor in search of work, this is the movie that I would want on my resume. Everything about the movie, and everyone in it, is perfect.The music, the cinematography, the writing, even the opening credits, is spot on. And it holds up beautifully to repeated viewing.I am not an expert on the work of Laura San Giacomo, but here she delivers a tour de force. She is tough and vulnerable, crazy and wise all at the same time. Yet without such great acting, her fantastic looks might have created the image of a much more shallow ditzy dame. One cannot help falling in love with her in this movie, which makes Quigley's astonishing restraint all the more honorable.Mention should be made of Alan Rickman in a quintessential role for his dry sarcasm. The part fits him like a glove.All the acting is impeccable, including the aborigines, such as Gnarnayarrahe Waitairie, Paul Gurrumurruwuy Wunungmurra, Dorothy Warnggarrknga, and especially Cory Tjapaltjarri!The Sharps rifle, which is still produced in reproductions, is also quite impressive.If you enjoy this movie, you may also like Monte Walsh, in which Selleck also plays a humane cowboy. It is perhaps an even more nuanced performance. And the cinematography is also great.And then there is Ike: Countdown to D Day. How unlikely a role can you get for Selleck? Yet, almost unbelievably, he nails it, without merely mimicking Eisenhower. He did it by really studying the character and biography of Ike, and of the historical context of the events. I guess it goes to show that sometimes there is no substitution for education and intelligence in acting.",Quigley Down Under

I like him whether he's playing good or bad, he always plays them at his best. Snape in Harry Potter, Sherriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Gruber in Die Hard, Metatron in Dogma, doesn't matter, he's the best. Sorry, back to Quigley. This is a classic Western in my opinion. Great story, nice locales, and all around decent acting. Although the Crazy Cora character started getting on my nerves about two-thirds of the way through the movie, it turned out allright.

The only uncomfortable thing was the portrayal of the treatment of Aboriginals, something none of us can be proud of, but it was a different age and different people. But the movie showed it like it was, and for that alone this movie should be compulsory viewing for Australians.

Despite the review: ""Great Movie, Awesome Gun, Unreal Ballistics..., 21 December 2004"", the ballistics are quite real. In the afore-mentioned review, the reviewer relies on the ballistics tables for the .45-70 Gov't cartridge. The ""70"" in the designation refers to 70 grains of black power. Mathew Quigley used a .45-110 cartridge, with 110 grains of black powder, more than 60% more powder than the 45-70. The ballistics don't compare.On the movie side, Tom Selleck does his usual great job of portraying likable heroes. Laura San Giacomo, is perfect as Crazy Cora. Allan Rickman does his usual great job of portraying the cynical/sarcastic bad-guy who thinks he's better/smarter than everyone else. The cinematography is great, the setting is expansive and wonderful to look at.All that aside, this is a really fun movie to watch. And as some of the other commenter's have said, can be watched many times without losing it's appeal. While it wasn't a big hit in the theaters, it has become a staple on many of the cable movie channels and movie-of-the-week programs on channels like CMT and TBS.I am disappointed that I didn't discover this movie until it showed up on TV. I would have loved to see the great Australian scenery on a big screen.",Quigley Down Under
84,Ezz-2,"Great film, why can't I buy it on DVD?",8,27 March 2001,A great film which I have only seen on TV. Tom Selleck is excellent but Alan Rickman steals yet another picture. I would like to buy a copy but I can't find it on DVD. (Either Region 1 or Region 2) I don't buy films on VHS any more.,Quigley Down Under
85,billswanson27,a classic for the ages !,10,18 April 2007,"Possibly one of the best westerns (or should I say ""southerns"") made in the last 25 years. In my opinion, only Silverado and Open Range are in the same class. Tom Selleck, Alan Rickman and Laura San Giacomo all give outstanding performances and the story and directing are top flight, making this a movie that has lasting appeal. Besides, as we all learned in Die Hard, Alan Rickman is just an incredible bad guy. What an actor!...... The sound and camera work are deserving of award recognition as well as the afore mentioned actors. Definitely one of Tom Selleck's finest movies. If you like westerns give this one a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",Quigley Down Under
86,bizcjs,A film that can be enjoyed by the family with older children,10,1 May 2001,"I hope that this film will be soon released on DVD in the widescreen format as pan and scan will not cut it.  To lose any of the landscape of Australia would be tragic.  A film for most family members that will give you a history and geography lesson, will take you through a variety of emotions, and will leave you with the feeling that good prevailed through the many heroes of the movie.   Many wrongs were brought to light and most were answered.  A movie to make you feel good and music that does the same.",Quigley Down Under
87,djbrown19,Plot and action lack realism,4,11 November 2007,"No one shoots like this off set. Everyone misses shots now and then. I prefer screen writing that reflects real life. For example, in the western ""Unforgiven"", actor Clint Eastwood tries several times to hit a can with his six gun, then uses his shotgun with better results. Acting, shooting, stunts, and photography are well done. Supporting actors such as ranch hands and aboriginals do a good job, as does the bad guy, rancher Marston. Giacomo saves the movie from its unbelievability by providing romantic interest and comedy as the mad woman in need of rescue by the handsome hero. So, ""Quigley Down Under"" is passable as comedy.",Quigley Down Under
88,jacobus-4,Exceptional,10,6 July 2007,"One of the last true cowboy movies. No swearing, no hiding a crappy story with special effects - just a good old movie.Tom Sellect should have given Magnum a skip to become the next man with no name. He is cool, manly and refreshingly funny. If you like Tom Sellect or like a good cowboy movie, then you will definitely love Quigley Down Under.A movie about how men should be.He is a real gentleman in a hard world. He knows what he wants and stands with what he believes.The villain is also cool and manly, but plays the other side of the fence. It's a super movie that will stand the test of time.",Quigley Down Under
89,jackf1946,"A sentimental, unexpected western thriller - how's that for a quick pick!",9,16 June 2007,"This is the movie you want to watch if you don't like to watch the Oscar awards. ""Quigley"" is at his best as a western sharpshooter with a heart. ""Crazy Cora"" is a diamond in the rough. Enough violence to overcome all that sentimentality without destroying the balance.There are Tom Selleck fans, like me, who need a dose of ""good-guy-do-the-right-thing"" every so often - without the spectacular effects of 'Die Hard' and etc - to remind us of the innocence of the Saturday matinées and the tough experiences - and happy endings - of our youth.All Tom Selleck movies fall into this category, but this one is special thanks to Laura San Giacomo. For the open-minded unbelievers, the flick would be great as part of a double feature - maybe with ""Fargo"" as #2 on the bill. They have a lot in common.",Quigley Down Under
90,bigfisherla,One of the best. westerns/films ever made,10,10 March 2020,"I hadn't watched this in years, but was even better the second time around. When it finished, it was one of those rare films, to me anyway, where I sat back and thought ""God, I enjoyed that"" !
Brillian movie, the three major characters are excellently played, and thoroughly enjoyable. Watch it!",Quigley Down Under
91,Gaiman,"Great movie, but real star is...",7,28 September 1999,"Savvy viewers know the real star of this movie is the Creedmore Shiloh Sharps 45/110 Rifle.  The scenery in this movie is incredible, and in many ways it reminds me of both Out of Africa and Zulu.  All of these movies take their queues from the breathtaking land around them.",Quigley Down Under
92,breitkingdom,A very good movie,8,9 July 2000,"This was a hero like no other.  Quigley wanted to do the right thing.  He did his job but not for slaughter.  He killed that desevered killing, but he did not believe in slaughtering the innocent.  This is a man of high principle.  Would like to see it on DVD.  John Wayne would have been proud.",Quigley Down Under
93,elizfrank,Quigley plain crazy!,1,8 August 2021,"Huh?? How did this movie get 8, 9 and 10 star reviews? This was a very strange and unentertaining film. I actually had to turn it off. In the first place, it's very hard to follow-there is basically no dialogue about why or where they are going-why the guy(Quigley) fought a group of men and then decided to ride in a wagon with them(ok?). The movie makes no sense! And the idiot girl who follows Quigley everywhere and refers to him as ""Roy""(when his name is Matthew), her husband who was either dead or something happened to him(that was not very well explained either). She was the epitome of annoying and anything but sweet. She was an added character that should have been erased from the script. And don't get me started on the savages. So they took Quigley and the girl captive but randomly left and didn't try to kill/eat them(whatever their intention was). And then to make things worse the bad guys start shooting the savages (oh, no! We can't have racism! Not even in an era where they would have had to defend themselves from Indians if they wanted to remain alive and protect their people.), so Quigley comes to the rescue and kills some of the bad guys who were shooting at the Indians. Sure, that makes sense, right? Indians take on hostages, then hero comes and defends Indians. If that doesn't show you that movies nowadays try to advance their political agendas through movies,I don't know what will. If that's the kind of trash you like, well you can have it! Just watch this movie a couple times and you'll see!",Quigley Down Under
94,treid58,Love it! Never tire of it!,10,2 January 2007,"I love good westerns and this one is easily in my top 5. Top notch performances by all, including the Aussie natives. Selleck is absolutely superb. He's rough & tough, fair-minded and yet tender. Quite possibly the best big screen performance by this very talented actor. A long way from Magnum P.I. San Giacomo is spectacular as Crazy Cora. She is funny, sad, loyal, loving and attractive. You can't help but love her and want her and Quigley to end up together. Some very well written and orchestrated dialog between these two. Music score is solid western. Location shots are absolutely awesome. The storyline is wonderfully written with the romance between Quigley and Crazy Cora, the jealousy and fear of Marston and especially his men, the somewhat eerie protective presence of the natives. This movie has it all: romance, action, drama, suspense. Don't miss this one!",Quigley Down Under
95,annesedgwick,If you like Selleck and Histoty..............see it!,8,31 December 2006,"Great movie and true to life! Check out your history books on this subject. The story follows much forgotten truths during this period in that country as depicted in this movie, sure there is some ""Hollywood stunts here but what movie doesn't have that?. Tom Selleck is great and well worth watching. Good story and theme, typical cowboy good guy. Most cowboys in our history and today are very similar to this character. These guys took a stand and stayed with it, sometimes alone. They had real Grit. I call it intestinal fortitude! And for you black powder buffs,regarding black powder rifle they are very accurate as depicted in this film. You might say how do I know? I have first hand experience shooting these rifles some well over 100 years old. At 800 years you can place your palm over the target group of 5 shots. No they didn't have these rifles during the civil war but they evolved into accurate and better rifles in the 1870's.That reminds me again, I need to see this movie again.",Quigley Down Under
96,chiluvr,Tom Selleck was born to play this role,10,5 September 2021,"Tom Selleck was born to play this roleProbably one of my favorite westerns. I can't imagine anybody other than Tom Selleck in this role. Him and Laura San Giacomo were just excellent. The scenery, the actors, the music; everything about this movie is great and it's such an underrated movie.Matthew Quigley is hired by a man named Marston for reasons Quigley is not quite sure of until he arrives in Australia. When he finds out that Marston expects him to shoot the aborigines he throws him out the window and so the adventure begins.When you watch this on TV they cut out some very important scenes so I would advise watching it in some other way. I'm not gonna go into all the details but let's just say it's a western definitely worth watching.",Quigley Down Under
97,Nequeotium,If you like absolutely perfect happy endings at the end of tiring ordeals you'll like this,10,19 February 2002,"The best movie ever!!!!!! If you like absolutely perfect, happy endings at the end of tiring ordeals you'll like this...yatta, yatta, yatta. Basic girl meets guy, they go on a hard life journey together, and end up becoming soul mates.  Matthew Quigley is the impossably accurate sharpshooter hero, and Crazy Cora is his faithful sidekick. The perfect western romance with beautiful lighting, camera angles, and soundtrack. The movie this plot most closely resembles, for me, is the recent movie ""The Mummy"".",Quigley Down Under
98,jhodgson-3,Injun good...White man bad,8,14 June 2008,"I am quite weary of the ever-so-popular Injun good... White man bad movie genre. (Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee, Little Big Man, many more)Nevertheless, this movie gives you everything you go to a movie for. Intriguing plot, good acting, takes you to a place you have never visited before, plot twists, great villain, outstanding cinematography.Tom Selleck is weak in many of his chosen roles, but he excels in a Western.The director also directed the highly acclaimed Lonesome Dove series; no surprise there.Does anyone out there wince a little at the terrible aim that all of the villain's minions are afflicted with? Just like all of those minions in the James Bond movies, the minions can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with a firearm. Therefore they are expendable and soon they pass on to that great nearsighted minion land in the sky.",Quigley Down Under
99,rayevans,Can't recommend it too highly.,10,21 December 2003,"I've been watching Westerns for some 60 years and Quigley Down Under rates in my top 5 along with Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, The Outlaw Jose Wales and Once Upon a Time in the West. I've watched it 6 times and haven't tired of it yet. The musical score is superb, great story line and beautiful cinematography. Excellent performances by Selleck, Giacomo and Rickman.
Insofar as Quigley's marksmanship goes, there is nothing in the movie rifle shots that are not realistic as far as I'm concerned. During the Civil War, a Whitworth rifle with a telescopic sight had an effective range of 1800 yards and the exploits of Truman ""California Joe"" Head with his Sharps were lengendary in his own time. Even the Civil War Enfield was fairly accurate to 1100 yards. Given a Sharps with a custom load to match the rifle, it's a matter of familiarity, eyesight (preferably 20/10 or better), practice and reading the wind, the latter of which was shown prior to Quigley's demonstration to Marston and is by far the biggest variable in long range rifle shots. In short, anyone who is an excellent rifle or pistol shot is unbelievable. Check out Bob Munden's .45 Colt demonstrations. Blink and you've missed some of single or double shot feats. Literally!That's not to say that Quigley is not a mythical character in the movie but no more so than Wild Bill Hickcok, Wyatt Earp or Bat Masterson came to be, usually for only one incident in their lives.This is a 5 star Western if there ever was one. Can't recommend it too highly.",Quigley Down Under
100,yankee98982,"Darn Good Western, with a Twist",10,7 November 2005,"I love Tom Selleck in this movie. He does a great job as an American caught up in the imperialistic world of Austraila. The plot to eliminate a native people from the land in which they have lived for years has a double meaning in this film. Not only does it shadow the treatment of the Native Americans in the United States, but it's also very intriguing that an American is the one that takes the stand to fight against their brutal murders. But the real star of this movie is the gun, Quigley's high-powered rifle that amazes the viewer with it's incredible power and accuracy. Because of Quigley's impressive shooting skills, just the sight of the gun inspires awe. I don't care too much for the romance between Quigley and crazy Clara, but it's the touch of reality that makes Quigley more sympathetic. My favorite Western by far!",Quigley Down Under
101,bfturner,"Great Movie, Awesome Gun, Unreal Ballistics...",8,21 December 2004,"I bought Quigley Down Under on DVD and watched it many times for its beautiful photography and to see Tom Selleck play the role he was built for. Watched it again last night with my school-teacher daughter, who is also a shooter, and she asked me about the capabilities of the rifle Matthew Quigley used in the movie. It was a reproduction by Shiloh Sharps of the Sharps Model 1874 chambering a .45-110 cartridge, which fired a 550 grain lead bullet using 110 grains of black powder, which gave it a muzzle velocity of about 1360 feet per second.While I couldn't find ballistics tables for the .45-110 online, I did find them on Remington's web site for the .45-70 Government, a nearly identical cartridge, just shorter. Ballistics for the .45-70 with a lighter 405 grain bullet and a muzzle velocity of 1330 fps show the bullet would drop 301 inches at 500 yards from a 100 yard zero point of aim. This means the shooter would have to hold his point of aim 25 feet above the target to hit it. At 900 yards Quigley would have a better chance knocking planes out of the sky than hitting a paper target or bucket on the ground, especially shooting off-hand.They used these guns for long-range target shooting up to 1,000 yards, but they were shooting prone at known distances. Despite the ballistics issues, I loved the movie and so did my daughter. Thanks for the opportunity to comment on it.",Quigley Down Under

103,aebaldas,Quigley Down Under,9,24 July 2005,"Amazing, I usually hate westerns but this one really changed my mind. A movie that is a must see for all ages. My whole family really enjoyed watching it together. We might go out and buy it, because it was that remarkable. My brother thinks that it was interesting by the way they make it look real. My father comments that it was a western comedy, and good as it gets. My dogs even enjoyed it, so I would give it 5 stars, and willingly watch it again. Thanks to everyone who helped produce it. Crazy coral, was remarkable and had a story that was sad but true, and gave an outlook on life that many fail to realize. All in all it was amazing.

Alan Rickman delivers a solid performance as a ruthless rancher, willing to do anything and everything for profit.",Quigley Down Under

107,rjsoderberg,The DownUnder Western,10,24 September 2019,"If you lump Spaghetti Westerns together, and if you lump John Ford Westerns together, then you may want to consider making a third category and place Quigley as the best of that category. I place Quigley in my top 5 movies of all time. Maybe this film flies under the radar and that is why I identify so wonderfully with it. I can easily watch this every month; I have been known to watch it twice in a row while conducting a large ""cooking in the kitchen"" project. Lovin' it every time! The soundtrack is top notch too! Granted the mapping of the Australian terrain has some question, but that has zero bearing regarding the plot nor character depth; a true struggle for humanity, love for one's neighbor, and defender of the defenseless. Fight on Quigley!!",Quigley Down Under
108,mcgrane-mike,The Actor with the Scottish Hat,10,12 February 2006,"Always enjoy the movie. Bought the tape, will probably buy the DVD. Who is the character actor with the Scottish feathered Hat. What's his real name. I keep thinking he's a retread ""Rock Star"" from the sixties. Like one of those one hit wonder bands. BTW, shopped the internet for one of those Sharps Rifles. Those things price out at between $3,000 to $5,000.00. Man-oh-man,talking about sticker shock. But,probably worth every darn penny. Have been a fan of Sellick's western's, starting with the Sackett series etc.Right up there with 'The Duke', Eastwood, Robert Duvall and Sam Elliot. Etc. Finally got my wife to watch the movie, and pointed out how he stuck up for the Aboriginal's and ""Crazy Cora' and why. Both just causes. She finally understood. She Likes Alan Rickman, as well, so do I. All excellent actors in the movie. But most importantly Will somebody PUHLEEEEZE !!!! solve the trivia quiz about the guy in the Scottish Hat????????",Quigley Down Under
109,scott04848,One of the best movies I've ever seen. What a nice surprise ! ! !,10,12 February 2006,"Found this movie just starting on the CMT channel and looked it up on the database. First review I read said it was better than excellent so, although skeptical, I decided to watch it. I've always liked Tom Sellick and found this to be some of his best work. The story has pretty much everything you could want in a western; action, shoot-em-ups, great story line and casting and even romance and 'family values' ! While that last item may not make the movie acceptable to folks who hate guns, wear lots of skin piercings, vote democrat, and don't bathe regularly ... most 'regular folks' will probably rank this movie in the top 10 on their list.

They cut out every scene that makes the movie the special movie it is, namely its commentary on aboriginal people. Don't get me wrong, it has some great acting, especially Alan Rickman, one of my favorite roles of his. And it's a fun movie to watch. But it has a very powerful message about the slavery of the aboriginal people of Australia that you'll completely miss if you don't watch the full movie.",Quigley Down Under
