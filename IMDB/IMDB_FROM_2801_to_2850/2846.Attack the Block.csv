0,Leofwine_draca,An unexpected gem,10,6 August 2012,"You know, I was fully prepared to hate ATTACK THE BLOCK when I started watching it. The usual caveats applied: more low budget alien invasion nonsense, a wannabe script that tries to get 'down' with the kids, a movie that asks us to sympathise with a gang of violent muggers, profane but ultimately vapid dialogue. Half an hour in, I forgot about those things and realised that I was having a great time.The thing that works about this film is its simplicity. The storyline paints a broad picture of a conflict between some simple-but-frightening alien creatures and a gang of South London hoodies. It doesn't try to be anything more than an action-packed, fast-paced little thriller, which is why it works so well. Yes, we have to identify with some potentially unpalatable characters, but in the end ask yourself this: who better to defend themselves against flesh-eating aliens than tooled-up and streetwise urban horrors? The script is nicely self-referential and quite subtle in terms of the characterisations. The protagonists are gradually humanised, but in a way that isn't shoved down your throat; in one very clever and precise moment, a character ends up donning a pair of thick NHS glasses and your whole perception of him changes in an instant. There's even a look at the social situations that lead to kids arming themselves and committing violence against themselves and others, but again it's portrayed subtly and with humour in an intelligent way.Director Joe Cornish is a film fan and geek first and foremost – I remember watching him on the ADAM AND JOE SHOW back in the day and he's perfectly poised to helm things here. His film is warm, witty and affectionate of its genre, and the man-in-a-suit aliens work far better than the latest CGI monstrosity from across the pond. The cast is surprisingly good too, especially John Boyega playing something of an iconic character, and the action bits are superbly handled. One of the things that impressed me most is Cornish's ability to stage large-scale set-pieces on a small budget: there's a riff on DIE HARD at the end and you never realise for a moment that you don't actually see much in the way of it actually happen. ATTACK THE BLOCK is so good that I went back and watched it again; it's one of the most entertaining films of 2011 that I've watched.",Attack the Block
1,SnoopyStyle,Fine small alien-invasion movie,7,24 July 2014,Moses (John Boyega) and his gang of fellow juvenile delinquents rob nursing student Sam (Jodie Whittaker) in this bad London neighborhood. An alien falls out of the sky next to them. Moses and the boys chase down the creature and kill it. They try to sell the carcass to drug dealer Ron (Nick Frost). The big boss Hi-Hatz allows them to store the creature in the weed room and set Moses up as his new dealer. Then more aliens start raining down.The kids are hard to like at the beginning. It takes awhile to get the rooting interest. The creatures are good. It's a straight up horror action movie and a pretty good one. The creatures are black werewolf-like with glowing teeth. It's sometimes fun. This smaller alien invasion movie is done with great energy. Writer/director Joe Cornish has good skills and a great ear.,Attack the Block
2,Prismark10,Attack the Block,6,25 July 2014,"Joe Cornish is no 'Homeboy' who grew up on the rough streets of London. He actually went to a prestigious and expensive fee paying school which probably explains why he so badly misfired the multi racial street kids in this film as they are basically portrayed as vile scum who you wish the aliens would dispatch in a rather nasty way.Moses (John Boyega) and his south London posse rob trainee nurse Samantha (Jodie Whittaker) near her tower block on bonfire night.Only for some dog like aliens to land and cause havoc. Moses kills one and then they are pursued by others over the night.Then there is also gang leader Hi-Hatz who seems to have a vendetta against Moses despite being attacked by the alien himself.Samantha joins Moses and his gang when one of his crew gets injured.The movie is destined to be a cult classic. It helps that two of the leads went on to star in famous science fiction franchises.The scenes where they brutally rob Samantha who lives in the same tower block is difficult viewing, I am surprised the director did not have her gang raped. Maybe if the meteorite had not struck giving her a chance to get away she could had a worse fate.Cornish has written and directed Attack the Block. It is more of a love letter to the low budget sci-fi films made by Joe Dante and John Carpenter in the 1970s and 80s.Nick Frost pays a supporting role and provide some star power as well as comic relief.The films suffers the fate like many other movies set in working class London tower blocks of showing a stereotypical image of feral teenagers.Notice the brainy one who puts some of the story about the aliens together is a white dope head. Contrast this with the black Hi-Hatz who inexplicably goes around chasing Moses for no good reason.Cornish does try to give some depth to the characters but there is more than a hint of a middle class white guy trying to write for characters from a rough council estate with horrible street dialect/slang.The film is scary but not a full blown horror, it is also not that funny. Not helped by dislikeable characters that do little to bring the viewer round to like them although the then unknown cast play their parts well.The creatures themselves are the highlight of the film with their design and movements. Its the technical aspects where Cornish succeeds in this low budget film.",Attack the Block
3,claudio_carvalho,"E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial in South London",5,18 December 2011,"In South London, the dangerous gang of teenagers led by the fifteen year-old Moses (John Boyega) heists the nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) while she is going home. Then Moses kills an alien that has felt from the sky and he brings its body expecting to sell it. Sooner they realize that it is an alien invasion and the gang protects their block against the aliens. ""Attack the Block"" is a kind of joke with ""E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial"", telling a story that is the opposite of the Spielberg's film: instead of naive children riding bicycles in USA, a gang of teenagers riding motorcycles and bikes in South London; instead of an amicable alien, violent aliens. The film is entertaining, but the non-likable characters (with the exception of Sam) do not create any empathy with the viewer and the plot does not work well. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Ataque ao Prédio"" (""Attack the Building"")",Attack the Block
4,nogodnomasters,I MISSED THE CLASS ON ALIEN BITE WOUNDS,8,5 July 2018,"Jodie Whittaker plays a nurse who is robbed while walking home by a gang of boys. During the robbery an alien crash lands nearby. Using knives, the gang manages to kill the alien while the victim nurse escapes. The kids carry around the body of the alien not knowing what to do with it. They end up at a flat (Ron's Weed Room) with a stoner who looks like a younger Ozzy (Nick Frost). The boys see more space aliens landing. All agog the gather ceremonial swords, clubs, Roman candles and a dog that looks like Spuds to go hunt aliens...only this time they are bigger and meaner, looking like hairy worgs with several rows of neon teeth that glow in the dark.The boys run for their lives, along with the nurse, trying to avoid aliens, a rival gang, and cops. The aliens have no eyes and hunt by smell, which takes the gang a while to figure out. They are tracking down Moses, the gang leader who killed the first alien.The movie had enough comedy to keep us entertained, while stopping short of being a comedy. There are brief moments of irony and juxtaposition to lets us know the writer and director aren't complete idiots. While the movie makes for a great independent, some of the acting and lines seemed a bit forced. I think a couple of early scenes with a little background on the main characters could have added to the movie and created something to build on, i.e. give us a glimpse of some future saving event.All in all, for those who like quirky sci-fi horror, this one is well worth a view.F-bomb, No sex, no nudity.",Attack the Block
5,kosmasp,Block Party Crashers,7,5 March 2012,"You have to wrap your head around our main protagonists. This will be I guess the most difficult thing to do for most people. It's not easy, because they don't seem likable at first. Quite the opposite, you kinda hate them. But there is more than meets the eye there. And even if it is a very thin line the director walks here, he does so very bravely and with a great result.Having said that, if you overcome that obstacle you can have fun with a movie that is not trying to be too serious, but also has some ""real"" (against CGI) ""enemies"" that will confront our ""heroes"". Having Nick Frost in there guarantees you'll have a lot to laugh too. So if you have a fable for B-movie Sci-Fi fare, this will be right up your alley (no pun intended)",Attack the Block
6,jboothmillard,Attack the Block,8,19 May 2011,"There was discussion about this new take on an alien movie on Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman, they said some positive things about it, so I was certainly interested in going to see it. Basically it is set in a council estate of South London on Bonfire Night, seeing a small street gang of hoodies/chavs, leader Moses (John Boyega) and members Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones) and Biggz (Simon Howard). While they mug innocent nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker), a fiery object falls from the sky and crashes into a nearby car, and while their victim runs away they investigate. They find it is a meteor from outer space, and after a near attack they manage to kill the alien creature, and they take its body to their council block where they all live. They decide to take it to their friend Ron (Nick Frost) who has a secret store room where he grows his cannabis/marijuana, and after chilling a little bit, they hear and see more alien meteors crashing in the area. Thinking they can get something out of it and having an urge to kill more of these invaders they all grab weapons and go outside to get them, but they realise they are much deadlier and bigger in size and quantity. They are now on the run from the aliens, that look like gorilla like creatures, with no visible eyes and mouths glowing greenish blue when they roar. They see the only place to try and stay safe is inside the block building, as there are too many of the monsters outside, and they do everything they can to fight them off and kill them. The teenage hoodies have now almost become the heroes as they battle against the alien threat, and slowly Sam joining them forgives them, but Moses may be the most likely reason they are chasing his friends. In the end, after one or two deaths of the friends, and a foe, all the aliens are ganged together in the same spot of the block building, and Moses finishes them off with a firework gas explosion, before all the teens and drug dealers are arrested. Also starring Luke Treadaway as Brewis, Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, Danielle Vitalis as Tia and Maggie McCarthy as Margaret. The young cast all do very well, to the point where you forgive the characters for being thugs because the aliens are more dangerous, the film has its jumpy moments, but you find it more funny than scary, including the witty street lingo, its like the feel of Gremlins, a good fun science-fiction action comedy. Very good!",Attack the Block
7,Woodyanders,Not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi alien invasion tale,9,24 May 2012,"The premise alone clearly implies that this movie is going to be something special, unique, and different: A scrappy teen street gang defends their dangerous South London apartment complex territory from a horde of savage alien invaders. Writer/director Joe Cornish brilliantly subverts basic audience expectations by making this ragged band of initially reprehensible characters the heroes of the piece rather than the villains of same: Granted, they aren't exactly the salt of the earth, but these kids ultimately prove to be fiercely loyal, resourceful, and remarkably brave under duress, with tough and gallant leader Moses (a terrific performance by John Boyega) emerging as the most admirable of the lot. Moreover, Cornish smartly shows these kids as being scared deep down inside by the ordeal they're put through, further notes that they are the toxic products of broken homes, and allows the gang members moments of surprising humanity that are genuinely touching. In addition, Cornish rarely lets the swift pace flag for a moment, stages the ferocious alien attack set pieces with thrilling rip-snorting gusto, builds a considerable amount of tension, and makes the most out of the claustrophobic blighted tenement setting. The uniformly ace acting from the bang-up cast keeps the movie humming: Jodie Whittaker contributes a strong and sympathetic portrayal as the feisty Sam, Nick Frost shines in his rather minor, but still juicy role as laid-back drug dealer Ron, Jumayn Hunter cuts an intimidating figure as ruthless top thug Hi-Hatz, and Alex Esmail projects a winningly spiky charm as the brash Pest. The excellent and convincing special effects are another major plus; the hairy simian aliens are quite gnarly, nasty, and pretty darn scary. Both Thomas Townsend's polished cinematography and Steven Price's dynamic pulsating score are up to par. An absolute blast.",Attack the Block
8,Tweekums,Aliens attack a South London tower block!,7,28 June 2012,"The film opens with a woman walking through the streets of South London; she is clearly on edge and has every reason to be as she is soon mugged by a group of a group of teenagers. It looks as though things might get worse for her when something comes crashing down from the sky and destroys a car. Moses, the leader of the gang sees this as an opportunity to steal whatever was in the car. As he gets in he discovers that there is a creature inside; it attacks him before fleeing; he chases it and kills it with a knife. Realising that the creature is like nothing any of them have ever seen they take it back to their tower block with the intention of selling their story to the media in the morning. Soon more objects come crashing down and the gang arm themselves with the intention of killing some more...the problem is these ones are different; they and bigger, stronger and far more dangerous!After a run in with the police Moses is reunited with the woman he mugged, Sam, A nurse who lives in the same tower block as the gang. After escaping from the monsters they have a run in with the local drug dealer who thinks he controls the block; this leads to him coming after them as well as the aliens! Once back in the tower they have to find away to stop the monsters without getting killed first; to do that they fight with knives, fireworks, a baseball bat and even a katana.I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this; in fact I was sure the protagonist Moses was going to be the first victim when he stuck his head through the car window... after all a low life mugger is hardly going to be the hero! It was a brave move by writer/director Joe Cornish to make us dislike the main characters the moment we saw them... whether it was a move too far or not will depend on the viewer; I'll admit that I wasn't keen on them at first but over the course of the movie grew to be on there side; at least in the battle against the aliens. The use of unknown actors worked well as did the fact that the way they spoke felt real... not being from South London I can't attest to how accurate it really was but certainly thought it made the characters believable even when they were in the middle of an obviously impossible situation. Amid the action there were a reasonable number of laughs; many provided Nick Frost of 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' fame, he wasn't the only amusing character though; I particularly liked 'Probs' and 'Mayhem' a couple of nine year olds who took on the aliens with a super-soaker filled with petrol! The Monster designs were pretty good although unfortunately they weren't really scary enough despite killing several people... given the amount of swearing had already guaranteed the film a '15' certificate they could have increased the gore and scariness without worrying about getting a more restrictive rating. Overall I'd say this is a decent horror-comedy and is well worth checking out if you like films such as 'Shaun on the Dead'.",Attack the Block
9,ma-cortes,"Funny , exciting and entertaining flick about an alien invasion by Joe Cornish's directorial debut",6,29 November 2012,"It's a imaginative treatment of the science fiction's ordinary theme about an Alien invasion but from a point of sight adolescent and which takes place in a tower block. A teen gang (Most of the teenage actors were found through their schools and online open audition calls) in South London defend their block from an alien invasion . As a rocks falls and when the meteorite breaks open, an alien cocoon is revealed . No matter how much armaments are utilized facing them, the strange aliens are invincible and impassive . Neither army, helicopters ,air force , Police or bombs manage to vanquish to the imperturbable and unalterable invasion alien , but the group of teens hardly contend the ugly and hairy extraterrestrials . While the inhabitants getting away , the group seeks refuge in their block but the aliens pursue them .This moving picture contains noisy action , thrills , chills , gore , guts and brief touches of humor . The film concerns upon the survival of human specie ,the fundamental theme is the humanity-Alien confrontation ; an exceptional happening like is an extraterrestrial invasion , being faced off by some valiant teens . However , turns out to be politically incorrect the gang of teens carry out violent mugging on a nurse well played by Jodie Whittaker whose scene was filmed on the first day of shooting ; director Joe Cornish was inspired to make this film after actually being mugged in real-life one night . As the biggest problem people seem to have with Attack the Block is that the main starring results to be a fifteen-year-old young delinquent become a hero . The movie is a crossover from ¨Critters¨ by Stephen Hopkins , ¨Gremlins¨ by Joe Dante and ¨Signs¨ by Night Shyamalan , in fact , writer/director Joe Cornish has stated that watching Signs (2002) and imagining what would happen if it took place in south London was an inspiration for this flick . Spectacular and amusing walkway chase set piece which took ten days to shoot and all the interiors were done on sets . Overwhelming and impressive FX of destruction executed by aliens are well made , though film-makers only used CG effects when absolutely necessary, and to enhance practical effects for the creatures rather than replace them completely . Good feature film debut of director Joe Cornish and the bulk of this film was shot in 67 days , having to remove fifteen pages of the script prior to the shooting of the film because of budgetary constraints and he did in depth research on language to accurately convey the way South London street kids speak . Joe grew up and lives in South London, where this film is set and he usually is screenwriter , as he wrote the recent ¨Adventures of Tintin : The secret of unicorn¨ .Rating : 6,5 ; acceptable and passable film . Well worth watching , it's an original and edge-of-your-seat entertaining.",Attack the Block
10,BA_Harrison,Makes you want to cheer for the aliens...,6,2 October 2011,"I enjoyed Attack the Block to a certain degree—it had some really cool creatures, solid action, and is littered with amusing lines of dialogue—but I would have liked the film a whole lot more if there had been just a few more characters I could actually give a toss about.With the sole exception of Jodie Whittaker as Sam, Attack the Block's characters are loathsome pieces of human garbage: teenage gang-members, drug dealers and wannabe gangsters, people with absolutely no regard for the the law or the feelings of others (they also do a pretty good job of murdering the English language).This probably wouldn't have been such an issue had they all suffered agonising deaths, but Cornish's script virtually exonerates these vile individuals of their crimes, turning them into the heroes of the piece. It's this moral turpitude that ruins a potentially very entertaining film. After all, it's hard to stay on the edge of your seat when you're rooting for the monsters.",Attack the Block
11,paul_haakonsen,A bit out of the ordinary...,7,2 September 2011,"This movie had totally eluded my attention, and I came across it by sheer random luck. What caught my eye was Nick Frost and the alien part. So I decided to give the movie a go.What I didn't like about the movie was the lifestyle that was portrayed in the movie. I know that people might be living that way and acting that way, but I don't really enjoy seeing it glorified on movies. That whole ghetto-I-am-tougher-than-you attitude was a bit too much. But still, it did work in favor of the movie. Not sure how accurate it is to certain parts of London, but there was a distinct street-life touch to the movie.Now, what really intrigued me, was the way the aliens were made. The first one you saw was amazing, and the details on it, when you did get to see it up close and personal was quite good. Then when you see the second wave of aliens, that was phenomenal. Nothing but sheer, brutal strength and killer instinct. And the part with the pitch-black fur and fluorescent teeth was quite good. I liked that. And also, the aliens had no personality, it was just sheer killing machines. That worked well and added to the mystery of these creatures and added to the other-worldly touch they had.The storyline was straight forward and moved at an excellent pace. You weren't left hanging out to dry, nor were you left bored at any moment in the movie. There was a lot of action and suspense in the movie, along with the occasional thrill and lots of witty remarks and odd humor.""Attack the Block"" is well worth checking out, especially if you want an alien movie out of the ordinary.",Attack the Block
12,Coventry,E.T. can't phone home! Thugs snitched his mobile...,5,24 September 2012,"It's actually a very interesting basic premise: primitive barbaric alien invaders versus juvenile London street gangs At least it's a whole lot more interesting than aliens versus cowboys, which is a concept that some big shots in Hollywood also tried recently. And straight from the opening sequences, it's made clear that the film's main strong point will become character authenticity. ""Attack the Block"" is set in South London, where writer/director Joe Cornish also actually grew up, and opens immediately with the assault of a young woman by a an aggressive and lawless gang of underage hoodlums. The sequence is very realistic, especially if you watch the news bulletins every now and then, and because of the assailants' ages also deeply disturbing. But hey, that's just the way it is nowadays Kids, barely fifteen or sixteen year old, are roaming the big European city streets at night and don't hesitate to rob, injury, rape or even murder other civilians for a small sum of money. This exact same bunch of youthful thugs subsequently then goes to war against an underdeveloped race of alien invaders that literally comes falling out of the sky like meteors. It is here already that the film's main strong point threatens to become a giant obstacle. Are we supposed to cheer for teenage thugs that narrowly just mugged and gang-raped an innocent women? Are we supposed to feel empathy when they look as terrified of the aliens as their victims look terrified of them? But director Joe Cornish and his cast of inexperienced youngsters surprisingly enough accomplish that we gradually (very gradually at the beginning) go from tolerating the protagonists to actually rooting for them. At the end of the film, the protagonists are still scumbags, but at least they demonstrated courage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. And besides, it's not like you can cheer for the aliens in this case, neither They aren't well organized and super-intelligent beings with a detailed plan to take over our planet, but primitive canine beasts with fluorescent blue teeth and impenetrable black fur. The characters refer to pretty much every semi-classical Sci-Fi/Fantasy flick to describe them (""Gremlins"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Harry Potter"") but the aliens actually look the most like a crossover between ""Critters"" and ""American Werewolf in London"". """"Attack the Block"" contains plenty of bloody action and harsh violence, but sadly the film rapidly gets boring and repetitive. There's a lack of variance in decors and filming locations (the aliens literally just attack the block and nothing else) and all too often director Cornish wants to imitate the raw impact of ""Assault on Precinct 13"". Nick Frost is, in fact, rather redundant as the über-relaxed weed dealer, but it's presumably thanks to his name on the posters that many genre fans wanted to see the film. Along with Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright (here the executive producer), Nick Frost uplifted the British horror and cult industry with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". The concept gimmick is original and dared, the performances are as good as natural and there are a handful of terrific Sci-Fi/horror sequences, but overall seen ""Attack the Block"" remains a modest and forgettable effort.",Attack the Block

14,hitchcockthelegend,It's raining Gollums!,8,5 January 2019,"Attack the Block is written and directed by Joe Cornish. It stars Jodie Whittaker, John Boyega, Alex Esmail, Jumayn Hunter, Luke Treadaway and Nick Frost. Music is by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price and cinematography by Tom Townend.When a South London tower block comes under attack from aliens, a young gang of lads and the nurse they just mugged have to band together to fight back.In Britain we was wondering just when Joe Cornish was going to turn his hand to directing a feature film, here for his debut he tackled a sci-fiction action comedy with a wry bit of social commentary thrown in for good measure - it was worth the wait.With one Edgar Wright hovering about in the producers lounge and Nick Frost on hand as a reassuringly adult comedic presence, it could be argued that Attack the Block has joined the Wright/Pegg production line. Yet when you break it down this does in fact homage a myriad of siege invasion films, but still it becomes very much its own animal.Cornish dangerously structures his film by introducing us to a young gang of kids who think nothing of mugging a single defenceless woman - with a knife. With the group spouting their turf speak (some none British views may struggle initially with the dialogue), they are not a bunch of youngsters one can easily get on side with. In fact to dislike them in an instant is wholly justifiable and understandable, so much so that once the aliens arrive it's a human reaction to root for them to rid us of these troublesome youths. So yes, dangerous by Cornish, yet astute as it happens.As the pic progresses and we spend time with the gang, we start to understand their way of life, their part in a tough society. It's during this key phase that Cornish brings in another structure, that of the victim and the perpetrators having to band together to fight an enemy, surely he isn't going to make heroes out of this gang of youthful miscreants? So once this scene is set, and the aliens start to unleash toothsome hell on this part of South London, it's battle royale time. The blood and jokes seamlessly flow together, the score booms and other characters are introduced, some either for a lighter angle - others to annoy us and maybe be set up for alien gnasher fodder?The aliens themselves are a splendid creation, a new addition to an overstocked market. One of the youngsters calls them gorilla wolf things, that's about right, they be jet black with spiky hair and bio luminescent jaws and claws, they move on all fours. And then it's the last part of Cornish's clever structure plan, for as we are given a reason why the aliens are after this particular group, so does characters transformations offer a prudent point. There is hope unbound, not just for people in movie, but for societies fractured by the way of the life afforded them. While the lesson here of people taking responsibility for their actions, to right their wrongs, is written loud and proud.Smart and fresh performances across the board, led by the wonderful Whittaker and a star making turn from Boyega, close out the deal. Attack the Block is a genre spilcer of a picture that brings something new to the table it sits at. Trust Bruv! 8/10",Attack the Block
15,Theo Robertson,I Was Cheering The Aliens . Wasn't I Bruv ? For Real,3,9 November 2012,"This got a lot of hype when it was released last year . When I say "" A lot of hype "" I do mean from a parochial jingoistic British press which is no indication of quality since the British press often blindly praise celluloid with the flag of union on it and for the second review in a row I have to mention Danny Boyle's SUNSHINE , a film that was described as a modern day classic by the Britsh critics but a film I found bitterly disappointing . So I sat down to watch ATTACK THE BLOCK and afterwards I found myself questioning if I not only saw the same film but if I shared any of the same moral codes of the critics who praised this dire piece of brain dead , morally empty , unentertaining rubbish The main fault of the film jumps out at you from the very first scene : a nurse walks home late one night and she is robbed by a gang of muggers . Let me point out that that this robbery doesn't involve a bunch of cheeky chappies quickly snatching a bag and then running down the street - the mugging involves a bunch of thugs holding a knife to the throat of a lone terrified woman. In some films this scene would be followed by a vigilante stepping out from the shadows and blowing away the said muggers with the film then centering around the vigilante who is an "" anti-hero "" This unfortunately doesn't happen because these muggers are in fact the anti-heroes of the film . Luckily there's an alien invasion underway so then these scumbags who hold a knife to the throat of a woman can redeem themselves in an example of speciesism But before we get to the redemption we have to endure some "" cool right on happening street culture lingo "" ( It says here ) that'll get all these wicked kids from da streets punching the air happy in the knowledge someone has made a film that understands them - not . I could quote some of the dialogue from Moses and the street posse but the site would notice recognise these words as graphic spelling mistakes and reject this review . They aren't real words anyway and the dialogue comes across as a highly patronising parody of a grade Z Ali G speak . There's something both highly patronising and offensive about Joe Cornish screenplay and in no way does any of it seem ironic Perhaps the greatest shame about ATTACK THE BLOCK is that there is , if not a good film , then perhaps an entertaining one trying to get out . Russell T Davies managed to resurrect DOCTOR WHO with an urban working class audience in mind , something he excelled at and perhaps Cornish tried to do the same thing here but has failed . The anti-heroes are far too hard edged to elicit empathy even though the villains are murderous aliens from another planet - just because they're killing aliens doesn't make them good guys in any way . Put it like this - if a rapist murdered a convicted child killer would the rapist then become an exemplary role model ?",Attack the Block
16,Hey_Sweden,"Could just as easily have been titled ""Defend the Block"".",8,9 January 2013,"Writer / director Joe Cornishs' man vs. aliens tale makes for surprisingly good entertainment; the script may be fairly routine, but it sets up a movie that begins with a bang and offers very little in the way of breathers, right up to a reasonably rousing conclusion. It may not be out to reinvent the genre, but it keeps one watching with its emphasis on action and pace.It also gives us a main troupe of characters who are NOT sympathetic to begin with: they're a teen aged gang in London who are witness to an infestation of aliens, which rain down from the sky. They decide to kill one of these things, but they're soon overwhelmed by the number and ferociousness of their enemy. Described by the characters as something of a cross between wolves and gorillas, they're black and hairy monsters with glowing teeth. In an unlikely turn of events, our antagonists-turned-unlikely-heroes end up protecting a young woman, Sam (Jodie Whittaker), whom they had initially mugged!Cornish keeps up a high level of excitement here, and gets capable performances out of his young, mostly no-name cast, who are engaging as people who endear themselves more to the viewer as the movie progresses. Eventually, one is in the position of rooting for them to save the day. John Boyega in particular has presence and makes the most out of the redemptive nature of his role. The closest thing here to a ""name"" actor is Nick Frost, the lovable sidekick of such films as ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", and ""Paul"", and he's in fine form although he doesn't get a whole lot to do. Some comedy relief is supplied by Sammy Williams and Michael Ajao as diminutive would be gangsta types Probs and Mayhem. And Jumayn Hunter, who also performs the catchy ditty ""Catch That Snitch"", is a good antagonist as Hi-Hatz.In addition to making this a solid diversion, Cornish does work some political material into the mix that doesn't work as well. It just comes off as silly. Still, amid all of the large scale action he does give the viewer a feeling of what it's like for these various people to live in this neighbourhood. The editing is sometimes too choppy, in that typical modern manner, but it never becomes too prevalent.Now, just going by the reviews here, this seems to be mostly a love it or hate it affair, but just speaking for myself I had a blast with it, no matter if I won't remember it for that long. Sometimes an hour and a half of amusing escapism is all I really want.Eight out of 10.",Attack the Block

During the mugging something falls from the sky & crashes into a parked car, the gang is then suddenly attacked by an alien that cuts the gang leader Moses (John Boyega) face & in revenge Moses & the gang hunt the alien down & kill it. Shortly after more aliens fall from the sky & land on the estate, these aliens are different though as they are huge & vicious & kill any human they meet. The teenage gang become aware of what's happening & decide to fight back against the alien invasion & protect their block of flats...This British & French co-production was written & directed by Joe Cornish & I have to say that while Attack the Block isn't terrible there are too many issues that I disliked about it for me to get excited about it. I suppose the biggest problem I have with Attack the Block is that the script tries to turn character's that I didn't like into the people that save the day, I am sorry but I just can't like a gang of thugs who mug a lone woman at knife point no matter how many times you have them swear which in itself isn't funny. The whole film is played as a comedy sci-fi horror that has obvious influences & is a decent time killer but I didn't think the central concept & theme worked the way the makers intended. I suppose the teenage muggers were meant to save the day, find redemption & we are meant to sympathise with them but after seeing them mug a woman, take drugs, do whatever they want, kill just because something annoyed them & then run around with Samurai swords, baseball bats & flick knives I just couldn't like them or root for them to win. I really wished the aliens had killed the lot of them, at only 80 minutes long at least it's short & it moves along at a good pace & is watchable but I couldn't the fact that I hated almost every character out of my head & ultimately that's probably why I thought it was alright but nothing else. I just didn't like the whole message about these thug's being victims rather than criminals, this is a huge issue in today's society & surely people must take responsibility for their own actions. No-one else is making them mug someone, are they? Quite why a fairly light hearted sci-fi action thriller is dealing with such deep issues is puzzling & I for one feel the makers took the wrong direction. The dialogue is also another issue, I have lived here in the UK all my life & even I didn't understand half the urban gangster crap they spoke, I certainly didn't find any of it funny either.The aliens almost seem secondary to the moral issues on show & they are kept virtually black in every shot they appear with only their sharp fang like teeth glowing in the dark giving off any light, they look alright for what they are but I suspect budget reasons were partly responsible. There is hardly any CGI computer animation in Attack the Block, I always prefer practical effects where possible so I liked Attack the Block for that aspect if nothing else. I can't say I found it particularly exciting or scary or fantastical, I found it a bit bland & forgettable actually. More aliens die than humans so there's not much blood or gore, a man has his throat bitten out & someone has their nose bitten off but otherwise nothing worth mentioning. In a nod to classic sci-fi films & author's several of the street locations are named after famous writer's such as H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke & Douglas Adams.With a supposed budget of about $13,000,000 this was partly filmed on the real Heygate Estate in London. The acting is alright, again I can't say i warmed to or liked anyone but there's no terrible performances here.Attack the Block is a film that many seem to like probably for the reasons that I don't like it, really irritating urban gangster dialogue, lack of alien action & a moralistic stance that I personally don't agree with although having first hand experience of some of the issues here might cloud my opinion a bit. Watchable & not terrible but there were too many aspect that I disliked for me to really enjoy it.",Attack the Block

Its defended, in a manner of speaking by some kids, with severe attitude problems that make them seem more like posers then real people.As I said how you react to the characters will determine how you react to the film. I found them annoying and overly strident. It has nothing to do with them being criminals and everything to do with them being smart mouthed kids you kind of want to slap and say get with the program. yes I know its where they live, but at the same time they seem to be taking a stand rather than acting.I also wasn't keen on the attitude of the film which was way too knowing, way too hip and happening and way too stacked in favor of our characters. You know they'll pull it out because the film seems to be a victory saga of their great deeds.Can you tell I really didn't like it?

19,zardoz-13,Aliens Versus Delinquents,7,24 November 2011,"Freshman writer & director Joe Cornish's atmospheric, above-average sci-fi invasion feature is no ""World of the Worlds,"" but it qualifies as the kind of entertaining nonsense that you can watch over and over again. Cornish is known best to British audiences for TV's ""The Adam and Joe Show"" along with its radio spin off, and he appeared in an uncredited in a small role in ""Shaun of the Dead.""A motley collection of British youths who are members of a multi-cultural street gang tangle with some menacing other worldly critters. These vicious aliens resemble medium-sized gorillas crossed with wolves and they have a multitude of teeth in their mouths. They look really frightening because their teeth are a weird Day-Glo green so you see only their distended jaws. Further, they move rather rapidly when they are in pursuit. The action opens during the evening as Moses (John Boyega), Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones) and Biggz (Simon Howard) mug a young, off-duty nurse, Sam (Jodie Whittaker) and steal her cellphone, purse and ring at knife-point. The narrative unfolds largely at night. As they are mugging her in the street after she has gotten off work, a meteor like explosion demolishes a nearby parked car and scatters them. Moses decides to loot what he can from the wrecked car and encounters the alien critter. The youths pursue this extraterrestrial into an isolated enclosure where they kill it. All of this occurs in long shot so the filmmakers can maintain the monster's mystique. Moses emerges with distinctive marks on one side of his face that look like flared stripes. They take the beastie as a trophy and lug it over to a friend's apartment, cannabis farmer Ron (Nick Frost) so he can identify it and help them turn a profit with its intriguing corpse. Before the evening is over, more of these meteors--looking like the initial alien invasion in ""Skyline"" fall on London. Meantime, Sam has gone to the police and they cruise out in a transport van with her to catch the delinquents. No sooner have the authorities latched onto Moses than the aliens attack them and kill the cops. One of Moses' cohorts commandeers the van and they race off to an underground garage.Happily, Cornish doesn't take himself seriously so ""Attack the Block"" is a lot of fun. The aliens chase our heroes around and prove to be rather menacing. These critters love to head butt the police van and they practice the same tactic when they hit the apartment complex where the heroes reside. Moreover, he doesn't let the momentum flag and he stages several interesting encounters without dwelling on the monsters. If you like tense, tongue-in-cheek horror chillers, ""Attack the Block"" is your kind of fare. Americans who love to hear British language dialogue with all its slang will enjoy this neat little 87-minute opus.",Attack the Block
20,neil-476,Ultimately enjoyable,7,12 May 2011,"Nurse Sam is walking home on November the 5th (Guy Fawkes Night, fireworks everywhere) to her flat in south London tower block Wyndham House, when she is mugged by a gang of 5 black teenagers (OK, 4 black and one white, but they all speak the same south London black patois, innit?). It just so happens that there is a burst of meteorites bearing aliens (the third within a year by my reckoning), but the fireworks mean that no-one notices until Moses, the 15-year old leader of the gang, is attacked by one of these aliens and kills it. The aliens invade Wyndham House and Moses' gang, aided, abetted, and sometimes hindered by Sam, assorted girlfriends and sisters, two junior would-be gang members, a couple of white blokes who are wasted on weed, and the local gangsta (it's his block, y'know) have to do the best they can to repel this invasion.After being initially put off by the mugging (and while continuing to be irritated by the gang accents - pointedly, parents do not share them), I came to sympathise with Moses and his gang, as I was meant to. They are fundamentally nice kids, but without much going for them, and a sense of decency drives them towards the end of the movie.There is quite a lot of humour, quite a lot of violence, and quite a lot of swearing. All the youngsters are very good. The aliens - well, I think the film probably does the best it can with a limited budget.Ultimately, I quite enjoyed it while expecting not to.",Attack the Block
21,evanston_dad,Is It a Bad Sign When You're Rooting for the Aliens?,6,27 September 2012,"This teenagers-against-invading-aliens sci-fi thriller has its heart in the right place, but I don't know that I can wholly recommend it.We're introduced to a bunch of punks who live in a bad London neighborhood, who decide it's up to them to protect their block from a host of aggressive aliens that look like shaggy black werewolves. We're supposed to think these kids are punks for the first half of the movie, but then be won over by them and realize that they're just victims of circumstances by the time the movie is over. But that never really happened for me. I spent most of the film looking forward to seeing them get their heads ripped off and then being disappointed when it didn't happen as frequently as I would have liked. The lack of rooting interest in this particular film is an almost insurmountable obstacle to thoroughly enjoying it.One bright spot, however, was Jodie Whittaker, playing a woman who's mugged by this gang of punks in the first moments of the film but then finds herself allied with them later when she has no other choice. She's a lovely actress and gives a lovely performance.Grade: B-",Attack the Block

More aliens land, and are attracted to a pheromone that was left by the first.Now the hoodies and the girl they mugged must protect themselves from the aliens, while avoiding an angry gangster and the armed police, both of whom know nothing about the alien attack......Cornish must have known that the comparisons to Sahun of the Dead would be rife when this was released, so what did he do? He hires Frost and Nira Park, to co-star and produce the film respectively. Bedcause even though this isn't anytihng like Shaun of the dead, the comparisons cannot be helped.But the film is wonderful, thanks to the lively directing, and the endearing qualities of our anti-heroes. These are not criminals, these are just bored, scared lonely people who just want attention from a significant other. They are unlikable at first, but once you spend more time with them, you root for them, a lot.Whittaker is fantastic as the victim who joins her attackers in defending themselves from the aliens, and this is a genius move from the film-makers, as there is always that tension and element of hate throughout the groups schematics.As for the monsters, they are good and are Predator like, and the film just has that right amount of horror, to make it feel more like 'Gremlins' than another gore soaked feature.Frost is wasted and does nothing or adds nothing to the film, and despite what you have heard, the film is funny, but it's not a rip roaring comedy. This is a film about survival, and saving the day, but knowing that you won't get recognition in this situation, because no matter ehat the people in this film do to help, they will always be branded a s hooligans by the Daily Mail Brain-washees.But all in all, this is a great movie, with plot-holes aplenty, but a good cross between the goonies and gremlins, with lots of swearing.",Attack the Block
23,trashgang,no comedy for me,6,27 February 2012,"Super 8, Kick-Ass, Let The Right On In and I can go on and on, are all flicks were teenagers are the heroes. It's clear that those kind of flicks are the new thing and are popular. If I say Twilight then you know what I mean. Attack The Block is the next thing but it also has some extra-terrestrials on board. It got nominated at the BAFTA's in 2012 so the hype was on. But immediately some critics broke this flick down and I can agree somehow with them. It starts of pretty well but after a while the alien attackers aren't anymore the number one issue. Attack The Block did add some criticism to the society and that's normal because last year some parts of London really had some riots and gangs conquering the blocks. And it is there that this flick fails a bit. Due the reason that the aliens aren't the main problem after a while it falls into a normal flick. Bye bye Sci-Fy. On the part of the so-called comedy I just can say that I never laughed it out. I love British comedy but here I didn't saw anything to laugh. Maybe the expectations were a bit too high because the sleeve says 'made by the producer of Shaun Of The Dead' and even Nick Frost from Shaun Of The Dead couldn't but any humor into the acting. Nevertheless the acting was okay and again I loved the cockney accent and there is one nasty shot in it but overall it's a typical teenager flick.

24,siderite,British film quality in a fun and thrilling sci/fi horror,9,28 December 2011,"The movie that comes most to mind when I think of Attack the Block is La Horde. The same block of flats where the characters take last refuge against the mindless invading forces, the same combination of anti- heroes instead of the usual pristine moral compass do-gooders that abound in other films of the genre, the same ambivalent look at the city subculture, part critique, part defensive rationalization. But that is where the resemblance ends. The Horde was a hard movie to stomach because of the pointless actions of the people involved and the artificial violence that was pushed down the viewer's throat. In the end, the heroes in La Horde seemed just as mindless as the zombies attacking them. In Attack the Block the gang kids that got caught in the middle of this were acting according to their social class, but also had personalities of their own and the subtle messages meant to expose the life of some London residents got more powerful because of that. The aliens were not shown too much, but what was shown was ingenious and bright.Bottom line: for a horror/sci-fi movie this was a very good one. It used the available people and ideas to their potential and in the end I could not be disappointed of anything in the film. As the American cinema petrifies into standard pieces to fill the needs of audience statistical groups and while French cinema goes forward with its attempts to shock the viewers, British cinema brings quality of ideas and acting, which is what I value most in movies. Well done, Brits!",Attack the Block
25,Red-Barracuda,Tedious and formulaic,3,16 May 2011,"Considering that this was written and directed by Joe Cornish, co-creator of The Adam & Joe Show this film has to be considered a huge disappointment. Joe Cornish is clearly a very funny man who has proved himself original and creative in his past output; all things that can simply not be attributed to Attack the Block, which is a movie that is neither funny, original nor creative in any way whatsoever. The story is a pretty hackneyed tale about an invasion of vicious dog-like aliens who trap a group of people in a London tower block. People-trapped-in-a building-while-ruthless-enemies-try-to-get-in-and-kill-them movies are almost a genre to themselves. From Night of the Living Dead to Assault on Precinct 13 to Dog Soldiers, this is a pretty well-worn idea. But those films did at least provide some thrills and excitement, Attack the Block suffers from not really being one thing or another. While it's a sci-fi action film, it isn't terribly exciting, on the other hand it clearly is written to work as a comedy but it isn't funny at all. This leaves its central idea, which is at best tired. The characters for the most part are made up of a gang of hoodies. A more tedious bunch of people you will be hard pushed to encounter. It's basically impossible to care for them at all. While the aliens themselves are clearly designed in such a way that allows them to be created with as little expense as possible. They are basically black balls of fur with fangs, or to put it another way like Dennis the Menace's dog Gnasher with fluorescent fangs. They are a pretty uninspired and lacking creation to say the least. And that is ultimately what has to be said about this film. Joe Cornish is a talented man but this is not good.",Attack the Block
26,Hellmant,A great homage to the critter flicks of the 80's without becoming too tongue in cheek.,9,19 October 2011,"'ATTACK THE BLOCK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) British sci-fi/horror creature feature from first time filmmaker Joe Cornish (writer and director). The film is satirical at times but at the same time packed with tense well paced action and monster gore. It's reminiscent to the critter flicks of the 80's (like 'GREMLINS' and 'CRITTERS') and pays great homage to them without becoming too tongue in cheek. The story revolves around a small group of teenage 'wannabe' gang members in South London who find themselves fighting for their lives, and defending their block, against alien creatures falling from the sky. It stars a group of pretty unknown British youths as well as popular comedic actor Nick Frost (of 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD' and 'HOT FUZZ' fame). The film is an all around impressive debut for Cornish.The film opens with a teenage gang in Kennington, lead by Moses (John Boyega), mugging a nurse, named Sam (Jodie Whittaker), as she walks home. As they're robbing her something crashes into a nearby car and distracts the boys while Sam runs away. They soon learn that the object is some sort of an extraterrestrial creature and chase it in to a shed, in a nearby park, where they corner it and kill it. Thinking it might be worth something they take it to the local drug dealer, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), who runs the block. Tension quickly becomes apparent between Hi-Hatz and Moses as he agrees to let them stash the creature in his 'weed room'. As the boys are leaving more monsters continue to fall from the sky and as they begin to hunt these ones down they learn they're much deadlier than the other. As they flee for their lives they cross paths with Sam again as well as Ron (Frost), who works for Hi-Hatz, and Brewis (Luke Treadaway), one of Ron's clients.The film, in my opinion, has just the right combination of action, thrills and laughs. It pokes a little fun at itself but never to the point of self mocking. This is a serious creature feature and has enough cool critter action to thrill most monster movie fans. It is a great throwback to the kids vs. monsters films of the 80's but always remains true to it's characters and it's story. These kids swear and obviously aren't role models from the get go. The film is R rated and never becomes sappy, overly emotional or kid friendly. The characters are relatable and the young actors portraying them all do an impressive job. The film has a pretty cool and imaginative indie film look that doesn't over do it with visual effects. Cornish has a nice directing style and I can't wait to see what he does next. This is a great jumpstart for him and a great monster movie treat for fans this Halloween!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OZUY3a_KI",Attack the Block

For one, you have to like the bad guys – siding with the opposition and put up with the dialect of 2-year-olds. I understand its dark-humor, but it got extremely tedious hearing one word sentences by these buffoons – no, not the alien buffoons, but close – even if it was supposed to be ""realistic."" That said, it's recommended for those who like both alien-invasion stories and something fresh. For as low budget as this promises, it has just that: promise. And a new scaled down, even lower than Cloverfield, and more intimate view of us VS them. It's a watch. (3/5 stars)",Attack the Block

It's actually quite a tense watch because, not only does it aptly establish real stakes relatively early on, the aliens themselves are wonderfully tangible and feel like palpable presences within every scene in which they appear, always ready to tear out a throat no matter if it belongs to a hardened criminal or an innocent child. It's this balance, of proper danger and grit with an equal level of fast-paced fun, that makes the flick as exciting and generally delightful as it is. It actually feels like a breath of fresh air, in some ways, even though it conforms to its genre, mainly because it's just so totally efficient and, as such, so totally effective. 7/10",Attack the Block
31,bowmanblue,"Not bad, if you can get over one factor...",7,9 March 2018,"I know that British science fiction films are always a bit hit and miss, due to the lack of budget for special effects and actors. 'Attack the Block' is no different in as much as you probably won't recognise anyone in the cast (besides Simon Pegg's best mate, Nick Frost - and he's not in it much). However, this film knows that and plays to its strength enough to actually make it worth watching. It's set in (what I always called) a 'council estate' in London, but the locals tend to just call it 'the block.' It's a maze of run-down high rise, low income flats where you probably wouldn't want to walk alone at night. And that's pretty much where the story begins - a woman walks home from work, only to find herself fall victim to muggers. However, before she has time to call the police, a new threat arrives - aliens.So, it becomes one of those 'team-up' movies where two sets of people with vastly contrasting backgrounds/values etc, have to pull together in order to defat a greater foe. Now there's nothing wrong with that, but if one section of your 'heroes' (note the quote marks?) are the muggers who stole from a helpless nurse one night, it's a little hard to see them in much more of a better light than the monsters who are now ripping them to pieces. And they do get munched on quite soon. The aliens deserve a mention because - and maybe due to a lack of budget - they quite simple, but, at the same time, also quite well done. They have a different look and feel to any other monsters you've seen on screen and, for that, it actually works.Plus the film has John Boyega in his only real 'pre Star Wars' role. It's interesting to think how he went from low budget sci-fi to possibly the biggest budget sci-fi franchise ever known. Now, as anyone who's watched the new Star Wars films will know, he's very good at what he does and highly watchable. However, as I've mentioned, he's playing one of the muggers. Granted you could argue he goes through major 'character development' and in the course of the story mends his ways, but - again - a lot of the likeability of this film relies on the audience being able to root for these hoods over the monsters.So, if you can get over that 'minor' gripe then there's actually quite a bit here to entertain you if you're looking for a cheeky little sci-fi/horror number that is self-knowing enough not to take itself seriously. Plus I still think the aliens are cool.",Attack the Block
32,ThomasDrufke,Serviceable Invasion Film,6,10 February 2019,"Attack the Block is like The Goonies meets Predator meets Gremlins meets It meets Cloverfield, and for the most part that works. I think I appreciate Joe Cornish's directing and those various nods/inspirations so clearly visible in the final product, than I do the movie itself. This is essentially where John Boyega got his start, with Jodie Whittaker (from Doctor Who fame) also making a pretty nice breakthrough here as well. It won't blow the doors off any cliches linked to invasion films, nor is it all that re-watchable, but it has its charm.

And brimming with gang values, they will go it alone, they will not even ask for help.Great premise, brilliant and engaging execution.

Although classified as a horror comedy, the horror outweighs the comedy by miles, and the comedy are merely humorist elements, and not the slapstick I expected.Instead, what is offered here is a thrilling, action-packed, nail-biting horror thriller with the most unlikely bunch of heroes. The action hits you before even reaching the 5-minute mark, and never ceases. It literally is a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Solid performances and a good script elevate the film way above some other films in the genre. John Boyega in particular was very good as Moses, the film's hero.The soundtrack is vibrant and moves the film along at a fast pace. The visual effects and make-up are also excellent.

36,sol-,Monsters versus Monsters,6,17 May 2017,"Mutual distrust turns to uneasy alliance as an alien invasion forces a group of British teens to work together with a nurse who they mugged in this action thriller starring John Boyega as the leader of the teen gang. Boyega is just as effective here as in 'The Force Awakens', giving his hardened character a vulnerable, human side bubbling beneath the surface. The actors who play his young friends are well cast too. Jodie Whitaker is less effective as the nurse and Nick Frost is criminally underused, but in general, there is a lot to like about how the characters interact here. There are even some scattered comic moments to be had in how everyone from the teenagers' girlfriends to the local teen drug lord scoffs at their claims of being under alien attack. The gradual bonding between Whitaker and the teens, who she initially describes a ""monsters"", in the face of *real* monsters is where the film succeeds best though - so much so that the action sequences end up being a low point of the movie. Without any eyes and glowing sharp jaws, the creatures are quite unsettling to look at, but all the attack scenes become a little repetitive with the film sagging towards the middle. The movie certainly ends on a very high note, however, with a third act that potently pushes the film's single biggest message about teen thugs always being misunderstood and never properly recognised.",Attack the Block

The angle is simply in it's setting. We are introduced to a bunch of generic, stereotypical 'hoodies' on a London high-rise estate. After an attempt to mug a young woman, lights begin to fall from the sky. What ensues is a battle between the ""yoof"" protecting their block.This is no great film, the general idea, and it's execution are standard for the genre. What is evident is Cornish's confidence in directing. The actors ""under the hoods"" are quite brilliant, displaying both the hard exterior that they portray on the ""streets"", but also their tender side, whilst along the way highlighting the reasons these young men are so disenfranchised; they are all from broken homes. This is quite a poignant issues when juxtaposed with the scenes of riots we saw in London this summer.It must be hard to come up with new 'alien' monsters these days. We've seen in recent years some diabolically b******s monsters, but the creatures in this film are different and quite exception. Wolf-like, they seemingly have no eyes, and are completely black. Much of the early part of the film we see only shadows, silhouettes, until they open their mouths, displaying glow-in-the-dark gnashers.Whilst not a ground breaking cinematic masterpiece, or even a great film, it has much to love. It has charm, some good performances, and the tension is palpable at times.

38,TheMovieDiorama,Attack The Block is probably the most exciting film featuring a London council block.,5,19 May 2018,"Although that's not saying much, let's be honest. Aliens tend to strike landmarks or major capital cities. We've seen the White House explode, The Great Wall of China infiltrated and the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed. So it's quite refreshing to focus all the science fiction energy into a block of flats on the outskirts of London, but that is where the originality ends. The plot is as simple as you think, aliens fall from the sky and hunt down a group of youths in a council estate where they must defend themselves and save the planet. British B-Movie goodness is the best way to describe this unusual flick. Illustrating the intimidation of youths (""chavs"" between you and I) that lurk in the darkness which is then turned around to view them as fearful. It subtly conveys the adaption these delinquents need to make in order to fit into the environment they reside in, where they are simply forgotten about. However, any meaningful themes are tossed aside to make way for simple entertainment. ""Black gorilla wolves"" galloping through dimly lit corridors, screeching with their neon blue jaws. Extremely basic designs yet these extraterrestrials are certainly memorable. Acting was functional, Boyega and Whittaker shining above the rest. My judgement for this film simply comes down to my own personal taste, which is why I think it is mediocre at best. I physically cannot stand the accent. ""Oi fam I'll merk u boi init, don't touch me fam yeah? I'll cuss u."". It's like a complete different language, I honestly need the subtitles on. The rapid execution of dialogue means I can't keep up with what is being said, therefore negating any humour that is injected into the screenplay. Speaking of the script, it's hit and miss. The British wit works well but, again, some of the lines really don't have any effect on me. The film pretty much starts immediately, leaving no time for character development or backstory. As a consequence, the characters are expendable. Perfectly watchable sci-fi, just not to my taste.",Attack the Block
39,matthewssilverhammer,Perfect,10,30 July 2019,"If we're gonna differentiate between ""movies"" & ""films"", then Attack the Block is a movie. It's also proof that the way we use the term ""movie"" in that sense as patronizing & derisive is not only unfair, it's the height of pretension. This is one of the most authentic alien invasion movies of all time; the humor, the confusion, the fear. The human characters are not only relatable but incredibly dimensional. Easily the greatest Amblin descendant in years, & one of my new favorites that I could see watching again & again.",Attack the Block
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Refreshingly small-scale alien invasion horror film,7,24 May 2012,"Alien invasions are a dime a dozen these days. Studios feel self-assured that the public takes note on the calendar every time a movie promises to lay waste to a major metropolis at the hands of angered or ruthless extraterrestrials. So with studios trying to one-up each other by expanding the scope of skyscraper carnage, what a peculiar choice for Joe Cornish to go microcosm and set ""Attack the Block"" in a small sector of South London.Budget limitations might have capped Cornish's threshold for mayhem, but based on the tone of his film, he wouldn't have used bigger funds to up the scale of destruction. He offers us ""Attack the Block"" as character and horror-driven counter-programming to today's invasion blockbusters.The alien menace in this film is markedly different, as are its protagonists, an inherently unlikable gang of South London teens. While they're mugging a woman (Jodie Whittaker), a strange creature crashes on the street right next to them. When it lashes out, the boys promptly kill it and then drag it to the drug dealer (Nick Frost) living in their block in hopes of finding out what it is and upping their street cred, but soon after, several shadowy beasts with glowing blue teeth fall from the sky and bound after them.Most of the action takes place in or around the block, and few people other than the central characters get roped into the invasion. In that sense the film plays out more as a horror film in which the gang (and coincidentally the woman they mugged) must fend off and outsmart the creatures, who are trying to pick them off. Cornish balances suspense, action and gore to keep the genre a bit more ambiguous.What's most impressive about the story is that the characters grow on us over time. Normally it's hard to care about the characters in a horror or alien invasion film unless they are well developed, but here's a case in which the characters truly develop as the film wears on and by the end we're quite fond of them.John Boyega as the gang leader, Moses, steals the show. He has the look and temperament of a young Denzel Washington. Although we never truly understand who he is—at least not until near the end—we sense the pain behind his eyes and his life's frustrations as he stands up to the aliens. Other characters, notably Pest (Alex Esmail) serve to add comedy and diversify the personalities to make the film more interesting.Parts of the film drag and much of what happens could be deemed predictable, but Cornish puts a certain spirit into the film, not to mention a greater social message about how to treat other people that most big-budget films tend to graze over. Combined with some fun stylization to the action and events, this is the kind of film that's easy to root for, even if its far from mind-blowing.~Steven CThanks for reading!

41,southdavid,Finn Valour,6,8 October 2019,"Can't believe this film is already 8 years old. This was only my second viewing after an initial watch at the cinema at the time of release but I'm working through my physical media collection and landed on this.Moses (John Boyega) leads his little gang of South London kids, mugging, dealing and causing issues around his estate. Following a mugging of local nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) an asteroid crashes into a nearby car. The Asteroid is actually a transport an alien life form, who attacks Moses. The boys kill the alien and drag it back to their block of flats, hoping that it will be their ticket to fame and fortune - but then more asteroids crash down and the invasion has begun.There's much to admire about ""Attack The Block"" striking whilst the ""Shaun Of The Dead"" flame was still relatively hot - it follows the formula of recognisable UK set-up meets extreme science fiction scenario though it dials down the comedy a little and dials up the action somewhat. I love the creature effects for the aliens in the film, it really does remind me of looking at the Space Invaders cabinet and seeing them come to life. The film does a lot with it's small budget with both physical and CG effects. The three actors whose careers were on the rise Boyega, Whittaker and Luke Treadaway are all pretty good, Nick Frost provides a bit of comic relief. The film looks good and is atmospheric. But whilst I do still quite enjoy the film, despite Edgar Wright producing, ""Attack The Block"" is not as good as ""SOTD"".Unfortunately, there are bits of it that don't ring true. They mostly revolve around the older Gangster character. It makes sense at the start, for him to be out for revenge on the boys after the car crash - but it remains his sole focus even after he knows that there is an alien invasion taking place. Initially the boys aren't sympathetic, but you (or at least I) warmed to them a bit as you realise how young they still are and learn a bit about their backgrounds. But also, plot wise the film is lacking a little towards the final third. Maybe this was as a result of the 15 pages that had to be cut for budgetary reasons but for me, it's what stops the film at the ""OK"" stage rather than ""excellent"".",Attack the Block
42,jamesrupert2014,Hard to separate my distaste for the main characters from my appreciation of an entertaining tongue-in-cheek sci-fi romp,5,10 November 2020,"On Guy Fawkes Day, five youths mug a young women, taking her phone and purse, pushing her to the ground, and threatening her with a knife when she is slow to remove her ring - and then the 'comedy' starts. While I appreciate that the film is about redemption and recognition of the consequences of one's actions (and that I am not the target demographic in several categories), I took so strong a dislike to the five boys in the opening scene that I spent most of the film cheering for the aliens (and the cops). That said, the film is entertaining and there are some funny moments (especially the two young kids tagging along). John Boyega is pretty good in the lead (just don't think about the sans-aliens reality of his character's life trajectory) and I liked future Dr. Who Jodie Whittaker as the foul-mouthed 'mugging victim turned ally' substantially more than I like her as the iconic Time Lord. In the end, I enjoyed the film more than I expected I would (despite the liberal-apologist undertone) but certainly can understand why some people despise it.",Attack the Block
43,BeneCumb,"Okay for the debut, but otherwise questionable in many ways",5,16 February 2013,"Apart from the alien figures, the characters, lifestyle and values seem to be (painfully) realistic, but is there any reason to promote them? Is it cool to be a wrongdoer or addict and hope for a bigger heroic deed to redeem your recent sins and torts? The idea of the film is trivial, the actors are not catchy, the attackers are like kingkonggodzillas and the plot has multiple unlikely scenes. The course of events is not boring, but often annoying, moving towards predictable ending.I am amazed why this film has received so many honors and praise. Well, I can picture its audience, but it should be restricted to them due to strong language and propagation of wrong values... There are dozens of better films depicting fight against evil within a block/compound.",Attack the Block
44,freemantle_uk,Inner City vs. Outer Space,8,19 May 2011,"Attack the Block continues 2011 of aliens on Earth, starting with Battle: Los Angles and Paul and with Cowboys and Aliens and Super 8.On Guy Fawkes Night in a council estate in South London our gang of teenage protagonists lead by Moses (John Boyega) bravely mug our heroine, newly qualified nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) when a alien clashes down to Earth. Their natural response is to kick the living s**t out of it and celebrate their triumph. But more aliens start to land on Earth, large, hairy, pitch black beasts with grow in the dark teeth. With the aliens gathering on the estate the gang have to tool themselves up to fight this deadly menace.Attack the Block is another send up of typically American genres by Big Talk Productions, the company that made Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. For me it is great to see that alien do invade outside the USA. Attack the Block is a very competent debut by Joe Cornish who combines a witty script with lots of action and horror in an 88 minute package. There was a certain B-Movie clarm to film, a little like John Carpenter with characters grabbing whatever they can for weapons, including a katana, the way the score sounds and even the font for the title. For horror fans there is plenty of violence and gore to keep you happy and the aliens are effective monsters with their long black hair and glowing teeth. Cornish needs to be praised for using as little CGI as possible.Comedy veteran Nick Frost provides the most laughs as a drug dealer who shall a little apathetic to the situation. Most of the actors are good and believable, many of them being unprofessional youngsters. The dialogue felt like it was improvised and makes the characters sound more natural and funny. Boyega certainly has a lot of potential and I hope he sticks to acting.There is however a tonal shift in the film, from a light-hearted affair to something more serious as the film moved on. Attack the Block is funny but it needed to spread its humour more evenly. There are some running gags through the film, some working better then others. The little kids who want to be hard-men are funny as they try to be like the gang, but the middle-class university student played by Luke Treadaway, becoming annoying: possibly because I found him too stereotypical.Overall, this is the best alien based comedy starring Nick Frost this year.",Attack the Block
45,dee.reid,"The ""Block"" is hot in ""Attack the Block""",10,10 November 2011,"""Attack the Block"" is very easily one of the best new films of 2011, and it's unfortunate that the film did not receive a whole lot of attention here in the United States, despite positive praise from critics. I guess like most sci-fi films, especially British features like ""Attack the Block,"" will in time become cult classics like so many others before it.People have often compared this film to ""Gremlins"" (1984) and ""The Goonies"" (1985). That's a fair comparison, but an inaccurate one, I feel. I think a better, more accurate comparison for ""Attack the Block"" would be ""Menace II Society"" (1993) and ""The Warriors"" (1979) meets ""Critters"" (1986) and ""Alien"" (1979).""Attack the Block"" is science fiction in the 21st century at its fastest, funniest and goriest, with its own unique version of un-preachy social commentary about slum life. The latter part brings me to the most widely debated aspect of this picture: unlike most sci-fi movies, the heroes of ""Attack the Block"" are not the military, police, brainy scientists, or determined everyday civilians. No, the ""heroes"" of this film are five violent teenage thugs who on any other night would continue to rob, harass, and beat up any South Londoner unfortunate enough to cross their paths.But the wow-factor of ""Attack the Block"" comes from the fact that this is no ordinary night in South London for this scrappy band of teenage hoodlums. The leading five young toughs at the center of this picture - hard-as-nails gang leader Moses (Jon Boyega), fireworks-loving pyromaniac Pest (Alex Esmail), nerd-ish Jerome (Leeon Jones), mo-hawked Dennis (Franz Drameh), and the daredevil Biggz (Simon Howard) - in the beginning of the film are in the process of mugging Nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) after she's just gotten off work. Although the gang seizes many of her belongings, before they can do any further harm to her a meteorite crashes into a nearby car. Sam takes off back to her apartment in the midst of the confusion.The five youths investigate the crashed meteorite and find themselves confronted by a nasty, scaly reptilian extraterrestrial monstrosity that is brutally dispatched in just one of the film's many young-toughs-vs.-bad-ass-alien-monster confrontations throughout the entire night. Led by the fearless, hardened Moses, the five stock up on baseball bats, swords, knives, Super Soakers, and any other degree of improvised weaponry that they can scrape up in time to confront an alien invasion head-on. And somewhere in there, five remorseless young thugs go from being remorseless young thugs to brave young heroes, however marginalized, over the course of one bloody, fright-filled night on the streets - and later an apartment complex - of a rough South London neighborhood. But it is worth noting, however, that the gang's actions aren't motivated so much by saving humanity from an extraterrestrial infestation as they are initiating a form of urban territorial-ism (they're defending the ""block"" - that term comes up a lot here - from beastly outsiders).I have to say that it is unfortunate that this film asks us to empathize with, even grow to like, a gang of brutal South London punks who are all that stands between us and furry, bear-/wolf-like alien monsters that seem to consist mostly of green luminescent teeth. It is also unfortunate that in well-known American movie classics like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and countless others, we're asked to sympathize with gun-toting bank robbers, aging outlaws and murderous jewel thieves, respectively, but we nonetheless respect those movies for whatever reasons we find those pictures worth praising.So why can't we do the same for a group of five young toughs from a poor section of South London? I found these characters remarkably three-dimensional and well-written by writer-director Joe Cornish (in his film debut) because these kids realize that they're not the most dangerous things on the streets on this particular night. And they also realize that because of where they live, calling the authorities is out of the question, because, why would the police or fire department ever venture into such a rough section of the city were it not absolutely necessary (and without a military escort)? Even Sam, through spoiler-revealing plot details that I refuse to divulge, joins the gang and eventually comes to see that things with the five youths are way more complicated than they appear. They're impoverished and from bad backgrounds and prey on the weaknesses of others (like her) because they can, yes, but again they've realized that they're fighting something that is far beyond your typical rival gangs or vengeful neighborhood drug dealers.For me personally, I found the young toughs in ""Attack the Block"" to be truly sympathetic for the fact that they're kids facing a terrifying enemy and as such, are not totally beyond some form of minor redemption as a result of their actions (as this film's ending proves). Out of the characters, it is Jon Boyega's determined portrayal of gang leader Moses that he becomes the most bold and ""heroic"" of the five (even though I'm somewhat partial to calling smart-alecky explosives-expert Pest my favorite of them all); Moses is forced to confront the grim reality of his lifestyle and the pain that it's brought to those he's victimized and where it might eventually lead him in the long run. It's a daring performance from a virtual nobody that can't be copied by someone who's more experienced as an actor.Since this movie's from the producers of ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), it features some hilarious moments of much-needed comedy relief, provided mostly by pot dealer Ron (""Shaun"" Nick Frost) and his #1 customer, stoner college student Brewis (Luke Treadaway). Lastly, the movie was released in the wake of the London riots earlier this summer and adds an eerie prescience to everything. ""Attack the Block"" is only the most surprising sci-fi/action movie of the year.10/10",Attack the Block

47,estebangonzalez10,This is how you can make a good monster movie with a low budget,7,12 January 2012,"¨Dogs? What kind of dogs those? Dogs with no eyes? Dogs the size of  gorillas? You think them things are dogs? Go out there and try feeding  them some Pedigree Chum! They're ALIENS, luv! ¨ Attack the Block is one  of those small films that absolutely caught me by surprise. This is Joe  Cornish's first feature film and he delivers a very entertaining movie  with the right amount of comedy mixed with horror. I am not a huge  horror fan, and find most these movies stupid, but Attack the Block was  really a delight to watch on screen. This is a British movie with a  bunch of unknown actors, but they are just great together in this  movie, which was also written by Cornish himself. The dialogue is fun,  the action scenes are entertaining, and the horror although low budget  works really well. The aliens are simplistic but cool looking with  their glow in the dark teeth. At first the movie seems like it is going  nowhere, but as it progresses the plot continues to get better and  better all the way to the climatic ending. Nick Frost is probably the  only known actor in this movie and he's barely in it, but it doesn't  matter because the rest of the cast leaded by John Boyega and Jodie  Whittaker don't disappoint. They give believable performances and also  have several funny lines throughout the film. This is a movie which  should be taken lightly; it's not meant to be a scary horror film that  will have you at the edge of your seat. It kind of works in the same  way Zombieland worked in America, although this film had a much more  restricted budget. Most of the action takes place at a block in South  London so the constraints work quite well.  The movie begins with Sam (Jodie Whittaker) walking down a dark street  in South London, when all of a sudden she gets robbed by a group of  young teens. The leader of the gang, Moses (John Boyega), points a  knife at her and steals her cell phone, wallet, and ring. The other  four guys involved in the robbery are Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz  Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), and Biggz (Simon Howard), who all seem  delighted with how things went. The kids are young and act like their  gangsters, but you can tell they're just wannabes. On the way back to  their block something like a meteor falls from the sky and smashes a  car. When Moses goes to look inside he gets his face scratched by some  sort of alien, and in a moment of outrage kills the alien along with  his buddies. They take the corpse back to the block where they live and  show it off to their friends. They tell Moses to take the body to Ron  (Nick Frost) who lives near the top of the block and who knows a lot  about animals since he watches a lot of National Geographic to see if  he can identify the species. Ron is a drug dealer who happens to be  dealing with Brewis (Luke Treadaway) when the gang arrives. While they  are trying to discover what sort of alien or animal they are dealing  with they see several more meteors falling from the sky and decide to  go hunt these creatures, although soon they will realize that perhaps  it's the other way around and that they are the hunted ones.  I have to admit that at first I didn't think this movie would succeed  since the main characters seemed to be quite unlikeable. I mean who  would want to root for these criminals? But after the first few minutes  went by and when things began to turn around and the teens became the  victims the film grew on me. John Boyega gives a great performance and  he will be one to watch. He has great facial expressions and made for a  memorable character. Attack the Block is extremely short and the movie  is really fast paced but it manages to explain the plot pretty well  with the little time it had and doesn't leave thing unexplained like in  other sci-fi films. The soundtrack is also pretty catchy and works well  with to establish the mood of the movie. The gore scenes are pretty  fake, but it doesn't matter because it isn't really the issue. For the  most part things occur behind the camera, but there are a few gory  scenes. This movie isn't supposed to be scary, it's more of a sci-fi  comedy with some interesting action scenes. Attack the Block is a small  film and probably not as easy to come across by, but if you get the  opportunity to watch this than by all means do because you won't be  disappointed. It's not a masterpiece, but it is very entertaining and  fun.",Attack the Block

Funny, but I don't ever remember The Goonies pulling a knife on an innocent woman.The ""protagonists"" here are annoying and despicable, and though that's clearly the intention, it doesn't make the film any more palatable. I don't know if this is intended to be a spoof or satire, but whatever it was trying to be, what it ultimately ends up being is awful.Despite playing such irritating characters, the young cast show tremendous promise, and from a technical standpoint the movie is capably made.

""Gremlins"" & ""Predator"".Also the ""Gang"" film genre is at play here with echos of ""The Warriors"" & of Course lots of ""John Carpenter"" thrown in to the mix!!!The excellent British director Joe Cornish really knows & loves movies, especially old school 70's & 80's Genre films as his Cool Debut ""Attack the Block"" feels & looks like it was carved from the film universe of flicks such as ""The Warriors"" ""Escape from New York"" ""Aliens"" ""Critters"" & many more great ""Cult Classic"" pure genre films but done all British.I really love the big urban tower block setting, it's a cool place to have creatures stalking around & lurking in creepy corridors so a real cool 80s almost Carpenter style atmosphere!!!It's easily one of the best ""British"" Horror films ever made & million times better than the way overrated ""Shawn of the Dead"" but ""Attack the Block"" could sit proudly next to ""Howl"" another excellent British Horror.This little gem of a movie is a nice blend of ""Genres"" as it's an Action Thriller, a Horror film, a sci-fi film & a dark Comedy!!!But the main thing about ""Attack the Block"" is it's totally ENTERTAINING.But...... we definitely needed more LIKEABLE characters because the main youth gang are really little nasty sh#ts that deserve to get munched by monsters!!! Now i admitted the gang do grow you as the film goes on & they step-up to fight for good but this film could've done with another good character to even it out abit like a Cop who gets trapped with them & hates the gang because of the trouble they cause but has to work with them to survive. That would've been my idea then we could root for the Copper more than the gang of Chavs.Like i said the gang of London youths are hard to like at first but become a nice bunch & right away the leader of the pack ""Moses"" stands out as an intense character, the tough lead played excellently by quick rising star John Boyega, He's since become huge in America & has Starred in the new ""Star Wars"" films & the sequel to ""Pacific Rim"" & more!!!Moses is an interesting character as he's only 15 yrs old but carries himself like an older wiser guy & keeps a serious moody face throughout the film, he becomes more than just a loser street thug,he becomes a Hero.The look & cinematography is very slick & the urban setting is a big part of this cool flick, the block is an enclosed fortress that works for the intense claustrophobic atmosphere & for the small budget but looks great,
The tower Block is used for scary effect with it's many dark corridors it's how the legendary ""John Carpenter"" would've used it for that intense mood he creates, well ""Carpenter"" was an influence with his 70s CLASSIC ""Assault on precinct 13"" where we get the tooled up gang trapped in a single block that's shut off from the rest of the city & with an enemy army trying to get in & kill everyone!!! Very ""Carpenter"" & very ""Precinct 13""
& the music is very retro & Awesome!!!""Attack the Block"" shows you don't need endless explosions of c.g.i or huge mega budgets to make an excellent fantasy Horror film, it's all made very low-key & old school, small scale & confined to one Block for the monster invasion, it's a little fun film, but you first have to look past the little idiot street thugs 'cause at first you want them to get ripped apart!!!The tone dark & dangerous but its still funny,exciting,creepy & action packed with lots of great moments & the gore is great with blood splatter & limbs ripped up, great monster movie stuff!!!The Alien Creatures look Awesome with their jet black fur & glowing fangs they are a great design & so stripped back & basic that it works perfectly for the low-budget & the simple look of a new kind of movie monster & they are some of the Coolest creatures I've seen in a long time.Attack the Block is pure fun entertainment with exciting action scenes, funny moments & scary monsters & as a bonus it's set in London so that's different!!!This is so rewatchable & entertaining & makes a great flick to watch over the Halloween period, a little Low budget genre film & an amazing piece of work from a film loving Director who really worked so hard with a limited little budget to craft a great movie that strangely feels familiar & fresh at the same time!!!",Attack the Block

The leader of the gang attacks the alien, gets some scratches in the process and then kills it. They kids take the alien corpse to their drug dealer boss. Little do they know that plenty of more aliens followed. Now they get attacked by a different kind of alien. Larger, hairier and with lots of glowing teeth. Now it's up to the kids to save their housing complex- called the Block with whatever rudimentary weapons they can find, some pistols, fireworks, machetes, and so on.They realize under the blue light of the marijuana greenhouse that the leader of the gang is covered in some substance released by the first little alien and it's that what attracts all the other large aliens.Attack the Block has a good idea, it's somewhat different, has neat special effects. The aliens at least look pretty amazing. Sure, little thugs aren't exactly the kind of characters you root for. But given the settings and the characters, this movie should be hilarious. It's disappointingly only mildly funny. In part because the main characters are just kids. I don't know what rating this movie got in the UK, but there's little here that justifies the US R rating. Had they taken advantage of that rating, it could have been a bit more edgy.",Attack the Block

Firstly this is set on a council estate in South London , not an obvious setting for an alien movie and secondly the humans that are under attack are so horrible that you want the aliens to win.Attack The Block is the directorial debut of comedian Joe Cornish and i have to say he's done a pretty good job. How he managed to get so many sub lower class morons who talk in the horrible urban Blacklish language seem so interesting, is really surprising. Because the characters are so unlikable you have do give a lot of credit the the cast of young actors.Another plus points are the aliens. Jet black bear like monsters that have fluorescent blue teeth .

53,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Sci-Fi/Horror Film with Social Commentary,8,23 July 2021,"This film is one that I saw back when I was working at Family Video. I don't believe I took it home as a pre-street, but it was one that I saw the trailer for while working on the weekends. My sister watched it with me and I'm sure we both liked it after that viewing. I probably haven't seen this in a decade. The synopsis is a teen gang in South London defends their block from an alien invasion.We start with a young woman leaving work. She is a nurse by the name of Sam (Jodie Whittaker). She got out late and it is dark out. To pass the time she is chatting with her mother on the phone. A celebration is going on with fireworks. On her way she is blocked by a group of hoodlums by Moses (John Boyega). With him are Pest (Alex Esmail), Jerome (Leeon Joenes), Dennis (Franz Drameh) and Biggz (Simon Howard). They rob her of her purse, her phone and a ring she is wearing. During this attack, something falls from the sky onto a nearby parked car.Moses goes to steal what he can from it and is attacked by whatever crashed into the car. It scratches his face, which makes him angry and thing flees. With his gang they chase after it, cornering it inside a shed where they kill it.They return to their block riding high from their conquest and go up to a weed grower who lives on the top floor. They bring the dead alien to store in his weed room until they figure out what to do with it. While there, Moses talks to the local gangster who runs the area, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter). He recruits Moses and gives him drugs to sell for him.Moses returns to his friends to see more things falling from the sky. They decide to get weapons and kill more of them. While this goes on, Sam goes to the police about the attack and they tell her that they will make a pass of the area to find them.When the gang gets out there, they find out these monsters are a lot larger, angrier and harder to kill. Moses gets busted by the cops and as they are locking him up, they get attacked. To make their escape, Moses steals their van along with Sam in the back and a few of his friends. They try to hide it in a parking garage. The problem becomes during their escape, they crash into Hi'Hatz' car and pissing off this gangster.The gang escapes back to the block, with the aliens following and seeming know where they are at all times. Plus with Hi-Hatz angry and on their trail, will they survive this attack?That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie and where I want to start is stating that I'm glad I gave this one a rewatch. I enjoyed that first viewing, but watching it now, there is much more to it than I realized. First, I liked seeing this group of hoodlums from a different country. They aren't that much different from a gang of teens that they think they're hard from the United States. I think this shows that no matter where groups like this are, they are similar. I also liked seeing the reality of them as we get to know them.What I mean there is that Sam is irate with them. I should point out that her and this group clash as she lives in the same building as them. They in their own way apologize for robbing her. They have morals. Moses states they would never steal from anyone in their block. Jerome also reveals that they were terrified in robbing her. They aren't criminals yet. They are teens that have looked up to the gangsters in their area and want what they have. They are victims more of circumstance. It is even more interesting to see Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao), who are even younger kids trying to be like Moses and his gang.We also get an interesting social commentary here. Sam states that she isn't sure the police will show up. They are busy, but she doesn't live in the nicest place. That is something we see in America. We also get to see that the gang takes care of their own. There is pride in where they are from and this is definitely something we see in the US. They don't have much, but they do have their pride. This also goes back to not trusting the police. The ending really shows that and it actually makes me tear up. With that established, I love the idea of taking an alien invasion and setting it in a place like this. Since this gang takes care of their own, they will defend it with their lives.I think that gives you enough for the story and the commentary, so I will take this to the acting. I remember the first time seeing this and thought that Boyega does well as Moses. It is crazy that I didn't connect that he was Finn in the new Star Wars trilogy. I think he does a great job here as Moses. Whittaker is solid as Sam. I can understand her anger in the beginning, but the more she gets to know the gang, it makes more sense. Esmail, Jones, Drameh and Howard are all solid as these hoodlums. I liked seeing Luke Treadaway as Brewis. He's a middle class kid in the area to buy weed. It makes it even better than the weed dealer is Nick Frost. Aside from that, I thought Hunter was solid as this harder gangster, who might be full it. The rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed.Then finally I'll move this over to the effects and cinematography. For the former, I like the look of the aliens. The first one we see is a bit different from the ones later, which is good. There is a logical explanation for that and it also gives our gang a false sense of security. For the larger aliens, they are black to the point where they blend in. Now there is CGI here for their teeth that are glowing. I like this effect. It makes it look like eyes until they fully open their mouths. I could tell this was done by computers, but it didn't bother me. Aside from that, I thought the cinematography was well done.So then in conclusion here, this movie was one that I liked after my first viewing and I just appreciate it more after this second one. I think we have an interesting social commentary here following this gang of teens. We don't like them at first, but we slowly change that much like Sam. It is interesting to take an alien invasion and do it on a smaller scale. The acting fits for the characters, giving them all distinct personalities. The effects work for me, including the practical and CGI. The soundtrack also fit for what was needed. This is a good movie to me. I would definitely recommend giving this a viewing. I will warn you though; this is from the United Kingdom. The accents and slang might be a bit difficult to understand so I watch with subtitles on. I just wanted you to be aware coming into this one.",Attack the Block
54,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Attack the Block (2011),6,12 December 2011,"Attack the Block is mostly a fun alien invasion action movie, set in an untraditional setting. The aliens are thankfully quite original in their simplistic design. Just pure black hair and glow in the dark teeth. The action and gore is all well paced throughout the short running time. Whether you enjoy this or not may depend on your feelings towards the main character. In my opinion, they were too unlikable. A bunch of stupid hoodlums with a retarded moral code. At times it did well to point out the absurdity of such characters, I don't feel as though enough lessons were learned, nor was there adequate pay-off to all the characters. It also seems to try and make the heart bleed for these guys, as though we are supposed to be surprised when we find out they are kids and then excuse their actions. A bit of fun, but needed more.",Attack the Block
55,Seraphion,Nice job in turning the seriousness up,6,17 July 2015,"The story feels quite stupid by what I read on the story brief. The opening also feels stupid, especially added with the heavy South London accent. But the movie can nicely use its whole duration to ramp up viewers' seriousness and attention towards itself, without ever really losing the whole mess-around laid-back stoner and gangster attitude. The side conflicts are in fact the things which kept the movie grounded and real, since the original premise is too stupid to continue on its own. I like how the movie can really create a launch pad for some of it's cast members like John Boyega or Franz Drameh. The overall acting looks quite nice to me, especially since the cast can nicely help the movie to achieve some degree of seriousness atop this quite stupid original premise.",Attack the Block
56,brando647,Alien Invaders vs. South London Hood-rats,8,15 December 2011,"Here is another example of a great movie that will go largely unnoticed to American audiences until it's eventually remade into a subpar summer blockbuster that will most likely do no justice to the original. It's a British film with a main cast consisting of newcomers and only two recognizable faces, so most people would probably breeze over it when presented with the chance of watching it. It really is a shame. It's even more impressive when you realize it's director Joe Cornish's first feature film. It's a new spin on the usual alien invasion plot with a group of inner city London hood-rats encountering an alien that crashes to Earth and immediately beating the crap out of it. The gang are feeling pretty good about themselves after killing an alien, but they soon realize they've kick-started an entirely new series of problems as more of it's species arrive by the dozen. Only now they're bigger and meaner. As if the alien invasion weren't enough of an issue, the gang becomes the target of a local drug lord and must rely on help from a recently graduated nurse whom they'd mugged only hours before. The movie's got loads of humor and sci-fi action, and, if you're the sort of person that has a hard time deciphering thick British accents, subtitles.The alien design in this film is excellent. Rather than the usual variations on the ""little green man"" or slimy creatures, the filmmakers took a more simplistic approach that works better than most. The creatures are covered in pitch black fur that reflects no light and their jaws consist of glowing blue teeth. There is very little CG used in creating the creatures and it gives the character's reactions a bit more weight since they're responding to a man in a suit instead of a tennis ball on a pole. The creatures are a combination of fantastic costuming with a bit of CG polish, and move with incredible realism thanks to Terry Notary. The rest of the cast does an admirable job for their first time in a feature. As I understand it, none of the gang members have prior film experience but you'd never guess. This is especially true for John Boyega (Moses, the gang's leader) and Alex Esmail (Pest, the token white boy, stoner, and fireworks enthusiast). Pest is the crew's comic relief and, though I was sort of annoyed with him at first, has some of the funnier quips in the movie. Moses is the stone-cold head of the crew who goes from your average street-minded hoodlum who does what he needs to do to survive, to an actual hero who accepts responsibility for what's going on and accepts his position of undoing the damage he's done. I wouldn't be surprised if his role here was a launching point for Boyega's career.The supporting cast are the ""grown-ups"" caught up in the situation, including Nick Frost (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HOT FUZZ) and Luke Treadaway as stoned out comic relief. Frost really is nothing more than a bit supporting role in the film, so do go in expecting him to carry a large part of the movie. Jumayn Hunter is the movie's human villain as Hi-Hatz, a local drug lord with a vendetta against Moses and an inability to believe the alien invasion going on around him. Then there's probably the funniest bits in the whole movie: Probs and Mayhem. Probs and Mayhem are two kids who want desperately to run with the big dogs but are constantly pushed aside, so they run around with their toys and pretend to be gangbangers from the block. They're freakin' hilarious. ATTACK THE BLOCK didn't get a lot of attention in the States and I hope to see it become a cult favorite at the very least. It's the best alien invasion flick of the year and absolute fun.",Attack the Block
57,Troy_Campbell,Possibly the coolest movie of the year.,9,8 December 2011,"Unfortunately only seeing a limited release on our shores, this British horror-sci-fi-action mash up may not be the best movie of the year, but it's possibly the coolest. Successfully combing the finest elements of multiple subgenres – hoodie horror, alien invasion, gangster action – debut director Joe Cornish has crafted a nonstop pulse-starter with an abundance of flair and self-assurance, and with a freakily fantastic soundtrack to go along with it. The young unknown cast portraying the gang protecting their turf from otherworldly creatures are pitch perfect, and the familiar faces – Nick Frost, Luke Treadaway – are a hoot in the smaller comic roles. The biggest winner of the day though is Cornish's screenplay; the uniquely South London dialogue is both hilarious and awesome whilst the story propels along at a rapid pace. All in all this is a real treat, or as the South London yoofs would say: ""this is proper wicked for real bruv, and I ain't even lyin' or nuffin'!""",Attack the Block
58,pyrocitor,"""It's raining Dobbys!!""",9,3 February 2016,"Cowboys & Aliens. Battle: Los Angeles. Apollo 18. Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Green Lantern. Going to the cinemas in 2011, it was nigh impossible to avoid having an alien invasion plop down on your head, even those attempting to differentiate by styling themselves after early, gritty Spielberg (Super 8) or edgier John Carpenter (The Thing remake) – hell, even with a good, healthy British influence (Paul). How could a debut director with a low budget but ambitious aspirations hope to make a mark by pumping out his own extraterrestrial romp, transposed into the inauspicious setting of South London? By doing exactly that. And it's by sticking to its guns and committing to its thorough Britishness in a fashion that has yet to be overly explored in genre cinema that helps Attack the Block shine as one of the most gung-ho, ferociously fun sci-fi smackdowns in the past several years – and, yes, by far the best alien film of 2011.There's an inescapable Shaun of the Dead vibe about Attack the Block, and writer/debut director Joe Cornish certainly shows a knack for the Wright kind of manic yet grounded mayhem. Still, this is no mere pastiche, with Cornish eschewing his mate's characteristic broader comedy in favour of a more John Carpenter-influenced nonstop onslaught of thrills, with one-liners sprinkled in periodically – the ultimate post-80s 80s movie, if you will. Cornish doesn't f*ck around with the genre's usual expendable 'biding your time with suspense' first act; within four minutes, our muggers-turned-antiheroes have already been savaged by an extraterrestrial intruder, and done their fair share of savaging back, and the pace only intensifies from there. It helps that the film's creature design is uniquely creepy (and, again, a nice 80s shout-out in using practical effects!), while the action itself is kinetic and ferocious, but with a healthy underscoring of humour and serendipity, lending it odd credibility in spite of itself. There's a faint whiff of budgetary constraints stopping the film short of the utterly bonkers mayhem it seems to be straining for, but with such crazy-fun setpieces involving fireworks, tear gas cans, and a homemade flamethrower, you'd be hard-pressed to complain for the most part. However, the main draw of Attack the Block doesn't lie in its spectacle anyway. ""Inner City vs. Outer Space"" may be one of the most hilarious taglines in recent memory, but it's also indicative of the film's thematic core. The South London 'Inner city' feel fully informs Cornish's film, and its thuggish, performative roughness and incessant dubstep soundtrack lend a furious, pulsing energy to the proceedings. Cornish famously spent a year working with London youth to hash out verisimilitude in dialogue and scenario, and it unequivocally pays off: his script is both hilariously stuffed with precocious one-liners and impressively naturalistic (but for English speaking non-locals: don't be embarrassed if you cave to needing subtitles, if only to keep track of the regional slang. Allow it.). Foreshadowing further exploration of crime and violence in disenfranchised, impoverished English youth (2015's Kingsmen: The Secret Service would pick up the reins) without stereotypically resorting to the ""damn hoodies"" dismissal of films like Harry Brown, Attack the Block dredges up essential socioeconomic critique, which lends sombre scope to its trappings of explosions and howling ""gorilla-wolves"". Here, one of the biggest plot holes in most youth vs. the supernatural is cunningly debunked: our reluctant heroes can't call the police, as they prove an even greater threat than the murderous aliens. And if Cornish's script lays this commentary on a bit thick at times (""my boyfriend's helping children in Africa"" ""What about the children of Britain? Not exotic enough?""), it's done with a wink and a nod, making its important message sit less pedantically than it could have. Similarly, there's a bit too convenient a scientific rational of the aliens' motivation by the film's climax - but, to be fair, having it be delivered by Luke Treadaway's hugely stoned amateur biologist (purposefully put in pretentious contrast with the teens) makes it sit better. Never dispute a deus-ex-marijuana. Watching John Boyega here post-Star Wars is a fairly jarring experience, but his virtually unrecognizable work here is testament to his incredible versatility as an actor. As Moses, the frequently silent, tough-as-nails leader of the central band of hoodlum-heroes, Boyega brings a furiously brooding physicality turned rough vulnerability, his piercing eyes constantly commanding attention whether posturing or stabbing aliens to death out of dogged, almost animalistic pride. Jodie Whittaker provides the film's more traditional moral centre, and is perennially raw and sympathetic throughout, her righteous indignation peeling away to reveal sparky heroics. Newcomers Alex Esmail (ably stealing the bulk of the punchlines), Leeon Jones (commendably likable), and Franz Drameh (the group's moral centre and chief samurai sword wielder) all share the scenery with a lived-in charisma and ease, while Nick Frost, in effectively a protracted cameo, manages to raise hysterical laughs with only the slightest shrug or frown. Attack the Block still has a few kinks to be ironed out to be considered a genre staple, but Cornish has delivered an insanely fun, heartfelt, and even deceptively complex debut. It's well worth a watch, even in the face of the glut of comparable Hollywood trash. If this is Cornish's Shaun of the Dead, I can't wait to see his Hot Fuzz. Trust, bruv.-8.5/10",Attack the Block
59,oneguyrambling,A modern day 'homage' to 80s creature flicks w/o the creativity or spark...,5,3 February 2012,"I'm not here with express intent of submarining the film (and might I point out that 5.5 is hardly a terrible score), but this is a deliberately low budget horror film that aspires to be this decade's Gremlins, Critters or Ghoulies, boasting a no name cast, derivative elements and effects that can't be mentioned without reference to the film being low budget. And for the record, Critters or Ghoulies were hardly considered necessary and Gremlins deemed to cutesy for teens and too grown up for kids If Attack the Block was introduced to you via a dating service the blurb would lead with great personality.Put still another way, this might look, smell and sound like Slither and Shaun of the Dead, but take it from me, Attack the Block is no Slither or Shaun of the Dead. I died a little inside putting them in the same sentence.After an opening shot that caused me to lean to ask quite simply ""really?"" – after all, even if it really was a homage and not a lazy plot device – it is fair to say that this homage has already been homaged. Many times.Anyway, when these 'critters' crash land in the wrong hood the local teens waste no time in killing it, then parading it around the area before deciding to cash in on their find. But as they ponder which media opportunities to turn down new arrivals fall from the sky.The 5 young lads immediately decide to tool up and get into 'em. After all, one must defend this particular block where everyone talks just like Ali G.Only this time the aliens in question are bigger and decidedly more trouble, they might look like a pitch black Sully from Monsters Inc – aside from the glowing razor sharp teeth they even seem quite cuddly – but these guys aren't here to scare toddlers So the 5 lads move about the local area, always with a creature or two (or many more) in close pursuit. Also on their tail are the local constabulary and a fiendish drug dealer who feels that he has somehow been wronged, and in tow is Sam, an off-duty nurse who has found no alternative but to align herself with the young boys who only hours prior saw fit to mug her in the middle of the street.The movie progresses as these films do, with the main wonderings being who will survive and how might they remove this evil scourge from their proximity. The performances are actually pretty good, with Moses the unofficial leader of the gang being a standout. Nick Frost does indeed have a cameo – furthering the SotD comparisons, but in truth his is a bit part that could've been played by a million others, or as the boys themselves might say 'Ee's hardly in it, innit!' I can't be seen to be attacking the small indie low budget Brit horror film that could, so I'll leave you with this; Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. The film lacks any real humour, which in an absence of true scares and a scarcity of gore is a real drawback, leaving a film that is original, funny, creative and pulse pounding (at times), that reminds us of Critters, Gremlins and Ghoulies.",Attack the Block

63,ElijahCSkuggs,Nightmare on Sesame Street,8,23 September 2011,"Our story of block attacking begins as our rag-tag group of protagonist hoods surround and mug a poor, helpless lass. In the midst of the mugging, a falling meteor crash lands into a car mere feet away. The boss of the group of young punks, Moses, lets the woman run away as he wants to loot anything he can out of the smoldering wreck. Within moments he and friends are fighting off a sharp-toothed, little alien from another planet. Not long after, they find out that this freaky looking alien has friends coming – bigger, meaner, freakier looking friends.Watched this flick a couple times now, and for the most part it stands up as a legit lil creature feature. This debut by Joe Cornish, is a consistently fresh looking and sounding flick that showcases some crisp and creative camera-work, some in-your-face social commentary, and, believe it or not, an actual story that was fun to follow, as well as some cool looking alien creatures that had me instantly nodding with approval – they were slightly Sesame Streetish, but with a twisted nightmare feel.The writing and ott characters here, which is apparently how some real-life style young'uns in London talk and act, may get on your nerve a bit – it's like British and Jamaican rolled in one – I personally didn't have much of an issue with it. There's lots of quick delivered slang and silly hood posturing being spewed all about, but through good direction of these young actors, Cornish managed to bond the actors and actually created a cohesive cinematic relationship among them. So much so, that by the end I was hoping all remaining characters wouldn't kick the bucket. Which is basically opposite of how I normally act with modern horrors – I want everybody to be mince-meat by the time the credits roll.Not a perfect film by any means as a couple scenes of tension faltered with its desired effect *ahemhallwaysceneahem*, the funny bone department was lacking, and a few moment of hamminess from some of our rough 'n tough 15 year old leads at times had me giggling to myself.

Everybody is Cuz' or Bro' or Blood. Born and bread in Essex I can't speak the Queens English but after about twenty minutes of listening to these gangster wannabes I really wanted the aliens to eat all of them (nurse included). The ludicrous script means you can't take any of the characters serious (in the same way if they were all yuppie Oxford boys who ended every sentence with 'Yar' or 'What'o Ruppert')I like an anti-hero as much as the next guy but these guys push it too far. The characters open up and explain how they are misunderstood and neglected - and yes they are thieves, drug dealers and yes they do rob lone women at knife point, and yes each does own there own personal arsenal - they are really just victims of society.

72,grendelkhan,Decent little film with a few problems.,6,11 December 2012,"I just finished watching the film and have read some of the reviews here. I understand some of the dislike for the kids; I had the same reactions at first. The film doesn't really get beyond their personae until very late; but, it seems to me this may be deliberate to force people to reassess them. Obviously, at first glance, they are a bunch of thugs and wannabe criminals; hardly laudable. However, things are never that simple, especially in that kind of environment. As the film progresses, you get glimpses of Moses' background and he is confronted with the consequences of his actions. This theme is reinforced with his meeting up again with Sam and with the girls later on. Those were the kinds of scenes I was waiting for, to get through to Moses that he had to take responsibility for his actions. It could have been handled earlier, and probably better, but it is executed well enough within the context of the story.The film won't win any awards, but it is a decent little production. They make good use of limited funds and let you fill in the blanks as you go, in a very old school manner. It doesn't go overboard with spectacle or CGI, and gives everyone room to work. The beginning could have used some reworking; but, overall, the film is paced well. Perhaps more time could have been spent fleshing out the characters earlier on, to make them more sympathetic; but, who said the heroes had to be likable? In the end, it's a decent little debut film for the actors and the director. It's not perfect, but it's a good first try. I think the film glorifies ""punks"" far less than directors like Tarrantino, Guy Ritchie, or even Martin Scorcese glorify criminals in their films. It's not La Haine, but it's hardly garbage.

It was simple, effective, and entertaining!The film has a great pace, with no messing about. Joe Cornish knew exactly what he wanted to do and got straight down to it. There was lots of good action, some great suspenseful scenes, and some neat chase scenes. At under an hour and a half long, Attack the Block never felt like it was dragging. It was zippy, fresh, and engaging.I wasn't massively in love with any of the characters. They were pretty cliched at times, and didn't really get much development. They just were who they were. I must say though Joe Cornish captured the generation perfectly. All the language and behaviour felt very real and authentic. The acting was decent as well, with Jodie Whittaker as the standout for me.My absolute favourite part of the film though was the design of the aliens.

78,willcundallreview,A just about good-ish alien free for all,7,13 April 2014,"Rating-7/10Attack the Block is an urban London film with a big twist, it has big alien monsters trying to kill everyone climb up very high buildings and you never really see what they are, what more could you want. With some fun characters and a plot that although is not great still gets a long well, people can really like this movie and could be considered even a cult movie. I personally felt that this film was just about a kind of good movie, and here below is why so.The story is fast and the characters are rarely together and with some big beasts to take on, you are in for some great with a slight humorous side to it, killings. With a story that boasts fun, comedy and even slight seriousness, you can't expect the film to be anything more and although this is far from the best Sci-Fi film ever made, still makes for very watchable entertainment. I felt one fun thing also about it is the way the characters take a variety of weapons to use against the aliens, this is fun and when you see some of the things they do with them it is just fantastic.John Boyega is the main man of the film who in a sense is the leader with a character names Moses, he gives off leadership skills and a good sense of confidence to give the role a different turn from the others involved in this. The entire gang featured are funny and even people not fighting aliens can be slightly funny too. I personally felt more of Nick Frost should have been seen as we all know he is funny and has been in good comedies in this type of situation before, but he is underused and the lines he is given do not pay off in the comedy sense.Joe Cornish as director and writer does an OK job but I think in truth he fails to take this to the next level, yes it is a good watch but I could also say go find another Sci-Fi film like this, If there even is one out there. I did enjoy the effects and stunts and for such a low budget British movie the effects are amazing, the beasts look completely real(albeit constantly in darkness), and the fighting scenes have some great prosthetics among other things. Camera work is also worth mention, I felt it was down to the high rise buildings giving nice camera shots down below etc, but good work nonetheless.The film as can be seen here is not perfect, the film lacks the comedy is promises and the story maybe slightly drags too much(but that is really up to you). I felt this could have been so much funnier but just never crossed that line where they were saying anything fresh and comical. Another bad point is the sense that the main protagonists are all actually bad people, and none really ever repent there ways, this is not a great setup for a hero type film but I guess a little respect to Cornish for experimenting.People who love Sci-Fi with a little tongue in cheek should enjoy a watch of this and although isn't high budget, you saw what I said about the effects and they could match many other Sci-Fi's any day. Ii felt watching it that it seems nearly completely aimed towards teenagers, now anyone can watch this but Cornish has definitely dived into his more adolescent directing and writing style to appeal to that kind of young audience, but I would still recommend it to anyone, even if your not a teenager. Overall a 7/10 from me, it was just about a kind of good movie and never quite started to get near being Good, although just escapes being rated plain OK. You may find this annoying, you may love it, I have heard personally good reviews and not just from critics, audiences seemed to love this and they are usually the one's who know entertainment when they see it. One last thing, be prepared to be thrilled and you will love it, watching it in a dark room will make you jump but also root for the good guys in it.",Attack the Block

80,peefyn,Good combination of a playful tone and a dark context,8,15 December 2015,"This movie has gotten lots of praise for its special effects, and all of it is deserved. The combination of practical and digital effects is really good, making the aliens both physical and outworldly. I also like the playful tone of the movie, combined with the darker situation in which the alien invasion occurs. At times, the movie was not quite as funny as I'm sure it hoped to be, and I never considered this much of a scary movie (though to me it didn't have to be). The acting of some of the kids was also not that impressive, but good enough for the movie to work.Portraying the thug kids in a nuanced way is maybe the movie's greatest achievement. When we first meet them in the movie, they are exactly how we imagine these kinds of kids are: unsympathetic, heartless and in need of punishment. Throughout the movie, as you get to know these kids, you start seeing that they are not the problem, but a symptom of something bigger. There is almost a parallel with the aliens, though it's not a strong one, and it falls apart in the ending. The aliens are at first mindless and evil, but as you get to know them, you realize what is the background of their behavior. The movie's ending is hopefully not a suggestion on how to fix such ""behavior"" in problematic kids, though.",Attack the Block
81,p-jonsson,If this would have been a SyFy original it would have been quite okay...but it is not,4,25 March 2014,"When this one came out I first thought it sounded like it could be a cool movie. Then I read a few reviews, filtered out the over-hyped ones, and decided that I might not like it after all so I decided not to invest any money in it. When it was shown yesterday on France 4 I thought I should have a go and see it now when it was on anyway.I quite frankly cannot understand all the hype and what appears to be some cult status surrounding this movie. To me it was a pretty bad movie. My main gripe with the movie is that the main characters are not very likable. Not only are they stupid and unintelligent but they are criminal, juvenile thugs. Some talk about social messages in this movie. Well I do not need any message to tell me that street thugs are stupid assholes thank you.The monsters are pretty much guys running around in gorilla suits with extra long hair and glowing teeth. Not very exiting even though the glowing teeth effects is somewhat cool.To me this is just another run of the mill group-of-kids-meets-monster movie with uncharismatic and unpleasant characters, meh plot and fairly substandard special effects.

All the performances were pretty good, particularly Jodie Whittaker as Sam and John Boyega as Moses, these two stood out. The rest of the cast were all quite young but all did an excellent job; so honourable mentions go to; Alex Esmail as Pest, Leeon Jones as Jerome, Franz Drameh as Dennis, Simon Howard as Biggz, Luke Treadaway as Brewis and, not forgetting, Nick Frost as Ron (him not young).I enjoyed this film quite a bit more than I was expecting to, partly because the characters, once you got to know them, were all quite likable.

83,markgorman,"Is it a comedy? Is it a horror? Is it a social statement? Is it any good? Yes, yes, yes and not particularly.",6,16 May 2011,"I love Adam and Joe's 6 Music show on a Saturday morning. It's wickedly funny and brilliantly inventive in its humour, audience engaging and cod songwriting skits (Song Wars) so the notion of Joe Cornish writing and directing an Alien movie was intriguing, if difficult to predict what the outcome might be. But IMDb liked it so I went for it this afternoon.Total audience? Six.The concept is built around what might happen if an alien invasion started in a council tower block scheme in South London and the band of brothers that inevitably unite to repel the invasion are a bunch of skanky kids and trainee villains.It's a nice elevator pitch, particularly when you throw in the fact that the only female in the posse is adopted, much against her will, after being held up and robbed by the bro's in the opening scene of the film.But I'm sorry to say it's a bit of a curate's egg if I'm honest.The issue is that it can't decide whether it's a comedy (and if so would have been a challenger to Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland - and lost), a social commentary piece or a full-on monster movie (in which case it would be comparable to low budget shockers like Monsters, District 9 or Cloverfield - and lose to all three of them too).In the event it's all of these and none of them. And that's the problem.It's partly let down by casting with most of the performances at best workmanlike and at worst either amateur (which I suppose most of the cast is) or caricaturised.The special effects are really quite good, albeit done on a budget, but imaginatively so. In particular the monsters with their ultra-black bodies and fluorescent green teeth (nothing else) are a bit like honey monsters gone bad which gives them an air of the humorous but at times downright creepy.I wanted to like this movie more and I suspect it's Joe Cornish's winning personality that has got him the funding for it and the, mostly, kind reviews.But the truth is, it ain't that great.If you stumbled upon it on the telly I think you'd be pleasantly surprised but for a full ticket cinema admission it's pushing its luck.6/10",Attack the Block
84,jamiedarlow-37510,Beautifully filmed but full of unlikeable characters and lack of laughs,4,9 February 2020,"It is made exceptionally well, with a beautifully cinematic opening shot, plenty of well filmed sequences and finished with a pretty epic ending. Joe Cornish does a good job of directing considering it is his debut feature, just not so sure about the script. For a horror/action comedy, the laughs are quite few. This is mainly down to the fact that the characters are not likeable at all, with the exception of Nick Frost and Luke Treadaway's characters. The horror in the film is actually quite shocking. In a good way because it is so unexpected. There is alot here for gorehounds to sink their teeth into and there are some scares to be had. There are various action sequences that are impressive and visually exciting. Overall, worth a watch because of all the hype. If the characters were likeable, this could have been much better. Not a bad debut for Joe Cornish though",Attack the Block
85,dr_clarke_2,"A winning blend of horror, comedy, action and social commentary",8,15 February 2021,"The directorial debut of Joe Cornish (best known to British audiences as one half of the comedy duo Adam and Joe), 2011's Attack the Block is a low budget British science fiction with a cast that includes some very familiar faces. And whilst it may not have been a commercial success, it has proved to be a critical one, thanks to its winning blend of horror, comedy, action and social commentary.
Inspired by Cornish getting mugged in real life, the film sees Jodie Whittaker's newly-qualified nurse Samantha Adams being mugged by a gang of hoodies led by John Boyega's Moses. She manages to escape when a meteor crashes into a nearby car and the gang discovers a small alien inside, but when Moses kills the creature he sets in motion a deadly chain of events that sees the tower block he, his gang and Sam call home being invaded by some particularly nasty monsters.
Attack the Block is great fun, putting a fresh spin on a tried and tested formula as gorilla-like aliens with light-absorbing fur and bioluminescent jaws start hunting down the humans in the titular block, forcing them to fight for their survival. It's tense and often spectacularly gory (notably when local drug baron Hu-Hatz gets his face ripped off and when Dennis gets decapitated). Cornish, demonstrating considerable talent behind the camera, works wonders with a low budget, with the simple creature effects proving surprisingly effective.
It's also very funny. The script sparkles with wit and actors Luke Treadaway and Nick Frost provide comic relief as posh stoner Brewis (based on Cornish in his twenties) and laid-back drug dealer Ron. More strikingly however, it also casts a satirical eye over youth culture, with dialogue such as ""This ain't got nuttin' to do with gangs..."" ""Or drugs, or rap music or violence in video games."" Cornish portrays Moses' gang members initially as thugs, but then reveals them to be bored kids nagged on the phones by their mums, reluctant to call the police because they already get arrested and blamed for things they haven't done, and seduced by the promise of power and influence that Hi-Hatz offers. Nevertheless, the script doesn't excuse their behaviour, with Sam condemns them for threatening her with a knife, but does raise questions about what motivates it: there's a genuinely surprising moment when Sam sees Moses' bedroom and he reveals that he is only fifteen years old, despite looking older. If there's a flaw here, it's that Cornish asks questions about these social issues, but doesn't offer any answers.
The cast is excellent (especially future big names Whittaker and Boyega, plus old hand at horror-comedy Frost), many of them unknown at the time and several of them kids. Cornish's crew is just as accomplished, with some great camerawork from Tom Townend, whose often frenetic approach reflects the pace of the film perfectly, and Steven Price, who makes his debut as a composer. Overall, Attack the Block is a rich brew, enormously entertaining but rising a cut above the competition thanks to its razor-sharp writing, and it makes an impressive debut for Cornish; his next film (The Kid Who Would be King) would also achieve critical acclaim but fall flat at the box office, but on the evidence so far it is to be hoped that he gets more opportunities to show off his talents in the future.",Attack the Block
86,Rockwell_Cronenberg,The most fun I've had this year.,6,3 September 2011,"Old school dopeness. It's like Goonies meets Shaun of the Dead meets Independence Day. The whole alien invasion thing has been recycled as hell lately, but Joe Cornish found a way to make this thing feel so fresh and unique once again by containing it to such a unique setting and having this young group of hoodlums fighting back. None of it feels like it's been done before and as a result the film doesn't get dull for a second.The less-than-90 minute running time is perfect for something this small, never letting us stop having fun in order to make time for pointless romantic subplots or unnecessary characters. There is never a dull moment in this, a film that I have no problem saying is the most fun I've had so far this year. Whoever cast these kids deserves some sort of medal because they are all fantastic and for most of them it's their first job. John Boyega in particular, in the lead role as the head of the group, is fantastic.At first I was skeptical about the Jodie Whittaker character and her constant run-ins with the group but by the end I really embraced her dynamic with Moses and actually found myself getting surprisingly emotional at the end. The whole thing is just vibrant, exciting and so much intense entertainment. There are a solid amount of laughs throughout, but it's not even a film about trying to make you laugh or trying to scare you. It's just about having fun and it succeeds so admirably. It feels real old school and I loved every moment. Everyone should watch this.",Attack the Block
87,Cinema_Fan,"Its well funny and well horrifying, ya get me.",8,14 May 2011,"Fire and brimstone arrive in the concrete jungle of inner city South London in the guise of some extremely ferocious and fearsome space monsters and London bad-boys', when their mums' allow. This truly funny and dark movie concentrates on the small band of street bruvs' who are unwittingly thrown into the deep end of an alien invasion and are bound together to save the neighbourhood, the tower block, which they call home.With a street view of urban language and culture, Attack the Block has the script of, both director and writer, Joe Cornish doing a job well done. Working the funny bone with its one-liners in fearful circumstances that both perpetuate the scenario of the setting of alien beast versus human courage bringing the house down with its vitality and energy and too terrifies you all at the same time.Well shot and tightly paced, this is action and sci-fi meets dark comedy bringing these young adults, more children than young adults to be fair, into the foray of battle with an immense sense of loyalty and pride, not only for their district but also toward each other. Yeah, they are just kids who still have to be ""in by Ten"" and they are all, at heart, nice and polite boys, when you get to know them. Unlike the black, furry, eye-less and luminesce teethed aliens; crawling their way up and chomping their way to the top of the tower block, a very nice and somewhat original touch and it really does work well.It is a decently made movie and for the director's debut, it is a good start, as a movie it can, I think, stand on its own two feet. While not on the same par as Noel Clarke's (Kidulthood, 2006) intelligent writing, concerning London youth culture, this, by Mr. Cornish, is most certainly not dumbing-down either, with its different approach to the Yoouth culture of Great Britain and its intertwining sci-fi horror and black comedy Attack the Block is a highly individual film that will gain respect and notoriety in time, init?",Attack the Block

91,eshwarmail,Got its pace and presentation right - but definitely overrated,7,9 January 2017,"Reviewed March 2012An amalgamation of a silly script, mediocre acting, smart production values and a perfect blend of execution - neither too serious nor just funny. Moses (John Boyega) and his gang of friends encounter and kill an alien that has fallen from outer space. While they are off celebrating their kill and making plans on how to spend the money they would get by selling the corpse, an alien invasion begins as hundreds of the tough creatures looking like a bear with glowing teeth descend to attack the block. With no choice to save themselves and their block, they grab everything they think of as a weapon and get on the offensive. It is a little putting off initially with the slang continually trying to impress the viewer with the words they use but one should get used to it a little while into the movie. The screenplay maintains a serious tone for most part with the lead character never smiling and people getting killed occasionally. A super relief in all this are the child characters who are wannabe tough kids calling themselves Mayhem and Probs. The visual effects are minimal but done neatly. Nick Frost might have done a courtesy role here since there is no wit in what he says nor there is any importance to the character. Definitely overrated, but not a bad movie at all. My rating for this movie is only because of its pace and the presentation given its limited budget.",Attack the Block
92,squirrel_burst,A Superior Creature feature Horror Comedy. A new favorite of mine.,10,13 April 2015,"""Attack the Block"" is a horror comedy that really works. It has a lot of laughs, memorable characters, sharp dialog, excellent performances, a smart story and some good action/thrills too. Not only are the human characters unique, but the creature designs/effects are unlike anything you've seen. I had heard about this one from word-of-mouth and to me, it feels like a real hidden gem. The kind of movie people might not have heard about and is full of delightful surprises.The film begins with a crime. Samantha (Jodie Whittaker) is mugged by a small gang of teenage punks. Just as Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard) and Moses (John Boyega) are about to make off with their ill-gotten gains, a meteorite falls from the sky. Turns out it's not a meteorite at all, but the first of a race of deadly alien creatures. Covered in hair so dark it seems to absorb light and armed with razor-sharp teeth, these antiheroes are the only ones who know what's going on when the creatures begin attacking the apartment block they live in.What I love about this movie is that it takes you for a loop. The heroes are a group of ghetto misfits who are introduced when they mug an innocent woman. Normally, you wouldn't care if any of these punks made it out alive but here that's not the case. The movie plays with your expectations and initially you dislike the protagonists. As the movie plays out though, you get to learn more about them, and your opinion changes. You realize how genuine the friendship between these guys is, you see that there's more to them than the petty crimes they commit and how under these circumstances there is no one else you'd rather be with. These flawed main characters add a touch of realism that makes the thrills and scares more intense. You don't know who is going to make it out alive and when people die in the movie, it's genuinely shocking.In this movie is something I hardly ever see in horror films; actual character development and personalities that evolve. You feel like you've spent a long time getting to know these guys and just as they've really started to grow on you, an alien comes around and kills them, just like that. I found myself getting really upset when something bad happened to them. Usually in horror movies, seeing people get killed is the best part, it's what you came to see, but here it's heart wrenching. This picture takes the time to make you care about people that you wouldn't usually care about. You get to see the characters grow and this allows the film to explore some important themes about poverty and community without ever feeling preachy.Another element I thought was nothing short of brilliant was the setting of the action. This apartment block that's under siege makes for some really interesting scenes, something you haven't ever seen before. To give you a hint, this building is set in a poor neighborhood. It's so poor that the lights in the corridor don't even stay on all of the time. To save on power, the lights in the corridors automatically turn off and you're expected to press a button to light them up and walk with the lights before the place is once again submerged in darkness. What a terrific setting for some scares. Just imagine walking down this corridor and not even having the light to comfort you. With these aliens blending into the darkness perfectly, you've got yourself a recipe for more than a few scenes that are genuinely frightening and incredibly tense.The casting here is perfect. There isn't a moment in the alliances and friendships that feel forced or manufactured and at the end of the movie everyone really feels like a big, unlikely family. The performances, mostly done by child actors are dead-on. The characters speak with unique slang and expressions in a thick accent that at first is hard to understand, but adds that extra touch of realism. As the movie moved along, I found that I was able to adopt to their dialog (in fact I wouldn't mind adopting some of their expressions in my own dictionary) and I'm confident that you will too. Also noteworthy is the excellent soundtrack by ""Basement Jacks"", which helps pump up the energy and adds to the film's ghetto, uneasy feel.All this and we haven't even really sunk our teeth into the monsters, which are really intriguing to observe. I'm a big fan of horror being boiled down to its basics and here is a terrific, simple design that's elegant. They feel menacing but because there's not really much to see when they're on the screen (their fur is so dark it doesn't reflect light and they basically look like gorillas with tiger teeth) you focus on the action and the adrenaline the characters feel, not the special effects.All that, and as a cherry on top, you have characters that are intelligent because they don't make the same stupid mistakes you see everyone do in horror movies and are able to improvise when the situation calls for it. That means there's actually more tension than in your average horror movie because you really don't know if they're going to make it out OK, or if they'll figure out a way out of this mess. You have the protagonists running from 3 different threats throughout the film. ""Attack the Block"" is more than a good sci-fi creature flick, it's a great, a fantastic, a splendid sci-fi creature flick. It's scary, thrilling and even touching at times. Once it's all done with, you'll be excited to share this with your friends and just thinking about it makes me want to watch it again. (On Blu-ray, November 4, 2012)",Attack the Block

94,TheRedDeath30,An R-rated Take on the Spielberg family movie,8,29 September 2014,"Having grown up in the 80s, I was exposed to a whole gamut of movies that followed the same basic plot construction and format, in which a group of young kids discovers (or hopes to discover) something fantastical or alien and generally ends up saving the world. Movies from ET and GREMLINS to THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD all fit loosely into this same paradigm.What director Joe Cornish has done so masterfully here is to take that pattern and turn it on its' head. Unlike another recent similar movie, SUPER 8, which closely mimicked those 80s movies so much as to be a direct homage, Cornish decides to use the basic framework but to provide the viewer with twists to make it new and refreshing.The first of those twists seems to be the most controversial with viewers in that this is not a group of precious, innocent kids who ""come of age"" while they save the world. Instead, Cornish drops his alien invasion straight into the middle of the hood (the block, call it what you will), and the group of protagonists that we follow are far from innocent. In fact, we meet them in the middle of mugging a young woman. A WHOLE LOT of reviewers on this site seem to focus in on how ""unlikable"" the main characters are and that this turns them off from enjoying the movie. I admit that I find this hard to understand. Let's take a movie like GOODFELLAS, which revolves around a gang of very hardened criminals with few redeeming qualities, yet this is considered a modern film classic. Part of me starts to wonder if this is more a case of white, suburban, middle- class viewership not wanting to cheer for a group of realistically portrayed black kids from the ghetto, but I don't want to go too far down that avenue.I found it to be a refreshing twist to use in a movie like this. I'm tired of the same plot formula where bland suburban kids save the world while dealing with the same real-life problems (the abused kid, the kid from a broken home, etc). Instead, for me, as a viewer, I started with an unfavorable view of these kids, but grew to like them as the movie goes on and they find their humanity, as they realize how important their neighborhood is to them and how important it is to save it.The other huge twist here, from the typical Spielberg formula is that Cornish is not afraid to kill off his kids, which you never see in those cookie cutter movies. In fact, they die violently and with ample gore, not shying from their deaths one bit. It was shocking to see as a viewer who is used to this formula keeping the kids alive, even when in obvious peril.In order for this to work, though, it needed more than clever twists on well-worn patterns. It needed to bring us a really horrific monster(s), which it does in spades. I love the creature design here. I love that they didn't go with the green alien with tentacles cliché, or any of the other designs you've seen over and over. These aliens are terrifying as they chase our heroes. The lack of eyes, the glowing teeth, the blackness of their fur, the realistic movement (praise to Cornish for use of practical effects in lieu of CGI). I absolutely love the aliens in this movie.I'm finding that my opinion improves more each time I see it and I think this is one of the better horror movies made in the past ten years.",Attack the Block
95,politic1983,Attack the Block,6,26 January 2014,"British film is often criticised and many will say that we just don't make good films in this country. And to an extent, this is correct. Many are made by those that have worked wonders in television, but simply can't make an entertaining piece when moving to the big screen. Others are overly-sentimental and serve as DVD -fodder for Mother's Day presents.Another man making the switch from a career in TV and radio to film is Joe Cornish, making his directorial debut with 'Attack the Block'. Part of the film-obsessed duo Adam and Joe, it would always be interesting to see what he would produce, and what he has is an enjoyable little piece in 'Attack the Block'.Set in South London (oh my days, blood!), the story is about a group of teenagers – with typically poor grammar – trying to defend their tower block from an alien invasion. Typically British, it's more of a small- scale piece, not overly doing it with special effects and unnecessary drama. The dialogue provides intentional laughs, in a Kidulthood kind- of-a-way, with largely silly characters and situations. Joe Cornish will probably not set the cinema world alight, and could easily face a similar path to that of Simon Pegg, starting with a nice, small-scale piece with quality beginning to decline as the budgets and fame increase. But at this stage, 'Attack the Block' is harmless fun, with some good comedy moments, elements of some interesting directorial talent and an addition to the recent wave of successful British television makers making the step into film.Compared to an equally-silly American comedy, this will probably get nowhere near critically or financially acclaimed, with people likely to make the age-old comment that the British just don't make good films. But being that the comedy is very British, it is probably more due to the lack of international appeal that the film will probably achieve than poor quality. Jokes here are more expected on BBC Three than a cinema screen, and so will miss with many expecting Hollywood shine. And because of that, the British are unlikely to be making a mass invasion in cinemas throughout the world.www.politic1983.blogspot.com",Attack the Block

I didn't even know what the plot was though - but once I quickly glanced at the summary and watched first few minutes, it's clear that the plot could be a B- movie. But the technical side of the film makes sure this film is pure quality!While the plot is simple - aliens attacking and all that jazz - the writing is amazing. The skillful writing is mostly shown through the dialogue. The dialogue is hilarious, and it sounds like teenagers could genuinely talk instead of too childish or too mature. But while the dialogue is so much fun, the characters sometimes drop incredible truth bombs about the society. While you'd easily think that's kind of weird in the middle of alien invasion, they aren't just thrown there. It comes from the conversation, which is weirdly realistic even in this quite absurd scenario.The writing's finesse can be also shown in the characters. They are anti-heroes, but they are more than just the trope. They do what they have to, and that means they can mug people when they need to, and other times they can save people. It's clear they are teenagers who feel like they can't trust adults anymore. They only have themselves and each other, and all that. That could be analysed better once I've seen this film again.One great thing about the monsters of this film is that they are terrifying and quite unique. They easily give you jump-scares, BUT after the film you don't think they are going to attack you from around the corner. After all this isn't a horror film.Another thing that makes Attack The Block really stand out it's the cinematography. Mostly it's simple and basic, but there are few extremely interesting angles. Also every shot seems kind of beautiful because of the excellent use of colours. There are so many amazing things about this film. It is very easy to enjoy it: it's thrilling, visually beautiful and filled with interesting dialogue and characters. I don't understand how it isn't bigger than it is. It's definitely a movie you should see!",Attack the Block
97,the_wolf_imdb,I need English translation for this movie,1,29 July 2012,"I do guess that there was a time when they spoke English in England. The main ""heroes"" of this movie do speak some imported version of language roughly similar to English, but I'm able to understand only about 5-10% of what they say. It would be very beneficial if this movie would have at least regular English subtitles for those who are not familiar with modern multicultural thuggish languages.Oh, these new English heroes with hoods and caps pointing in wrong directions! The one who rides Pizza bike and has very bad replica of katana on his back is particularly bizarre. They even manage to kill several monkey-aliens with that $20 piece of tin which is somewhat surprising. These kids are pretty hardcore - even 8 year old can improvise flamethrower and burn an alien to death.Unfortunately, everyone seems not to understand the fragile souls of today's youth. The police is against them, the women who has been robbed does not like them and the aliens try to kill them. We may even heard the theory that the aliens have been sent by the government because they would like to somewhat eliminate these poor souls. Well, I sort of do not understand how this movie about aspiring criminals / terrorists could be considered to be a comedy. It is not funny, it is just disturbing. The story is boring, there is about as much action as in 5 minutes of average B class Japanese flick. And with its anarchistic / anti police message this is the most assuredly a huge waste of public money. Way to go, way to go indeed! So, there are my two conclusions from this movie for those who plan to visit England these days: 1) Learn the new progressive thuggish English so you know what they want when they try to rob you. 2) Learn krav maga so you can grab the knives of these lovely new youngsters and stick them in their throats. You are not allowed to have not even pepper spray for self defense in this very advanced democratic society, so some knowledge of krav maga and some improvised weaponry like say a screwdriver could come handy.Maybe I will watch Harry Brown to get rid of this strange aftertaste of these ""new British heroes"".",Attack the Block
98,BillBayard,"Boyega's first, but the fun comes from a couple of white dudes",5,20 October 2021,"I would assume that this is mostly famous for being the first film of John Boyega who has certainly gone places from here. He does have presence. This is a rather silly litter Critters type film, though not quite that silly, about some aliens, well, attacking a block for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves. It's primarily a comedy, but not one with a lot of laughs. Most are provided by Luke Treadaway as a white stoner in a mostly black neighborhood and Alex Esmail as a white bro in Boyega's black band of brothers. Apparently this has a fanbase as there are plans for a sequel with Boyega surprisingly involved a decade later. Different strokes! Enjoy, but it's not for me. Fair at best.",Attack the Block
99,huh_oh_i_c,This is a supermovie,10,14 July 2016,"I picked this movie from a list of the ""25 best SciFi movies of the 21st century, so far"" mainly because of the poster: What Scifi movie has black people on the poster? On average, zero. So when I finally got to see it, I was happy to see this wasn't a social commentary movie, documentary styled movie (not that there's anything wrong with those), it was a genuine high production value type of movie. Also, the acting is quite good, if not excellent: Certainly Boyega does a lot of damage with his sullen looks and strong silent thing. But the members of his crew are quite good actors and the unforgettable young actors who play Probs and Mayhem deserve huge applause. In America, these two would be huge Disney stars with their own show. Also, Jodie Whittaker does a good job as the Designated White Pretty Girl.It isn't a comedy, but it's funny like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch"". While the story line is not all that new, it's still a surprise to see the kids retreat inside the block, rather than trying to flee it. Of course, they go to what they know, but still.And if this is a low production value movie, it doesn't show it. The CGI for the creatures is above average. Perhaps some of it was just actors in suits? This is just a great film, great entertainment, and special mention for the London slang, it's totally funny but every one outside of London should probably get a subtitled version.

100,Siamois,A polarizing mixed bag of horror and comedy,5,21 December 2011,"A gang of criminal teenagers team up with a nurse they previously robbed to fight off alien creatures.Attack the Block takes place mostly in in a UK's council estate (basically, a building apartment that serves as public housing). The movie plays out like a mix between Assault on Precinct 13th (for making their last stand in a building) and Pitch Black (a bickering crew fighting off savage alien critters). And much like those two movies, the protagonists here are not exactly squeaky clean ""heroes"". In fact, the members of the South London gang are very much portrayed as teenage criminals and the very first thing we see is their entire group robbing a nurse and threatening her with a knife.Teenage criminality has been a very, very hot topic in the UK lately and it is not surprising that this movie has polarized viewers just for featuring such gang members as ""good guys by default"". Joe Cornish does tease the audience a bit by first exposing them as harsh criminal but then showing more dimensions to them. The young gang leader, 15-year old Moses somewhat goes through a transformation during the movie, which may be called a redemption by some viewers while stretching credibility for others.The movie itself plays very much like an 80s creature feature with an extra dose of humor. The aliens are quite silly. And Cornish alternates between gory scenes, comedic elements and at times a little bit of drama. I must say I did not find this blend worked very well but at least, Cornish does try to keep the movie fresh despite the avalanche of clichés on display.In the end, I thought it was an interesting experiment but not as well done as it could have been.",Attack the Block

103,dmuel,mediocre effort,4,9 September 2011,"I have to agree with several of the low-ratings here. This story of alien invasion in a contemporary UK urban neighborhood is a low-budget effort at movie making. Most of the central characters in the movie are just young thugs, or wanna-be thugs, so when the aliens first attack the block we are somewhat sympathetic with the alien instinct to kill them all. In the opening scenes the group of young punks clearly are of the ilk who terrorize their own neighborhood for personal gain. The dialogue is an impediment as it will only be understood by those who are unfortunate enough to inhabit this kind of environment and, with the heavy British subculture accent, it's a good thing there are subtitles available. The movie's ending, where these young hoodlums are transformed into urban heroes, makes the whole story a difficult one to feel warm about, alien invasion plot aside. As I note above, a mediocre effort and not at all up to the high rating it has at this site.",Attack the Block

The creatures are a cross from werewolf and a gorilla, with glowing teeth, LOL. There are thugs, and that was a turn off, but the movie was pretty good. Hard to tell what they were saying most of the time. That is another reason it was so funny too.The teacher is hot. Almost want to have passionate sex with her, if I could, LOL. This is just a movie to keep to laugh at. I don't usually watch UK movies, but this is an exception. No wonder we even got a rating with people not voting. This is so lame, because of no mandatory voting. At least I know the truth of which movies are good and bad, and those teenagers sneaking into rated R movies, to say how bad or good, that is really the opposite of the movie is.

In fact, I couldn't wait until it was over. The movie's all about these low-level gangstas who fight off aliens who look like big dogs with glowing blue teeth. The movie is definitely very low budget, with the black, furry creatures running around in the low light. The characters all mumble in these barely intelligible English accents. There's the usual gore and usual chaos.I get it, we're supposed to not like these street punks at first, and then admire them as they redeem themselves. But, there is just no spark to any of them, they're all just mopey, stock types. And, the aliens come across as just guys in suits.All the filmmaking is routine, and nothing to think about. There are much, much better alien-attack movies to watch instead of this one. My main objection to this movie is what a complete waste of time it was!** (2 Out of 10 Stars)",Attack the Block

107,julian-mumford,"Low budget, high entertainment",8,10 December 2012,"An inner city South London housing estate, if you are disadvantaged with little hope, you might form a gang with your buddies. You can intimidate people with your hoody and maybe even mug a local nurse with a flick knife. As night falls, you then fight vicious alien creatures with neon glowing razor sharp teeth as they attack your neighborhood.Hold on, let's back track a minute.So begins this feature from first time feature director Joe Cornish, with a small budget, dank miserable location shoot and non-professional young actors, surely this is never going to work.It is a testament to all those involved, that this does fit together very well. The story is small and must surely be full of plot holes, which are largely ignored as it crashes headlong forward into an exuberant chase movie.Moses (John Boyega) is the young casual leader of his young teen gang, in training for more serious work as a drug runner, if he can earn his stripes on the street. The gang menaces trainee nurse Sam (Whittaker), who is the unlucky victim of a hold up at knife point, not realising that this will be the least of her problems that night. The gang are initially anonymous and decidedly unpleasant, exactly the group you would cross the street to avoid. Whilst chuckling at how young and ridiculous they look, until the flicknife appears of course.On encountering a weird character that appears to have fallen from the sky crushing a parked car, the gang then beat the extra terrestrial to death in a tin shed, as you do. ET DOA or ""first contact"" followed by ""last contact"" in quick succession.The gang then meet the real aliens, vicious furry creatures that run on four legs and rip anything in their path to shreds. Armed with nothing more than a pizza delivery scooter, pedal bicycles, a few swords from the walls of their apartment and some fireworks, the gang set out to defend their territory.The film is a frothy concoction of dark humour, alien invasion and scary monster movie. The young cast are game for movie fun. Although, at times the film pulls no punches and is moderately scary in places, if you think that no youngsters will get chomped, you may have to think again.John Boyega as Moses is a real find, with definite screen charisma, he could go further with the right guidance. Pest (Esmail) is the white wannabee gangsta, speaking with so much gangsta rap, he is sometimes difficult to understand - ""That's an alien bruv, believe it"".A handy dope smoking trainee zoologist, handy for pointing out ""it's an alien"", the co-opted nurse and the remaining gang members, Jerome, Biggs and Dennis round out the opposing force. The group are also also assisted in their mini war by their own mini-me gang, Probs and Mayhem, who join the fray with a customized supersoaker water pistol, kids should most definitely not try this at home.Nick Frost pops in as ""Ron"" to support the local drug kingpin ""Hi-Hatz"" (Hunter), as he grows massive amounts of weed in his own artificially lit warehouse at the top of the block. Frost adds a bit of structure to the enterprise but the story zips along anyway, clearly the kids having as much fun as the audience.The film is short but highly enjoyable although critically well received, it has yet to find a large audience, which is a shame as it is worth seeking out. Not a lot of depth on offer but the initial street thugs are shown to be just scared bored kids with nothing better to do. That is until aliens force them to discover all the traits we should all possess, friendship, bravery and sacrifice. Albeit without the catalyst of a furry alien with big teeth attacking your apartment block.As one character states, ""No one is going to call you Mayhem, if you keep acting like such a pussy"" Summary Great unusual fun, with aliens, tower blocks, inventive kids and some real scares, this is a crowd pleasing film that just needs a crowd to please.Recommended, ""respect due""http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Attack the Block
108,gattonero975,"""Lovely Puppet""",8,3 January 2014,"A truly sleeper surprise for me. The only reason I wanted to see this one was because Nick Frost was in it. Turned out he really has a glorified cameo. But still nice to see him in here in any capacity.Well let me start with the main thug leader 'Moses' played excellently by a young actor named John Boyega who steals the show. He has the look and temperament of a young Denzel Washington. I hope Denzel works with this young actor before he loses that uncanny resemblance as he gets older. They would make a great father & son team in a film.Alex Esmail as Pest, Leeon Jones as Jerome, Franz Drameh as Dennis and Simon Howard as Biggz. Howard totally reminded me of another similar looking actor who ironically also played a similar role as a gang member in the classic ""The Warriors"" I'm talking about the late Marcelino Sánchez who played the spray painting Warrior member, 'Rembrandt' They even have the same hairstyle and peach fuzz mustache! They all did an excellent job in portraying thugs from the hood in London. Now I have read some of the other reviews were they say that this film glorifies these young hoodlums as heroes. I disagree to some extent. Yes they are despicable but they are a product of their environment. They can't help be who they are. And just like any innocent victim that has crossed their path or stupidly come into their block, they will get attack. Even Aliens monsters or the like They are not defending anybody but themselves. They are survivors. Yes some people would want all of them to die but like I said some are survivors and strong. (Some do perish though but not all)While it is never known or mentioned why these Aliens came in the 1st place, it is a fact they want revenge to what was done to the 1st Alien who came down from the sky. (it was a female) And since Moses and his crew did it in, they have the blood and smell all over them especially Moses. When the main drug dealer 'HiHatz' played excellently by Jumayn Hunter kills one of the creatures, he gets blood all over himself that seals his doom later on when he is overwhelmed by the other creatures.Luke Treadaway as Brewis one of the buyers/junkies of Nick Frost who plays 'Ron' HiHatz's seller. Did a nice job. he has some funny scenes where he meets Moses and his crew and tries to be friendly towards them but they want nothing to do with him.The creatures were nicely created. No eyes but glowing neon bluish teeth. Classic! Only complaint they were so dark looking you could barely see them in all this darkness but then that adds to the scare factor in some way I guess. And the fact that they resemble a very large dog/bear/gorilla like animal is super cool.Anyways, I enjoyed the film. The soundtrack was pretty cool. (I found it on the web) Way better than most of the crappy films that have been coming out. So give it a chance and check it out.",Attack the Block
109,chaz-28,Inner City vs. Outer Space,7,9 July 2011,"When aliens touch down a movie screen, it is usually near a desolate desert gas station. The humans who are charged with confronting it/them are a hearty band of passers-by who had the misfortune to break down there or spend their whole lives there looking for a way out. A select subset of alien invaders land smack in the middle of New York City or Los Angeles and start annihilating the entire city block by block. Now, direct to you from the producers of Shaun of the Dead is a location and band of warriors just a bit different from the norm.Aliens have invaded a low-rent housing complex in South London complete with Cockney accents! Who gets the unlucky job of standing between them and the rest of humanity? A group of teenagers trying to master their mugging skills and just breaking into the drug racket. Led by their leader Moses and a woman whose role is the 'always in the wrong place at the wrong time' girl, the haphazard group takes on the dog/wolf like aliens while the rest of the apartment building seems blissfully ignorant of the fight which is raging outside in the hallways.Nick Frost shows up as the actor you will recognize from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, but he has a limited role as the building's resident drug enthusiast. The girl, Jodie Whittaker, looks exactly like Emily Mortimer. In fact, I thought it was Emily Mortimer until the end credits. The kids are all convincing and are supplied with great one-liners. It would be a hell of a film to combine these South London blokes with the small town kids from Super 8 who join forces to fight yet another thing from the sky. The aliens here though seem like a script afterthought. Almost all of the screenwriter's energy was in the one off gags and witty street banter. The aliens are dimensionless, unexplored, unexplained, and even when they are directly on the screen, you still can barely see them because they are supposedly the blackest things anyone has ever seen, except for their neon green teeth.Attack the Block is worth seeing for its rare location, its above average dialogue, and because you'll take away some sayings you can use with your friends later such as ""Trust"" and ""Believe"". Don't go for the aliens, many other films have done that better, but most films do not match this sophisticated level of mockery.",Attack the Block
110,alistairc_2000,Sarf Londoners and muggers only,1,27 May 2011,May Contain Plots spoilers I sat in a 1000 seat cinema with six other people to see this turgid nonsense. At the start of the movie this gal get mugged and threatened by a gang of thugs. They steal her money and humiliate her. She managed to escape but I felt that they also wanted to gang rape her as they told her to come back as they had not finished with her.If I was going to make a movie about Aliens attacking earth I would make the hero's believable and likable. Then thugs duff up and murder a defenceless alien. As first contact situations go these thugs treat our first alien visitor as just another plaything in their pathetic lives. After they murder the pregnant alien they parade its body through the streets much like a serial killer would collect trophy and then display it for their sick satisfaction.Then the Alien's pals decide to take revenge. Fair dues to them I was on their side and wanted them to win. Every time another thug died I whooped with joy. The aliens arrive without a spaceship and appear as meteors but can be killed with fireworks. Really this does not follow the logic of the story.The worst British movie of the last 50 years and yes I am saying that Love honour and obey was a Brit flick. If you live in Sarf London and say words like Blud. If you think being in a gang is cool this is the movie for you.

112,toll-8,"This isn't half bad blud, trust!",6,5 March 2012,"If you were to think of every alien film you had seen, or any you have heard of, you could never imagine it to be anything like Attack The Block. This is completely original and brings a new look on the out-of- space alien invasion genre that we have seen an awful lot of.Attack The Block is set in London. It starts on firework night where a group of youths mug a young woman called Sam (Whittaker). The attack is cut short though when something falls from the sky and smashes into a car. Sam disappears and the youths decide to rob that now destroyed car but instead find some kind of alien. The group leader Moses (Boyega) kills this alien and takes it back to the 'block', the block of flats the youths live in, and show it to a neighbour who may know about these things, not because he grows weed in his flat of course. This neighbour is Nick Frost, who brings a funny cameo to the film.As they are at the flat more of these things fall from the sky and the kids vow to kill them all. However the creatures, black, hairy, gorilla like creatures with luminous green teeth, attack back, and the boys find themselves hiding in the block whilst the alien creatures force their way in and start killing them off.The film is quite typical in the sense of a group of people being stuck in a building being stalked by some alien creature, look no further than the Gremlins movies, but what makes it stand alone is the settings and the characters. The film is set in London and the youths are very typical of the youths in London of today. Most will act up to a gang leader. Most will wear the woolly hats and use their hoods and scarves to cover their face. All will say the word 'blud', 'believe', 'trust' or 'ya get me?' at the end of each sentence. The dialogue and the performances of the cast are uncanny to what a group of youths in London would be like. It is very stereotypical but we have never really had a film where we are to side with these youths and follow their journey throughout.It starts off being difficult to follow them though. The opening of the film is watching them mug this woman for no reason other than to have something to do. We are then expected to side with these kids and want them to destroy the aliens. To be fair many will watch this film and will never side with the kids and this will ultimately ruin the movie for them. Maybe the opening shouldn't have been quite as malicious as it was, I'm sure that would help us to actually like the group of youths by the end of the film.There are many characters in the film and if anything it is the side characters that are the funnier ones. The main group are all about the London talk, and after a while it wears a little thin but I was often sniggering when 'Mayhem' and 'Probs' were on the screen. These are two nine year old boys who are trying to prove to the older youths that they are hardcore enough to join the gang. The banter between the two is really good and snatches a few laughs. More laughs are bought to us from the genius that is Nick Frost. He isn't in the film much but every time he is he manages to raise a chuckle. His side kick in the movie, a posh, white boy who is buying drugs, is also part of this comic act. The scene when the two are more worried about getting stoned on the sofa whilst the aliens cause havoc in their building is particularly funny. It is billed as a comedy horror but it perhaps doesn't raise quite enough laughs to really be billed as a comedy.The film opens with a 'B' movie type feel but don't be put off by it. The film is well worth a watch. Many will become annoyed with the dialogue and it's repetitiveness but I'm sure that is exactly how they would talk in real life. You should see this film for the cinematography, the sound design, the creatures, the acting and the directing. It won't be the best film you ever see but it is one that you should enjoy for the ninety minutes it will occupy you.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Attack the Block

Seeing John Boyega so young playing the main character in a pretty big film is great to see and it's so cool to see how far he has come, he is easily the best actor in this movie and to say this was his first role he's amazing in this.

Now see I live in a country where Trump is president so it all makes sense now. People just like dumb sh**. So basically if you're over 30 and you stopped smoking weed ( that's a big one) this movie is just going to be dumb. Idk, maybe it's me- I don't like drug movies either ... i mean if you're not impressed by gangs or English slang / Ebonics, this won't be that great. It's a kids movie and I imagine kids who relate with the characters... to me , I just from the very first scene I wanted the lead actor to die and get killed by the alien. I couldn't believe that the movie was going to actually be about this group of punk kids.. but again, makes total sense nowadays . j didn't think it was funny or smart or anything. But I lived a pretty crazy lifestyle for most of my youth and I'm just over it .. smoked more weed all that. I think this movie is for people who wish they lived like this or kinda think they are like this in their heads or the other option. Just immature and stupid with really easy to meet needs as far as film goes - action, etc. I don't want to sound like Debbie downer- I mean the acting is great , the script is realistic. As far as dialogue, and it's a well produced movie. Its cute . I just wanted to warn the adults out there that this is not the movie for you if you're smart and like I said over 30 and stopped smoking weed.

115,Matti-Man,"Attack the movie if you must, just not what you imagine the movie to be",7,6 July 2014,"I always like to check out the other reviews before I submit my opinion of a movie on IMDb. And what I found while checking through the other reviews of ATTACK THE BLOCK here is that if the reviewer likes the film, everyone else tags the review as not helpful, and if the reviewer hates the film, usually taking the film's plot points out of context or just plain misrepresenting what happens in the film, then everyone finds the review helpful.Here's the thing - the question is, ""Was the above review useful to you?"" Is is NOT ""Do you AGREE with the above review?"" Right, now I've set the scene for everyone here to find my review not helpful, I'll press on ...I like ATTACK THE BLOCK ... a lot. I liked it when I first saw it on Channel 4 in 2012 and I've watched it again a couple of times since, the most recent being last night. It never fails to entertain me.I will however take issue with a couple of the other reviews here ... for example:""The girl they tried to rob and rape comes asking for seconds"". Nonsense. No one tried to rape Sam, at least, not in this movie. The reviewer might not like the characters - I don't like them much either - but no need to try to prevent others from watching the film by misrepresenting what happens on screen.Another reviewer says that having the protagonists not apologise for mugging her ""drives a huge wedge between them and the audience"". But to do that would have been lazy writing on Cornish's part, turning essentially irredeemable characters in to ""tame"" cuddly nice guys. This kind of inner city feral teenagers are not nice people. They are what they are, not what you'd like them to be.The same reviewer says that ""The police are especially hard done by, they are portrayed as totally corrupt and not to be trusted under any circumstances"". This is simply not true. The only two police officers who have anything to do here are the two who arrest Moses for mugging Sam. Which he did. We saw him do it. If he claims he's an innocent victim of a brutal police force ... WE know he's lying. So how are the police hard done by? I'm mystified.Same reviewer finds ""disturbingly strong misogynist atmosphere"" because ""The only criticism they (the boys) face is from weak female characters who are unable to defend themselves, and who rely on the various male gang members for protection from violent outsiders."" Gee, I dunno, looked they were doing okay, when Tia and Dimple take down an alien with a standard lamp and an ice skate. Didn't need much help from the boys ...A reviewer from the US says, ""we're supposed to not like these street punks at first, and then admire them as they redeem themselves"". Nope, that's only in Hollywood movies. I don't think Cornish expects you to like these characters any better by the end of the movie. But what we do see here is a glimmer, the slightest chance, that these characters might be able to turn their lives around. What we don't know is whether they will take the opportunity.A reviewer from South Africa says, ""The dialogue was apparently authentic, but it sounded made up, like the droogs' language in A Clockwork Orange."" Yes, the dialogue IS authentic. I live in Tower Hamlets (on the north side of the river from Oval) and that's exactly what the feral teenagers talk like. So I'd say the issue isn't with the dialogue, it's with the reviewer. It only sounded made up to that reviewer. So they're essentially criticising Joe Cornish for being accurate. But enough ...ATTACK THE BLOCK is just exactly what it looks like. A low-budget, cleverly-written alien attack movie set in the inner-city, deprived area of South London. The lead characters are products of that environment. Marginalised teenagers who have somehow become convinced that education has nothing to offer and that the only way out of their situation is low-level crime and, very likely, an early death. They're not heroes. They're not redeemed by the events of the film. You CAN not like them, and it's doesn't make any difference. But they are characters I recognise ... raw and authentic. I wouldn't say they're Real, because they're aping the mannerisms of US rappers, but that IS how the kids down my endz act.Don't take it so seriously. ATTACK THE BLOCK is not a searing social document. It's not a hard-hitting indictment of our times. It's just a bloody great sci-fi action movie. Stop criticising it for what it's not ...",Attack the Block
116,Sjhm,Frustrating,3,24 June 2012,"A first. This is the first time in my life that I was praying for at least 85% of the cast to be eaten after only ten minutes of film. After 15 minutes, that went up to 90%. This plays like Resident Evil without scary monsters and with a cast of teenage thugs instead of Alice. Gang of teenage thugs mug a girl. They are interrupted before they can go any further by an alien crash landing on a car. Being teenage thugs, they kill it. Which calls down a serious reign of terror on their heads. It's messy, noisy and in your face, but ultimately not very satisfying. It's a shame, this could have been so much more than teenage thugs go to war. If this was supposed to be a comedy it really wasn't even vaguely amusing. Nick Frost may be present, but scarcely registers. One of the main problems is the gangsta language, it's so dense that most people would need subtitles.",Attack the Block

And a large amount of the actors have gone on to be quite successful so the director chose well.In terms of the story and setup, it's all fine. They're attacked by alien creatures and they have to protect 'the block'. I had some issues with the overall execution of this premise. Its setup seems like it's going to be a bit goofier than it actually ends up being. It's not really a fun movie at all. The action is coherent for the most part and nicely shot. But it's very violent and is almost like a horror movie at times. I think Nick Frost was supposed to be the comic relief but he has barely more than a cameo of screen time compared to everyone else.It's an above average lower budget action movie but it only wants to dip its toe in humour and cheesy-ness despite having a fairly cheesy premise.",Attack the Block

Along with the groundswell of festival audiences who have raved about 'Attack the Block' after watching it, there have been notes of concern that the film could be seen as having ""brattish"" or chavvish/gangster"" protagonists whose swearing or drug, drink and crime fuelled behaviour must never be seen by under eighteens. I think that restricting the admission of views On his radio show and blog, Joe Cornish has often cited the ""kids'"" films of the 1980s as his favourites and that ""they don't make them like that anymore."" He is correct to an extent because the scatological humour, swearing and violence of 'The Goonies', 'The Gate', 'Explorers', 'Adventures in Babysitting', 'Gremlins' and 'Stand By Me' would never really make it to most kids' films today - although not all films children had been intended to view, children certainly saw them and helped popularise them. Cory Feldman, Josh Brolin, Sean Astin and other child actors of the time were often portrayed smoking, being rude and "" brattish"" - basically how kids, or more accurately some boys, behave among friends. I think 'Attack The Block' is a ""childrens'"" film done along the fairly dark, ribald trope of these fairly risqué kid-centric films of the 1980s. It retains a dark sense of threat that made 'Gremlins' so funny yet horrific.",Attack the Block

This is yet another just-for-fun film and taking this too seriously will probably land you in major disappointment.If you're looking for pure fun, this is definitely the right kind of story to provide you with that, with a slight touch of ""Die Hard"" for me as well, since most of the movie takes place in a residential block. Other than the intense one hour and a half, it is also a story about the hardships of these teenagers, their friendships, and of course, gangs. But those elements aren't over-emphasized, nor do they interfere with the entertainment the plot has to offer. As I said, the theme of this movie is not too serious. As long as you love science fiction with aliens and an exciting adventure through the eyes of a bunch of teenagers, this shouldn't go wrong for you.Visuals and sounds are not too captivating, but they remain sufficient.

Didn't expect much going in but it turned out to be a fantastic twist on a tired genre: Alien Invasion movies. It's wildly original (I can definitely say I've never seen anything like it), cleverly written, flat out hilarious and had a very engaging story. If you loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, I think you're going to love this as well. It's clear this wasn't made a with a big budget, but it doesn't take away from it. Not at all. It just goes to show with a great story, interesting characters and a fresh take on something old, you can make a great movie. I thought the little kids did a great job in the film (unlikely heroes as they were) and made the film that much more appealing. It's like Skyline but made for a lot less and significantly better.This movie was a whole lot of fun from the get go and didn't disappoint.

126,MarcusJ13,Better than expected,8,17 June 2011,"I was quite looking forward to this film but had neutral expectations as to how good I thought it was going to be. The premise is simple really, a gang of youths find their local area invaded by aliens and must do their up most to protect themselves as well as help a lady they previously attempted to rob. The film starts out fairly quickly paced. There isn't really much time wasted with expository dialogue or what would be slang in this case. The reason for this being the film comes at a fairly brisk running time of an hour and a half which serves it well not becoming boring for one moment. Acting wise, near enough everyone does a good job, the characters played off each other very well and we got a decent idea of their prior relationships without dumping explanations. This is touted as a comedy but I found the humour to be based around the events more which meant it didn't become vital to the enjoyment of the film. The serious moments seem to outnumber the humorous ones especially as the film progresses. The lead character of Moses does very well in particular and showed his potential for playing dramatic roles in the future. A quick mention for Nick Frost, where he was amusing at times but it was refreshing to see him play a supporting role where he was utilised very well and made for a much better performance. At many points the film did get quite scary and the aliens were genuinely terrifying with a sense of mystery about them. It went to show that huge budgets were not required to make them scary and make the attacks any less believable. In fact they look better than some of monsters mainstream Hollywood films have had to offer honestly which is a testament to all those involved in the creation of them. In summary do check this film out as it makes for a dynamic horror comedy that does not overdo certain elements in an attempt to appeal to an audience that might not be attainable.",Attack the Block

Like many good indie flicks, Attack the Block is well acted, well shot, well designed and well directed.The technical side, although not perfect, is pretty sick. With a great use of camera angles, lights, and music, the viewer is dragged kicking and screaming into anxiety-ridden action. Even the ""gorilla-wolf mf's"" with the teeth gone ""rave"" are a riot.Bruv, for an English movie, I had to turn the English subtitles on, fam. The dialogue between the brethren is bare slang. Ironically, it is this mad mash-up of the Queen's English that helps make this monte aight. Have your urban app standing by to translate if you're born in the 70's or earlier.Nick Frost (without his BFF Simon Pegg) plays a minor role (pity), but John Boyega, who was 19 (19!) when Attack the Block was made (his first feature), and veteran British actress Jodie Whittaker, are your main protagonists who hold their own.Easy peasy lemon squeezy.",Attack the Block
128,petrelet,Silly and clichéd with interesting dialogue and setting.. you call it,7,19 April 2015,"A youth gang, residents of a public housing high-rise in London, is out mugging people when a space alien crashes among them. They kill it. But it doesn't end there... So it begins, an entry in the long line of movies in the ""Team Humans (Youth Division) vs. Team Monsters"" tradition. We have seen a lot of them and we can joke about a lot of the clichés - the people on opposite sides who make common cause against the foe, the people on opposite sides who never do, the people who don't believe there are really monsters until they are half eaten by the monsters, the kids who can't count on any grownups and have to save the world themselves, and so on and on. And you know what? This story is full of them. And not in a send-up way either.So that isn't good. Also, the aliens and the pseudoscience are about the worst and silliest you will ever see anywhere. I'm not talking about low-cost effects, I'm talking about low-logic ideas. And you know how monsters are sometimes impossible to kill and sometimes so easy to fight off that a child can do it, depending on who the writers want to kill off and who they want to save? Well, these aliens are the new encyclopedia picture for the concept. Their powers are elastic and inconsistent.Having said that, this movie has some virtues. It moves quickly, and there isn't any dead time in its under-90-minutes length. It has a good rhythm of monster scenes and human scenes, action and dialogue.But the big thing it has going for it is the whole London working class/oppressed youth culture vibe that pervades it. Watching it from Chicago with the closed captioning on - a necessity to pick up all the argot - I enjoyed the novelty of it all, and it made the youths interesting and sympathetic without I think overly prettying up the destructive stuff they do. (Or overly preaching about it? Well...) And it placed them in an interesting and probably accurate place - partly within everyone else's society, using the same language of popular culture, and in the homes of their clueless ""normal"" parents, and partly in their own world of the street that their fringy drugs-and- muggings habits make for them.When the dialogue was trying to plant a plot point or send a message it was pretty clunky, but when it was an ""incidental"" scene it was pretty intelligent and funny. I'm thinking, for example, of an early scene where the youths are discussing how to make money off a monster carcass and debating which newspaper to call - the Guardian will carry more weight, but the Sun will pay better. And there are others.So whenever I start to ask myself anything about the aliens I start to hate the movie and want to rate it as a five or a four, but when I focus on the parts I actually enjoyed I want to give it a seven. As I am feeling in a good mood right now I will stick with the seven, but your results may vary.",Attack the Block

131,Victor_Fallon,A Bit of a Shame,3,3 September 2011,"A big fan of Joe Cornish, I decided I would like this film and forgive a lot of its flaws, but sadly, it disappoints.It's a film that has 'rookie director' written all over it, but I hope Cornish comes back with something tighter and better developed.It has elements you think you can't go wrong with - original locations, unique protagonists, aliens, violence and swearing. What's not to like? Well, plenty.The teens at the core of the story are uniformly unlikeable from the outset. These are just horrible people, which may be intentional, but they end up being entirely dispiriting to watch. Their borderline-unintelligible dialect is annoying but I don't mind strong dialects in movies IF the visual storytelling is up to scratch and takes responsibility for moving the story along. It doesn't. Dialogue scenes are clunky and stagey so, unless you speak fluent 'street', things come to a halt when people start talking.There are whole scenes where you could take any line of dialogue and give it to any of the other characters and it would make no difference whatsoever. All of the 'heroes' have exactly the same voice and are an indistinct blur as characters. There is an occasional hint at a sub-plot which fails to ignite and luxuries such as a c-story are nowhere to be found.Ultimately, these hateful little creeps spend their time being hateful little creeps. I rooted for neither the aliens nor the humans. They can beat and eat each other to death for all I care. But I wanted to care. So it fails as a movie.There are very few flourishes or risks in terms of camera work or production value, so it quickly becomes visually dull. It's like looking down a dark alley at some shouty kids for 90 minutes or so. You might squint and wonder what on earth is going on, but ultimately walk on by and leave them to their own stink.My four stars are for trying really really hard.

An alien invasion on a South London council estate. Oh another alien invasion movie you say? But Attack The Block is different, because aliens finally decide to come to London to kick off their worldwide invasion. Yes, London! Not some town in middle American no one's ever heard of! Not only that, but they filmed it near where I currently live and where I grew up. First London Boulevard, now this. Where was I when all this was going on? Anyway, I enjoyed it! Had a budget of 8 million to play with from the UK Film Council. Set pieces were well filmed, as were the scenes without any action in them. A scary movie at times. Cornish does well to capture the fear and tension the characters experience as they battle the aliens. But he may get some stick for depicting gang culture in such a comical way. It's a sign of the times, but not something I would take seriously. Performances were very good! Which is saying a lot, because the script is a lot to be desired. Cringeworthy, phrases like ""ya get me"" ,""ya dun no"" and ""lau it blood"" are some of the more commonly used slang words. Not that I had a problem with it. No it took me back to my teenage years when I was at school/college. In fact it's one of the reasons why I was able to relate to the characters. They all reminded me of the guys I grew up and went to school with. The aliens themselves, looked basic in design but were visually effective in some scenes. Also a very funny film, which had me laughing out loud at times. My only negatives from this are that the script could have been better. And the performance from one of the young actors in particular, was a bit over the top for me. All in all and this is a short review. Attack The Block is worth a go! Another product of the defunct UK Film Council. A shame really! If they can provide the tools to make a decent film like this, made in London, in 4 days, with the budget it was given.

134,socialmedia-437-956449,Revenge of the ASBOs,8,16 August 2012,"From the producers of ""Shaun of the Dead"" comes ""Attack the Block"", a science fiction comedy that pits savage alien monsters against the Earth's best line of defense, a group of hoody wearing, knife wielding, teenaged youths from the mean streets of South London.The story for this dark British comedy unfolds in the unlikely setting of a deprived and foreboding council estate, where we meet the anti-hero Moses (John Boyega) and his gang as they rob an innocent woman, Sam (Jodie Whittaker) at knife point. There is no hiding the fact that these teenagers are the stuff of nightmares as they prey upon fragile victims, but it is they who soon become the prey when aliens start dropping out of the sky in the form of dark, vicious dog-like monsters. As one of the teenagers exclaims, the aliens are ""blacker than my cousin Femi!"" Joe Cornish, the writer/director, took inspiration from his own personal experience of a mugging in Brixton, London. Having an understanding of the nature of disenfranchised youth gave weight to the character development of these teenagers, who, if they were to meet the kids from the 1985 film, ""The Goonies"", would most likely beat them up, steal their bikes, and eat all of Chunk's chocolate bars. The use of street slang and popular culture is a means to win the audience over – ""I just want to go home, lock my door and play Fifa"" has a universal appeal to PlayStation addicted urbanites across the globe. You soon forget that Moses and his gang would sell their own grandmother for loose change if they weren't being pursued by the devilish monsters from outer space.There is no doubt that Cornish has attempted to create a film with a social conscious, setting it in a deprived area of broken Britain which remarks on a society not giving the disenfranchised a chance at life. Interestingly, the film was released in the UK a few months before riots broke out in London – almost telegraphing a message of discontent felt by the young. Although not standing behind a banner of justice, the riots were a sharp reminder to politicians and community groups that there exist deep rooted problems in certain sections of British society.By no means an essay for social reform, ""Attack the Block"" keeps the laughs coming. There are plenty of nods to teenage sci-fi films, with clear references to ""Gremlins"" and ""Critters"". But where in those American films, we saw well behaved kids rallying together, here we see young terrors yelling, ""killing 'em, killing 'em straight"".The cast of mainly inexperienced actors give real authenticity to the group. Mainly discovered through their schools and online auditions, we are given a raw performances of real street kids – all of whom would be expelled from Hogwarts if they even bothered to turn up. Jodie Whittaker is a convincing underpaid overworked nurse who the gang first robs, before reuniting with her to take on the aliens. Nick Frost adds hilarity as a lazy drug dealer who never leaves his flat.The CGI aliens are probably the most silly aspect of ""Attack the Block"". They look like black blobs with glowing teeth, which is meant for a minimal effect. I couldn't but help think it may have been a budget constraint. Still this film is about delivering comedic set pieces over its brisk 88 minutes. ""Attack the Block"" is a film teenagers will adore, as well as adults with misspent youths. You may wish to be warned that some of the comedy may fly over the heads of a non-British audience, but ""Shaun of the Dead"" worked as an export and if that's the kind of film you like then you are sure to enjoy Attack the Block – just as long as you can decode the street jargon.",Attack the Block

What is then very interesting is the way this character is developed, when there is a scene where every character hops back home and we see their flat/family, and in this scene it is highlighted that we do not see the protagonists living conditions. This scene is a spectacular way to imply something about the character.The movie also has very fun societal commentary, mainly the drug lord of the block. The implication is that the protagonist is making progress to become like him, but the situation(aliens attacking) calls for him to change into something else. Of course the sad societal commentary here is that if this alien invasion did not occur then a perfectly good kid would have turned into another criminal. So its got a very deep message in terms of societal constructs and pressures which make certain family structures(like living alone as a kid) not at all possible under the current paradigm.The characters all seem genuine and talk with very strong but hilarious accents.

The film also proves you can still make fun action movies that ooze a social conscience... and therein lies the magic.The movie kicks off with a South London teenage gang - led by a black Moses - mugging a young white woman. Immediately, my sense of social justice kicked in and I thought: ""I'm going to hate this. Should I just turn it off now?"" Glad I didn't.After a while I began to realize that the movie is about the enemy within... in this case represented by shadowy alien beasts invading ""the block"". Every time the film throws us an answer, it leads to yet another question. As others have pointed out, the movie is by no means perfect. But its' many good points far outweigh its' minor flaws.The performances are uniformly good to excellent. The special effects, while not brilliant, defy the movie's minuscule budget. All in all an impressive effort by Joe Cornish.Peter Sykes (Sci-Fi Lists)",Attack the Block
146,bipbop13,Bills Reviews For Short Attention Spans,5,9 March 2019,"I was let down. How can a movie that features aliens attacking an apartment complex with one of the stars from Shaun of the Dead in it be a let down? I'm not sure, but it was. A group of unlikable kids robs a young woman at knife point. After the robbery, a meteor crashes into a car next to them When they investigate an alien attacks. The boys are able to fight it off, then chase & kill it. Wrong move. Lots more aliens come from the sky to exact revenge on their fallen comrade. The aliens themselves are a let down as well. The teeth on them are very cool though (you'll understand when you watch), but the rest is a kind of black ink blot. So, chases, fights, gore & blood ensue, but really none of these characters is worth caring about that much, and the reasons for almost everything that happens in the movie are either never given, or are random at best. If you really shut off your brain at the door, you can waste ninety minutes on this without too much pain though. Funny thing is, I keep remembering those teeth!",Attack the Block
147,rdbrown-zeteo,People Need to Watch This! Here's why...,8,2 September 2011,"Its way too much fun to risk not watching.I was scanning through a list of sci-fi movies and came across this one. I thought the name reflected the typical B-rated cheesy science fiction alien movie. But, the cover art was too good and too cool not to look into what the movie was about and what people said about it. It didn't take much to convince me to watch it.Its a satisfying alien attack movie because its unique. The aliens are really cool and not your typical aliens. They are really cool looking actually.The acting is really good. The story is simply, but sometimes seems multi-layered. There is some depth to the story that is heartwarming and connects you to the characters.The characters are all really interesting and the actors, especially since most of them are teenagers or children, did a really good job.The action and suspense was really good and fun. There is also some good humor in it.Don't let the sound of the title fool you! If you liked Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz then I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie. Even if you didn't like those movies... I'm sure you will find this movie entertaining if you like aliens and survival stories. Very good movie. There is a lot of bad language in the movie though, and much of it comes from the young actors in the movie.though I found a few parts funny when the young actors cursed, its hard to listen to young kids and teenagers cuss like that or even get high.None-the-less, this movie is a ton of fun!",Attack the Block
148,Schnayblay,"In the vein of ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Attack the Block"" joins the ranks of British Comedies that Americans Will Love",8,31 May 2012,"""Attack the Block"" was a movie I heard about solely because I love Edgar Wright. He directed my second favourite movie ever, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"", which I've seen hundreds of times. Anything Wright does is unique, extremely funny and smart, and has a flare that is completely his. So when I heard he was producing this new British alien invasion movie, I immediately decided I had to see it.""Attack the Block"" is about a local street gang of teenagers in London. When a meteor comes down baring an alien, the gang's leader, Moses, decides to kill it. Soon enough, a wave of extraterrestrials hell-bent on the death of the gang invade Paris, and it becomes a fight for survival. The plot is very standard, but it's all you really need. One thing I always liked about Edgar Wright's movies is that the premise is always very simple. This movie is a lot like his film, ""Shaun of the Dead"". It's never explained what caused the zombies, and it doesn't matter. The same thing applies to the aliens in this movie. Doesn't matter what world they came from, they're just here.The cast is really the films strong point. John Boyega plays Moses. He does a good job. At first, you don't like this guy. He's ruthless, selfish, and hardly cares about anyone but himself. Over the film though, his character is well developed, and by the end, you're routing for him. It's a great example of how to make a character arc. But even still, while you do care for Moses, I don' find Boyega's acting that impressive. It's a weird thing, I care for Moses, the character, but Boyega is so bland He speaks pretty much in monotone, and he never gets rid of that stone face. I know he's a newcomer, but still. The only thing that makes me care for him is his dialogue and the situational aspects of his character; his hardships at home and his slave-like position to the gangs. There's maybe one scene where a sliver of acting comes from Boyega, but it's over a phone, so you can't see his face, and it kills his shining moment.Then there are the other members of the gang. Pest is my favourite. He's hilarious because he's like the weakest of the group. He's one of those great toques with the tassels, and he uses fireworks to fight the aliens. Then there's Sam, played by Jodie Whittaker. She's a woman who the gang mugged earlier the same night of the invasion. Needless to say, she's resentful to help the gang survive. One of the funniest character interactions is when Pest is hitting on her. It's hilarious. She looks a lot like Gemma Arterton to me. There's not really much to say about her character, but shes good none the less. Then there's Ron, played by Nick Frost. He just steals every scene he's in. He's very likable and funny, in a very simple way. He doesn't need to do much to make you laugh. You look at his haircut alone and chuckle. The final characters I have to mention are the two kids, Probs and Mayhem. They're a couple of like, nine year olds trying to be a part of the gang, and they're awesome. They get to kick some alien ass themselves, and their dialogue is priceless. I wish we could get like a 10 minute short film of just them fighting the aliens. It'd be a great bonus feature.The effects in this movie are wonderful. It's all practical effects. The aliens are just guys in suits, and it's something I've really missed in movies. It's rare to see good old prosthetics and animatronics used to create a creature these days, instead of just making some CGI. Don't get me wrong, CGI can be fantastic, but it doesn't have the same effect as something actually being on the screen, fighting someone.""Attack the Block"" is a fantastic film. It's hilarious, brilliantly written, great practical effects, and has very likable characters. If you're looking for a good way to waste an hour and a half, give it a watch. It's well worth it.",Attack the Block
149,dsmith1868-1,Truly despicable main characters had me rooting for the aliens,3,20 January 2012,"Very well made and shot. Great alien design. Unfortunately, this supposedly ""fun"" sci-fi film is populated by truly despicable characters. I'm not sure if this is a SPOILER, but I thought it was unfortunate that some of the main characters actually survived so that they may continue to mug and deal drugs another day. I truly wanted each and every main character of this film to be killed by the aliens. If you are the sort that can identify with the leads of this film, you may need to reevaluate your life choices. If you are a writer on this film, you may need to reevaluate your life choices. It was amusing that the writers threw in some even MORE despicable characters just to make the main despicable characters seem less despicable. Got that? They also gave the lead a biblical name as well. All smoke and mirrors. What minimal character arcs that were present in an attempt to have you feel for these punks were nowhere near enough to redeem them by the end. SPOILER. Even as the ""lead"" character is getting hauled off to prison at the end, the joy that I would feel at this moment is hindered by crowds cheering for him and his ""heroism"". ""Heroism"" earned through self defense after brutally beating to death a female of the alien species which kicked off this whole ordeal. Who knows if the aliens would even have been a threat in the first place? Will the crowds still be cheering after he gets out of jail in a few years and steals their wallet or sells drugs to their kids on the school playground? Probably not. It is yet another moment where the film tries really hard to get you to identify with one of these scumbags. A true waste of talent on all fronts with this film.",Attack the Block
150,skinhead-5,Block buster is ain't but it's a great film to watch.,8,17 May 2011,"What an excellent parody on south London estate gang culture, the film makers got this down to a absolute tee. Even on the bus home from the cinema it was full of school kids from the local bandit school speaking just like in the film.Although it's clearly a take on sci-fi films of a bigger budget the film proves you can do a film on a low budget and get same effects. All right, the aliens are basically rugs bought from the local carpet shop with some added lights for jaws they do work. The ending of film is a scene stolen from I-Robot with the robots climbing the skyscraper and the lift scenes are from several films out there but it all works.The characters are just ""as is"" you see on the streets of London and whoever was responsible for the research they should be getting a Oscar, the language, the actions and all this pseudo gansta culture is absolutely correct.The story line is simple and requires no destruction of your grey matter that gives you time to relish in the dialogue and laugh at it, albeit this is how things are on estates. Enjoy it for what it is, the acting is very ""Shaun of the Dead, the plot very strait forward although the ending of the film will leave you feeling a tad sorry for Moses but he after all a mugger and suspect the end was more moralistic than anything.The overtones of Channel 4 Films and Studio Canal are evident and this is what makes it all the much more enjoyable.",Attack the Block
151,degeneraatti,A true lesson in how to make an engaging film with limited budget,7,28 September 2014,"All aspiring film-makers should watch this. And those producing films for SyFy or Asylum should also take note.First and foremost, we need characters. Characters that have each their own voice and emotions, all growing from their personal past. This makes the viewer care about what happens to them, root for them, and believe in them. It also takes a bit of the storytelling burden off the cinematography, as these characters can support the story in their part.Secondly, a compelling story should be written. Compelling does not necessarily equal complex. A story should have events pan out in an order that presents at least some kind of logic and thought behind it. Twists and turns are okay, but they don't have to be gimmicks. This doesn't mean resorting to worn clichés, but have these engaging characters something to do. Something, that has some weight to it, so that the viewer stays focused for the length of the movie.And third, add a bit of vision. A little quirk here and there brings the humanity of the characters, the story, and those making the film apparent, and creates the valuable bond between the finished movie and its' audience.As we can see, none of these elements require much of a budget. So having a small budget should not be a constraint per se, but rather a source of ingenuity. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one excellent example, Attack the Block is another.It is clear that they did not have the money for a plethora of awesome locations, top-notch CGI, or brand-name anything. But what they managed to do with what they had was fun and entertaining and well worth a re- watch: The lack of shooting locations was masked with a brilliant and logical reason for limited room; lack of awe-inspiring special effects was masked with more traditional skills, ie. use of light and sound, and going story first (everyone knows how annoying is the modern over-focus on CGI over human connection, even when the effects are great); and I have no reason to believe they were looking for cheap actors, but people with desire to go out and do their best and have some fun while at it.This film is fresh and entertaining, and as stated in the beginning, a great lesson in how to make something great out of nothing much.",Attack the Block
152,Filmaholic78,Fantastic 5* British Film,8,15 May 2011,"Firstly you have got understand this film is made in the same genre and style as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's pure British humour and is designed not to take itself too seriously. Having said that I have to admit the start of the film depicts a gritty reality that could almost be mistaken as a scene from a real drama like ""Harry Brown"". Then afterwards the fun begins. It is pure comical laugh out loud genius. I have read a few bad reviews here on IMDb and I can only assume these reviewers just didn't get it. I'm not going to say they are wrong, they just obviously don't find this type of humour entertaining. The producers and director hit the nail on the head with this one by mixing the grim reality that little chavs are in fact little bas*ar#s, their English is terrible, attitudes stink and have no respect what so ever. Combine that with aliens, hilarious dialogue and a ridiculous situation and you get Attack the Block. Whats so funny about the film is you can actually believe thats how these little mother fluffers act. The direction is fantastic, acting is surprisingly good and what I was relieved at are the special effects weren't as bad as I thought they would be. After I saw a trailer for the film I had my doubts, the aliens looked a bit naff, the ""made by the Producers of Shaun of the Dead"" and name dropping of Nick Frost made me think they were going to rely on this for success but thankfully they delivered a film that stands on it's own two feet. What I will say though is I don't think anyone outside of the u.k will enjoy it as much, it is very British and they probably wouldn't get a lot of the dialogue/slang and references. To sum this one up I have to say it did everything it set out to do well, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone that wants to watch a non stop fun fest.",Attack the Block
153,jackstarr777,"Different, cute, fun and overlooked",10,3 April 2012,"As I have gathered from other reviews on this site, this film is very prejudiced and overlooked. Nobody seems to have taken into account the warm humour, the brilliantly cheesy action and the neat script and instead gone on to bash the ""hoodie youth"" protagonists, who are seen mugging people, vandalising things and smoking cannabis. But all that isn't half the point.'Attack the Block' really gets you going; it's exciting, especially for a teenage audience. It's best seen on the big screen, and when I did see it I'm certain I've never had more fun in a theatre. There's so many laughs, thrills and scares to be had it's unbelievable.Joe Cornish does terrifically as a debut, helped all the while with Edgar Wright producing. If you enjoyed Wright's previous films ('Shaun of the Dead', 'Hot Fuzz', 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' and of course the brilliant series 'Spaced') chances are you'll love this too, with its darkly comic but warm and different stylistic cinematography. And speaking of Wright, Nick Frost doesn't exactly give the performance of a lifetime, but his character fits in incredibly well with the kids. It's a real pleasure to see.There's barely anything I didn't like about this film personally, to be honest. The characters were great, the script brilliant, the filming style amateurish - but that's one of the things that makes it so great. If this was a Hollywood production, it would only be worth a pretty average 6.8 rating. But this is different; a light-hearted, fun-filled adventure.In conclusion, it's best avoided by miserable, fussy people who can't stand to see delinquent teens in an adventure - but as for those who love laughs, thrills, jumps, frights and excitement, this is one of the best films you'll see for a very long time.9.8/10",Attack the Block
154,robojames,Almost Good,6,13 March 2021,"This is one of those films that comes so close to being good you just want to blow on it and push it over the line. It isn't bad, though. It's just sort of upper-middling in a particularly frustrating way.The monsters are good and the premise and characters pretty compelling, especially at the beginning, but the film sort of misfires in several ways at once after that. The comedy isn't quite funny enough, the action isn't quite meaty and substantial enough, and you don't get enough explanation about the aliens to really put your mind in gear.Where are they from? Don't know. What do their ships look like? No idea. Do they have an advanced language? Not clear. Why were they in the vicinity of Earth? anyone's guess.There's mystery and then there's black blobs with glowing teeth that have been implanted into a setting just for people to fight so that we can see fighting. Fighting that isn't all that great.The film does start well, though, building up suspense and interest. The characters are decent, even if there are too many long scenes of them talking to each other, and the ending has a kind of redemptive quality that I appreciated. Attack The Block is watchable, light viewing that doesn't outstay its welcome but doesn't excel at anything either.",Attack the Block

But the humans were so wretched that within a few minutes I was cheering on the aliens to clean up the homo sapiens gene pool...eat them quick! Before they can reproduce! We are supposed to care about the fate of teenage thugs whose ""English"" is so unintelligible that I had to get English subtitles to follow the dialog? And after a few minutes I realized, following the dialog was irrelevant, and I wondered, if these kids are the future of our species, do we deserve to survive this invasion?

The film obviously wasn't very expensively made, but with a concept as ridiculous as this, there was no need for it to be more expensive. But what elevates this film from a low-budget average film is the funny performance from the always funny Nick Frost, and the great atmosphere in the film. It was actually really tense at times, I'd never have guessed the atmosphere would be that good. The film knew what kind of film it was right from the start, so if you're 15 minutes in and already feeling like you're wasting your time, there's no need to watch it 'til the end, because the film won't go in a different direction.

Err ..... okay, I'm familiar with the concept of anti-heroes but already I'm having empathy problems. They are interrupted by an alien crashing through the roof of an adjacent Volvo. Being the enlightened individuals they are, our role models kick seven colours of snot out of the strangely defenseless alien life form. In a mission to re-balance cosmic karma, the alien's mates turn up - looking like large black muppets with strangely fluorescent teeth. The new arrivals are rather less defenseless and all hell breaks loose. Now, I don't know about you but when I saw Alien Resurrection all those years go, Sigourney Weaver and Ron Perlman were the good guys - in this one, I was rooting for the aliens.

An American film would seriously have beaten that horse to death and beyond (as is kind of evident in the reviews I've read so far.) Yes, the story is about a gang who runs into alien interlopers and responds in gang fashion, which is the premise of the whole movie. People are butthurt because the main character is an alpha male who happens to be black and leads a group of people through this violent alien conflagration which he more-or-less predicated by killing one of the aliens on first encounter. Ooops.The main character is 15 years old. The alien he killed attacked him when he tried robbing the car the alien crash landed in.It's very funny, it held me all story long and there was a character arc that was quite satisfying.

161,crazy-ben66,"Another Finely Tuned Brit-Buster, But Nothing More",7,16 May 2011,"Since the late 1980's, British cinema has drifted in and out of mainstream success, most notably (and most recently) the groundbreaking accomplishment of Edgar Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead'. It's well toned blend of British humour and clever parody noted it as an audience favourite on both sides of the Atlantic, planting it's stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost firmly in the limelight. All eyes then turned to the talented threesome of Wright, Pegg and Frost as they set up part 2 of the now aptly named ""Blood and Ice-Cream Trilogy"", a buddy cop-comedy entitled 'Hot Fuzz'. Another runaway hit, the 3 are yet to come out with the third and with Hollywood knocking who knows what will happen. In the meantime though, Team Shaun have been behind several new projects, the first being this very film, 'Attack the Block', directed by Wright's writing partner and star of BBC Radio, Joe Cornish and featuring Nick Frost himself; Cornish's ambitious debut has been surrounded with plenty of hype following the 2011 SXSW festival with many hailing it as the new 'Shaun of the Dead'. But are they right to jump to such vivid conclusions?As the cinematic debut of a lowly British radio-host, 'Attack the Block' appears on paper, to be the most ambitious yet. Featuring large and violently creepy alien breeds, an inexperienced inner-city cast and an entirely new ""street"" language, Cornish certainly had his work set out for him and with a budget of roughly £8 million, he did startlingly well. Although heavily British in its setting and characters, the film looks no different to any other Hollywood blockbuster, the tone replicating that of a much higher-budgeted picture perfectly, allowing maximum enjoyment from such basic effects. Cornish's simplistic touch to both the scripting and the pace of the film work beautifully, never slowing down to explain the origins of the increasingly menacing and uniquely dark alien creatures. It is through this that Cornish builds the biggest and most vital bridge of all, a link between the audience and the central characters, the ""youth"" gang. By beginning his feature with the fragrantly intimidating group mugging an innocent woman, Cornish doesn't make it easy to immediately love his subjects, but by putting us directly in their shoes throughout the entire ordeal, from first landing to the final fight, we build a close and almost personal bond with these troublesome boys and begin to see them as real human beings, not hooded cloaks of death as the British media would have you believe. By doing this, connecting his audience with his cast, Cornish makes the entire picture a lot deeper than any of us ever expected it to be; you begin to care for these boys, you invest your energy in hoping for their survival. Having said this, the pace of the movie moves so quickly and brutally, with Cornish desperate to tell his tale in less than 90 minutes, that when certain ""homies"" are strategically picked off, we have no time to dwell on their lost souls, and the boys have very little or no time at all to grieve their dead friends. Partner this with the under-use of some of the film's best talent (most notably Nick Frost) and we have ourselves a huge gaping hole of opportunity left shamefully blank. As far as inexperienced casts go, this is easily one of the best however, the majority of the leads finding their place amongst the group quickly and surely with only a few stragglers not towing the line as well as they could. John Boyega adds terrific layers to his mysterious Moses, the gang's silent leader, Alex Esmail peppers the creeping terror with well-time humour and Jodie Whittaker is fantastic as the believably concerned young nurse who seeks security in her previous muggers. Despite certain unmentionables drifting a little too close to home with some rather unhinged performances, the casting is to be highly praised, the true spirit of the film captured within the believability of the cast. Certainly far from being the new 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Attack the Block' is a fresh and considerate take on the Brit-buster. Evenly paced, mostly well acted and with some smart and sassy dialogue along the way, as a piece of entertaining science fiction, 'Attack the Block' passes with flying colours. Just don't expect for it to remain etched in your memory for long, the rather abrupt conclusion stealing away the dying seconds. Expect no brilliance, just good fun, Cornish's energetically contemporary debut is a sure fire hit amongst the teenager generation this side of the pond, but large chunks will surely be lost in translation. The best it is not, but 'Attack the Block' still manages to be fun and frothy without dwelling too much on unimportant aspects of its genesis. Think of it as a polite reminder of the kindness of the human condition, through the medium of alien invasion.",Attack the Block

Yes your right but just turn your brain off like i did and you will have a wonderful time.i have been tracking this film for a while now, and after finally sitting down and watching it i was extremely pleased. Yes this isn't a masterful piece of cinematic beauty and no this probably won't be a movie you will remember in 10 years time, but it is right now and you should enjoy it.So the plot is about a bunch of chav south London lads who defend themselves and their apartment block from an alien invasion. The aliens are a nice, creative take on what we would expect and there is a nice cameo from Nick Frost.I enjoyed this movie, it had some witty dialogue, nice little parts of blood splatter and great pop references to playing FIFA. My one issue may be the same as many people's though. As a teenager who is disgusted seeing other teens running around dressed like gangsters, mugging people and having no respect for hard working folks, this film completely glorifies this and makes it look cool, but i guess in the end it all about having fun, which i did.Good fun, not a superb film but something you might enjoy to sit with some mates and half a laugh and a cheer.

The bit where Mayhem has his pal riding around on a scooter ( toy one) as bait is priceless.The preppie 'posh' boy was also a great character.In short the gang kills what appears to be a small alien thinking they are cool, but little known to them the alien males are a lot bigger.There follows an invasion of aliens who seem to be targeting the gang and the girl they mugged earlier, we do find out why later.Plot holes yes, fun, definitely, the gang member who phones his mum all the time stuck in the commercial waste bin is good too.It is what it is, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz style horror comedy and it works well.If you are expecting a light romp thoroughly enjoyable then this is a must, if you are expecting a high budget special effects moralising film with a deep meaning go watch a Woody Allen film.EnjoyThere follows an invasion who seem to be targeting the gang, a psychotic gang leader, some awesome",Attack the Block
164,BigRichAU,Not your typical blockbuster,8,12 July 2013,"This film tries to go beyond simple entertainment. It succeeds in part, but this fact is also why so many reviewers have found it hard to like. You can either watch a film as a movie - a piece of entertainment that largely gives you what you want and expect - or you can go with more of an open mind and look at it as more of a work of art - something that challenges your perceptions of the world and of yourself.If you approach Attack the Block as just a movie then, yes, your enjoyment of it will depend on whether you can get over the fact that the 'heroes' are, on the surface, unlikeable toerags.However, if you go with more of an open mind, you will see that this film is challenging you to question your assumptions about these modern urban kids. Sure, it's a bit simplistic about it at times, but there are various moments in the film that I think reinforce the idea that this is what Joe Cornish was trying to do.The invasion against which they fight is more than just a neat special effect - in fact, given the film's budget, it's only barely that. It's really just a reminder that there are forces outside our control; outside the control of the police and authority as much as outside the control of the delinquent kids.Ultimately the film is trying to show the effect of fear on all our lives. These kids live in a world governed by fear of one kind or another - fear of each other, fear of the adults around them, and of course all the classic childhood fears. In that world their day to day behaviour is driven by whatever is the biggest fear. But show them that they are a part of society, and that society extends beyond their immediate day-to-day surroundings, and perhaps they will come to change their behaviour.I come from the same generation and a similar background to Joe Cornish. To me this film felt like it reflected my feelings about what Thatcher's government and policies, and their continuing legacy, have done for the less privileged parts of Britain. In a nation where there is no society, it's not surprising that kids feel like their actions have no repercussions.Of course, that idea is not without its problems. Maybe the way these kids respond to the developments in the film is more of a projection of Cornish's middle-class sensibilities than a real reflection of what kids in this situation would do and feel. It did feel at times like it was verging on trendy-vicar moral preachiness. But I'd rather give it the benefit of the doubt.It's also interesting that the real contempt in the movie seems to be reserved for the middle- class student character. The more we get to learn about his situation, the more you feel that he's there to be mocked as a proxy for every right-on posh kid and champagne socialist you've ever met.So in summary, it's an interesting and thought-provoking film. It perhaps has roots in a different set of ethical and political assumptions about what motivates people and how society should be than most mainstream movies. It works well in parts, it comes across as overbearing in others, but it is also entertaining. If you can cope with that combination it's well worth watching.",Attack the Block

I'm still high from the movie and adrenaline. man it was an imaginative piece of movie, from Brixton, and this is ""mein block""....it was fascinating, the entire ride, no big guns,,, just kids,, but did they belt out London style,,, with the aliens....being foreign style... you get me?aye Jamaican rhyming English lads,,,,and special effects, nicely done,,,enough to have me believe them without them spiffies... really thoughtfully done!

166,Spyan,Yob da filmin sci-fi,1,24 May 2014,"The movie starts with a gang of teenage walking collection of pustules and hoods (TWCPH) trying to rape/rob a 20 something girl (adult antagonist) while she walks to her car (night time).Then they stumble upon an alien young'un in a kiddie amusement park. The concept itself stumps their logic, so they beat it to death.Then they carry it around (the block) like a dead white boy impaled on a helicopter paddle, until the parents (alien) start chasing their dumb ar5es.They then take refuge in a pathetic wannabe gangster's (still carrying around the ""trophy"" and painfully articulating swear words as forms of satisfactory congratulations) s4ithole of an apartment and start insulting each other. Nick Forst briefly appears in this scene but I'd rather forget that. Too bad, the aliens are still after them, so they make themselves scarce (while thoroughly insulting each other and riding mopeds and bikes).Miraculously, the girl they tried to rob and rape comes asking for seconds, because they're so lovable and cute.You wish the protagonists get devoured by the dark, fluorescent teethed assailants, but by the time this happens, you'll probably be doing anything but watching.I suggest you do better things with your life than watch this rancid turd, I personally stopped watching (which is NOT a good sign) about 50 minutes in.This film feels like you are being MUGGED all the time by prepubescent morons that satisfy themselves with the fact that they outnumber you. It glorifies a bunch of scumbag idiots that deserve only castration, if only to spare the human gene pool of their potential wretched spawns.I would take a mild and uninterested pleasure in punching all the people involved in this with a quick and sharp jab to the nose. One of the most offensive movies I have ever watched.",Attack the Block
167,CrisPat,British slums and slang of universal appeal,8,11 April 2012,"The producers of this film have earned their bragging rights with ""Shaun of the Dead"". As it is safe to stick to a recipe that works, ""Attack the Block"" is another spoof horror, which this time brings together inner-city youth and blood-thirsty aliens. It's hard to say which of the two are scarier though, given how grittily the film portrays the slums.This movie is not a Hollywood-style corny passage to redemption. The teenagers who rob a girl at knife point at the beginning of the film do not go the full journey of becoming likable characters - there is no return from where fate has placed them. They only half-heartedly do some good, enough to keep the label of comedy on this film. The appeal of ""Attack the Block"" is driven instead, much like in ""Shaun of the Dead"", by the surrealism of the situations ordinary characters are involved in.There are a few essential elements which drive the film and can be read as very British: the dreaded council estate and its residents, both excellently portrayed here, and the language, which is a highlight and sounds inner-city enough to be funny. This does not prevent the film's general appeal: slums and slang are everywhere, and British humour has proved its universal character over and over again.",Attack the Block
168,jurassicmarc,The Goonies with asbo's.,9,16 May 2011,"Attack the Block to me proves that the British film industry is not only still alive and kicking but that it can create a movie that is above all fun. I will admit in the opening 15 minutes I wasn't sure I was going to like the 'gang' such as they were as they commit a pretty horrible crime at the beginning of the film. Not that I feel its always necessary to empathise with the films protagonist but regardless by the end of the movie I was pretty much sympathetic to their plight. The director says the film is influenced by the likes of Stand By Me or Gremlins, hes nailed it here the kids all seem very authentic as did Corey Feldman and co. did to me growing up in the 80's and in this respect not only do i think that teens will identify with it but older audiences can respect that Cornish is showing these teen warts and all. Thats not to say this is a film with deep monologue's about poverty and education but more its putting the fantastic against a complete opposite a very real very mundane life in a council tower block. The movies fast and at 88mins I was left wishing for more which is good in my opinion as Im very likely to watch again. The direction is tight but not over flashy the last third slow mo scene was very well done, the story itself pretty much starts with a bang and keeps on going. The setting looks very real and aside from the creatures bringing in some much needed to spice to the cold location Nick Frost is on hand to bring in some comic relief. Frost is a dab hand at this kind of character and does it with good effect here along with his middle class pot head customer/friend. The main gang themselves are authentic some times funny sometimes mean but always believable. A lot of my laughs came from pre-teen gang member wannabes 'Props' and 'Mayhem'. I don't want to add any spoilers so Ill end by saying that if you want to be entertained this week at the cinema go see Attack the Block.",Attack the Block

This is one the best movies that I've seen in a while. Although the movie is a throwback to the days of alien invasions, a very original story inhabited by a wide variety of characters has formed in a way that almost defies a simple explanation.The delivers a perfect movie experience through a blend of things we like to see in these kind of movies without reaching the cliché point. Through a brilliant display of screen writing, we can hate the characters at one point and then be amused by their actions and dialog or feel sympathy when they get eaten by creatures during another point. I usually enjoy creature features as long as the creatures themselves are fit to deliver, the aliens are no exception. The simple design of the aliens is just brilliant and although I don't mind a through explanation I like how the movie gives us just enough information to let us know what is going on and leaves the unimportant details up to us.Overall, a very well-done film from the UK. To me it's refreshing to see a British film that isn't a comedy or a zombie horror film. It's a nice alternative for sci-fi fans or anyone looking for a good movie. Do yourself a favor and watch this film. Now.",Attack the Block

Recommended for: fans of the UK television series ""The Misfits"".The drug dealer who owns the block is a psycho bad. The alien invaders are scary animals. Cops participate in a system of oppression. Bored pre-teen street thugs prowl the block avoiding home, looking for purpose, and thrill seeking.A straightforward theme, ""Actions have consequences."" A little bit of love thy neighbor.A smattering of gratuitous gore.John Boyega heroically portrays Moses in this tale of redemption well supported by an entertaining cast of sidekicks including tykes Sammy Williams and Michael Ajao as the aspiring street punks Probs and Mayhem.There aren't many films with protagonists this young aimed at an adult audience. Cornish spotlights the youth culture and attitudes with respect. Were these the kids causing real life mayhem in London riots? Do they need some aliens on which to take out their boredom and angst? What about someone who cares? Something to do? The film makes good use of low-tech special effects — fireworks, smoke and black light — with a great, simple alien creature concept.

172,Naomh,"Unfunny, unscary, unlikeable",4,14 May 2011,"I really, really wanted to love this. I love high concept films and I love comedy sci-fi / horrors - this falls flat on it's face alas. The leads are unlikeable. I get the moral tale near the end, but it's too little too late. Their apology to the nurse they mug came across as false. They're painted as unintelligible thugs at first and then we're told to like them and yet none have any charm or wit to speak of. Their accent got tiring and it seemed like they felt no emotion. They're just stupid bullies and at least three of the gang felt like they were basically the same character! It's fine having anti-hero's but give me a reason to like them. Here I found myself rooting for the aliens! I also found it to be pretty unfunny for a comedy and pretty unscary for a horror sci-fi. The aliens looked good (not like crappy CGI thankfully) but I didn't get what they did or what made them special. Ultimately what's the difference between them and hungry dogs? Early in the film we see them attack two police officers with the kind of power and ferocity that they never wield again. What's that about? The action also didn't build. It felt like the same scene over and over again.I really don't know what the hype about this film is. It's sad, I love the work of joe cornish and with edgar wright watching over his shoulder i was expecting a classic.

173,RockoutGlockout117,One heck of a fun time!,9,24 September 2012,"""Attack The Block"" is about as close as you can get to pure entertainment. It just pulls out scene after scene of humor and action.I've noticed that in a lot of the reviews people seem to be complaining that the protagonists were unlikable, which I admit I was worried about at first myself, the film opens with our gang mugging a woman at knife point for a moment I was really worried thinking ""These are our heroes?"" but over the course of the film I really felt the guys redeemed themselves, I'm not insulting people who disagree but I felt that in the end the gang, and Moses heart in particular were in the right place, full of a ridiculously politically slanted conspiracy theory perhaps but in the right place.I also really enjoyed the Aliens, they looked unlike any Aliens I've ever seen before these aren't your typical lizardy looking humans they are definitely something else. The film also has a Teen wielding a Katana and of course everyone's favorite character who spouts pop cultural references 24/7! So you can see the movie has a lot going for it.The things I didn't like about this movie are really minor but they are 1. Running Time hitting credits at about 83 minutes is pretty short, but still those were some exhilaratingly fun 83 minutes! 2. Not everyone makes it, I suppose Joe Cornish had to do this or else we wouldn't be afraid of the aliens but still I loved all those guys(the good guys anyway) and it was sad to see them go. 3. One sequence in particular felt like it was a lot shorter than it should've been, I think you'll recognize it when it happens, totally epic nonetheless.Then again who I am to complain ""Attack The Block"" is a great film, almost completely enthralling from beginning to end. I really recommend you check this movie out. Get it from the Library, order it online whatever you have to do, except of course illegally downloading it cause, thats.... you know, not cool. I was lucky enough to rent it for cheap, a buck literally, but it is worth a million times more than that.

If you agree with those statements, maybe Attack The Block is one to avoid.I realise the ad hominem approach can be self defeating a great deal of the time but in this company, I use it with an almost Nietzschean conviction.It looks like some of the people from the fancy side of the river have joined IMDb, but they have brought something with them from the Daily Mail forum: their beloved ""Broken Britain"" mentality.Even ignoring the subtext, it's just a great, fun movie.",Attack the Block

178,JessyCritical,"Entertaining, funny, but missing something.",8,29 May 2011,"Telling the story of a group of residents from an apartment block defending themselves against glowing- blue-teethed gorilla-type creatures from outer-space, Attack The Block had enough laugh out loud moments to keep me entertained to the end, but it was definitely missing something. The night is November the 5th and a lady notices, you wouldn't be able to tell ""if World War 3 is going on out there."" That is due to the sound of fireworks lighting up the sky, and she is almost right as something more sinister is about to happen. Attack The Block exceeded my expectations, and certainly everyone in the Cinema found it hilarious. However, there was something a bit try-hard about it. Yes, it was nice to see aliens causing mayhem in the 'ends' of London, instead of choosing to torment the huge cities of Los Angeles or New York. However, the constant gags centred on the slang language of the teenagers, began to grate on me. There are only so many times I can laugh at, ""they're aliens, bruv, trust!"" Don't get me wrong, the script was very well written and it's great to see England not being presented as a bunch of posh-speaking Hugh Grant's, but, not all teenagers are like that. It is a definite genre-defying, original and very entertaining film that does its Director Joe Cornish justice. It has everything you could want from a sci-fi film: aliens, intense fighting and the typical hero vs monster showdown at the end. There are even a few jumpy moments, something I was not expecting. Also, the damage the monkey-dogs caused was pretty disgusting and the film is undoubtedly not pure comedy. The moments of comedy that usually included the character of Pest were, also, reasonably funny. Perhaps the film would have been funnier if the comedy moments had included Nick Frost and his character Ron. The few scenes he and the very British Brewis (Luke Treadaway) were included in were the funniest and most memorable. The other characters that were created weren't particularly likable, and it was hard to care about any of them. This was probably because their determination to maintain their tough stance whilst facing blue- teethed and very angry extra terrestrials became annoying. However, they did know (sometimes) when it was time to run, and warn others that their water guns were a particularly inadequate choice of weapon. Of course, our heroes knew that swords, guns and a lamp would be more sufficient. Perhaps this film is a warning to knife-wielding teenagers: you should think twice about mugging a stranger on the street, because they may end up saving your life. Or perhaps this is just a director having a lot of fun, making a film that he knows will get rave reviews from its British audience. Whatever reason Cornish chose for making Attack The Block, it was a good one as it has become a very promising debut for the Director. Overall, Attack The Block is a fresh addition to its genre. A very funny, but sometimes tedious, action-packed film, pitting teenagers against their worst nightmare: something that threatens to take over their block.",Attack the Block
179,neo-karoshi,Human scumbags should have been devoured by the aliens,1,16 October 2011,"I was truly disgusted at the attempt of justifying the behaviour of hoodies in the UK. Four of our five ""heroes"" live with their parents and are well provided for. The fifth thug (Moses) lives by himself and this is supposed to justify the fact that he put a knife to a woman with the help of his friends. If you can have an education and instead of making the most of it choose to become a ridiculous brain-dead thug, do not blame the police, the establishment or the bloody aliens. If you want to know who is guilty, find yourself a mirror. If your parents are so useless that are unable to control or even find out what their children are after, then they should be heavily fined. There is no excuse: you get what you deserve.

Well, firstly, this is nothing like the violent kids who torture inner city estates. Joe Cornish, a man I find funny most of the time, has bought an Ali G DVD boxset and used it for the 'street lingo'. I suspect he wouldn't know an estate kid like those supposedly portrayed in this film if he was robbed at knife point by one. The dialogue is painful to listen to.Which, incidentally, is where we start the film. These anti-heroes robbing someone at knife point and being portrayed as 'cool'. A strange ambition, Joe.Then there's the CGI or whatever they have used in the film to show the aliens. They should have used cardboard cut outs. It's 20 years out of date.Then there's the acting. They all should be shot. All of them. Including Nick Frost. And I love Nick Frost. And yet he has to die.In truth, I'm an hour in and I can watch no more. I sat through Plan B From Outer Space.

They are three dimensional and evolve in the course of the film.The neighborhood seems real, gritty and violent. The bad guys who become heroic are actually bad, not misunderstood.The creatures are oddly believable, well designed and reasonably motivated. They are animals behaving like animals and able to die like animals, not super human aliens or zombies. Terry Notary (choreographer, movement coach: creature movement, etc.), who has been involved with many big budget movies, injects and extra degree of reality to these shark mouth, wolfy gorilla looking predators. Love the teeth.The film is nicely spiced with a little social commentary, satire, stoner comedy, neighborhood dynamics and lots of fun.For those who care, there is some gore but more often implied, as with splashes of blood from off camera.While you may not love it like I did, you have to at least enjoy it.",Attack the Block

There are some other bad guys who you kind of like more, until you find that actually, they're pretty darn hard to sympathise with too. You can't side with the police, as the film portrays them as the cliché ""above the law"" bad cops, and Nick Frost is a sleazy drug dealer with no emotion... to be honest, I was rooting for the aliens.Technically, the film was appalling.

187,im-71950,Surprisingly Charming British Gem,7,1 June 2021,"I walked into this movie with pretty high expectations and I am happy to say it met them. I obviously wasn't expecting a thought-provoking masterpiece but for what was was being advertised, it exceeds with flying colours.The premise is simple- Aliens attack a small estate in South London, a bunch of teenagers try to kill them. This movie has such a simple premise but is able to stretch so much out of it, something commendable.One thing I think also deserves recognition is the dialogue. Since the main character's are all teenagers, writer/director Joe Cornish researched for months on end in order to try and recreate the ireverrency of the way young people talk. I am a young person at the time of writing and I can confirm this movie's dialogue is almost identical to the way me and some of my peers speak with each other, something I feel is sorely lacking in other teen-centred movies.Furthermore, the performances are pretty good. John Boyega gives a solid performance and the child actors all seem to have a genuine rapport which adds to the quality.In terms of location, the film is very clever. By shooting in this one estate block, with neighbours who live with each other, the film gets a real community and intimate feel, as if you've known these people your whole lives.Another great thing to see is the alien designs, enough time in the shadows so it can be left to the imagination but detailed enough to create that sense of dread.The characters however, feel pretty bland and without motivation. The opening scene of them mugging Sam really makes them unlikeable for the first half of the film, and while their characters do develop slightly from the middle, the beginning left a sour taste in my mouth. On top of that, O found the Cinematography passable and nothing really exceptional.If you're looking for a dumb action movie, look no further than this one. If you compared it to other dumb action movie, this one would be high-tiered but in general it's just passable. Definitely check it out if you're in the mood for it.",Attack the Block

Was it lack of budget or lack of imagination that made the aliens look like black old English sheepdogs with luminous teeth? I suppose in the little time (half of it?) I watched it was almost always in darkness, which was probably some sort of way of disguising the general feebleness of these aliens. What was their problem? Would no-one take them for a walk?

Successful, they drag the beast through the streets and into the apartment of the local drug dealer, the same apartment that Sam happens to live in. Although the storyline is weak, and there are too many characters to make sense of where they fit in, the point of the film is that Moses' gang go from terrorising anyone on their block that they think shouldn't be there, to having to defend their block from aliens. The hunters become the hunted as the aliens seek revenge for the death of their female counterpart. Anyone who has come in contact with the slain alien wears its scent and is a target for the hairy bear-sized alien beasts with their fluro-green razor sharp teeth. They have no eyes, tracking down their victims by scent. One by one the gang members and drug dealers are ripped to pieces as the beasts search for the female carcass. Watching each member have their throat ripped out or their head crushed and mutilated escalates the tension as more and more aliens drop from the sky and surround the block. Moses, played by John Boyega takes command of the screen and is well cast as the angry, restless gang leader. His performance is natural and convincing. He is well supported by Alex Esmail, who plays Pest, and Luke Treadaway who plays Brewis, the drugged out teen, whose connection in the plot of the story is unclear. His sole purpose seems to be to provide comic relief which is well married with the growing tension the shrieking aliens create throughout the film. The film is well directed, set in darkness and the confines of a sterile, low class apartment block. The stand out scene is watching Moses, with the female carcass strapped to his back, run from the pack of beasts who are snapping at his heels. The scene is in slow motion through the corridors of the apartment and surreally created with a spot-on soundtrack. Attack the Block will keep you entertained visually. Don't expect to understand the London babble shooting out of potty mouths at a hundred miles an hour. There are snippets of funny quotes well delivered by some fine young actors. Watch it if you're tough!",Attack the Block
193,mullisaur,Hood Rats and Space Monkeys,8,14 January 2012,"Attack the Block well exceeded my expectations. Don't get me wrong, when I heard there was a movie about London hood rats fighting off an alien invasion, I was excited. But I didn't get my hopes up too much because sci-fi action flicks tend to disappoint. But this movie brought me in and kept me very entertained for it's entirety. The main characters are a group of hoods from the bad part of London who, right at the start of the movie, mug a defenseless woman. setting them up as a group of likable criminals. During this mugging they are interrupted by something falling from the sky and destroying a nearby car. The car destroying space matter turns out to be a small alien monster which the kids pursue and easily execute. While they are celebrating their victory they see more pods falling from the sky and decide to go out and kill every last one of the space monkeys. They didn't anticipate that the alien they killed wasn't exactly as formidable as the ones that follow it. But these aliens picked the wrong block to invade. The smart mouthed thugs are some of the most cleverly written kids I have seen in a movie. The slang they use brings a very authentic and modern feel to the film. If you like to quote movies, you'll be dropping lines from this one for months.Not to mention calling all of your friends ""bruv"" from now on. The way they handle the situation brings so much humor to everything. There attitudes are countered by the effective violence used when the aliens get their neon fangs on some of the locals. One thing that really stood out to me in the film was the constant reference to cell phones. At one point one of the hoods says ""This is too much madness to explain in one text!"" The fact that staying connected to their phones, even while fighting off aliens, is so important is a very funny and very true sort of parody on modern youth. The talk of video games and other references give the movie a very trendy and accurate feel. In addition to that there are a few shout outs to the eighties throughout the film. Only one of the characters in the movie was an actor who I recognized and I only knew him from other Joe Cornish films, but all of the actors who where unknown to me did an absolutely stellar(pun intended) job. This is the kind of movie that anyone can enjoy, it's the perfect combination of action, violence, and hilarity. If your looking for a good time, you've come to the right block. Believe it.",Attack the Block
194,cliffchuff,An Ironic Classic,9,21 September 2011,"This film explores racial stereotypes against a backdrop of dark humour. Its a movie for people who like to think about what they watch, very British, the language is right on the button and its set in deepest South London. Delivered with humour and a multi-layered appreciation of culture in the present day for young inner city kids.Many commentators seem to get hung up on the fact the 'heroes' are gang members, this is no new jack city glorifying the lifestyle but a peek through the lens of humour at territorialism.its good gory fun with a well balanced sense of tension and the absurd, some of the characterisation is stretched for sure but the key themes of defending your own against external oppression shines through, this film is about redemption and change.One of the funniest films I have seen and well worth the long wait, but this is not for you if you like polarized goodies wear white plots with no imagination.",Attack the Block
195,TheTVSamurai,"'Attack the Block' Movie Review: ""Good movie bruv. Believe it.""",8,25 January 2012,"So I came upon this hidden gem because of my cousin. I have to admit, he tried explaining the synopsis to me and also showed me the trailer during our weekend road trip and I was very, very skeptical about the movie. Put aliens, young British gangsters, a samurai sword, A lot of British slang, weed smoking, two little pryo maniacs and you got yourself, Attack the Block. I have to make one thing clear though, I am a big fan of British humour and films (RocknRolla, Snatch, —fine, maybe I'm just a big Guy Ritchie fan) because know a lot of people either don't enjoy or just don't get British style films, namely, their slangs and jokes.The film has a very simple and straight forward story, aliens invade Earth and are attacking a project housing complex, known as ""The Block"" in South London. Enter the heroes of the film, a bunch of young wanna-be gangsters who run the block. Sounds ridiculous right? I know but bare with me. The story starts off with the street gang mugging a young nurse, who we later find out also lives in same building as the gang. During the scuffle, a meteor hits into a car parked on the street beside them and we quickly get our first encounter with one of the many, alien creatures. The alien gets into a scuffle with the head gang leader, it scratches him in the face and runs off. The whole gang chases it down and eventually kills it with not-so-high-tech weapons—fire crackers and a wooden stick to be exact.As you can probably tell from my other reviews, what draws me to like a film is usually the characters—if I don't find them interesting, chances are I'll lose interest quickly. Let me introduce you to the young street gang. A young looking version of Denzel Washington, Moses (John Boyega), the gang leader and main star of the film. Other gang members include: Pest (Alex Esmail) who is probably my favourite character of the film, Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones) and Biggz (Simon Howard). And there are also the two little pryo maniacs played by two very cute child actors who call themselves Mayhem (Michael Ajao) and Probs (Sammy Williams). And we also have the adult nurse who gets mugged by the gang in the beginning of the film, Sam (Jodie Whittaker) who is also the new resident of the Block. As you can see, the low budget film doesn't consist of too many well known actors but I personally think that works in advantage to the film and all the young actors did a great job in my opinion. The only name, most audience would recognize is probably Nick Frost (Paul, Shaun of the Dead) who plays Ron, a drug dealer residing in the block but he's only in a small part of the movie.Read the full review at: http://goo.gl/MGFMI",Attack the Block
196,nuepb,Clever Urban Alien Film,9,26 February 2013,I bought this film on blu-ray because I enjoy British new-wave films. I didn't really know what to expect but after watching HEARTLESS I took a chance and Im glad i did. The gritty reality at the start was a surprise given that the gang of attackers are the characters we were supposed to identify with throughout the film. However the good acting and the characterisation of the individual members of the gang is well handled and by the end you can believe that their lives were moulded by their surroundings and upbringing. The humour is dark and doesn't make you disconnect from the film at any time because it is character driven. The Aliens themselves are very creepy - dark hairy masses with glow-in-the-dark teeth - and come over very well on a budget. All in all a good film with reality being invaded - I gave it 7/10,Attack the Block

198,rperry-17,Huge missed opportunity,6,16 March 2013,"Acting is great from everyone. Some slick camera moves, Kubrick-like setups, great music in parts.Does not take itself nearly seriously enough.They were sitting on a goldmine of a gritty/funny/scary/landmark format and missed it.The first half has large chunks that simply should not be there. Just plain waste material. Some of the early shots linger too long for no purpose.They should treat the jokes as throw-aways. They don't go overboard here, they just use wrapping paper when they should use none.In the latter half, the gold glints and you can see what a killer film this could have been.Too much polish and light in the first half, too much trying to be 'nice'. Not trying to be funny, but ending up being boring and wasteful of time.I don't think it would have taken any more money or time to make this a much greater film.I'm thinking of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1973) here.Stop trying to be a comedy. Stop trying to be British. Stop wasting screen time.Get a script writer to pull this one apart. Having the writer/director do everything is what killed this. Great script, now make it even better and film it like that.It's maybe the last 20mins of the film which illustrate what I am trying to convey here. Imagine if they made the whole film like that. Wow!A missed opportunity, not totally thrown away. A quite nice little film",Attack the Block
199,ManicMovieMan,One of My Favorite Sci-fi/Alien Movies Ever,9,6 September 2021,"I really wish all somewhat recent sci-fi and alien movies could be this darn good. There wasn't a single facet of this film that I didn't just love all around.My only regret is that there hasn't been a sequel made to it. Though, honestly, perhaps it best to leave something this great alone. You cannot always capture what made a movie a classic with a sequel in my opinion. Often times they add stupid new things to a sequel and or take away great parts of the first film I believe.Also, beyond what I thought was superb acting, story and just a great atmosphere in the movie. Well, my very favorite feature of, Attack The Block, was just how amazing I found the mix of mostly practical FX with some rad CGI thrown in, with how the alien creatures looked in this picture.If director, Joe Cornish, had been foolish like so many other sci-fi directors out there today, he would have just filled the entire movie with boring, take me out the plot, never realistic looking enough, CGI aliens. But, thank the Lord he didn't do this. The way he and the VFX crew made those incredible looking alien designs, man! I cannot remember the last time that I have been that impressed and found creatures to be that believable in a sci-fi or even horror movie like in the last ten years. In my mind Computer Generated Images (CGI), can never replace the awesome realism of well done practical effects. And Joe Cornish and his VFX wizards nailed that ultra creepy, awesome and totally ""alien"" look of the aliens in, Attack The Block, in my opinion.I actually have two regrets about this movie. The first as I mentioned then expanded upon, was no sequel. But as I said that's probably best left alone. My other regret though is that I cannot watch Attack The Block for the first time again, haha. Oh, I still watch repeated viewings of it regardless, often. But, to feel that exhilaration of seeing the whole thing and its bad@$$ alien creatures for the first time again is something I'll never be able to do again sadly.In addition, for my money, seeing Nick Frost again in this movie was rad even if his role was somewhat minor.Overall, I highly recommend Attack The Block and I just wish other sci-fi/alien movies were made this well.",Attack the Block
200,mdc-9,So bad it's depressing...,2,13 November 2013,"This has to be one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. Surprising given the talents involved, but the leading characters are so unsympathetic, so utterly charmless and unlikable, the movie is dead in the water in the first ten minutes. Like others have written here, you really do end up rooting for the aliens. The supporting actors overact terribly,trying to make a very unfunny script entertaining, but their performances only magnify the feeling of despair. It's hard to imagine that anyone sat in an editing suite and couldn't see how misguided this film is.

201,samerabdallah,Surprisingly good !,9,23 November 2020,"First impression, following the first few minutes of the film, is ""no, not another movie about disgruntled teens in the suburbs"", but as the film progresses it gets more and more interesting, with characters maturing in the course of one night as they have to deal with totally unexpected events, furthermore there are convincing changes of attitude (for some) and a plausible explanation of the occurrences coming from one of the nerdiest guys in the film!

Pull the other one, Mate) witless, humorless, charmless and had me cheering for the alien invaders. If Cornish thinks he's got down what kids sound like or how they behave in life, he's not only wrong, but dangerously so.

205,Tafelberg,Good movie but got the balance wrong,7,9 February 2013,"It was a good movie, so why would I hesitate to recommend it to my friends?Because the concept, aliens land in a council estate and have to deal with chavs, is clearly going to be a comedy with a bit of social commentary. If you knew nothing about the movie, you'd be thinking, ""Oh boy, those aliens won't know what hit them. I'd like to see them deal with what we have to deal with every day.""But instead of comedy with a bit of social commentary, it was social commentary with a bit of comedy. And the commentary could be summed up as, these are poor misunderstood kids and the system treats them badly. Whereas the average viewer thinks these are nasty little thugs and they need to be taught a lesson on how to be decent human beings.Gripes aside, I thought it was a good movie. The monsters were great. Particularly effective were the teeth, which looked like glowing eyes from a distance and shark mouths from close up. The film was well plotted with a good explanation of why their block was being attacked. The fights and acting were okay but not great. The dialogue was apparently authentic, but it sounded made up, like the droogs' language in A Clockwork Orange. Maybe it could have been toned down a bit. Some of the action up and down the corridors became repetitive.One thing I missed was vignettes of how other people in the block reacted to the invasion. Just brief clips. The filmmaker lost an opportunity for laughs there.With more humour and more humanity learned by the protagonists, this could have been a great and entertaining classic. As it is, it remains good but a bit preachy.",Attack the Block

It's filled with hilarious one-liners that I'll remember for awhile.

Again, perhaps not a big deal, but as a kid I'd probably fall for it.The aliens look good, but one of the problems with them is that they seem slightly easier to kill off than a gorilla.Some call this a sci-fi movie. If you're a sci-fi fan you might get disappointed. If aliens means sci-fi, it is. However the aliens could as well have come from the ground and it wouldn't have change the story much.

213,corvuscorax-ti22,Nice addition to the alien invasion genre,8,20 June 2012,"First, it seems many of the negative reviews of this film have to do with the portrayal of the youths in a South London street gang as heroes. If you cannot buy into the premise that a teenager who mugs people at knife-point could be a hero trying save his public housing block from alien invasion, then you won't like this movie. Don't watch it. If you can accept the idea long enough to see where it goes, then this film is definitely worth a look. Now, on to the review....There's some gore and horror, but it won't be terribly scary for most people old enough to handle R-rated movies. There's action, but it's not over-the-top. There's humor, but the film isn't a laugh-fest. There's social commentary, but it's not too heavy-handed. Perhaps some would see these as flaws -- as if the film didn't go far enough in a particular direction to define itself as something more typical (and more easily marketable) -- but I see it as a more balanced film. Plus, it lets the focus remain on the characters and the story. The actors do a wonderful job, too; the characters seemed very authentic. Maybe that's why so many people didn't like them -- it really felt like these kids had grown up in a hard neighborhood and had become hardened themselves. I've had disappointments in the past with films where the director filmed the screenplay he wrote; too many directors are more oriented to nice-looking visuals and so construct a weak story with flat characters just to make something that looks visually stunning. Joe Cornish is not one of them. The story by itself is pretty simple, although there are quite a few characters running around. If you don't like ensemble casts, you may find this annoying. But the characters are written and acted well, and the directing is strong. There are some great subtle elements, too, like the interaction between Moses and Tia. I'm not surprised that this movie has won a slew of film festival and critics' awards.Not really any new ground broken on the style of the aliens, but we've all seen so many types of aliens (the ones with fangs, the ones with tentacles, the quasi-human ones, etc) that it's difficult for anyone to come up with something totally new. Still, the ones here are done well and are a nice twist on fang-type aliens. Given the limited budget of this film, they look good. I liked the fact that while tough, the things aren't invincible. They're just plain nasty animals, and in a way, it keeps them believable in a film that tries to keep the setting and characters believable. I've seen many Hollywood blockbusters with aliens that can barely be defeated, and what I enjoyed most about Attack the Block was that it's NOT one of those movies.Although produced by the same people who did Shaun of the Dead, this film is not quite as funny. That's not a bad thing -- I think the more serious edge works here -- but if you're looking mainly for a comedy focus similar to SOTD, then you might be disappointed with Attack the Block. There were some parts I found predictable, but it didn't bother me. On the whole, it's a unique and fun movie to watch!",Attack the Block
214,colins573,Near Perfect,10,20 July 2016,"There's a reason the experts on rotten tomatoes gave it a 90%. The movie is not about making you think the main characters are angels. It's about showing the humanity of kids, even the punk ones that grow up in a gang culture in a poor area. The realism mixed with the scifi and the superb humor is what makes this such a great movie. There wasn't 10 minutes going by that I wasn't laughing at something. It also wasn't too long and drawn out. The pace was exciting and the music was enjoyable. The personalities of the kids were all unique and the lady was also an interesting mix in that bunch of punks.

215,horrornerdsdotcom,The reversal of the tradition horror film,6,2 January 2013,"Attack the Block is in many ways a reversal of the traditional horror film. More than one critic has pointed out that horror and science fiction often meet at a very coy crossroads; Brian Aldiss observed once that The Day of the Triffids ends when its protagonist acquires a shotgun and a smallholding and retires to the Isle of Man. Early on in the film, we get a shot of a public map of the Clayton Estate. Director Joe Cornish wanted to set the scene but the budget didn't allow for aerial shots so he took advantage of the opportunity to make a charming nod to the movie's sci-fi and horror roots: Most of the action takes place in Wyndham Tower, named for Triffids author John Wyndham, and the streets and blocks are named for sci fi alumni.One of the movie's most likable characteristics is that it's clearly produced to be enjoyed by the youths depicted in it. Attack the Block plays against the demonization of the 'feral poor' that sadly characterises so many films in the genre, whether set in the city or the country. Its hero, Moses, is a young black teenager, the oldest member of a gang of petty criminals of all racial backgrounds who unimpressively stalk the streets of their London estate. We meet Moses and his friends first as they mug Sam, the nurse who's the first character we see in the film.The actors were sought in council estate school drama classes and they talk unapologetic UK 'Jafaican,' calling each other 'blud' and riding their bikes around the 'ends' without concession to people who might need pointers – or subtitles – to understand them. Most of the kids are played by first time actors and the whole thing is almost very worthy – except that it spikes that, too. The mockery ranges from Brewis' childish illusions to Moses' pseudo-Spike Lee ranting about the government bringing first guns to the ends and now aliens. The scene which begins with Brewis standing in front of the tower block's elevator, recently disembarked from his dad's BMW and aimlessly humming along to KRS-One's 'Sound of da Police,' and ends with Mayhem, Pest, Biggz and the others crowding round him, is a masterpiece of characterisation by action and contains more social commentary than a Tracy Chapman record.Despite their criminality the kids are presented as worthy of respect even if they are deeply flawed; their surroundings supply the film's real horror. The film's characters either learn to pull together or reveal their psychopathy as comically-named gangster Hi-Hatz disdains fighting off an alien invasion to seek repayment of drug debts. The aliens, a kind of spectral superdog from outer space, barely compete with the dystopian housing estate that forms the movie's physical and emotional backdrop.",Attack the Block
216,alexlangholm,"Oh Joe, what have you done?",3,5 April 2014,"WARNING: Contains spoilersThis is really frustrating: Joe Cornish, the director and writer of Attack The Block, is very funny, intelligent, self-aware and has deservedly gained a cult following as one half of Adam & Joe on TV and radio over the past 15+ years. With such a strong track record, you'd expect his first film to carry that clever satire onto the big screen, wouldn't you? Unfortunately that's not what happened. At all. Attack The Block just left a really bad taste in my mouth and I never want to see it again.To be fair, there are some good things in the film: the basic central concept, the acting and the effects are all solid. Thanks to some good casting the characters felt surprisingly real considering the unrealistic plot, and this is the strongest thing about ATB, though it is also a major source of problems when you see what the characters actually do.The negative aspects of Attack The Block are far more numerous:By far the worst thing is what many reviewers have noted, the amoral and unrepentant ""heroes"" of the film: a gang of teenage muggers who surround a terrified young woman, draw their knives and repeatedly threaten to kill her. Very, very late in the film one of them offers to give back her ring (though not her bag or phone), but he never really seems to regret his actions and just mumbles something about not knowing that she lived locally (as if mugging outsiders is okay). The director seems to recognise this is a problem and makes the victim voice our concerns, but the gang just tell her to stop whining, so it's as if the audience is being told to stop whining too. They even tell the victim quite late in the film that threatening her with knives was good for her because it speeds up the robbery. This kind of twisted worldview just drives a huge wedge between the audience and the gang members, it's not building any bridges.The plot revolves around monsters being a threat to the characters, but this threat isn't really set up properly. The teenagers casually (and rather gratuitously) kill the first alien with barely any effort, they parade its body and laugh about it for the opening scenes, and even the bigger aliens that appear later on are dispatched fairly regularly with items such as kitchen knives. You never really get the feeling of anything unstoppable being on the way.Despite the map at the start of the film, the geometry of the estate doesn't come across. The action starts to become scene after scene of people running between similar-looking flats down identical-looking corridors without much idea of where they are going or why, and this gets much worse when the corridor fills with smoke. You also wonder what exactly is preventing people leaving the estate.Even after several violent murders (including two policemen killed very early on), gunfire, explosions, car crashes etc we never see any emergency services turn up, except brief glimpses of police towards the end. We don't even see any other residents, it's as if the whole block is just the gang and the aliens, which undermines the supposed protecting-the-community message.The police are especially hard done by, they are portrayed as totally corrupt and not to be trusted under any circumstances. One of the gang speculates that the authorities are letting the aliens attack in order to wipe the residents out. When the mugging victim tries to call the police, the gang leader snatches the phone away and takes out the batteries, saying that ""the feds"" shouldn't be involved. This attitude is followed through right to the end of the film, even the mugging victim seems to be experiencing Stockholm Syndrome with her last line.I'm not generally a fan of political correctness in art, but there's a disturbingly strong misogynist atmosphere in ATB. The supposedly-heroic gang of knife-wielding muggers is all male, very macho and constantly trying to outdo each other in their ability to kill or maim. The only criticism they face is from weak female characters who are unable to defend themselves, and who rely on the various male gang members for protection from violent outsiders. When one of the gang members is injured, they force their mugging victim to tend to his wounds and continue to treat her with contempt afterwards, pausing only to tell her how fit she is. The ending seems to celebrate these attitudes rather than sending them up.The Adam & Joe Show used to regularly criticise the drugs-and-guns stereotypes of south London and their depiction in films, but now Joe's spent £8 million actually making a film reinforcing all of these stereotypes.Why Joe, why? :(...maybe this is why: Joe was apparently inspired to make Attack The Block after being a mugging victim himself, and he mentioned that the mugger seemed to be more frightened than he was. It's an interesting observation and this is even the basis of some dialogue in the film. The trouble is that the dialogue as presented just doesn't ring true: the gang leader doesn't seem frightened at any point, so when he threatens to kill people it seems to be a lifestyle choice rather than a sign of desperation. There's no way to feel any sympathy for him if he is choosing to do these things, and the tiny hints of a difficult childhood towards the end are too little too late.Whatever the original intention, Attack The Block in its final form comes across as pro-violence and thoughtlessly amoral, with surprisingly little humour to make it palatable. It feel like an earnest, serious version of Speeding On The Needlebliss, which is frankly a terrifying prospect.",Attack the Block
217,imdb-7400,"Not funny, scary, or gripping.",1,11 September 2011,"There are a few things wrong with this film. Not the least of which is that it doesn't do any of the things you want from it. A lot of the publicity mentions Shaun of the Dead. It certainly doesn't compare to that. I don't know what the film was trying to do. -It's not funny, at all, I don't think it was trying to be. -It's not scary. It just isn't, it's not a horror film. -It's not gripping. The story is fairly weak and extremely simple.Another huge problem for the film is that the protagonists are not likable. At the very beginning of the film they are shown mugging a nurse then beating an alien to death for no reason. Nothing they or the film does subsequently ever wins you over, heroics notwithstanding, you kind of want them to die. I never figured out if the film was trying to satirise south London gang culture or advocate for it. It seems to lampoon it's main cast as well as apologise for it. Regardless you spend the whole film thinking that a gang of half a dozen kids who mug a nurse with a flick knife need to be locked up and wishing it would happen.It's not all bad. Nick Frost is good but only has a small part. For any physicists the aliens are made of a super black material such that you can't see any texture and can only discern their shape from their outline. But that really really is not enough to save the film. Feels more like a short film project than an actual movie. Extremely disappointing.",Attack the Block

Yes, this film is produced by Edgar Wright, director of 'Shaun', but this is a very different film, but also similar as well.An alien invasion begins in South London after a gang of young hoodlums mug a young lady, thus beginning a chain reaction of events that culminate to a battle of live or let die(england reference) inside an apartment building.WIth it's cross of 'Goonies', 'Critters', 'Slither' and 'Assault on Precinct 13', this film needs to be seen worldwide.

The first half of the film involves obnoxious hoodies saying 'yeh blud' and generally being very annoying. Nick Frost pops up and has no funny lines. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as 'Shaun' but I literally didn't laugh once and I couldn't tell if it was even meant to be funny.

I'm a fan of Joe Cornish and I was raised on films like Gremlins and Critters. This film really has very little in common with either of them, they at the very least were original and entertaining.So, attack the block - terrible dialog, awful acting, rubbish aliens (think men in gorilla suits), an unsatisfying and dull story...... was it supposed to be sf, horror, comedy ? It didn't succeed at any of them.But worst thing of all, this is a film that actually seems to glorify hoody culture, it made me angry that a film that is obviously aimed at teenagers makes it look cool to carry weapons like knives, smoke weed all day, steal and mug people.In the current climate, especially in the UK shouldn't film-makers take a bit more responsibility. In the opening scene we were treated to 5 masked teenagers terrifying and mugging a young woman on her way home from work. I almost switched off, but hoped there might be some sort of moral ending ..... no such luck, the ring leader survives and is worshipped as a hero. There were only 2 educated characters portrayed in the film and they were made to look like pathetic losers all the way though. I don't know if this film set out to show gang culture and stealing as cool and fun alternative to gaining an education and working but this seems to be one of the messages it is sending out.",Attack the Block

Most of the actors are new to me and I cannot say, that they are ""the best ones"", but every actor fitted perfectly in his role! When you talk about the story, well, here comes the ""trashy"" element: aliens attack ""the block"" and want to kill the teens, which don't know why and they try to escape and fight against em and @ some points, the monsters look really scary. But the movie has a good mixture of everything: joke, action, gore and scream - I really liked it! All in all, the movie has an not to underestimate message to pass and so it is not as sketchy as you might first thing - it's about prejudice, something that is all present in our world.It's not a must see movie and many people might not find it that special.

I think people were too focused on the fact that they were thugs, but if you actually pay attention to the movie you will see that they were not as bad as the first scene made them look. I like that this was realistic in the sense that they were average people fighting back. Not government not police not former military. Just scared kids. The only two complaints I have about this movie is the police and Hi-Hatz the blocks drug dealer. The police for some reason have no idea about the aliens. Hi-Hatz cares more about his car getting smashed and getting revenge than the fact that aliens are taking over.

225,s_b_jackson,Hairy aliens versus inner city teenagers,3,18 May 2016,"As a middle-aged, middle class, educated white Englishman, I find it depressing to think that there may be people throughout the world who think that the characters represented in the film are typical or representative of the population of the UK - not least because they are, despite being caricatures, sadly recognisable.My question to the writer and director of this film is simply this - ""What are you trying to say by creating this product?"" The film is clearly written for a teenage audience, as the adult characters are largely peripheral and barely defined. Even the young nurse is scarcely out of her teens and the Nick Frost character is deliberately child-like in his personality. The language of the film is the pseudo-Jamaican/rude boy/black American gangster that inner city UK youths are meant to look up to - the only possible audience that could find the teenagers of the film amusing or their actions commendable. But the point is that this audience laughs at the characters not with them, just as the characters laugh at and mock each other incessantly.The three 'generations' of youths are also sadly predictable, with the two youngest aspiring to be allowed to hang out with their slightly older contemporaries, with their toy gun and water squirter. The five mid-teens are slightly more developed, with knives and a baseball bat as weapons and mountain bikes and scooters as transport. They, in turn, aspire to the top of the food chain, who own cars and guns and deal in cocaine. Fortunately, the latter come to a very sticky end, which may dissuade the others from looking to emulate them! Finally, the sketchily-outlined - by a dope-head with a convenient rudimentary knowledge of zoology - explanation for the presence of the aliens and their obsessive desire to enter the tower block and kill the main characters of the film (but none of the hundreds of other residents of the building) seemed as if it was hastily tacked on to the end of the plot three-quarters of the way through shooting, making for an unsatisfactory denouement.On a positive note, I liked the luminous teeth of the aliens - although why a predator would evolve a mouth that gave out light is not obvious, as it would not help it to see its prey, but it would enable its prey to see it.",Attack the Block

229,kcarterh,[16/20],8,16 April 2019,"What I like about films is that they can transport you to different worlds. You can go forwards in time, backwards in time. You can stay on Earth, fly off to alien planets, watch pirates, cowboys... you know what I'm trying to stay. However, every now and again, it's nice to see a film that can take you home.I'm not sure Americans know how this feels. 80% of all films made every hear are set in America or at least feature a largely American cast, Americans see themselves on screen every day. I am a Brit myself, I live in South London, and the characters I saw in 'Attack the Block', I see every day. This happens on film so, so rarely.Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of them. I never mugged anyone in my life. But a hefty handful of my mates have and I see muggins every other day.'Attack the Block' is I think what Quentin Tarantino refers to as a ""Hangout Movie"" where the characters are like your friends, and every time you watch the film is like hanging out with them... it's my ""Dazed & Confused"".Personal preference aside, this is a good film from a moviemaking perspective. It's not stunning, but there is nothing wrong with the way it's made. The film is the directional debut of Joe Cornish, and as directional debuts go... it's fairly decent. Most directors take a couple of films to settle into their distinct styles, but Cornish knows exactly what director he wants to be and how he wants to hold the camera.The screenplay, however, is the films most impressive aspect. Sometimes, when the older generation (which I guess Joe Cornish belongs to... no offense), of England try to capture the younger generation, they get it so wrong. Sometimes British writers write youths the way they were when they were younger, in the 80's or 90's. Joe has clearly done his research. Each character is perfect, acting and talking exactly how London youths talk (I just find it a shame that a London youth didn't find Excalibur in Cornish's follow up 'The Kid Who Would Be King'... that would have sick).Cornish also slides a little hidden message under the mat, one which I find admirable. The British media would have you believe that British youths are menaces to society, who do nothing but smoke, swear and shank. Whilst, this is technically the case, Cornish shows any older audience member why British youths smoke, swear and shank... because it's fun. Except the last one, that's not fun.All in all, this is one of the best representations of British youths that I have ever seen on screen. And the best thing about it... it's fun. It's a lot of fun. It isn't a bleak, depressing drama about the dangers of living on a council estate or anything like that... it's just five well wrote youths fighting aliens and having a great time.To an American, this film is nothing special... but I feel exactly the same way about 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'.",Attack the Block

Who on earth thought that an alien should look like this? They weren't scary at all. After abut 45 minute, when I knew it wasn't going to get any better, I looked it up on IMDB and found out it was from 2011, when these actors weren't famous yet, so I figured it was a low budget movie at that point.

This is not too say that this movie is not thoroughly enjoyable.Acting (7/10) : Surprisingly good, as opposed too other UK urban films .eg,Shifty,Kidulthood etc where the acting perhaps wasn't up too scratch and the slang was somewhat an irritant Attack the Block is a very quotable and not over the top with its urban language use though to people who are not from the UK may still struggle too keep up and subtitles are recommended. (Its time for the rest of the world to realise we don't all speak the Queens English). It is also a very bold and very strong performance from John Boyega especially with it being his first major role.Cinematography (7/10) : Though Attack the block uses very little original camera work it feels just right. The film itself is very dark and you instantly get the feel of this from the beginning but as opposed too other Sci-fi horrors such as AVP-Requiem its not about the actual cinematography being dark (its way to dark in Requiem)its about the camera and light work giving off a dark feeling more than a physical dark presence. The special effects used on the invaders i find are very well done although they do not look too real it keeps a sense of fantasy about the film with its signature blue teeth and dark fur they make for a menacing foe.Overall (7/10) : Well worth a watch one of the better blockbuster films too come out of the UK in a long time and quite frankly it has a very surprising re-watch value, good performances, good humour and very well put together both post and pre production.",Attack the Block

234,smoochpapandreas,Attack Da Block,3,16 September 2011,"Here we have another film purporting to be the new 'Shaun of the Dead' and it does quite well on the score, only lacking humour, a coherent script, a narrative arc, and lead characters that don't make you wish that alien invaders were tearing out your own throat. But it does have Nick Frost, so at least they have that bit right...And Frost is very very good, though, let's face it, you knew that already. That's why you bought your ticket. Only, what the trailer doesn't tell you is that this is one of those films that trick you into thinking it is one thing when it's really something else. Did you really want to spend the majority of the film in the company of a group of teenage thugs speaking a patois unintelligible to anybody over the age of 21? No, neither did I. Frost is only in a few scenes and the sum effect is akin to spending the night cowering in the kitchen whilst teenage thugs set your living room alight. You only let them through the front door because they were in the company of that funny guy from 'Paul' but he cleared off the moment trouble startedI realise that I'm probably in a minority thinking this is a problem for the film. The ratings on IMDb suggest that most people think this is a better-than-average light comedy. I understand that view. It does develop a forward momentum that carries you along. Yet I found it hard to disregard the way it portrays the world of the inner city in a totally disingenuous way, where the police are worse than the aliens, were muggers are honourable so long as they don't mug from people on their estate and only wave knives in a woman's face to get the robbery over quickly. It asks for a mainstream audience but speaks exclusively to a demographic who share its moronic world view. We are even given a terrible moment of sermonising which alludes to Malcolm X's famous view of 'white man's poison'. To imply that aliens are only invading the estate because drugs aren't killing the inhabitants quickly enough is a pretty dumb attempt at political rhetoric but it's even more dubious coming from a character who had treated his own promotion to pusher of hard narcotics as though it was a great honour.Yet my biggest gripe with this film is that it's about as funny as getting mugged by street yobs. If you are 17 years old inarticulate waster who wants to spend your whole life smoking weed, you might consider this film to be your generation's 'Some Like It Hot'. For me, it was a flabby alien invasion flick so busy with trying to look cool that it fails to realise how annoying and utterly moronic it truly is.

The film does give a small insight as to why these teens are behave like this. It's due of the environment they've been bought up in, for example, being in a gang with a tough image can be the only way to feel safe that you won't get 'murked' on the block while also providing a sense of family to those who don't have a stable one (e.g. Moses). Once you understand that and realise that beyond their exteriors hides complex characters, more than just 'monsters' (as they are labelled by a character in the film) I think you can really enjoy it. For me, the story line itself is engaging and entertaining without being overly complicated and despite not having the best visuals (this is no big budget Hollywood movie here) they are good enough for it not to spoil the movie and the entertainment this film brings me and my family alone is enough for this to be forgiven.",Attack the Block

Protect The Block (Written and Directed by Joe Cornish) initially seems to be locating itself in this location as in the opening scenes show a mugging of a nurse by a gang of masked and hooded kids on bikes. From this stark and unsympathetic introduction, these characters are turned into unlikely heroes. Ostensibly a horror movie, aliens fall on London on Bonfire Night and wreak havoc, this film is actually a darkly humorous story of redemption with John Boyega's Moses (the gangsta wannabe leader of the gang) learning that actions sometimes have unexpected consequences. With few of the belly laughs of Shawn Of The Dead, which has been incorrectly compared due to Nick Frost as dope dealer Ron, the film is well paced and, although probably not bloody enough for hard-core gore fiends, was to my mind a fun splatter-fest with some laughs, a few shocks and a generally young unknown cast who all gave strong performances, with a stand out performance from Alex Esmail as Pest and a memorable supporting turn from Danielle Vitalis as Tia.",Attack the Block

This film portrays teenage daring and social dynamics in a believable and compelling way. Events are occasionally gruesome but never stupid. I enjoyed the seemingly honest, entertaining account of life in council flats for kids, brought to life by the challenge of aliens.

With some hugely and insanely funny satire reminiscent of those whose lives is shite, so if shite happens wtf, its just another day. I guess its a sad but try elegy, life is shite so if shite falls from the sky we are ready to walk with it. Good work. Great to watch. Enjoy this film.

Perhaps the best feature of this film, for me, are the creatures; they are very original and give the film a true sense of horror and terror.

All it does is cement in people's minds that teenagers are all thieving, knife wielding scum. There's no revelation by the gang in this film, they don't come to realise that their lifestyle is a problem or any such nonsense, they just act out their ignorant, pack mentality behaviour and reinforce stereotypes that need to be broken down.

255,drrothe,Delivers the goods efficiently,7,5 November 2020,"My cable system recently offered up this 9-year-old British flick called ATTACK THE BLOCK where a biracial gang of juvenile delinquents in Brixton contend with a bunch of space aliens who resemble large Brillo pads with legs and nasty big pointy teeth. Only one of the gang has a gun available but they come up with other means to combat the invaders, such as a bunch of fireworks (it's Guy Fawkes Day). As always, it's enjoyable (at least for me) watching young people ""die horribly, in searing pain"" (a line from the original ""Star Trek"" series); there's a moment of possible ""social commentary"" (or a spoof of it) where ""Moses,"" the black leader of the ""yardies,"" muses that the creatures may be the latest government attempt to kill black people, after first introducing guns and drugs. (Likewise I guess one could read something into the extreme negritude of the creatures.) My favorite exchange is when a white woman who lives in the block, and who earlier got mugged by the gang, announces that her boyfriend is in Ghana or something helping underprivileged kids, and the gang's Jewish member asks why he couldn't find any such kids in England to help; this is how I respond to stories of saintly Americans who go wandering overseas and often get killed or what have you. Unfortunately Nick Frost (frequent screen partner of Simon Pegg and the only cast member I knew) doesn't get to do much here, but if you happen to catch it on the telly some night (I wouldn't pay to see it) there are worse ways to kill an hour and a half, especially if you've had some beer, or maybe the weed that we see the kids smoking. if you're wondering if the authorities ever get involved, they show up at the end---and arrest the gang; nice ironic touch....",Attack the Block

At first I didn't think it would be anything more than just an action sci-fi inspired movie that would entertain but it turned out to be a bit more than just that. The characters that live in this dark and violent end of London all have a believable depth to them and the environment in which they exist makes it that much more believable. The thing that really made me appreciate this movie a lot more than expected is that even though the events that make the story progress are very sci-fi in their nature, the characters reacted to these events in ways that makes you forget that you are watching a movie. The event that started it all felt like a real disturbance in the lives of the characters rather than feeling like something that had to happen or the movie's world would fall apart. The way that the movie makes us discover the characters by showing us a part of a normal day for them is so well executed that it deserves praise. I would happily recommend it.",Attack the Block

I was amazed at some of the reviews here from those that simply didn't get it, so I thought I'd write my own - it has to be watched with a broad mind,and a realisation of what many of today's disaffected youth can be like.It was made plain right from the start that it was set in 'gangsta' land, and I thought that was novel for a sci-fi film to begin with. While I didn't 'like' these young thugs, I was gripped by the pace and acting, and as I like sci-fi/comedy (Earth Girls are Easy... Tremors etc) found I couldn't resist watching more. While I found it very entertaining throughout, what I particularly liked by the end was the way it demonstrated that each of these characters had somewhere inside them some glimmer of redeeming features, which I believe is very much the case in reality. I thought the producers got the tone just right with the run-down, un-cared-for surroundings, the subtle retro-throwbacks to other classic films, and the response of the gang to the bizarre situation they found themselves in.There's no point in going into detail about the production values, 'each to his own'.

At no point did I feel these kids learnt anything from the experience, in fact it was almost like the movie was saying ""it's OK to be a little thug as long as when aliens attack you help"" Like seriously, this film was catered to these kids who already think that there's no consequences to their actions.

Believable and witty.Some people reviewing this movie seem to be really offended by the fact that it takes perspective of a gang. I don't understand why though, it's a lot more true to life than most movies and I don't think that's a bad thing. It does not glorify gang life or anything of the sort. If you're uptight and can't face different facets of life, you should probably avoid it. That being said, I enjoyed that angle of it...it's something I rarely see in movies and made it more fascinating.Also, especially for unknowns, the kid actors were GREAT!

263,JC_SpunkMonkey,Great fun...but it's not getting an Oscar,7,13 May 2011,"I saw this movie on the day of it's release in Great Britain. I was hoping for a good comedy/alien flick, and one that I would want to re-watch once it was released on DVD. The last movie that fell into this category, which I truly enjoyed, was Gremlins (man, that makes me feel old) - I still watch it every Christmas, and it is definitely timeless. To ask for a classic on this scale is a bit much, but we can all hope right? After a plethora of exciting trailers (Everytime I see Transformers on the big screen, it turns me into an excited little girl) the film began and I instantly felt at home. It's refreshing to see the city of London portrayed so honestly. Being set in the Brixton area, they do a great job of capturing the true feel of the area, it feels lucid and real - which in my opinion adds greatly to the film. But several hairy aliens later, you realize this is no documentary. The dialog and young actors are refreshing, they really feel like their real-life counterparts, acting and conversing like you'd expect kids of this day age to do. The humanity they use to prop-up each of the characters 'hoodlum' facade is crucial to the dynamic of the film, and what lifts it above other attempts at this genre. The underlying reasoning for this alien invasion is also rather smart, if a little underplayed. The aliens and their origin aren't really explored at any time, but instead become a prop to facilitate the action within the film, rather than being part of it. They're far from formidable, getting picked off one by one like Uruk Hai at Helm's Deep. They're 'just there', and thats as far as it goes. The action runs smoothly, if lacking any particular structure. Stuff just continues to happen without any attempt to build tension, or move towards a firework ending. This does let the film down a little, but the great screenplay and dialog paint over these cracks. The supporting actors do a great job, although some roles (the gun-swinging drug dealer being one) don't really add to the film, and could have been fledged out a little more, or lost altogether. Overall, this film impressed me, if wanting for a little more in terms of structure. The distinct lack of attempt to build any tension (bearing in mind the film contains teethy, hairy aliens) was disappointing. But thanks to the believable young actors, superb dialog, and relatable surroundings...this film rises far above mediocrity.",Attack the Block

If so, you should watch romantic drama and other safe stuff. Another: ""The movie glorifies gang culture and the police are stupid"" No it doesn't glorify gang culture. The thugs are pathetic. No one wants to be like them. But they happen to be in the midst of an alien invasion. Which make them our main characters.I feel that that the movie actually makes a point about youth criminals: Where are the parents? At one point a boy tells his parents he's playing football.

265,shannon_cooke,An Underrated Masterpiece,9,3 July 2015,"There's a lot of movie's these days that like to pull the 'epic' card - drawing out fake sciences, long back stories, adding the lore and mythology of creatures and people into the story, trying to be funny and clever and make you /care/ to such a point that after three hours of staring at the screen you're not even sure what's really going on anymore. It seems like it takes something special to make a film that's smart, unique and doesn't take more time than it should - but Attack the Block achieves all of this.To summarise, this movie is about an alien invasion on a block of flats in South London - but don't go looking for some in-depth outer space story with movie science and the lot. Attack the Block keeps the facts short and sweet and spends most of its time following a small gang of teenage boys as they defend their home.The acting is superb, with a cast of well-chosen young actors giving their all. It probably won't suit everyone to have a bunch of kids swearing and screaming most of the time, but it works well and they pull of the emotional scenes with grace. Now there is the problem here of this being a different type of 'anti-hero' film - in that the acting and characterisations are so on point, that a lot of people react to them and their actions negatively. But each to their own - by the end I found myself warming up to the gang, but still disapproving of how they behaved.The effects are also something of a 'less is more' situation, with the alien invaders a mix of Jim Henson puppetry and actors in suits with very few cgi additions. They're a simple but effective design and will send shivers down your spine. There's a little bit of gore (it is, after all, a horror of sorts), so if your sensitive to blood be ready to cover your eyes - they're over with relatively quickly, and there's no excessive amounts.As for the actual story, it had me hooked the whole way through. There's just enough information to keep you on top of things, and put pieces together yourself, without drowning you in alien lore and other such nonsense - there's enough to let you know the motivations of the teenagers, but not so much that you find yourself overwhelmed by five + back stories and tragedy. And in the end, you get to make your own opinions of them all, good or bad - in fact the way the ending is handled has to be one of my favourite parts. All actions have consequences after all.All in all, Attack the Block will be in my favourites for a long time. It's a movie I wish there was more of and yet know that this was just the right amount for it to be perfect. It's got story, it's got grit, it's got horror and humor and character, and it's got all of that in half the time and twice the amount that other movies ramble on for. At just an hour and a half long it doesn't take much out of your day to give this a watch, and I guarantee you won't be wasting your time - this is a seriously underrated classic that deserves a lot more good attention that it has.",Attack the Block

I would class myself as quite critical towards films and went into the cinema with quite low expectations. But I'm happy to say that it was defiantly better then I initially thought it would be. In fact I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best films I've seen in quite a while (being a holder of an Cineworld Unlimited card that's quite a few).The beginning of the film takes a little to get going but it's good for setting the scene and introducing the main characters, even if you initially are meant to dislike them. After the film gains traction it turns it's self into to a high paced thriller with plenty of chase scenes and some pretty grotesque fight sequences.As the story unfolds you find yourself warming to, and even becoming attached to the characters as you begin to realise they're generally nice kids who have fallen victim to their surroundings.Solid performances from all the cast who seem to play their characters like an extent ion of their real life personalities. This is especially nice to see as most of the main characters are relatively unheard of actors, which is a bonus as you don't have any preconceptions about them. Over all I would rate this 8 out of 10 with the gender bias swaying a little to the male side (due to the gore). Even though I didn't think the gore aspect of the film was over done too much.

The 'gangster' theme and the fact that most teenagers probably relate to these kids makes me lose hope in future generations... and I'm 23. As some people have already said: The characters didn't develop and I saw no use for many of them. I was aware that the writers tried to justify the protagonist's behavior by the fact that he was brought up by his uncle who didn't take proper care of him but I din't care in the least.

There is no character building, almost no action, but a great deal of one line punches to stress the poor-London suburban type.

In addition, if this is a movie for the young, the message is astonishingly uneducational: drugs and stealing is cool, policemen are bad. Parents abstain from taking your kids to watch this.

272,zero-bob,"Alien invasion, but no British invasion...innit.",4,25 May 2011,"Where to start. Unoriginal alien invasion plot? Uninspiring tone? Bad dialogue? No, let's start at storytelling 101 - the characters.The hero characters that you are meant to empathise with are essentially teenage narrow-minded thugs; not the best choice in terms of storytelling as few people would empathise with them, but I thought they might do something interesting with them later in the story to get you as the viewer on their side, but alas they didn't.The characters are poorly established. Characters seemed to come and go for the first two thirds of the film making it very unclear which characters the film is actually focusing on, never mind establishing a protagonist.Which brings me on to my next point. Why establish your protagonist and outline their background towards the end of a film? You need to establish an emotional connection between the protagonist and the audience early on, and then reward / emotionally toy with the audience throughout the rest of the film. This is what makes films enjoyable to watch.The film generally consisted of the kids spouting lines that they deem clever with such consistency you start to wonder whether they are doing it for effect or the director actually thinks the lines are truly funny. Only towards the end stages of the film did I even start to find the dialogue mildly funny. Their London ""gangsta"" accents will grind on you throughout the film without fail however, so don't think a few funny lines will rescue you from this.The plot was basic and predictable. Basic I can forgive, as there's no need to over-complicate a storyline as it can diminish it's impact, but the fact that it took the path of least resistance to the end wasn't so forgivable. The only aspect of the plot I liked was that the woman who the kids mugged was forced to team up with them to defeat a common enemy, which provided some interesting tension and humour.The only thing I truly liked about the film was that the aliens were really black, really really black. So black in fact they almost aren't there. This was believable in terms of the evolution of a species which required camouflage and a cool little feature of the invaders. Aside from that I'm really struggling to find anything good to say about this film, apart from one or two funny lines as I've already mentioned.In short, it wasn't silly enough to fall into the slapstick horror category, nor was it structured well enough to even be considered an average film. I'm mystified as to how this film has gained a 7.5 IMDb rating at the time of writing this review.",Attack the Block
273,Alex_j_porter,In response to those who didn't like the characters......and why I loved it!,10,17 September 2011,"I must say that i went into this movie with absolutely no idea what to expect besides the summary and a few reviews on here. Many were great reviews, and the one's that weren't focused on how morally unsound the characters were and didn't have a strong protagonist. So this is what i went into the movie thinking......man am I Glad I Did!!!! The above being said, the main protagonists of the film are instantly set up as antagonists as they mug a sweet girl (who later befriends them as they fight to survive the alien invasion). As the invasion starts off, you are instantly made full aware the these are Children. Riding around on bmx's and carrying on like a group of teenagers....Throughout the movie, there are more and more reminders to ensure you realized the age, social stigmas and attitudes prevalent in today's youth, group mentality, and the avenues it can take being unabated and unsupervised; as made evident as you witness the group spouting off the usual excuses to get their parent to let them stay out.A big theme, in this movie also realizing your enemy. I am from LA, experienced more gang mentality than i care to remember and have been effected by it personally and on a daily basis. I also am in school to be a high school teacher (have wanted to for a long time). That being said.....The Biggest Problem Facing Poor and Impressionable Youth is the Inability to Recognize the Enemy (ie the ones who take jobs away, disenfranchise, starts wars that the poor will inevitably fight, set legislation that takes money from their schools, the media that make people generally ignorant of their world...etc); Not only was it evident in the groups main role-model, the gangster who lives in their building, selling drugs, trying to get one of the kids to sell, and talking about murdering people all day. This is a prime example, how this man, even while looking these aliens, these things that want to kill him, he can't take his sights off the kids who he feels wronged him......he couldn't see the enemy. It is also said straight forward while the group says audibly that those things were sent there to kill the poor blacks, showing the fear and confusion being poor and a minority and feeling like you have no real control in a world that feels like it's out to get you.Conversely, by the end of movie, the group had made amends with everyone they had previously saw as their enemy.... the girl they mugged and the slightly effeminate kind-hearted boy they 'punked' at the beginning were now close allies as they come together to fight the real enemy......to the point that the 14 main character is willing to risk his life to save those few people who took interest in his life....and in some ways, the world he never felt apart of.I am very disappointed honestly that a school teacher's (negative) review of this movie is getting the most attention and that the reviewer, being a teacher, couldn't see more in this movie than they did and perhaps relate a little more to these kids seeing as they deal with kids all day. I honestly plan on showing parts of this movie when I teach here in Los Angeles, California....Home of the Gangsta Mentality. I encourage all those who felt the characters were Impossible to like, to watch again and remember that there are too many subtleties in this movie to throw it out is such a manner. The symbolism and messages in this movie are too profound, and presented in a way that is too entertaining for this movie to be missed.... I could talk about what this movie meant to me for awhile....Just remember that the main character was robbing at night then going home to sleep alone in his spider-man sheets!!!!! How seriously can you take anyone who sleeps on spider-man sheets and not realize that they are just kids (a few of which turn out to be great kids). 'Ya Got Me, Fam!?'",Attack the Block

I saw many of the critics, saying that the movie is glorifying teenage gangs, mocking the cops, etc. To be honest, I totally disagree with that.Maybe I have overlooked, but what I think the plot of the movie tries to reflect the reason behind the London riots. Throughout the whole film, it is not difficult to notice them: Social exclusion, lack of normal parenting, gangster rap and culture....and ""ironically"", it was Moses in the film that saved the block, not the cops and armed police. In my opinion, the director is trying the convey the message of weak policing in the society.

But, in two mere sentences, the loose threads are tied and the finale is lead into all in one great sweep of fantastic writing.Last, but definitely not least, the aliens themselves were phenomenal. There was a certain amount of keep-them-in-the-dark and leave-it-to-your-imagination, but there were also absolute gore-fest moments which were done superbly (though the squeamish may need to blink). The aliens were well designed and were flawlessly integrated into the movie.

Yeah, I understand this isn't exactly horror, more sci-fi, but as there is good blood and gore and it was suspenseful, I am fine calling it horror. The writing was brilliant and hilarious! I was into the movie the whole way, it never had me thinking ,""when will this end"" or ""when will it pick up."" It was just an all around great movie. As this is the first film from Joe Cornish, I can't wait to see the next ingenious idea he has!The monsters/aliens were not CG effects, it was a pleasure to experience the old costumed monsters again. It just brings you back to the good old days, when monsters were made from real creative artists who really put their imaginations into their creations. Terrific masks and costumes with a real flair to it. I'm not saying the actual monsters were totally amazing, but they were different and more down to earth than some CG effects. Like the old Critters aliens, but much bigger and more insidious. The glowing teeth were also a nice touch.As you can probably tell, I'm giving this movie 5 Hatchets!

It was refreshing in every single way: Not all characters are perfect nor are the good guys completely good but you get to really know them and even understand them. There is no love story which is quite nice (to remove prejudice, I am a girl but I am sick of having to go through life being shown in movies that every single situation is a potential meet-your-future-husband moment). The aliens were explained quite nicely as well, no unnecessary dramatic stories there, it was quite concise and clear why they are there, what they want and why any of the movie plot is happening. I can see why the critics call it a future cult movie but I absolutely cannot see why users here are bashing it so much. This movie was deeper and more entertaining in its hour and a half than most newer movies are in two hours or more. And another thing. There is a review here I read by a teacher or some other who hated the movie because she feels it sets a bad example for kids because of opening-scene-type behavior of the main characters. I feel I have to absolutely disagree and praise this movie for not running from harsh realities of the world but for showing that you can always choose to be good just as you can choose to be bad. It shows that you can still be someone's hero even I you were a complete f***-up before. It shows that if you are or were problematic, you can make things better (all it takes are some aliens and bravery). But seriously though, it's a good movie. I watched Assault on precinct 13 a long time ago but this movie with its vibe kind of reminded me of it, in that that you realise it is a movie, it is in its little movie world but you are still able to fully...in the lack of a better world, feel it.

Other reviewers who were expecting redemption, healing, and change, and DID NOT FIND IT, apparently didn't finish the movie. Because, at 1:13, there is good in the protagonist. Yes, the kids are rough, and that is to be expected. This is not some whiny, preachy, Hollywood movie where kids do wholesome bad things we expect from somewhere in the Midwest. This is the slums of London, and as such, they do bad things. But, you know what? In the end, the worst thing they do is rob someone at knife point.

Well, it was in a way but with a diversion to the shops. Joe has openly admitted the film is inspired by 'Gremlins' and the like, but this film lacked the same amount of humour and tried too hard to have a moral message. You do end up engaging with the teenage thugs, who start the film by mugging a nurse. This initial misdeed leads to the killing of a creature from outer space which in turn leads to their own demise. As the character Tia spells out to us ""your actions, 'zay' 'ave consequences Moses, 'innit'"". This message is hammered home with the proverbial sledge hammer and ruins a film that could have been the 'Gremlins' of the 21st century. The film has alien monsters that look very simple but effective. It has a high speed chase through a tower block, involving BMX bikes and a pizza delivery scooter.

However, they have obviously completely missed the point. This is one of the few films ever produced anywhere in the world to star working class characters in a central role, without trying to show us how 'gritty' and depressing their lives are. In fact it simply offers a warts and all portrayal of a bunch of kids on a council estate, and how they react to an alien invasion! At no point are we asked to sympathise with the main characters, however I would point out that if the character who is the victim of their behaviour is able to forgive them, then the entirely disconnected viewer at home should be able to too. It is clear that the behaviour displayed by the central group of kids is symptomatic of societal problems in Britain, something which I believe Cornish tries to address throughout the film. Indeed, the premise of the film is based on an incident in which the director himself was mugged by a group of young people. However, instead of simply labelling them all as good for nothing 'chavs' as many on this website have done, he was able to see past these simplistic and prejudice labels, and do some research into their back stories to put together this extremely well written and researched debut film. P.S. It's also a helluva a lot of fun, and an extremely good homage to 80s and 90s Sci-Fi movies.

I now spend a majority of my lunch time running to forbidden planet and back to buy the most precious of items. I run back to the office and show all I can find, the wonders of my brand new signed copy of an Attack The Block movie poster. 'Its beautiful!' I tell people, and most of them agree. On it are three signatures, John Boyega, Nick Frost and most importantly, Joe Cornish. This is the man of the moment. No longer am I telling friends, 'you must listen to Adam and Joe on 6 Music... well they used to be on channel 4' it's now, 'you must listen to Adam and Joe, its the one that directed Attack The Block'. He's fast becoming a house hold name, and not just with lovers of their fabulous podcast or radio show, of which I know there are many. This man can do no wrong in my eyes.So as you can see, I went into this film with high expectations, which has not seems to work well for me as yet, but I am pleased to say that although I hoped of the best, I had not jinxed it this time. ATB is a fabulously hilarious horror, action film about 5 youths and a young nurse (which they had very previously mugged) fighting an alien invasion. The aliens were spot on and certainly frightening and the kids we completely realistic. As they began talking I started having flashbacks to secondary school, but thankfully they passed quickly as I became so engrossed in the movie I let my chocolate melt and slowly meld back into a funny shape. What was so fascinating about this movie was not just that the storyline was pitch perfect, but also that this was Joe's first feature film! You really wouldn't know from looking at it. There is on the other hand, one moment then we cross from outside a room to the inside that reminds you that he's still learning as he goes, but who cares. He's put so much love and energy into it he even gave himself shingles! Now that's commitment! There are not many big blockbuster movies that manage to make their characters realistic (I'm looking at you, every rom-com for the last 4 years!) but ATB is different. I can imagine these characters and thankfully have not had the pleasure of meeting them...yet.Not only did I thoroughly enjoy this film, I also picked up some new phases, and as I went out into the garden that night to scare off a cat that has confronted my own, I grabbed the water spray from under the sink, and as I latched it to my belt I uttered the words, 'Tool up'.

The dialogue was forced and sometimes out of context and quite frankly didn't do anything to erode negative stereotypes on inner city gangs and the IQ, in fact quite the opposite, fully reinforcing the fact they live by drugs, weapons and violence with the collective IQ of any common garden vegetable combined with the typical attitude of shoot now, worry about my life later....much later, possibly never if there lucky...However if can endure a bunch of truly annoying kids constantly saying, 'you get me?' and 'blood' then you'd most likely go to see it several times and then once more! Cinematography-wise effects were pretty good, music was OK except for High Hat's rap song, personally I think he should stick to selling drugs and leaving the music industry to people with a larger vocabulary. Well that mix of good but mostly bad explains the 3/10.Defiantly one to miss if you enjoy good quality cinema or have a brain you actually use and value.

The dialogue - I've read reviews saying that it was over the top and this and that...well thats how most chavs where I live talk so I think it was good. The script was very witty and had some killer lines. I believe enough of a connection is created between the chavs and the audience even though they're unlikable at the start.

We laughed when we were supposed to, and we jumped when we were supposed to.The plot was not slowed down by a stupid back story, but moved at a electrifying pace that took us from laughing to jumping in the blink of an eye. Yes the heroes of this film aren't your typical heroes, but they fitted perfectly into the idea of the story.The setting was also a great choice by the director, as the close corridors and small flats of the block made a dramatic and claustrophobic environment. The use of the flickering lights in some scenes added to the tension of the scene and also helped to show the glowing teeth of the aliens. Smoke from the fireworks in the scenes near the end also helped, as it gave the corridor a sense of tension as you don't know if anyone is going to be killed.But the great strength of this film is the language. The young actors in this successfully kept up the slang throughout, and it was easy to understand so you knew what was going on. Americans might struggle to understand, but as a Brit I agreed with the language and use of it to make a realistic setting.On the whole, I hope this film was go down as one of the stand out British horror films of all time, along with Shawn of the Dead, another film that stars Nick Frost.

I figured the pacing of the movie -crisp and flowing- to dictate and expose the intimacy of the scenes of viewer explanation and in-movie jibes and plot transition. But, the theme snuck upon me. I felt charmed by the dialogue of these gritty London kids, the cultural witticisms masked behind a chirpy English drawl that held treasures of observations of both alien and societal input. Not once did I figure any character to be dishonest in his/her reflection of a human being as class-branded, they all came off as a seemingly effortless articulation to the terror of cosmic beings into their already Darwinian urban habitat. Not only did the plot have flaws as to the origins of the fuzzy-clad spacemen -vague, stoned zoologist musings- and the realistic nature of certain physical limitations, it reveled in them. At a briskly efficient clip of movie-going, you'd be hard-pressed to salvage a more genuine, thrilling, witty and knowing piece of filmmaking this summer or any. The film is a gem, and it's co-incision of the ongoining London riots add an emotional and cultural heft of reality to the release of the film that would have otherwise been a quirky, street-wise battle of quick stereotypes any other year. It's a tricky monster, and one well worth seeing to flush you into a cultural moment of both prescience and fun, a mutiny to be shared by the world and a theater to shield your view from the dilapidation of very real London Riots.

The story was beyond bizarre and surreal, but the characters drew you in and made you like them. The special effects were laughable, and the monsters unconvincing.

309,Minty82,I started to root for the aliens,1,3 October 2011,"This film seems to glorify gang culture in the UK. I was quite optimistic when I started to watch it and came to the mugging scene. I took an immediate dislike to the characters but thought I would give it a chance as they were bound to redeem themselves later on in the film. They didn't. I was actually quite pleased when a few of them met their demise.If I were the woman in that situation I certainly wouldn't want to help these scrotes after the abuse she still continues to receive when they ask, sorry, demand her help later on in the film.The sfx were not too bad for a budget film and I will also give them credit for getting the character stereotypes spot on.If you are worried about the chav gang culture in the UK then avoid this film. If you call your mates 'bruv' and own quite a few hoodies and terrorise communities then this film is for you.",Attack the Block
310,angel_fire_kat,Aliens attack a British block...,3,9 October 2011,"Attack the Block isn't your usual ""Oh no, the aliens are invading our world""-film, but an attempt to put a twist on the story by introducing true anti-heroes in the form of young maladjusted boys from Great Britain in the middle of the scene. The movie follows the boys through their fight with the aliens that have invaded the block where they live.The film has a range of good actors, good soundtrack and a clear indication that the people behind the film knows their movie theory - and yet it still managed to disappoint me. I usually love gore and sci- fi as well as comedies...My major problem with this movie is the characters (mind, not the actors): The fact that the heroes are actually the bad guys wouldn't normally have upset me - it has been used through other films. The issue is that I find these characters extremely unlikeable to a point where I sat cheering for the aliens to kill them in between cringing my toes.I understand the topic of the British youth and them being involved in gangs, but I find that the writers have utterly failed in trying to make a stand for these young boys and rather just created a gang that belongs in a juvenile prison to make the streets of London a safer place.The humor is dark beyond the point of being morbid. I did not find the movie to contain enough comedy elements to achieve this category, which left me with a kind of a hollow feeling inside. Also, I had anticipated a different movie knowing Nick Frost had a part in it, as I loved Shaun of the Dead among others of Frost's movies (and that this had been the thing it had been sold to me on). My word of advice would be, that if you want to watch this movie because you are a Nick Frost fan, there really isn't anything to go for. His role is minor and not worthy of his skill.",Attack the Block

318,jag-jg,A solid film with appeal to almost anyone that isn't immediately biased because of the generic character personality displayed.,7,5 May 2012,"First, my main reason for watching this film. On watching normal daytime TV an advert comes on for Love Film rentals and their new marketing campaign via their website. For a few brief seconds I see a bunch of faces staring out a window, with expressions I can remember back from my old school days. I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this film last year, when I was at the cinema watching another film (I didn't start watching TV again properly till end of last summer; CSI was too good to pass up). Being a fan of most things sci-fi this film had appeal to me. Seeing it labelled by most respectable websites as a comedy, I could instantly imagine how i'd like the film to pan out. For those of you unfamiliar with gang-style culture in south, east, west or north London (although gangs aren't limited geographically to these areas) obviously a certain distaste would arise from seeing a bunch of youths mug a young woman trying to head home, but I would like to point out it is a common occurrence worldwide.I think the film will generally only be 'admired' by those of a certain generation, although the admiration itself may be for completely different reasons. I can assure you that the character psychology is actually rather astute, not every kid on the street is violent or anti-social just because they want to be; there are usually adults, older brother figures to blame. As for the film itself, I liked it. It had a few laughs, even a couple of tear-jerker moments. To empathise with the main character when he loses a mate isn't too difficult, because despite his tough exterior we are still reminded that these are just kids, struggling to grow up based on someone else's ideals. Of course the film itself isn't a masterpiece, but for a film of this last decade it definitely has a place to call home. I realise that what i've written isn't quite a review, but reading through some of the other reviews all I really see are people bashing the film just because of their inability to understand the characters and where they come from. I say, watch it. Be surprised, if you have an open mind!",Attack the Block

Besides I liked the slangs used such as po-po for police, man in the end of every sentence and a lot more of such type. If someone is not familiar with such slangs, I suggest to have sub-titles to fully enjoy(and then admire) the movie.

323,juddo74,great writing and direction,9,26 March 2013,"This movie is made great for me by the clever writing, you are dragged into the story in a big way by the way that the central characters see more aliens landing close to where they live, after they've killed the first one, and they go dashing down the stairs in the block to their separate flats which in the case of all but one of them gives you at least some idea of what sort of home life they have so you know what you would normally expect of them, you find out more about the character Moses later when Sam goes to his flat and talks to him on the phone while she sets the trap that ultimately leads to the destruction of the aliens, I would mainly liken this film to the classic 80s film Gremlins due to its mixture of horror and comedy,this film is, in my humble opinion, every bit as good as Gremlins, I know many people won't agree with me about that view but when you break this film down you realise that it definitely didn't have the budget that Gremlins had and yet it holds your attention and you do, despite the fact that there are a drug dealer and some petty criminals among them, very much care about the central characters, this directorial debut by Joe Cornish is a definite triumph in my eyes",Attack the Block
324,theoscarsclub,A great film - some points people seem to miss,7,17 February 2014,"At its heart Attack the Block is all about communities. The social groups we make through shared culture, location and in this case by a common cause i.e. defeating a bunch of f**k-off big aliens who are attacking your turf. Many people have made complaints about the characters of the film being unlikeable due to their unruly actions and apparent lack of moral code. To this i would reply a) you don't have to be moral to be likable in films (lots of the best characters make us questions ourselves for liking them despite acting in ways we feel to be reprehensible) b) These characters are essentially kids. They are young, inexperienced and learning about the world. A strong underlying theme in the film is of background and its inequalities certainly within the socially polarised city of London. These kids are coming from deprived backgrounds and are learning from an environment which encourages them to be violent and to distrust governmental order which has only served to give them a harder-off start to life. From their point of view the government, order, schools and the police have made them poor and are their to keep them poor. With this in mind I think we have strong grounds to like the kids from the block and over the course of the film we certainly get a sense that their hearts are in the right place even if their heads been muddled by their environment (Moses reveals that he lives with his uncle who generally leaves him on his own. These kids aren't scum, they're unfortunate souls). Anyway some good context to the film would be that London is an extremely culturally diverse city with huge immigrant and poor populations. The poorer areas however are made up of strong communities of people from various ethnic backgrounds who manage to live more or less cohesively (the gang in the film are a mix of races but race is really not the issue in their portrayal, rather the lads are bound by their community which is the block, shown by their acceptance of the nurse when they find out she is a neighbour.) Furthermore the characters are likable as they are not morons as such youths are frequently portrayed by the media. They fight the aliens with cunning as their chief weapon and adapt when needed. They also learn valuable lessons throughout the film. With all this in mind I hope the characters can be enjoyed more and questions over their morality wont cloud your judgement in seeing them as decent people. Sorry for this wordy review but I feel this has been brushed over in other peoples summaries of the film. It also may not be phrased as well as it could be since its 1 in the morning and im tired. :)",Attack the Block
325,r_shakey,"Well shot, but Shaun of The Dead it's not",6,20 September 2011,"An intriguing premise let down by a heavy-handed, cliché-ridden script, Attack the Block attempts to straddle several genres but lacks the deftness of touch seen in Shaun of the Dead - the film with whom it will inevitably be compared.Despite the involvement of Edgar Wright and Nick Frost, it never really convinces as a comedy horror. The main culprit is, as mentioned above, the script. Apparently, Joe Cornish claims to have spent time on 'the block' in an attempt to give his script realism. Unfortunately it didn't really work. The teens speak in gang clichés which don't ring true, failing to win the audience's interest or sympathy despite generally winning performances from the first-time cast. As commented elsewhere, the film veers uneasily between condoning criminal behaviour and clumsily attempting to explain the characters' motivations. A minor character, a posh boy attempting, and failing, to fit in on the estate, seems more like a reflection of Cornish himself than a character with anything significant to add.Putting those things aside, however, there are some interesting things to watch. Cornish as a director is much more successful than as a screenwriter. It's extremely well shot, conjuring up a moody atmosphere which at times evokes some of John Carpenter's work. As an aside, parts of this film seem like a cross between Assault on Precinct 13 and The Fog, two of Carpenter's minor films that are well worth a watch.In the horror aspects of the plot, there are some effectively tense set-pieces, but also a missed opportunity for more sustained suspense. Somehow it dissipates away rather than building it up. The creature design is simple but eerie, and their distinguishing feature is used frequently to good effect.There were a lot of things that I really liked about Attack the Block. The direction kept things moving well, the action scenes were at times quite chilling and the barren urban landscape well used. With a more nuanced script and a firmer leaning towards the horror genre this could have been an excellent film. Sadly, the comedy aspects fail to convince and the lead-footed script keeps us at arms length from the characters. If you've seen a few horror films you'll enjoy the references, but this is ultimately a tantalising taste of a directorial talent not quite fully realised. I'll watch another Joe Cornish film, but only because I'll be hoping for a more satisfying experience than in Attack the Block.",Attack the Block

The way it has been shown that what really happens out in the world. The kids were doing trash talk but it is a way to show how things work nowadays. aliens and blood kill was the main attraction .The logic of the movie was missing somewhere. for example one of the kids get murdered and nobody asks anything about it. The Police just arrest the kids for no reason in the end. Things like that were a bit odd. but the movie still ends as an entertainer . . What is evident is Cornish's confidence in directing. The actors ""under the hoods"" are quite brilliant, displaying both the hard exterior that they portray on the ""streets"", but also their tender side, whilst along the way highlighting the reasons these young men are so disenfranchised; they are all from broken homes. This is quite a poignant issues when juxtaposed with the scenes of riots we saw in London this summer. so i recommend watching this movie to all.",Attack the Block
327,kierinbell98,loved it,10,5 October 2014,"movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of ""time slowdowns"" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. ""I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!"" Sounds familiar? Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.So here's the deal.If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable.

Growing up in city/public housing, with or without a parent around is not something that is easily related to the walks of every day life that we all consider normal. Joe Cornish captured the entire upbringing that so many (my brothers and I included) children had/have had to, just because you have a parent does not mean you,or they have money, growing up in those sort of neighborhoods either builds character or destroys it. The fact that I have read so many reviews that consist of hatred towards a group of confused under-privileged 15 year olds just goes to show that part of the film is lost on a certain demo......the film killed in theaters as far as experience, and I'm yet to find a person under 50 who has a sour word to say about it.

During the first 10mins I was concerned that the characters seemed pretty horrible, but as the film progressed I realised that was part of the point. They are supposed to be flawed and not supposed to come across as role models or heroes, and eventually they become more lovable as you see their vulnerabilities and how they deal with the crisis that they are faced with. I think some of the negative reviews are rather self righteous and lazy; people haven't looked closely enough.

Yes, the characters are pretty much scum (and luckily we did get to see a few of them get mauled), but I still enjoyed it. The balance with Sam and her fear of the boys is actually quite interesting to watch. I also ended up liking Moses. As we see, it's not his fault that he's the way he is, he just has pretty crap life. I loved the design of the aliens; simple yet effective (and for some reason they reminded me of wild mutt from Ben 10). It was entertaining watching them chase the boys through the block. The premise of the film is also interesting, and I enjoyed the traditional 'picked off one by one' scenario as they get chased through the building. Ultimately, it was a neat little sci-fi flick that I'd definitely recommend people to watch. Obviously, it's not perfect though. Nick Frosts character is incredibly under-used despite how good the actor is. The pot-head character who watches national geographic is also a bit of an ex Machina, just so that they can add the revelation of the aliens being after the female.

Don't get me wrong predictable isn't always a weakness but in this case it is. The characterisations where almost non existent. The humour was very English and sparse.   It just came across as trying too hard. To be quite honest I can't understand how people gave rated this as 8/10 let alone 10/10. Perhaps I just don't get it. Some writers put it in the same category as Shaun of the Dead, another film that I found just okay which is perhaps why I didn't find it that amusing.  To sum up if you've not got a better way of killing 90mins then by all means give it a watch, don't expect too much and it'll keep you entertained.",Attack the Block

Please take your comments elsewhere if you can't see past the message, or the color of someone's skin (yeah, you know what I'm talking about).The movie itself wasn't anything like I expected, but it was good nonetheless. I think the reason people are hating on the cast is because they acted out their roles of ""thugs"" so well. You're not supposed to like them, which is quite obvious from the beginning of the movie, so they would be the last people you'd expect to be fighting these aliens. I like surprises in my movies. I don't know about the rest of you though.I found humor in the dialogue, and you can too. Just picture everyone as Ali G the whole movie. Other than that, the kids didn't seem as bad as everyone is making them out to be. Yeah, they mug people, but there is a deep social message trying to be made here.

It cropped up on some ten best lists that I read and decided to check it out.First of all, it's a beautifully crafted picture. Inspiring cinematography, editing, dialog and terrific performances. The movie flew by for me.The film in no way glamorizes the inner city youth. It does however, let us peek in and see the hard circumstances that these kids have to overcome every day. We also get to watch as the kids begin to grow up and rise above the odds.Moses, the leader of the gang, was absolutely fantastic. His menacing introduction gradually changes to scared kid and then to brave man. You could see all of his thoughts in his facial expressions.I especially loved the scene where the kids go to get weapons in each of their apartments. The short glimpse into their homes shed light on their situations as well as reminding us that these are kids. Solid character development in a short period of time.I also found myself reminded of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 more than once.

Setting up the main protagonists as violent little hood rats who put a knife to a girl loses audience sympathy / belief within the first half hour. Particularly mine, having been violently mugged in the car park of my flats a few years back. Believe me I wouldn't team up with the ?!**!! who did that to fight off a zombie apocalypse, let alone a few hairy aliens.Worse it reinforces the stereotype that kids who live on council estates are stupid violent thugs. Not true and pretty insulting to the majority. I'm sick of this idea that if you're poor or grow up in a rough area you're OK with violence and gang culture, and I don't like seeing it glorified. The one dimensional characterisation - including the 'posh boy' - seems to based on some weird middle class media dream version of the UK.What a wasted opportunity. maybe someone should buy Joe Cornish a dictionary for Christmas so he can look up 'anti hero'.",Attack the Block
336,sheismyveryfavoritegun,A grand ol' time,9,16 June 2011,"This movie had so many great elements to it; giving one a very different look at aliens in South London, almost in the style of the new Doctor Who, with lots of running around after aliens with a sort of novelty approach to such, while remaining interesting and intriguing. The characters, namely the little gangsta's, are introduced as the most unlikely heroes you can imagine, but as the movie continues on you start to see these guys in more of a friendly light, where they once were mere street thugs they become these socially concerned individuals who've simply had enough of the oppression given to people of their social class; albeit a misguided view most of the time, they have a lot of heart, and that is exactly what gets them through the romper stomp with the ""big, scary, wolf, bear mothaf****rs!"" The language used throughout was entertaining and appropriate, like that you would expect from some young South Londoners. The humor too was appropriate and not so over the top as you might expect. The danger aspect, at the level it is, prevents too much humor from escaping their mouths. The aliens themselves were an interesting bunch. Totally carnal and seemingly without intelligence prompts the question of ""how did they get here?"", but through all the action you accept it for what it is. They're blacker than black with green fluorescent rows of teeth much like a shark, and can bound along and climb fast. Very cool. It all just fit together nicely. The Block itself acts as a connecting force that binds the different groups of people who live on it. As they are forced to fight for their own survival, they decide facing death is better fought alongside one- another, differences put aside. The action itself was highly enjoyable, fast-paced and totally unpredictable. This is what you hope to expect from young street toughs armed with whatever they have at hand, and highly determined to protect the Block that belongs to them and not some uninvited alien force. I 100% recommend this. If you enjoy any of these elements, the social tale, the alien invasion, the English humour, and runaway action, you will enjoy Attack The Block.",Attack the Block
337,colly-33100,An unexpected gem!,10,11 October 2021,"This movie was considered a sleeper, but was QUITE unexpected. A great movie, I watch every time it comes on and the music was fantastic (I'm looking for the movie score)!! A must see😊",Attack the Block
338,chrishylands,Everything in the movie is set up,8,12 January 2019,"During the end of the final act Moses needs to blow up his apartment so he explodes it and jumped of the balcony and catches himself using the uk flag and in the middle of the first act when we see the block for the first time you can see the Union Jack hanging out of a window where it was when Moses jumped of the balcony. I have seen people criticise that pest has a ""magical backpack"" because when they take out a couple of fireworks they ""magically"" has more the next minute for plot convenience this is stupid as I believe as he could fit more in his backpack. To summarise I think this film is good and is a good film an I would recommend to whatch it of you can.",Attack the Block
