0,bkoganbing,Sadder and wiser romantics take heed,7,8 December 2015,"In many ways Under The Tuscan Sun seems to be a kinder and gentler version of The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone. Both deal with female protagonists who have lost their husbands and seemingly a reason for existence as both had much maybe too much invested in their marriages.Unlike Vivien Leigh's film where her husband dies leaving her a wealthy widow who can now indulge in hedonism, Diane Lane was a successful author who supported her husband who was struggling as a writer and she catches him with another woman. He demands and gets the alimony.So disgusted is she that she takes off for Italy on a gay tour at the behest of her lesbian friend Margaret Oh who gives up her and her partner's ticket for one first class for Lane because she badly needs R&R. That's a friend, no one ever did that for me. The theory being that on a gay tour she can think without being hit on as a ready to rebound divorcée.Passing through Tuscany she spots a villa being sold dirt cheap by American prices and impulsively buys it. After that comes a few heartaches, but gradually Lane's back in the swing of things Italian style as it were.I did love the nicely photographed scenes of Italy showing the daily life there. Lane really dominates the film and though she's sadder and wiser she's not caught up in a meaningless and hedonistic existence as Vivien Leigh was. And Margaret Oh has a lot of wisdom in her and she will be one you remember.For sadder and wiser romantics Under The Tuscan Sun is cheerfully recommended.",Under the Tuscan Sun
1,SnoopyStyle,Diane Lane makes this good,6,21 September 2013,"Frances (Diane Lane) works hard to support his writer husband. So when his husband finally finishes his book, she is surprised to be cleaned out in a divorce from his cheating husband. I don't know why she doesn't get half his book. But while he gets to live in their old house with his new girlfriend, she gets to rent a tiny apartment in a divorcées complex. When her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) has unusable tickets to a gay tour to Tuscany, she insists that Frances go to renew her life. Only she decides to buy an old house there.Diane Lane is lovely. I guess it's a single girl fantasy to run away to Italy. She has some wacky fun renovating the house. Then midway thru there is an Italian guy. It's done in a totally different style. I feared that it was turning into a more by the book rom-com. Then the guy goes away for awhile. Sandra Oh comes back into the movie. The tone goes much lighter with Sandra making a couple of jokes. There is a young couple that injects some energy. Diane Lane makes this fantasy good. The film could be a self-indulgent mess without her. I really feel for her. That's all due to Diane Lane. It does turn sad as nothing works out. But we recover for our happy sappy ending.",Under the Tuscan Sun
2,Hitchcoc,Some Pretty Sharp Commentary,6,11 January 2017,"I try to write a little on every film I see. My sister recommended this to me and so my wife and I watched it. The hard thing for me is the self-indulgent rich person who is searching for herself, trying to get herself moving forward after her ex- done her in. She has so much money that she can do just about anything she wants. I never found a connection to any of the people in this film, partly because we are so unalike and partly because I felt they didn't deserve much attention. It's hard to pull for character who are rolling through life, feasting on what is there. I do admit that this part of Italy is gorgeous. The cinematographer did a marvelous job of producing images of sun and architecture and all that this part of the world has to offer. After I saw the film, however, I had to think hard to remember what happened.",Under the Tuscan Sun
3,Prismark10,Bland and kind of predictable. A hollow centre.,4,26 April 2014,"This is a travelogue that meets 'a year in Provence.'It is an adaptation of a book where Diane Lane who discovers her husband is having an affair and is persuaded to go to a tour of Italy and impulsively purchases a run down house. She sets about getting workers together and fix the house while at the same time getting her life together and hopefully find romance again.There is wonderful Italian scenery, Lane looks ravishing, some tender and funny and scenes but its predictable. I saw the television adaptation of the Year of Provence over twenty years ago and here again you have workers struggling to fix the house and having problems communicating because of the language problems, some of the builders here are Polish.Pretty soon Lane has a male admirer and things seem to brighten up for Lane as the house is coming together and some of the side plots such as one of the Poles falling for a local girl coming to an optimistic end. However you always feel her young male admirer is someone hardly in short of female company when he is away from her.The film gets along in a nice bland way, never really jolting you because its predictable and never reaching a higher gear. Its as is some edgy characters such as Lane's gay friends and the nice scenery is supposed to make up for a run of the mill screenplay.",Under the Tuscan Sun
4,claudio_carvalho,"A Delightful Romance, With a Tour Through the Wonders of Italy and a Great Homage to the Italian Cinema",7,29 March 2005,"When the American writer and critic Francesca (Diane Lane) divorces from her husband, she becomes very depressed. Meanwhile, her lesbian friend Patti (Sandra Oh) gets pregnant and Patti and her mate decide to give their travel to Tuscan in a gay tour as a gift to Frances, to lift her moral. Once in Italy, Frances decides to spend all her savings, buying an old villa in an impulsive decision. While reforming the place, Frances finds wonderful places, friendship with the locals and love. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a delightful romance, with a tour through the wonders of Italy and a great homage to the Italian cinema, with a reference to ""La Dolce Vita"" and a minor participation of Mario Monicelli. Diane Lane looks like wine, becoming more gorgeous along the years, and with a lovely face and smile. I have never had the chance to visit Italy, and after seeing the magnificent locations and the nice people of Italy, I believe most of the viewers will have the feeling of expecting to have a chance to visit such a marvelous place. I really liked this enjoyable film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sob o Sol da Toscana"" (""Under the Tuscan Sun"")",Under the Tuscan Sun
5,moonspinner55,"Breezy, likable fairy tale/travelogue",6,27 October 2005,"Lovely modern-day fairy tale has recently-divorced American woman rebuilding her life after taking a vacation trip to Tuscany and deciding that's where she wants to live; after purchasing and remodeling a run-down villa, she makes new friends and love-interests. Comic and romantic ingredients are not presented in an especially subtle manner, but the charming characters and Diane Lane's sparkling lead performance help make up for the small deficiencies. The simple effectiveness of the overall story won't grab some (the early exposition and introductions may seem contrived or trite), however the magic of the enterprise--no matter how engineered it might be--does its job. Ultimately, the film offers an enjoyable and moving experience, surprisingly. **1/2 from ****",Under the Tuscan Sun
6,michaelRokeefe,What does it take to start life anew?,3,27 August 2004,"Audrey Wells directs and is responsible for the screenplay of Frances Mayes' book UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN. The lovely Diane Lane plays Frances, a bewildered writer fighting the depression that follows a life altering divorce. Friends arrange the gift of a 10 day vacation to sunny Tuscany. While there she manages to get a great price on a not so great shape villa; where she hopes to start her life over again. The villa is not the only thing that comes by impulse...new friendships are built and romance suffers for lack of priority. Frances might not be lucky in love; but the effect she has on other people's lives account for the betterment in her own. She finds contentment in restoring her new home and leaves herself wide open for whatever life has to offer.I have always loved Lane and must say that she is the only reason I stuck with this movie to the end. I would like to sweep UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN under the carpet. Totally bored to death. Even the few seconds of love making hardly registered on my excitement meter. I can say that the scenery is awesome. Supporting cast includes:Raoul Bova, Vincent Riotta, Claudia Gerini and Sandra Oh.",Under the Tuscan Sun
7,jotix100,Italian for beginners...,7,9 November 2003,"Something very strange happened on the way to make this film. It appears as though director and adapter, Audrey Wells, threw the original text away only to create her own trip to Tuscany. With the help of her gorgeous star, Ms. Wells found backing for this pastiche she ended up presenting to us, which bears almost no resemblance to the original book by Frances Mayes.This is a movie full of cliches: The lonely and naive American tourist that would stay in Italy, the Latin lover, the good lesbian friend, and last, but not least, the eccentric Brit living in the small town!The best thing this film offers is the radiant Diane Lane, who is just gorgeous enough to make us forget the story and what is she doing in the mess she is in. Also, Lindsay Duncan, another great British actress doing a crude interpretation of her own ""La Dolce Vita"" some 44 years later.This is a typical ""date film"" which will be enjoyed by those people that didn't read the book.",Under the Tuscan Sun
8,evanston_dad,Saved By Diane Lane,5,2 December 2005,"Diane Lane is a fascinating actress to watch. Her face is always doing something interesting, and she has a winning, winsome quality to her that makes you automatically root for her. She takes the role she's given here and actually does things with it that other actresses probably couldn't.Otherwise, this film is the visual equivalent of Diet Soda: canned, bland and full of sugar. It should appeal to the Oprah crowd or people who love reality shows about people's homes being remodeled. It's harmless enough, but it has that sort of lazy, vapid quality that makes you wonder why anybody thought it was really worth turning into a movie in the first place.Grade: C",Under the Tuscan Sun
9,ferguson-6,Major Chick Flick Alert!!!,6,11 October 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Yeah, OK, it is no surprise that this is the ultimate chick flick.  However, I was hoping for more.  A star vehicle for Diane Lane (coming off all the attention she received for the overrated ""Unfaithful"") I had hoped this would be more than wronged woman overcomes obstacles and creates a new life while enriching those around her.  Sadly, nothing more here from a writing perspective.  I will say Diane Lane shines in the role and her smile literally brightens the theatre.  The most interesting character in the movie is Lindsay Duncan as Katherine, who seems to be the wisest nut case around.  Her scene as Sylvia from ""La Dolce Vita"" is wonderful as are her many facial expressions!  The Italian countryside is breathtaking, but the side plots all just mix together as a bunch of nothing.  I did find it cute that Director Audrey Wells worked in an Italian version of ""George of the Jungle"", which of course, she wrote!  Not sure what to say about the actress, Sandra Oh.  She continues to put together a solid acting career, without, shall we say, ""classic Hollywood looks"".  See this for Diane Lane and the countryside, but keep your expectations low for the story.",Under the Tuscan Sun
10,anaconda-40658,Lane Should Hide Under Something and the Tuscan Sun Isn't It.,3,24 November 2015,"Under the Tuscan Sun (2003): Dir: Audrey Wells / Cast: Diane Lane, Raoul Bova, Sandra Oh, Lindsay Duncan, Kate Walsh: Romantic drama about change starring Diane Lane whose recent divorce leaves her depressed. Her friends decide to send her on a vacation to Tuscan where she buys a house. It is here where the he story becomes disjointed with pointless subplots. She meets an antique dealer played by Raoul Bova whom she falls in love with but he cheats on her and so the formula goes. Directed by Audrey Wells with beautiful photography but not a shred of story that hasn't been seen countless times. Lane carries through the tired formula as a woman venturing into the unknown and seeking new opportunities but ends up subduing herself in a lousy relationship. Supporting roles are in an out and never very broad. Bova plays a guy who is basically there to bang Lane and present himself as a jerk. Also along for the ride are Sandra Oh and Lindsay Duncan who contribute absolutely nothing to this flimsy outing. They are talented but subdued with formula driven screen writing that amounts to the obvious. Rather than address themes of change and dealing with a fresh start it settles in jerking viewers around with endless stupid romantic clichés. Viewers are recommended a real vacation as oppose to watching this dreary film. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Under the Tuscan Sun
11,phd_travel,Transporting experience,9,5 November 2012,There are some romantic movies set in Europe that you just want to watch again and this is one of them. It's funny warm and has gorgeous Tuscan scenery and makes you want to go to the see the real places. The story isn't irritating too with a bit of culture differences and a transporting yet believable plot. The characters are likable and aren't too stereotypical.Diane Lane is lovely here and this movie deservedly revitalized her career. It could have been a bit pathetic looking if someone less appealing had played the role. Raoul Bova is well cast as her Latin lover. Sandra Oh is cute but Lindsay Duncan is a bit tiresome.Of the recent movies about expats visiting Italy like 'Letters to Juliet' and 'Eat Pray Love' this is still the best.,Under the Tuscan Sun
12,gradyharp,"Revisiting Tuscany, under the sun",5,13 July 2010,"Having read Frances Mayes' travelogue UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN: AT HOME IN ITALY and enjoyed the flow of her reconstructed a shabby old treasure of a house there and her inimitable conversation about how to enjoy the special qualities of Tuscany, seeing this book adapted into a film seemed a reasonable step. After seeing the film and finding it so completely unrelated to Mayes' book - using it more life a stage on which to create a lot of 'audience pleasing subplots' - this viewer passed on writing a review. Seeing the film again, years later, without any expectations to meet, was a pleasant surprise. Get past the Audrey Wells superimposed episodes of Sandra Oh and her baby, of the love affair gone awry, and the Fellini reenactment etc and the film has some charm. Diane Lane tries her best to make us consider this little story a transformation event and in many cases ti works. But not always in the manner in which it was intended. What does come shining through are some bit parts by actors who deserve more attention and more exposure. For instance, the 'workmen' who help Lane's adapted character transform her villa into a 'home' for all manner of folk. One of the actors who plays the young Pawel, Pawel Szajda, has all the necessary qualities to bloom into a fine career - and hopefully this film will be a springboard for him. Also Lane's 'at the end of the film only' lover Ed is played by another solid newcomer - David Sutcliff. Otherwise the possibility of falling in love with beautiful Tuscany is a bit blurred with all the generated little stories that add little to the film. But then again, it IS durable - which says a lot for the many love affairs with Italy that both the book and the film started! Grady Harp",Under the Tuscan Sun
13,mm-39,My wife likes this one,6,12 July 2005,"Well, the story gets a bit much for myself, being socially conservative, but one could say I am guilty of watching American Pie, so call me guilty for watching my wife's movie, which is like a romance novel. Not a John Wayne or Sylvester Stalone film. Tuscan Sun is entertaining, my friend Tony has told and this film repeats the love of life Itialian culture embraces. I watched Tuscan at my uncle's shown on his new TV set, hey Sony makes great sets, and my wife found the movie interesting. Diane Lane plays a financially rich person who can throw caution to the wind, and goes on a crazy path. I get to see how one with money can live and think. Even Chuck Norris makes a guest appearance, No just joking. I give the film a six out of ten. This movie reminds me of the Hilton sisters that they show the jet set life styles.",Under the Tuscan Sun
14,whpratt1,Keep Your Childish Innocence,7,12 February 2006,"This was a very enjoyable film that is full of very simple truths of life, where a woman is heart broken about a marriage break up and losses hope that she can experience such a wonderful feeling or joy. Diane Lane,(Frances),""Must Love Dogs"",'05 plays this tender hearted young woman who has a close relationship with her girl friend and encounters a so called romance that turns into a One-Night-Stand. Frances is at her wits end with men and romance and learns that sometimes things happen in our lives that are meant to be and we find joy in match making other friends. There is lots of drama, romance and comedy, and keeping your childish innocence is not a bad idea, it is better than going into complete DEPRESSION !",Under the Tuscan Sun
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, will this movie just give us a break?",3,3 January 2007,"I'll admit up front, I'm not a huge chick flick fan, there are only pretty much a dozen that I like, I normally love the romantic comedies, despite how cheesy they can be. Well, a friend told me while I was renting this on the phone that it was a cheesy movie but I figured, some like sausage and some like pepperoni per say, some movies really do depend on your view of the film. But this was a chick flick that was majorly rubbed in my face and could be at times very predictable.Kathleen is a newly divorced woman who has been cheated on, she goes to Tuscany, Italy and buys a house that is falling apart. She gets immigrants to help her restore it while she works on a new novel hoping to achieve a happy new life. She meets an Italian charmer, who of course I could tell from the line ""I could swim in your eyes"" that he was... well, you'll get the idea. She goes through some rough times, but pulls herself together when her pregnant friend, Patti moves in with her.Under the Tucsan Sun is a very over the top chick flick that I wasn't at all impressed with, the only thing I'm giving points on that it had some very beautiful pictures in it and it had nice touches to it. But I really do think that Dianne is an over rated actress, again, I know I am going to get bashed for that, but I want to be honest. For women who only enjoy chick flicks, be my guest, but if you're the average film fanatic, I'm not sure if you'll be too impressed by it.3/10",Under the Tuscan Sun
16,=G=,A stroll down a Tuscan Lane,7,4 February 2004,"In ""Under the Tuscan Sun"",  a recently divorced American writer/critic (Lane) ventures to Italy where she sets about putting the pieces of her shattered life back together in the rustic, bucolic, scenic countryside of Tuscany. Lane registers a fine performance in this lighthearted drama spritzed with humor and romance which is as lovely as it is clumsy. Obvious in its attempts to tug at the heart-strings of romantics with all the expected Italian stereotypes and cliches, this flick received mixed reviews and will resonate most with more mature sentimentalists. Those who enjoy this film may want to check out V. Redgrave in ""A Month by the Lake"" (1995). (B)",Under the Tuscan Sun
17,sddavis63,"""Someday You'll Be Happy Again""",7,14 May 2009,"Admittedly, I was surprised. This isn't the type of movie that normally appeals to me, and yet I was really quite taken with it on a number of counts. It could be described as a very gentle movie (even mildly spiritual in some ways) full of sage advice about life and how to handle the disappointments that naturally appear, and - being somewhat stereotypically Italian in its presentation - it has a lot about love and romance and flirtatiousness in it. It even packs a bit of humour. Not a typical guy's movie, but still very pleasant viewing. What I particularly liked was the premise that essentially started the whole thing off. Frances (in a great performance by Diane Lane) discovers that her husband is having an affair, and they end up divorced - and, she being the primary bread winner - he gets the house and alimony. The lesson? When your life falls apart, move on to something completely different and start picking up the pieces. Frances buys a villa in Tuscany and restarts her life, with us watching. Her problems aren't solved. She seems to think that everything revolves around finding a man and romance, but - as her friend Martini points out near the end of the movie - she ends up with everything she wanted - just not in the way she expected to get it.At times, it's a bit slow-paced, and it's not ""exciting"" in the way we think of the word, but it's got a quality that draws you into it. As far as the story is concerned, my only quibble might be the introduction of the character of ""Ed"" right at the end of the movie. Everything to that point had led to the understanding that Frances didn't need romance to be fulfilled; she had found her fulfillment with the people she had assembled around her, who had become a surrogate family. I suppose it's nice that she found someone to love, but the movie on the whole would have been more satisfying if it had ended with the gathering at the dinner table with all her friends - without Ed! That was an unsatisfying intrusion into an otherwise satisfying story. 7/10",Under the Tuscan Sun
18,Buddy-51,cloudy skies over Italy,4,1 February 2005,"Though officially based on a true story - the autobiographical bestseller by Frances Mayes - ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" plays like one of those slick fiction ""women's pictures"" (now called ""chick flicks"") from the 1950's and 1960's in which a beautiful woman (usually played by Lana Turner or Jean Seberg), unlucky in the ways of love, heads to Europe in the hopes of finding true romance in the arms of the heavily-accented man of her dreams.This glossy, shallow and superficial soap opera stars Diane Lane as Frances, a semi-successful writer who discovers that her husband is cheating on her with another woman. After the divorce, in which somehow the husband has managed to finagle almost everything including the house away from her as part of the settlement, Frances agrees to go on a gay bus tour through Italy that two lesbian friends have set up for her. While on a stopover in Tuscany, the usually far-from-impulsive Frances decides, on the spur of the moment, to purchase a villa replete with bad plumbing and acres upon acres of olive trees. Without any discernible source of income to make it all possible, Frances divides her time between making major repairs on the place and cavorting all over the Italian countryside, having ""adventures"" with the colorful native and immigrant population and falling under the spell of the handsome young Italian who always seems to be just waiting in the wings in stories such as these. But is he really the right man for her? Needless to say, with all this going on, we don't see this ""author"" getting a whole lot of writing done during this overseas sojourn (though, at the end, we find that she's somehow managed - apparently off-camera - to write a whole book about her experiences here).Diane Lane is so fine an actress that she is able to make even this hokey pablum almost believable at times. For the most part, though, the film is a case of missed opportunities. For instance, nothing whatsoever is done with the gay tour aspect of the plot (one suspects that the film might have been more interesting had Frances STAYED on the bus rather than gotten off, as I'm sure a group of gay guys would have known how to have more fun in Italy than she does), and Frances' own story winds up taking a back seat to a bland Romeo and Juliet-type subplot and a whole host of stereotypical minor characters. Every time Lane begins to bring some depth and reality to her character, the romantic fantasy trappings pile on to overwhelm her.Apart from Lane's performance and the eye-popping views of the Italian landscape, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" offers little for the non-armchair traveler to feast on.",Under the Tuscan Sun
19,vincentlynch-moonoi,Utterly charming,7,30 April 2013,"I guess I've watched this film three times now, and each time I do I find it utterly charming. And, it seems so real. The situations in the plot do not seem ""set up"". It's a very pleasant story, but by pleasant I don't mean all happy. The crux of the story is really quite sad -- a woman is stunned by a divorce, reluctantly travels to Italy to get away from things, and takes on a new life with all its challenges, feeling for so long that she will never find someone.The settings and cinematography are stunning. I spent most of my time traveling in Southeast Asia...never to Europe. This is one of those films that made me wish I had traveled to Italy! Diane Lane, who is a wonderful actress...well, this may be her most engaging role...and frankly, I can't think of an actress that would have been better (or half as good) in the part. Sandra Oh is very good as an unwed lesbian mother-to-be. Raoul Bova as an unexpectedly married Italian man (though I expected it) was very good. Pawel Szajda, as the young lover, was delightfully innocent. And there are many other well-played roles in this film...in fact, that is the primary strength of this film.Highly recommended as a love story...well, actually as a hoped-for love story!",Under the Tuscan Sun
20,tabuno,American Romance Under Foreign Skies,8,25 January 2019,"26 September 2003. This somewhat predictable, but gorgeously photographed and nicely acted movie gives evidence to the increasing sophistication between drama and comedy in movies. This delightful American-style romance film shot in Italy makes for a women's date fantasy. The humor is slick and cerebral tantalizing, the drama zesty with feeling. The crazy antics and the voice-over tantalizing.Certainly not a brainy or intelligent movie by any stretch of the imagination, this fun and carefree spin around the world is just the ticket for a great night on the town, a nice bedtime tale, just the cruise to a good night's rest.Eight of Ten Stars.P.S. The director's commentary is a double plus bonus. Her commentary is almost an added story in itself as she follows along the movie with how the movie was made, what it involved. Audrey Well's experience directing this movie is a wonderful real fairy tale in itself (1/16/08).",Under the Tuscan Sun
21,howard.schumann,As authentic as a spaghetti commercial,4,23 February 2004,"I usually give the benefit of the doubt to films that have their heart in the right place, but Audrey Wells' Under the Tuscan Sun is about as authentic as a commercial for Mamma Mia's Spaghetti Sauce. Wells has taken a picturesque novel about an older couple buying and renovating a villa in Italy and turned it into a contrived melodrama filled with the most obvious stereotypes. The film stars Oscar nominee Diane Lane as Frances Mayes, a writer who, after divorcing a cheating spouse is sent on a Gay bus tour of Italy by her pregnant Lesbian friend Patti (Sandra Oh). When she spots a rundown villa called Bramasole, she decides on the spur of the moment to buy and renovate it. She finds cute itinerant laborers from Poland to add to the mix, and before you can say ""chick flick"", the villa looks like a palace. All that is needed is someone to sleep in her bed and a wedding in the patio.I don't mind films that present a woman's point of view but here the men come off especially badly. Beyond her philandering husband, there is the writer who tells Frances of her husband's affair to get back at her for a bad review and Frances' lawyer who has no sympathy for her whatever. There's more. There is the obligatory romantic Italian named Marcello (of course) but he is deceitful and she is left to fall back for comfort on her friend Patti who comes to visit her in Italy, even though ready to deliver her baby. I could go on and tell you about the teenager who wants to marry a Polish laborer but her parents object, not unreasonably it seems to me, because she has just met the boy, an itinerant laborer with no education. They are persuaded, however, because he performs well in a flag-throwing contest and Frances lies and says he is part of her family.
This is movie making on the level of a television sitcom. It plucks the right heartstrings, has an uplifting message, and appeals to just about every known demographic. The only thing lacking is narrative coherence and emotional truth. On the plus side, it has a good message, (fulfillment can be found by giving to others) and, thanks to cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson, the redeeming beauty of the Tuscan countryside. This plus Diane Lane is worth the price of admission but there is little else to recommend it except of course if you are doing research on the difference between art and artifice.",Under the Tuscan Sun
22,Vartiainen,"Fluff, but in a good way",6,7 September 2015,"Under the Tuscan Sun, based on a memoir of the same name by Frances Mayes, tells her tale after she gets divorced and decides to buy a Tuscan villa on a whim. The film is rather lighthearted in tone, and is really more a feature film length tourist advertisement for Tuscany, but not in a bad way. A lot of time is spent getting to know the locals and the areas around, but seeing as Tuscany is one of the most charming places on Earth, there are worse ways to spend an hour or two.Diana Lane plays the lead role, and a lot of the film's strengths can be attributed to her. She is a very fetching woman, and she also has enough acting skills to pull off the more somber drama scenes in the beginning as well. Her inner monologues also give the movie some much needed maturity and depth, more because of her presence and tone than through what was actually said. Still, a Golden Globe nomination well earned, I'd say.As for the downsides, it is rather shallow when it comes to actual themes and messages. The romance subplots are rather meaningless and/or clichéd, the plot twists are not all that exciting and even the setting grows a bit stale near the end. Sure, they were tied by the source material and I do get that they didn't set out to make anything all that world shattering to begin with, but I still don't think this is a movie you're going to remember for years to come.And that's really the movie in a nutshell. It's charming and fetching, but also rather meaningless. Fluff, in other words, but sometimes it's nice to see a fluff movie and this is certainly one of the better examples of those.",Under the Tuscan Sun
23,Polaris_DiB,"Some surprises, some gratuities",7,1 January 2009,"This is a really surprising movie, for me. I enjoy some chick flicks but this one really didn't sound all that interesting as I'm not into the conceit of romance in other countries and don't much harbor dreams of Italy. However, those expectations are what made this surprising because it's not necessarily settled on that rote theme.Actually, the beginning of this movie is really great, as it's pretty mean-spirited and dark-humored. That was a delicious way to start and really helped the rest of the movie make a lot more sense in regard to the main character's motivations. By the time she's in Tuscany, you care about her and the landscape is beautiful, so there's not much to dislike.It does drag a bit, and even having not read the book, I can tell it's definitely not the book. After a little while the movie switches its concerns from the process of rebuilding the house to the process of dating again, and at that point it becomes a lot less interesting, but still quite redeemable. This movie makes the biggest mistake of insisting that she find a lover by the end, something entirely not necessary and really soaking the warm imagery with an air of sentimentality.If only it had returned to the verbal repartee nature of the beginning from time to time to remind us that we weren't vicariously living some epic American fantasy of European romance, this movie would really stand out. However, eventually it decides to go the standard way and thus becomes predictable. Luckily, the characters will keep you interested long after the story ceases to be.--PolarisDiB",Under the Tuscan Sun
24,meeza,Lane Shines!,7,22 June 2004,"First, she was the sole fem outsider in the male grunt dominated 80's classic `The Outsiders'. Then, she geared it up with some steady acting driving in `Streets of Fire'. After, she was Matt Dillon's prey in `The Flamingo Kid'. Then, she was a flatliner. No! She was not in that movie but her career was as motionless as a flatline. Ms. Diane Lane's career had suddenly crashed and it appeared that she was driving in the wrong lane. However, Ms. Lane's perseverance got her back in the fast lane! Diane's career was recently resurrected with her groundbreaking performance in the vaporous sexual thriller `Unfaithful'. However, many critics were still unfaithful to Lane and did not have faith that Diane would follow up her `Unfaithful' performance with another wondrous acting effort. Ms. Lane has proved wrong her pundits with her work in `Under the Tuscan Sun'. Diane plays a successful writer who relocates to Tuscan, Italy after her pernicious divorce. In Tuscan, she befriends several locals and gradually becomes the new `It' girl in Italy. Director Audrey Wells does a well job by implementing a non-formulaic tone to the narrative by inserting a `sunny side thumbs up' appeal. On the contrary, Wells underdeveloped the supporting characters. The only character worth caring for is Lane's `Frances'. All in all, `Under the Tuscan Sun' is Lane's show. She does definitely shine in `Under the Tuscan Sun'. *** Average",Under the Tuscan Sun
25,MBunge,"This is the sort of ""chick flick"" guys always complain about",4,19 October 2010,"Whenever guys complain about ""chick flicks"", Under the Tuscan Sun is exactly the sort of movie they're complaining about. It's long and aimless and saccharine with no discernible point other than to indulge sappy, feminine delusions. Films like this are the equivalent of pro wrestling for men, estrogen energized instead of testosterone fueled.Frances (Diane Lane) is a professor of literature and book reviewer who goes, literally within the first 3 minutes of the film, from content, upper-middle class, married urbanite to devastated, cash-strapped, divorced loser. Then her ex-husband buys her out of their home to make his new, pregnant girlfriend happy and Frances' gay best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) sends her on a tour of Tuscany. Once there, Frances decides to buy a villa and make a new life for herself amongst the predictably charming, colorful and wacky Italians and one British expatriate who used to know Fellini. So, Frances hires a crew of Polish workers to restore her villa, has random sex with an even more random guy, becomes den mother to pregnant Patti after her girlfriend walks out on her and even helps a young couple in love before The Almighty Plot Hammer grants Frances her own happy ending.Based on a non-fiction book by a woman who didn't get divorced but did move to Italy and restore an old villa, the best word to describe Under the Tuscan Sun iswell, it's really not a word. It's more like a cross between and exasperated sigh and a discomforted moan at all of the self-indulgently precious moments this movie shoves in your face like an over anxious girl working the perfume counter at a department store. No one in this movie acts like a real person. Frances is an everywoman sad sack surrounded by androids who've been programmed to either be quaint or mushily romantic. There's no particular rhyme or reason to what France does or what happens to here. It's just all supposed to be irresistibly charming. I found it very resistible.Diane Lane is a beautiful woman and a very talented actress, but looking at her in this film is like looking at a mentally handicapped girl who's drowning in a wading pool. You keep waiting for her to save herself and she never does. Lane does prevent Frances from becoming annoying and hits the right emotional notes when called upon. The story, however, puts that character on a treadmill that goes on and on and on. Watching Under the Tuscan Sun was one of the longest 113 minutes of my life. I looked up at the clock once, thinking it had to be almost done. I hadn't even been watching it for a half hour and it dragged on because none of the events in the story are connected to each other on any level. The British expatriate is obviously supposed to be some sort of model for Frances' new life in Italy, yet nothing the expatriate does mirrors and contrasts in a significant way what Frances does. You'd think that the ups and downs of rebuilding of the villa would in some way correspond to the ups and downs of Frances rebuilding her lifethey don't. Her abortive affair with a handsome Italian isn't anything more than an effort to get a PG-13 sex scene into the movie. It's just all scattered pabulum.I'm not one of those guys who can't stand romances or romantic-comedies on general principle. I've enjoyed plenty of those sorts of film. However, I can't imagine anyone with male genitalia enjoying this chore of a movie and that includes post-operative transsexuals.",Under the Tuscan Sun
26,Chris_Docker,like a gentle glass of wine,6,7 April 2004,"Leisurely, romantic and nicely written 'finding a new life' story of a writer emerging from a seriously bad divorce and, on impulse, buying a house in Tuscany. This will hardly keep you glued to the screen if you feel your attention wandering, but it has some lovely one-liners and may appeal to the nomadic and literary nature within you (if you have one). Frances (Diane Lane) starts a new life and is engagingly wooed by several Italian Lotharios. It isn't cheesy, but it isn't particularly deep either. I would love to retire to Tuscany, amidst the vineyards and olive groves, fireflies at night and the smell of summer between the sudden downpours - I just can't imagine Diane Lane there.",Under the Tuscan Sun
27,davispittman,A great job on lanes part,9,10 April 2016,"Under the Tuscan sun (2003), based on the book of the same title, is a sweet charming tale about love, sex, relationships, and other adult elements. Diane lane really shows her raw acting talent and shines as Francesca, and she interacts and works well with all her co-stars. Sandra Oh plays a great character here too, she is a great best friend to Lane, and is dramatic and funny at the same time. I also love the way they treated her as a lesbian, they didn't stereotype her to be a certain way just because she is a lesbian, she was just a normal character, which is refreshing to see. The script is well written and well thought out. The one sexual scene is filmed beautifully and is acted beautifully too by the two actors involved in it. It was not overly sexual or over the top raunchy, it was so elegant and romantic, and well lit as well. Marcello is good here too, his character is necessary to the movie overall, and he was well casted, the actor that played him is sexy, romantic, and charming, just how he needed to be. 9/10 overall, a very entertaining and well made film to enjoy.",Under the Tuscan Sun
28,rosscinema,Film has undeniable charm,6,3 October 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is a very old fashioned and predictable story but at the same time I do recommend it. Why? Basically the reason is why you would see it to begin with. The star of the film! Story is about a San Francisco writer named Frances (Diane Lane) who is recently divorced and her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) buys her a plane ticket to Tuscany, Italy so she can get away and regroup. While on the tour bus she spots a villa for sale and yells for the bus to stop. She gets off and goes to the villa to make an offer. She buys it but it needs to be fixed up so the real estate broker Martini (Vincent Riotta) recommends several people for the job. There are assorted locals and illegal Polish immigrants that are hired to renovate her villa and slowly Frances gets to know each one of them. She meets a local woman named Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) who keeps telling her to get on with her life and enjoy herself. One day Frances meets Marcello (Raoul Bova) and their is an immediate attraction between the two. They sleep together and Frances seems to be a new woman. Then Patti shows up and she's pregnant and her lesbian lover has dumped her. Frances tries to get together again with Marcello but both of them are always busy so one day Frances decides to surprise him at his place.*****SPOILER ALERT*****She discovers that Marcello has a new girlfriend and he explains that fate was not in their cards and she should not be upset. This film is directed by Audrey Wells and she has a good flair for female characters and by putting them in attractive surroundings. The story is very predictable and we have seen these characters before in other films. Most notably is Katherine who practically admits she acts out characters from Fellini films. At one point she wades into a fountain to recreate the famous scene from ""8 1/2"". I have always been a fan of Oh's but I did not understand why her character had to be a lesbian. It would have been the same role and performance if she were straight but I guess the filmmakers needed a lesbian to round out the cast of characters. And I did object to the ending of the film where this American male model type walks in out of nowhere to romance Frances. It was like the writers of this film could not allow the film to end without Frances meeting some guy. The film would have served it's purpose if it would have ended with Frances being okay with the fact that at this moment in her life she doesn't have someone. But for some reason Hollywood has to have the main character always meeting Mr. Right. It's a very contrived plot device that hurts the film. But I do recommend this film and it's because of the performance by Lane. She does an excellent job of making sure her character doesn't go to far overboard with the cliche's and she's always reminding us of the pain her character is carrying around with her. This film could have been predictable travelogue but Lane brings genuine depth to the character of Frances. Along with her performance and the beautiful scenery this film does overcome the flaws in the story. After viewing this film you might be inclined to make plans for a trip to Italy.",Under the Tuscan Sun
29,raulfaust,Unique,7,15 February 2013,"In a first moment we get to think it's gonna be one of those movies in which the main girl is sad, depressed and finds a prince riding a white horse. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" isn't that kind of movie. Frances is a divorced woman that travels to Italy, maybe to start a new life-- she doesn't actually know why she's leaving her home. Instead of finding a new man to marry, she finds some since people and develop a beautiful friendship with them. Don't get me wrong, she tries to find a man, but just like usually happens in real life, they end up in separate ways. Maybe that's the best point of this movie; showing that life isn't perfect and showing that one can find happiness even if not in a relationship. The plot isn't predictable at any time-- in fact, everything you try to guess you fail. There is no big achievement in the whole story, but it is a charming film for those who care about other people and how they connect to the world. Maybe a female audience will like it better.",Under the Tuscan Sun

They even managed to throw in some clichés about homosexuals just in case anyone needed a little extra patronizing. I have never been able to make it all the way through this disaster of a movie no matter how hard I tried. It's a mess on every level and even the scenery of Tuscany isn't enough to save it.I've always said that bad acting is the result of terrible directing and this film is a clinic of bad directing and terrible acting. How many stupid muggings can we watch of the protagonist expressing sadness, joy, pleasure, fear, surprise, disgust, or whatever? It's the director's responsibility to get what he or she wants and to instruct the actors. The best thing is to cut out all of the stupid and Completely obvious emotions and convey these things through dialogue whenever possible.The director lets her people run amuck in this thing. The English woman who appears like a phantom seems to be a female Liberace, and I don't mean that in a good way. She is simply another dumb stereotype of an eccentric, gentry-class denizen. Her lesbian friend is simply annoying. The three workers are paper-thin and wholely predictable at every turn.Ugh, I hated almost every scene in the film. She over-acts at almost every turn of the camera. Why did the director frame her face in so much of the film? Turn the sound off and watch this and I guarantee you will laugh yourself sick at the bad acting clinic she seems to be giving.The love angle in the movie was corny at best and embarrassing at worst and played like a teenage girl's rendering of how it should be.

32,MrGKB,"Might be Oprah-lite (or heavy, depending on your mood), but...",7,17 January 2007,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" manages to disguise most of its shortcomings with some out-and-out gorgeous Italian scenery and an effective (and affective) performance by Diane Lane, an actress that I must admit I have long coveted in the biblical sense, if not since ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains"" then certainly her explosion into prominence in ""The Outsiders,"" ""Rumblefish,"" ""Streets of Fire,"" and ""The Cotton Club."" One could watch this fairy tale of a film for no other reason than Ms. Lane's terrific work.I've never read the source material for ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" which is apparently a personal reminisce to which the film bears almost no resemblance, nor do I care to do so. A film should be appreciated on its own merits, and judged by its relevant standards. Audrey Wells' auteur effort succeeds in its simple task of emotional empowerment. The storyline is improbable yet alluringly convincing, an Oprah-ish tale of Frances, an aging writer/editor suddenly divorced, who a year later accepts a vacation in Tuscany, Italy, from friends and ends up impulsively buying a house there, trying to make a new life for herself. Of course, everything ends happily; it's a romantic comedy, not a romantic tragedy. The support acting is good, with special commendations to Sandra ""Grey's Anatomy"" Oh as the lesbian best friend and Vincent Riotta as Martini, Frances' Italian real estate agent and one of the many romantic red herrings in Wells' tale. Geoffrey ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" Simpson's cinematography is sumptuous, reveling in the lush beauty of the Italian countryside, while Christophe ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Beck's music hits the usual emotional chords without being too cloying. Production values are high all the way around; my kudos to all. Wells' dialogue is mostly on-target and occasionally quite observant, but then, the lady wrote ""George of the Jungle,"" so who's to say? Point being, I didn't find myself grimacing, but instead found myself grinning and occasionally moved to a sympathetic tear or two. Oh, and did I mention that Lane does a remarkable job of portraying a hurt woman in search of healing? She amply deserved her Golden Globes nomination.""Under the Tuscan Sun"" might not have a lot in the way of repeat viewability except for Lane fans, but at least it's a ""chick flick"" that doesn't beat you to death with ""issues."" It's mostly a pleasant romantic fantasy for middle-aged women and the men who might like to understand them.",Under the Tuscan Sun
33,CitizenCaine,Bask In The Glow Of This Delightful Film,9,19 January 2004,"Once in a while, a movie comes along with wonderful characters, a good script, and a star that fits seamlessly into the story as one of its characters. Diane Lane, coming off her Oscar nominated performance for Unfaithful, stars as newly divorced writer Frances Mayes in Under The Tuscan Sun, based on the novel/memoir by Frances Mayes. Lane offers a comedic, delightful, and sweetly touching performance as Mayes, whose book apparently differs significantly from this film. She travels to Tuscany on a whim and decides to purchase an old Italian house with accompanying olive trees to boot. While there, she faces the prospect of moving on with her life and discovers some truths about living along the way. Audrey Wells wrote and directed this splendid film, which is often referred to as a ""chick flick"". Indeed, there were 7 women sitting shoulder to shoulder a few rows in front of me in the theater. However, few films today, especially American films, offer this kind of quiet, special observance of life. The location filming in the Italian countryside was magnificent, offering beauty, charm, and warmth to spare. The supporting actors were all good, especially Lindsay Duncan as Katherine, a wise, free spirited, middle aged woman. She reminded me of the overweight town floozy in Fellini's Amarcord. The one that young boys had dreams about. Indeed, she even referred to working with Fellini in her youth when she offered advice to Frances. Fellini's films are full of life, its disappointments, its possibilities, its lessons, and rewards, just like Under The Tuscan Sun. Many reviewers complained that Lane's character whined and nothing much happened. However, there was plenty of introspective drama they were missing in the form of a woman's difficulties and heartaches with starting anew. Perhaps they were unable to identify with a character like that. Rarely do we get a chance to experience it with such honesty and sincerity. There were numerous subplots that touched Frances' life, including a Romeo and Juliet romance that might have been taking things a bit far. The film romanticized life, but it was never really maudlin. Audrey Wells is a sure-handed writer/director on her way up to providing better roles for female actresses. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Thats what happens when  accountants are turned loose making movies. But having said that, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes with some nice Italian atmosphere.

35,jluis1984,"Sappy and unrealistic, but still strangely charming...",7,22 January 2007,"Poet and writer Frances Mayes became a household name when in 1996 she published ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", a book where she detailed how she and her new lover bought and renovated an abandoned villa in Tuscany, Italy. With her stylish prose, she made the book something more than a mere diary of the renovation and turned into a captivating chronicle of her trips through Italy and her familiarization with the country's rich culture. The book's detailed account of Mayes' trips attracted director Audrey Wells, who used the book's story of the renovation of an Italian villa as a basis for this charming romantic comedy set in Tuscany and starring Diane Lane.Frances (Diane Lane) is a writer in her mid-30s currently suffering writer's block, but this is the lesser of her problems, as her husband suddenly decides to divorce her and as a result of legal issues, he keeps their house. Without a place to call home, Frances enters a state of depression, but her friend Patti (Sandra Oh) has a solution. Since Patti (who is a lesbian) has become pregnant, she and her partner offer Frances their tickets to Italy and convince her to take a holiday. While traveling through Tuscanny with the tour, Frances finds an abandoned villa for sale, and impulsively (and thanks to a series of consequences), she decides to buy it. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" details France's efforts to renovate the villa and her life at the same time, as well as her encounters with many interesting characters from the beautiful Italian region.Well, it is safe to point out that other than the tale of the renovation of an old house, Audrey Well's adaptation of the story has little to no resemblance to the book's plot. However, the way Wells mixes Mayes' Italian adventure with her character's own tribulations is almost perfect. True, the movie's plot is a bit typical and filled with some of the most common clichés in the romantic comedy genre, but it also offers some really nice (and unexpected) twists to the formula. While not exactly the detailed travelogue that Mayes' book is, this version of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" really captures the magic of the Italian region and accurately shows off bits of the country's culture despite the funny use of classic stereotypes.Director Audrey Wells takes a straight forward approach to her story, but wisely, takes full advantage of the location's awesome landscapes and the enormous talent of cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson. Together, Simpson and Wells create beautiful vistas of Italy's famous countryside that often mimic in a cleverly fashion some very well-known paintings of the same locations. The film's cinematography is definitely the movie's main asset, but it's not the only good thing in the film. While in terms of style Wells follows the romantic comedy formula somewhat to the letter, the movie is filled with a very human touch that most movies of this genre lack.Diane Lane is simply perfect as the movie's main character, as while the role may be a bit typical, she truly added her talents to the part and made Frances a very real and likable woman. Sandra Oh is good as Frances' best friend Patti, although really less convincing than Lane. Vincent Riotta is the film's highlight, as the helpful Mr. Martini who also gives two or three lessons to the stranger in a strange land. Lindsay Duncan appears as the strange Katherine, and plays an over-the-top character with dignity and charm. Overall the rest of the cast was very good, with everyone being perfect to the part although nothing really special. By the way, watch out for a small appearance of legendary director Mario Monicelli in a small role.It's impossible to compare the film to the book as they are both very different beasts, with very little in common; so fans of the book won't find a faithful adaptation despite the gorgeous images of Italy. As a film, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a very effective melodrama, as while it's certainly sappy and silly at times, it offers a breath of fresh air when compared to other similar films. True, it's story may not be the most original one, but the way it's executed it's strangely charming, as if the beautiful cinematography and witty script were able to cast a magic spell on the viewers and simply captivate with their simple beauty.It's easy to dismiss ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" as another silly romantic comedy filled with typical clichés and sappy situations; but while those descriptions often prove true to this film, there is something else, something more that this movie offers that makes it special, and a truly different experience to those used to watch the same plots in melodramas over and over. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" may not be true to its source book, but it uses it cleverly to tells a really charming story. 7/10",Under the Tuscan Sun

How could anyone be turned on by a man who bears no relation to reality? Don't answer that. I don't want to know. Anyway, this is supposed to be a chick flick, not Sci Fi.The lead is a woman wounded by her ex-husband, lost chances, and the specter of a wintry future. Diane Lane has a body a 20 year old would envy. She lacks gravitas. I couldn't feel for her plight. It's just not there on the ravaged face, the drooping body; she's too aerobicized and perky.""Tuscan Sun"" is as cluttered with gizmos girls are supposed to gush over as a Barbie doll house. There are swooning, adorable Polaks, goofy young lovers, a pregnant lesbian best friend.There are close-ups of yummy Italian food and unbelievably adorable people having big dinner parties. Everyone is adorable. Even grandma, with her internet love affair with a minor. It's so cute you really wish that at least one of the characters were serial killer.Everyone has tons of money and can fly between San Francisco to Italy without a moment's care. Frances, the lead character, lives a life completely divorced from normal monetary concerns. This sounds like a fantasy but it comes across as creepy. ""Does this woman ever work? Does money mean anything to her?"" These questions become so annoying, and distasteful, that you are taken out of the movie.For a movie that got similar themes very right, check out David Lean's 1955 ""Summertime,"" starring Katharine Hepburn and Rosano Brazzi. You love their on screen romance, but you see that she is imperfect, and he is, too. ""Summertime"" is just as visually beautiful as ""Tuscan Sun,"" but it provides an artistic experience that ""Tuscan Sun"" can't even aspire to.I didn't much like this movie but I did like the actor playing Martini, the realtor who helped Diane Lane with so many things, including -- paging Dr. Freud -- a snake she could not find in her bedroom.There was a real chemistry between the two. He wasn't the most handsome man in the movie, or the most sexually dynamic, but he was the one, I think, that most viewers probably wanted to see her end up with.He was married. But this is a movie. You have two characters with such great chemistry; you could make his wife a harridan, or a lesbian -- not enough Italian lesbian movie characters out there -- or maybe she received a vocation from God and entered a convent.

In the face of adversity with her divorce, she is appropriately upset and doesn't vie for the Oscar by going over the top  her subtlety is one of the things that made this film a `watchable travelogue/chick flick' for me.  The other element that made this film enjoyable was Tuscany itself.  Almost becoming a character on its own, the scenery was drop-dead gorgeous.There are more than a couple of criticisms that I have about the film  the ease with which things happen in the film, the hollow characters (with the exception of the fun best friend, Patty) and some loose ends that didn't get tied up.  On the plus side, I actually like how the film ended  I wish that more films of this genre would take note.Generally, I liked it.  There's a lot that I would have changed, but not as much as most films of this type.

41,lawprof,Diane Lane is Brighter Than the Tuscan Sun,9,28 September 2003,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a polarizing film that seems to leave viewers (and critics) either in love with a story of growth and renewal or dismissive of its line.  I'm firmly in the former camp.Based so loosely on Frances Mayes's own account of her regeneration in beautiful Italy as to carry an end credit pronouncing that substantial fictionalization replaced key true details, writer and director Audrey Wells crafted a stunning vehicle for Diane Lane whose radiance projects from the screen powerfully. And in every scene.Diane Lane, as the changed-from-the-memoir Frances, abandons San Francisco after her never shown cad husband divorces her, getting the house she once loved.  Frances is a writer and literary critic.  Why does she leave S.F.? Two of her closest friends give her a ticket for a gay bus tour of Italy and she jumps off the bus to look into a ramshackle old country house up for sale.  Impetuosity?  Definitely.  Believable?  Yes, actually.
Frances' new house isn't a handyman's special, it's a contractor's assurance of food on the table for a very long time.  Frances adapts to the house and the locals with remarkable aplomb.  Tuscany is sunny but its light fades before Frances's challenged but resilient commitment to not just restore a house but to create a home.  The two aren't the same. I'm not sure how many male directors could so well create that reality.Director Wells tells the story from a woman's heart but with a breadth of humor and drama that should appeal to anyone who wants to believe, or needs to hope, that there really is a light at the end of the tunnel of marital infidelity and dissolution.  Supporting Diane Lane is Sandra Oh as Patti, her closest friend.  In relatively short scenes, Ms. Oh displays a lively and laconic grasp not only of her friend's life but also of her own which is not, as they say today, devoid of ""issues.""Lindsay Duncan is Katharine, an older woman determined to hold on to her now fading attractiveness through a blend of humor, earthiness - and alcohol. Her character may be predictable but she's also fun.Raoul Bova has garnered some press attention as handsome Marcello, the romantically available and affluent Italian.  That's a character we've seen in many, many films and Bova delivers an expectedly satisfactory but hardly deep performance.Yes, Diane Lane is beautiful but there is much more to her acting than a shining appearance.  Her facial gestures, mirroring her emotions as they shift from moment to moment, are the product of extraordinary acting ability.  And her character draws a powerful portrayal.Credit also must go to cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson.  Perhaps it would be impossible for a blind camera director to turn in anything but a gorgeous visage of rural and urban Italy but Simpson did do a marvelous job of making the locales come alive.This is a film for adults, for people who can understand pain and the search for recovery and understand the difficulty of coming back from a space that once offered the mirage of safety and security.I loved this film.9/10.",Under the Tuscan Sun

She is natural, unforced, and very believable. The supporting cast is also good with the exception of a few unnecessary and sometimes annoying subplot characters like some of the Polish workers and Raoul Bova (who is definitely good looking, but far too young and 'soapy' in order to be credible in such a film).

45,B24,"The book, the movie, etc.",6,19 June 2005,"One pleasant aspect of having read a previous review of this film by some professional critic -- then having decided to avoid it because it was purportedly not true to the original story -- is that when I did give it a try on rerun TV I sort of liked it.True, it is if nothing else a woman's movie, filled with sentimental clichés and other oddly familiar images. But the cinematography is quite appealing, as are those odd images reminiscent of just about every American-goes-to-(you name the European country)-and-finds-(romance, thrills, the meaning of life,etc.) film ever made.Apart from its travelogue flavor, there are just enough scenes involving adequate direction and acting to keep the thing from falling by the wayside, and the casting is jolly. I quite liked Sandra Oh in her part, and ""Pavel"" is obviously a caricature of the young John Paul II. Then there are the hilarious and rather tongue-in-cheek reminders of Fellini. One wonders if the author is making fun of herself just a bit, given that the book from which all this started is so much more serious, complex, and engaging.",Under the Tuscan Sun
46,chron,Ok Film that Fails to Completely Pay Off,6,4 April 2004,"I enjoy Diane Lane's performances.  This was the major motivation for selecting this film.  The plot sounded interesting.  A recent divorcee goes on a trip to Tuscany, only to buy a villa on a whim.The movie thankfully avoids a typical, cliche Hollywood plot, but at the same time, it doesn't move in a direction that I found to be ultimately satisfying.  The Lane character does undergo some changes as the plot proceeds, but the supporting cast of characters aren't developed to the point that they need to be.  In spite of that, it was an enjoyable movie.  The Tuscan scenery is quite beautiful and the acting is well done, but not exceptional in any way.

The colors of the movie, the sun, the color of her hair, the photography is just gorgeous. I love those stories, because, although  it seems common place, there are people starting their lives over every minute. It encourages people in such situation. The wardrobe is great, Tuscany, is great. We are planning on going there on our next vacation. I have had great experiences with Italian people. They are very generous people. It also helps when one understands both languages in a movie, without having to read the sub-titles. I am now watching the news in Italian just getting ready for my trip. After you watch the movie you will feel the same way. Sandra Oh ( `The Princess Diary,' `Brake a Leg,' )'Patti' is a great comic release.  Liked her a lot! Again her part is great role for a woman. There has been a small  but very notable change in the roles for women in Hollywood. I find that the ones aging gracefully are getting great parts! Look at Diane Keaton in `Something's Gotta Give,'  it is great to see her without a face lift being nominated  for and winning awards. Same with Meryl Streep ( `One True Thing') she is getting good parts. I am not against plastic surgery when in moderation. Lovely movie, very enjoyable experience.",Under the Tuscan Sun

50,ilovedolby,How many more movies do we need about a woman struggling with a divorce and then finding her spirit after a time? The whole thing is just too damn Oprah!,5,19 September 2003,"`Under The Tuscan Sun' is the new film from director Audrey Wells (`Guinevere') who also wrote the screenplay based on the book by Frances Mayes. The first thing that comes to mind about this film is that we've seen this concept in so many other places-it's almost hard to stomach sitting through this nonsense over and over. How many more movies do we need about a woman struggling with a divorce and then finding her spirit after a time? The whole thing is just too damn Oprah! Having not read the book, I can't make a comparison to the story. However, undoubtedly the book is better than the film. The world of the imagination is infinite and with words an author can create images, analogies, flashbacks and ideas that are lost when filmmakers try to translate the film to the screen. Such was the case with `Where The Heart Is,' which was a superb book from author Billie Letts, but the film lacked any depth that the book encompassed. `Under The Tuscan Sun' tells the story of Frances Mayes (Diane Lane), a woman who after a bitter divorce, is persuaded by her friends to take a vacation in Tuscany, Italy. At first, Frances rejects her friend's proposal because she doesn't want to meet other single men. Much to her chagrin, it's a gay tour of Tuscany. Frances finds herself away from her pressures at home, enjoying the freedom of her vacation when she comes across an ad for a villa that is for sale while shopping in a marketplace. When she finds the home, she persuades the owner to sell her the house, which she does in a matter of minutes with little collateral on Frances's part. Nonetheless, Frances finds herself alone in Italy with a house, like her, in desperate need of repair. With the help of her neighbors, the townspeople and a good friend from home who comes to live with her named Patti (Sandra Oh), Frances realizes that life is an ever changing process in which we can find happiness in the most unlikely of places. Lane is a very gifted actress whose talents rate her as one of Hollywood's finest leading ladies. However, it's her choice of films that keep her out of the real critical and award spotlight. She often performs in films that are below par. If she wants to prove herself a great actress, she needs to start making films with real depth to them. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in `Unfaithful;' fortunately, Hollywood denied her the award-what a hideous world it would be if an actress received an award for faking orgasms! Oh provides a surprisingly good performance in a film that is less than great. She has been well received on the stages of London in `Oleanna.' Also, in Canada for her role on the television film `The Diary of Evelyn Lau.' Having been in the films `Big Fat Liar,' and `Full Frontal,' Oh has proven herself an engaging actress to watch for the flare and emotion that she brings to the screen. Easily the best part of `Under The Tuscan Sun' rests in the shots of beautiful Italy despite the fact that there's nothing particular impressive about the film's cinematography. Regardless, the shots of Italian landscapes, villages, sunsets and sunrises are absolute eye candy that leaves the audience begging for more. Ultimately `Under The Tuscan Sun' flops not because of its performances, but because its lack of originality, and simple writing from Wells.

51,zfiany,Attractive!,6,18 November 2009,It's a story about how people who want things badly rush themselves into experiences that are worse than their previous ones. It's a good movie with several deep messages. The movie also has a certain atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are in Tuscan on a trip yourself. I have to disagree with the view that says you need to be in love to enjoy the movie. All what you need is some depth and you will definitely relate to the protagonist. She happens to be healing from a failing marriage but you can relate to her story if you are dealing with any kind of problems in your life.There is one specific part of the movie which I truly like is the one where she defends the love story of a young couple though she was hurt. This shows that even though she failed she didn't cease to believe in love. She succeeded in going out of the egocentricity of a person who usually hates good for people if his life is not working successfully.,Under the Tuscan Sun
52,FilmSnobby,Disappointing.,2,29 March 2004,"One spring not too long ago I spent almost a month in Tuscany, roving between Florence and Lucca and Pisa.  It was one of the most glorious periods of my life.  And I've had a crush on Diane Lane for about 20 years (and counting).  Therefore, I was willing to put aside the  ""chick-flick"" warning label that was attached to  *Under the Tuscan Sun*.  If one loves Tuscany and Diane Lane, how bad could this movie be?Pretty bad.  It's almost as gender-exclusionary, in its own way, as a Jean-Claude Van Damme picture.  Guys, you're not invited.  The men in this flick are  1) Heartless adulterers  2) Harmless teenagers  3) Gay  4) Womanizers  5) Unseen seed-purveyors to trendily pregnant lesbians  6) Laborers reminiscent of Curly, Moe, & Larry  7) Judgmental, Capulet-type fathers  8) Ill-tempered old men . . . need I go on?  Even the writers depicted here -- guys who'd presumably be more  ""sensitive"" -- are jerks. The movie is a feast for manhaters.  Women, it seems, are the only creatures on two legs capable of inner depth.  Have fun, gals:  save this movie for a slumber-party replete with Chardonnay and chocolate, or whatever the hell it is y'all do when we're seeking refuge elsewhere.Meanwhile, the filmmakers clearly missed some great opportunities. Apparently the movie is based on a book by someone named Frances Mayes, whose autobiographical account detailed the travails and joys of buying and renovating an old Tuscan agriturismo.  It seems to me that these details alone would provide plenty of cinematic material, without having to resort to inept chick-flick cliches.  Do we really need to see yet another Italian stallion  ""loosen up""  a frigid and/or unhappy middle-aged American and/or British lady?  Must we endure Fellini references . . . again?  How long, oh Lord, how long?Deepening the disappointment, the cinematographer insists on obscuring the intense colors of the local countryside with peach-toned camera filters. Not that there's much to obscure:  for a movie with such a great setting, we see very little of it, and instead are marooned indoors while Lane suffers loneliness or pursues love interests.  And while this movie is supposed to be anesthetizing entertainment  (rather like  *Colombo*  reruns), questions intrude, such as:  how can Lane afford all this, anyway?  how'd she get around Italy's Byzantine visa regulations?  and surely the pushing-60 local blonde who purports to have known Fellini is a figment of Lane's imagination and not a real character, right?  Well, never mind:  the movie is saved from desolation primarily by the beauty and talent of Lane, as well as by the surprising amount of depth that Sandra Oh brings to an otherwise trite role.",Under the Tuscan Sun

If it's missed..no great shakes.The Tuscan scenery is certainly lovely but so would be Tuscan scenery in National Geographic. The story line is ""eh..""

Going home for a weekend to see my parents and my sister, I really had no objection to seeing this movie. Like the old saying goes, ""Don't knock it until you try it,"" because some movies may surprise you. Well, Under the Tuscan Sun didn't really do that for me.This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think my mom and sister enjoyed it, particularly the joke about the ""butt facial toilet."" My dad and I chuckled, but we weren't really bowled over. The scenery was pretty nice, and I imagine this movie is great for people that either want to go to Italy or have fond memories of vacations there. I didn't fit in any of those categories, so that wasn't much of a big deal to me.Really, the only redeeming factor for me in this movie was Diane Lane. She is definitely one of the most beautiful actresses around. I think I can watch her in about anything. No matter how bad the movie may be, as long as Diane Lane was in it, that movie wouldn't be a complete loss!In conclusion, I don't feel I can slam this movie too harshly, because I am definitely not its target market.

56,przgzr,"Different is just different, not hostile, pervert or wrong",6,22 December 2007,"This is a movie made for Hallmark & similar TV fans, but this doesn't have to mean that it isn't worth looking.A whole story has one woman in the middle, all other characters are there to fill the story and make things happen. Some of them are interesting, but almost nothing happens to them and they don't seem to change. They, however, help the female hero Frances to change, not too much, just to adjust to new circumstances.But that's not a little thing because these new circumstances are very different: small town in middle Italy couldn't be more unlike San Francisco even if aliens were walking along its streets. Though ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" stays rather superficial (using lots of stereotypes), we must admit that it shows three important things: different cultures are indeed different, different doesn't necessarily mean evil, pervert or hostile, and third and most important, if you try, you can adjust and be accepted.The movie stays on the level of entertainment and doesn't try to analyze these differences, concentrating on troubles with renovating an old house and on love problems instead. But behind this plot every ordinary (even less attentive) viewer can see how this culture with its traditions looks strange to Frances. And we must praise authors for not taking any side, what is so unusual in 21st century movies. If we only read IMDb boards, we can see how far this America-Europe antagonism can go. In fact it is good that movie with such peaceful messages was made for ordinary audience, so the way of life in other's countries wouldn't always be watched over an aim and condemned as wrong and immoral. (Unfortunately, it is very unlike that anyone who uses aims might ever try to watch this movie.) ""Shogun"", ""1492"", ""Gods Must Be Crazy"", ""Rabbit-proof Fence"" go to near or far history and show differences among cultures of different races. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" shows that in global village of 21st century, even in cultures of one race that are connected for hundreds of years, differences still exist.

59,fred-houpt,This sun warms the heart,9,19 January 2005,"A friend of mine urged me to take this film out to watch. I did and am very glad I was given the tip. First of all it is true that there is little unique in the story line. It's all been done before. Fine. However, in our jaded North American lives, so many of us struggle to find meaning and value in our daily life and so naturally we are attracted to escapist fantasy. That is where this movie hit's a home run. The story line is hokey but after a while we don't care. We are attracted to the main character as she tries to heal her pains and somehow find a clear meaning to her life. The real winner in this film is the simply jaw dropping beauty of the land. I have not seen such deliciously opulent colors, such ravishing landscapes in so long all I could do was to hold myself back from buying a ticket on the internet to get to over to Tuscany on the next red-eye. The characters are often hilarious, touching, obviously very Italian or European in their presentation. There is the flamingly sexy Leslie Duncan who cannot help but light up the screen with her aura of off-center body language and great hats. Diane Lane transforms herself as the film evolves into a reborn babe and who cannot but share in her heartbreak when her Italian lover tells her that it ain't going any further.This is simply wonderful fantasy with so much to please the eye, so much to fill the heart.

And/ or read the Elizabeth von Arnim novel.2nd, if you like Diane Lane and think she can act when she tries and/ or has a good script, don't even think about watching this. She comes across as a whining & simpering TV actress. She's so much better than this dreck.3rd, if what you do want is reinforcement that all men are dicks and prefer younger women to their warm, loving, caring, wonderful, giving, supportive, wives - watch and wallow in ""The First Wives Club"".4th, if you want a shallow and superficial (and so very condescending) summary of what it would be like to make believe you weren't rich in Tuscany, read Mayes' book. If you don't find Martha Stewart trivial, you may well enjoy this book. It's for anyone and everyone who LOVE the common-folk, when they keep a good distance that is. But those Italians with their cute little hand gestures - as adorable as kittens. Think of a book by Demi Moore about the rigors of her pioneer life at her Idaho ranch.Mayes and her new lover purchased an Italian villa and renovated it. Director Audrey Wells said the movie is ""loosely based on Mayes' book"". ""Loosely"" as it's about a woman who goes to Italy, buys an old house, does some cooking & gardening? There isn't much else in common. Wells adapted, wrote the screenplay, produced, directed. We 1st see how Frances (Lane) gets screwed on her divorce by a jerk-off husband who uses CA law to his advantage - poor Frances. Just when it couldn't be worse, turns out the younger new woman wants the house (renovated with Frances' mother's money) and Frances has to pay alimony because she supported her husband .... So unfair. So TV.Frances moves to an apt w/ manifold folks other who are getting divorced. The guy next door sobs incessantly. Everything reminds her of how depressed she is. I looked at the credits to see if it was a teleplay.Wells then inserts a gay subplot (Frances' best friend; the trip to Italy is via tickets for a tour with ""Gay & Away""). That's Wells' business but it has nothing to do with the Italian trip. It's just a reminder of how ""good"" certain kinds of men can be. Most of us think that gay men are good friends with women but if you didn't know that the guide announces to the bus that Frances just had an awful divorce and really needs their support. Which the give and give. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.Frances leaves the bus, buys the villa, is scared by insects & a snake, finds a comical group of contractors, prepares some Martha Stewart meals, watches love bloom in others, meets and loses an smooth Italian guy. You never have to think either. Before you even get close to thinking, a character comes in to explain exactly what everyone is feeling. ""Love? Love is just at the beginning. it doesn't last. You're stuck with what's left"". So insightful. And fresh. Wow spelled backwards is woW.My favorite part of the movie was seeing them drive around on empty or low-traffic roads in Italy.

61,dwr246,Homage to Second Chances,8,22 May 2006,"When life gives lemons, make lemonade. Or so the saying goes. This film shows just how palatable that lemonade can be.Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) is a successful writer and teacher, who finds that her marriage is ending in a most unkind way, when a writer she gave a bad review to lets slip that her life is about to take the plot of his book which she panned. Shortly thereafter, we see Frances in the office of her divorce attorney (Jeffrey Tambor), who convinces her that she should allow her husband to buy her out of their house. She does, and moves into an apartment building full of divorcées who are just as unhappy as she is. Her friends, Patti (Sandra Oh) and Grace (Kate Walsh) decide that she needs a change of scenery, and after some convincing, send her on a trip to Tuscany. Once there, she starts getting signs that she should stay, and buys a crumbling villa to start a new life in. Her new life does not start smoothly, however, and she wonders if she has done the right thing. She tells her realtor, Martini (Vincent Riotta), that the house should have a wedding in it, and children, and people to fill the bedrooms and cook for, but she has none of that. What if she doesn't get those things? In her search for them, she finds Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a wise old protégé of Federico Fellini, adopts a group of Polish contractors, helps one of them, Pawel (Pawel Szajda) to wed Chiara (Giulia Steigerwalt), the daughter of her neighbors (Roberto Nobile and Anita Zagaria), provides a place for Patti to raise her daughter after Grace deserts her, and has her own unsuccessful romantic entanglement with Marcello (Raoul Bova). At Pawel and Chiara's wedding, which she hosts at her villa, Martini tells her that she has gotten everything she wished for. But Tuscany still manages to provide her with one more thing to make her life complete.It's a feel good story, there's no doubt about it. And to that end, it overlooks a lot of the impracticalities of the situation, namely that Frances doesn't speak Italian, or Polish, or that she doesn't seem terribly worried about money, even though she's spending an awful lot of it, or should be. However, the practicalities of the arrangement are not what's important in this film. What is important is Frances' healing process, and heal she does, with wonderful results.This is a well acted film. Lane carries the film with ease, giving us a believable portrait of a woman who overcomes bitterness which at times seems insurmountable. Oh gives a great turn as the helpful friend, who needs some help herself. Riotta is delightful as the compassionate realtor. Bova is wonderful as the smitten Italian who can't wait for Frances' life to sort itself out. Stegierwalt and Szajda are delightful as the young lovers, and Nobile and Zagaria are believable as the disapproving parents. Duncan's performance is charming. And David Sutcliffe turns in a nice performance in a small part as France's love interest at the end of the film.Admittedly, it gets a bit far fetched at times, but the story telling is delightful, the cinematography wonderful, and the acting good enough that you really care about that.

There's nothing here that isn't hugely predictable, but the characters -- including the Tuscan villa that Frances buys on impulse -- are so intricately drawn and played with such good humor that it doesn't matter. It is also easy to forget to ask how a recent divorcée that just lost her house and got whacked with an alimony buy-out can afford to speculate on real-estate and employ a renovation crew for months. So what when you have what is probably the most picturesque community in the world as a backdrop.Diane Lane looks about half her age, congratulations to her.

64,mirkobozic,A festival of stereotypes,3,22 November 2017,"""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a cheesy flick about Diane Lane's recovery from a divorce trauma by moving to a small town in Tuscany and restoring a local house, creating a liberal oasis within a conservative community. Regarding the movie, it's hard to say where to start. You got all your Italian stereotypes neatly lined up as if on a museum shelf: the beautiful scenery (every scene is a postcard), the food (it seems every grandma is a Michelin- star chef in this country), the uber-conservative town (just because you're a Catholic doesn't imply you're not open-minded), the gorgeous men who are just after flings (if you walk into any place filled with locals you're more likely to run into average-built or stocky people), and on and on. Apart from trying to spice things up a bit, the reason for including Sandra Oh's pregnant lesbian is beyond me. And if this is not cheesy enough for you, Lane ends up with an American writer (who just happens to earn so much money he can show up at your villa in Italy at any time), after the director has given minimum time to actually elaborate the development of the relationship. We don't see any downsides of living in Italy, like the horrible bureaucracy and public service, the bankrupt economy of the South or treatment of minorities. This way, it seems as if the Italian Ministry of Tourism paid for a Hollywood production-style ad campaign for Tuscany. As we all know that Lane is capable to pull of serious roles, this should be treated primarily as eye-candy, since it's disappointing in all other categories.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Since that describes about one in a million people, the movie is more of a middle-class fairy tale about renewing your life after a divorce than anything else. There are some small parts that work: the scene in the divorce lawyer's office, the scene where Frances makes an attempt to do some rehab work, the scene where she revels in her reawakened sexuality, the fact that her personal rehabilitation doesn't hang solely on her next romance. What especially works is Lane's performance. She plays Frances with Grace-Kelly class, a believable equanimity in the face of being on her own in an unfamiliar culture.But her composure doesn't outweigh some of the major absurdities the movie requests the audience to believe: a small, ragtag crew of semi-skilled laborers who become ever more lovable as they competently do a complete rehab a 300-year-old villa; the jilted pregnant lesbian pal who shows up unannounced and fits in joyously and seamlessly into the household, the world's nicest realtor who spends half his free time being Frances' emotional support.In addition, the gorgeous Tuscan countryside and Amalfi coast can't make up for the lack of credibility in character development. At key points, people, especially Frances, are different, all right  more in love, more mature, more relaxed  but it's not clear how people got from point A to point B. The movie simply asks the audience to accept the changes.Under the Tuscan Sun is a pleasant enough way to kill a few hours, but as a story of rebuilding one's life, it's a few bricks shy of a load.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Sure it has some parts where you say ""how is that possible?"" but anyways, a movie is not meant to be realistic, it helps us to dream..Well the movie is about Fran (Diane Lane), who's going through a tough divorce and is feeling completely miserable about it. Then her friends buy her a tour to go to Tuscany, and of course, she goes. After a while she feels so enchanted by it's magic, that she decides to buy a house there. The whole movie almost starts from that point, she'll meet a lot of people who will change her life forever indeed.I liked the performances, Diane Lane is funny and serious when she has to be, I thought she did a great job. Everybody else in the cast does a great job as well. And the landscaping is gorgeous, I'd say that's another character of the movie.Anyways this movie has a couple of twists (can't find another way to call it) and it's very entertaining, so rent it or better yet, buy it!

68,CutUncut2021,"Pitter-patter, pinder-pander",7,16 January 2021,"Sure, it often makes you cringe and is packed with stereotypes and classic tropes of Italy and the Old Continent, but these are aptly pointed out in the exchange between Frances and Marcello on the beach: this is what we Europeans expect of you Americans, and vice-versa. It's the kind of film that garners 300+ reviews of course because it panders to the New World's longing for history and tradition, while anchoring its film legacy in actors a tad too pretty instead of the plainness of reality. Such pandering tends to derail the story with its trite maxims. Florence, Montepulciano (San Biagio!) and Positano, ivy, scorpions and snakes, olives and lines of cypresses, migrant labourers in love, what could go wrong. One feature that will elude the foreign viewer is the presence of Mario Monicelli (the old guy leaving flowers every day), a director equal to if not greater than the cited Fellini (Féfé). The film dates from before the 2008 economic collapse, the multiple disasters of 2016, and the current plague. Nice to look back and dream. In the wake of pointless killings of black youth, the director Audrey Wells later came down to earth and wrote the screenplay for the brilliant ""The Hate U Give"", a far superior product, but we should be grateful anyway for this uber-romantic outing. Thanks to all those involved.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Sure enough, it didn't disappoint!  What a story of triumph over circumstances! The lush Italian scenery, the colorful characters, the Romeo-and-Juliet romance between a lovely Italian girl and a Polish laborer - breathtaking! Loved the Italian grandma - she saved the day for her granddaughter by her testimony.  Sandra Oh did an incredible job, but the true credit for this picture goes to Diane Lane - what a beautiful smile she has.  She was perfect for this role.  My recommendation?

I am convinced the lesbian couple and the gay tour bus were an attempt to draw an even larger viewing audience by playing on the sensitivities of gays and lesbians. Both premises were so blatant and evident that they came close to killing the entire film. Without the scenic background and the remaining cast, most movies would have been doomed. Sandra Oh was atrocious in this film and her character as Patti does not seem a reasonable fit as a close friend of Frances (Diane Lane).Aside from the above detractions, this was a very enjoyable film with excellent casting and acting.

She falls for him after consummating an afternoon of love making. She later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her.Bash Number Four : You have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie. Her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (SP?) fertilization. I am told that in most lesbian relationships, you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role.

Yes, despite stiff competition from the natural surroundings, LANE's face is not just the witness to beauty but also the thing itself in this stunning-looking film. Chalk it all up to prettiness, if you like, but Lane's case has more to do with spirit -- with warmth and emotional readiness, plus a kind of open-book quality that makes her both lovely and comical, usually at the same time.

In ""UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN"" DIANE LANE really comes into her own. It is an amazing performance that won her tons of acclaim, awards AND a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. DIANE LANE's performance as a woman who recovering from a traumatic divorce and has to try to rebuild her life is an absolute powerhouse star turn, and she is nicely supported by a good cast of quirky and very funny characters. The film itself is very well made with lots of subtlety and style. It is funny, sexy, entertaining and very enjoyable.

80,MoonsofJupiter,Too long and too illogical,1,15 February 2004,"Unavoidable spoilers!I like a romantic comedy as much as the next moviewatcher, but this one had so many dumb things about it that I couldn't ignore them and enjoy the story.  I don't even know where to begin, but I'll give it a try.Pains are taken to impress upon us that Frances, the leading lady, doesn't have much money after her loser husband takes half the house plus alimony. Well, fine, but when she goes to Italy she suddenly becomes independently wealthy, first buying a villa then employing three Polish workers full-time to restore the place.  They were there the entire duration of the movie, which covered at least 8 or 9 months.  Wardrobe?  She arrived with one suitcase, but never wore the same thing twice after that.  We see Frances tapping absently at the laptop occasionally and I suppose we're supposed to imagine she's reviewing a book...I wish I could get on that payroll.Italian stereotypes?  You want it, you got it.  Crazy old contessa who takes bird poop on the forehead of a stranger as a sign to sell her the prized villa.  Okay, whatever, even though she would have gotten more money from the German couple who had first dibs.  Suave love-em and leave-em Romeos? All over the place.  Simple, good-hearted locals happy to pick your olives for you?  A whole villageful.  And then the biggest problem of all: Diane Lane's performance.  How could an actress who was so good in Unfaithful be so bad this time?  She twitched and grimaced like a female Hugh Grant, using delayed reaction goggle-eyes instead of emotion.  The self-grabbing congratulatory dance she did in her bedroom after scoring with her young stud was painful to watch.  Another awful scene was when Patti came back pregnant and abandoned and lay in the bed crying.  Diane Lane's face was vacant, with a fake little soap opera frown of concern on her brow and a simpering smile on her mouth.  Awful, and inexcusable of the director to leave that shot in.And all of this was just too long, with so many little unnecessary scenes that we didn't need.  And what about that Tuscan sun we were promised? There were virtually no shots of the hot passionate sun of Italy, which would at least have helped to explain the crazy behaviour going on all around.  And after all that poor Frances ends up with a goofy-looking failed American writer, while all that prime Italian beefcake goes to waste.

82,Sees All,Women's fantasy amid gorgeous scenery,5,4 October 2003,"This is primarily a film for women.  I think most men will find it silly. Basically it's the story of a wealthy woman who divorces her unfaithful husband (to whom she has to pay alimony, which seemed farfetched to me) and moves to Italy with seemingly no hassles from immigration. The film is politically correct to the nth degree, with the heroine's best friend a pregnant lesbian played by an Asian actress no less.  The women are clever and warm; the men are mostly ineffectual, despite their bluster.  The heroine has a lot of angst over not having had sex recently, but seemingly has an endless parade of attractive younger men making passes at her. It's all farfetched, but harmless.  There's nothing terribly original about it, but the Italian scenery is gorgeous, the photography and music are nice and the cast is attractive.

Oops, there he is, Raoul Bova in person, a dead ringer for Rudolph Valentino!........... From bad to worse, I would say. We'll jump out of the frying pan into the fire. Okay,okay, let's get down to brass tacks: I'm kidding, you know, but I'm tired of looking at the whole shebang of old-fashioned stereotypes about Italian people, depicted as ""caricaturable spaghetti eaters"", ""mandolin players"", ""Latin seducers"" and so on, always ready to play for the hypocritical saga: ""volemose bbene"" (let's love each other) the leading role of easy-going merry fellows, always prone to laxism, feeling at their ease as small time seducers, giving their easy kisses as untrue love tokens to condescending tourists always on the edge of a crisis of sex abstinence, together with big hugs underlined by a light breeze near ruffling sea waves. Having had the bad luck of reading Tim Parks' ""Italian Neighbours"" as well, a book full of conversational commonplaces, that's what I would call ""cheaply folklore"" lavished by handfuls ""like a spring of gushing water"". Much to my regret, I must admit that the ""homo italicus"" is sometimes considered synonym of ""tarallucci e vino"" (small biscuits & wine), a misleading portrait connected with unavoidable and obsolete Neapolitan songs with mandolin accompaniment full of superficiality and carelessness. In my opinion it's useless to examine the movie from a cultural standpoint; please, don't sell me this medley of commonplaces as ""poeticity"" because there's nothing artistic in it. What a pity for the beautiful and willing Diane Lane who does her best to look pleasant and to be equal to the task! Her character faces life with serenity in search of opportunities, heedless of the potential danger of love at first sight. She's looking for a safe anchorage in difficult times as if she were on the point of slipping on the banana peel of life, devoted to Marcello, her Latin male lover, a guy with a deadpan voice that puts me to sleep, not comparable to Edward 'Ed' Sumner, but more reassuring than the stalker Jack Price (the thriller addicts know the guys I'm talking about).But to make a long story short, has anybody seen this Tuscan sun in the movie?

If only the screenwriter/director/producer had gotten the point. Enthusing about picturesque Italians and Italian landscapes is no substitute for a story with characters who actually struggle with decisions and actually change in the process. That isn't to say that the movie doesn't try to show its hero changing, but those changes turn out to be pretty shallow and utterly predictable.Would anyone have made this movie (or paid good money to see it) if our hero had been named Francis and his life-changing discovery is that he should forget his ex, move to Italy, and live in a big house in a small community with his old and new friends around him?

90,bzb2001,Recycled yet superior story,10,23 December 2004,"Audrey Wells' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is generally not the type of film I look forward to. Even your average, forgettable romantic-comedy is filled with sappy, melodramatic overtones and over the top acting from Hollywood's best (paid) and brightest (jewelry). But from the previews you could tell that this film wanted to be more.The story, alone, is different from most simple dating flicks. A middle-aged author (Diane Lane) ventures to Italy after a messy divorce and a creative drought. There she hopes to rekindle her life and hopefully her passions.As one would assume, she is met with culture shock. She doesn't know the language or the customs. Though there is distinguished beauty to the land, there are also torrential thunderstorms and a visiting owl perched on her nightstand. Not what she is used to from her native San Francisco. The people seem friendly enough, but they are all driven by a perceived universal understanding that she does not share.The villa she purchases is indeed beautiful, but it is also old and in need of repair - much like herself. She begins renovating the house and the plaster and rock become a metaphor for her own growth in the new region.Much of what I have described seems like items we have experienced before in movies. And many are. But never do they seem over-used or washed up. Lane brings a melancholy charm to the role that could easily have fallen into emotional wrought or intense bitchiness. Instead, we follow her through Tuscany dreading and cheering her choices; loving and sympathizing with her.Throughout the film there is a warm, self-deprecating humor that is both funny and human. The supporting characters have fully enriched lives of their own and are not just crutches for the primary plot. Much of the story is about love, wallowing in it, shining in it, wishing for it. But the story descends much deeper into the purpose for one's life and the need for companionship. I was especially impressed with a subverted plot that contrasts uptight American values with those of the laid-back Europeans.Though some of the story lines are recycled, it is rare that they are presented this well done and with such a genuine feel. There isn't a second of this film I could do without. In many ways, I honestly can say I enjoyed it more than I would like to. A cynic like myself can't be enjoying movies like these too often. **** out of ****",Under the Tuscan Sun
91,mikestollov,"Diane Laine smiles a lot & solves everyones problems. Fantasy Rubbish, AVOID! AVOID!",1,27 February 2004,"How on earth these movies still get made I'll never know. Derivative in the extreme, it is a by-the-numbers-movie graced only by some good camera work & locations that are undeniably agreeable on the eye.Diane Laine plays a newly divorced professional writer desperately searching for answers to her sad life. Around her are the disfunctional & simplistic characters seen a thousand times before. The disfunctional represent her past, the simplistic her spiritual future, the return to her own personal Eden. Blah blah blah.The film exploits not only the ""chick dollar"" but the ""pink dollar"" too by sending her away on a gay holiday. I suppose this was an attempt by the producers to widen the audience & so increase revenues, but anyone who fell for the ""gay & away"" line will be disapointed as it is a device quickly disposed of, but by then it's too late as you've paid & are in the cinema.On this tour she sees a house & buys it on a whim. Obviously this girl has never tried to do business in Italy, where things can be slow to say the least! Anyway she ends up with this abandonned villa that is in dire need of several million dollars of renovation.So where's the army of workers who renovate the house? Surely the Polish handyman wasn't working 24/7 to do all this, was he? Or are we to believe that the place simply needs a coat of paint & hence took only a few days? If so why was it in such bad shape? Do we accept that Ms Laine does this all herself? Then how did she get round Italian immigration laws that allowed her to stay for the years this would have taken her? It's utter poppycock from start to finish.Raoul Bova as Marcello is predictable to the extreme, only a naive cretin would miss the clumsy way his character was set up to be unfaithful to her. YAWN! When I saw this movie I was amazed how the audience was surprised by Ms Laine's discovery of this fact! I have news for these people, when you go to Disney Land & meet Mickey Mouse it's really only a guy in a suit. Got that? Good!What really made me groan was the tap (faucet). I watched this incredibly obvious & shallow plot device & chose my time to sigh in a loud voice ""Let me guess, the damned tap will be finally running"" just before the sound of running water was heard. Of course the tap's dryness was a symbol for Ms Laine's parched & empty life. Now it is providing water again she is fullfilled....... hand me a sick bag PLEASE!It is just SOOOO predictable.Of course there were a few highlights, mostly, as I mentioned, the scenery which was very well handled. There was also the dress Ms Laine wore on the scooter ride to her ""boyfriend"" which was simply a classic, with well handled photography & direction & let's face it she looked stunning. Also there was the gratuitous ""bouncing boobs"" episode where she runs down a steep hill wearing a tight T shirt. Ah well, I suppose the husbands & boyfriends dragged along for the ride on this movie had to have something to wake them up!All in all it is another example of the lack of imagination in Hollywod right now. What plus points it has are vastly outweighed by the negatives, although I have no doub that it could have been a lot worse.Perhaps the most stunning criticism I heard was someone in the exit line who grumbled ""It's nothing like the book, they changed practicaly the whole story & made a mess of it"".",Under the Tuscan Sun

Stereotypes of Italians and Americans are nicely done away with. The characters want to be judged for what they are as individuals, not for what their nationality is. I was in quite a bad mood when I went to see this movie and left very inspired, thinking about my own life, and how indeed one might see opportunities pass by without taking them, and how it only takes seizing one to start afresh.

99,largelyhappy,Excellent movie,8,26 December 2005,"As a foreigner, I have not been brainwashed into thinking Diane Lane is gorgeous, so found the reaction of males in this movie rather odd. She is no more than a passably attractive woman at best, and at worst(as a troubled divorcée escaping from life)haggard and unkempt and yet the men have to act as if she's beautiful!! In one case, 3 Italian men leave their work to follow her - a disheveled 40+ American tourist? Gimme a break! It's rather like someone pretending that Woody Allen is drop-dead gorgeous :-) (Of course, who would DARE disagree???)In the personal interviews afterwards, Lane looked at least 10 years younger and a lot more attractive, which makes one wonder why they had to 'witch her up' for the role of a woman who was supposed to be pretty.I've never seen any of these actors before but Sandra Oh stole the movie beyond any doubt. Her natural style (Lane was far too mannered and aware of herself)and easy delivery did what every actor aspires to do - make the viewer think they are looking at a slice of life, rather than at people who have learned lines and are acting out a part.We have gotten used to the Hollywood style of head-shaking, gazing into the distance, biting lip when *portraying emotion* - it is every bit as corny and false as the old Olivier-style declaming was in the 1940's. People then thought this was the last word in fine acting - now we think it's hilarious. Some of the time, Lane's performance was in this league and coupled with the fact that she looked every one of her forty years and more - and therefore WAY too old for the handsome young guys who were supposed to be lusting after her, made this element of the movie an unrealistic farce. Mrs Robinson rides again?I have to say though that the movie itself was great. The idea of women leading successful, happy lives after the breakup of a relationship (albeit heading straight into another, as if women alone simply can't be happy) is a good theme and was well portrayed here. The contrast between jaded Frances and Katherine and the innocent Chiara, who will doubtless find that life with Pavel is not the dream she believes, was beautifully crafted.I expected to find more than just a single-sentence reference to the way foreigners (Brits, Germans and Americans especially) are so deeply resented in Tuscany and wonder why, ""You greedy Americans"" was included at all when it didn't really make the point. Nor was the movie much like the book it was said to represent. I have to wonder why a producer, who read the book and thought 'This would make a great movie' did not then actually make a movie like the book? Read the book, it's brilliant.The quiet, sexy Vincent Riotta and Sandra Oh redeemed the film of any faults completely and I shall be looking for movies starring them in future.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Diane Lane did a wonderful job bringing this character to life on the big screen and her portrayal of the endearing main character was a thorough joy. Slapstick comedy during the renovations to the old villa and the endearing characteristics of the Italian people were wonderful additions and the romantic element was enough to make your soul sigh. The scenery in this movie grabbed my heart and wouldn't let go and was the impetus for my husband and I to set off on our own adventures to discover those picturesque Etruscan towns perched high on the hillsides of Tuscany. Thanks to this movie the streets and people of Cortona now feature on the pages of my own novel ""Silken Images"" under my pen name Jennifer Larmar.

It is unlikely she would be accepted into rural Italian life due to the fact she is non-white. this was a bit of PC nonsense. the film is also offensive to Italian men. For instance, the one man she (Diane Lane) has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: at the end your typically plasticky American brick-head turns up, all cheesy white smile and tan, and she finally finds what she wants all along: a real American man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. In fact, this film is quite racist in its depiction of Italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.",Under the Tuscan Sun

She herself has definitely grown as an actor and it shows, she seems to keep getting better and better in her romantic roles; The Perfect Storm, Unfaithful, and now this one. This movie falls into my ""cute and entertaining"" category..with a bit of more of a focus on the woman in a ""relationship"" rather than both a man and a woman. The beautiful, breathtaking cinematography really captures your attention, if you haven't been to charming far and away places, you'll find yourself wanting to after watching this one. I give it a 7/10, above average, but not perfect because of the fundamental plot/outline..and of course, the predictable ending.

104,mashby,If you love Italy then go see this movie. If you like real and intelligent characters then go see this movie. If you hate romantic comedies then go see this movie.,8,27 February 2004,"I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?
Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical `funny sidekick' so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again. This film is definitely going into my DVD collection.",Under the Tuscan Sun

There is no scene, not a single one, without interest or beauty or fun. It's engaging, and very true to life. There are a few tiny places where the editing was cut a little short, but minuscule in importance. For a well-invested block of time, I highly recommend settling in for this lovely experience.

It's fun to watch a character with a heart of gold live her life in a totally mindless way and not only survive, but get rewarded for it in the end. That's the feel-good message of the movie. ""Take a chance. Act on a bad idea (several of them) and see how well your life turns out.""  That's Hollywood, that's ""Fantasy Island.""  It's not a theme that works for me.  Even romantic comedies need to keep one foot in reality to be satisfying. Because of its fantasy, the script was oddly predictable. I do give the scriptwriter credit--she was not always coherent, but somehow managed to connect all the disparate elements and achieve unity at the end of the movie.I wish we could have had more of the villa--what an intriguing place--and less of the ridiculous blonde in the fountain and what she represented.",Under the Tuscan Sun

In essence the main weakness of this film is the predictability of the plot.

This movie is sensuous, and the delightful spontaneity of Diane Lane makes you completely comfortable. Regardless its thinness, there is warmth, fun, immersion, and everyday cuteness. Discovering her lover has moved on, Diane Lane is moving, registering her character's hurt, and dignified, extricating herself from his presence.

115,info-21405,Inspiring and Likeable if You're Ready,9,19 May 2020,"Full disclosure: I love the book this movie is based on. This movie is very different from the book, but I love it, too.Diane Lane plays Frances Mayes, a writer who discovers her husband is having an affair with a younger woman. As expected, she becomes depressed, angry, and sad, but fortunately she has friends who convince her to travel to Tuscany for a little rest and relaxation time...which quickly turns into a life change when Frances makes the arguably rash decision to buy a villa and work to rebuild it.It's an obvious metaphor (yes, some might call the movie cliché), but it works. And it makes for a heartwarming inspiring movie about finding your own path, discovering new things, and rebuilding your life, even when things don't quite work out the way you thought. (Another lesson here: hard work is necessary.)Diane Lane does a brilliant job of capturing Frances's stress and hope throughout the process and the supporting cast is also excellent at portraying well-developed and likeable characters.And, of course, Italy is almost a character itself--the colors of the Tuscan countryside, the sun-soaked ancient villa, and the very very appetizing pasta, fresh produce, and ruby red wine cannot be missed.Some might call this a typical shallow romantic comedy, but if you look and are ready for it, there's much more to it--it is about a woman who discovers a new way to define her life, her family, and her home.

(Much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around Italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingénue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. Bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewison's vastly superior ode to Italy and romance). 'Tuscan Sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of Italy.

119,Pablo Picassimo,Too Much Cheese...,5,1 November 2003,"Let's get the positives of this movie out of the way:1. Fantastic Italian scenery: From Positano to Florence, the movie shows the audience back drops that take the breath away.2. Diane Lane: Played very well and convincing 'Frances' character.Beyond that, the movie is plagued with so much cheese (SPOILERS WARNING):1. Too many coincidences: Things that happen out of no where, like the bus stopping in front of the house that Frances happened to see earlier advertised on a Real Estate ad.  Or France picking up Marcello just to escape the taunting Italian men.  And the coincidences continue to pile.2. Employment: I'm not sure if I am the only person to see that none of the people actually worked in this movie, except for the Polish labor, who renovated her Frances' new (old) home.  Coming out of a divorce, you'd expect Frances to have only some change in her pocket, yet she's able to feast with the rest of the characters in the movie like she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.  Everyone appeared to have too much time on their hands.  It all is nice to fantasize, but is highly unreal.  And how about Katherine?  She's probably living off the alimony from her previous divorces.3. Clichés and Stereotypes: Hearing that this was a 'chick flick', I expect some clichés, stereotype, and most important, a happy ending.  Well, this movie has plenty of them.  For starters, the lesbian couple was fine, but introducing the `Gay and Away' tour bus was a little too much.  Secondly, seeing both Jerzy with the cigarette in his mouth and Zbigniew with the Polish novel in *every* single shot, portrayed the insignificance of their characters.  Then there is the stereotype of Italian men who are nothing but unfaithful and promiscuous.  And finally, through all the hardships of seeing Frances' relationships breakdown, she finds another fellow American writer (whom she criticized when he was in high school) who happens to be touring through the Tuscan region of Italy.To sum it up, this movie is a 5/10 on my book.

Sure, it was a bit Disneyland, bit Italian cliché, bit unrealistic (Patti must have rich parents or inherited or won in the lottery or something to be able to stay there without a care in the world and Francis didn't really write much, did she) - but still, for a Hollywood movie - pretty good. I guess its because I watched it as I too am going thru a divorce - not from my husband (that happened years ago already) but from a career I loved. I have taken this movie as a kind of sign. A good sign. Really, the movie was more about getting up after defeat and it was packaged so nicely, you can forgive the preposterousness of Francis not having a financial care in the world. Even after divorce. How nice would that be in real life?",Under the Tuscan Sun

The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look.",Under the Tuscan Sun

I think all the acting was great. i liked Sandra O's character I thought she was great. I loved the laid back European philosophy spouted by the English woman and the hunky Italian man.

Tuscan Sun is a marvel!,10,3 October 2003,"We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are.

When she said that, I nodded my head(someone understands!!) and fell into the story as if it were mine.I'm a straight guy, but I really liked this movie and it's now on my list to purchase.

139,luciencoolness,just too charming,7,30 December 2004,"Loosely based on Frances Mayes' book ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", Lane stars as the 35-year-old San Francisco writer Frances Mayes. After she loses her house to her philandering husband, thanks to the retarded alimony laws of California, her best friend and pregnant lesbian Patti gives her a ticket to go to Tuscany in Italy, with a tour for homosexual people. Helped by the circumstances and the endearing mr. Martini, she decides to buy an old villa, which is refurbished by a group of Polish workers. She meets lots of interesting people along the way, and romance. All characters in the film are just charming and nice, in fact, too much so to be believable. But it makes for a nice feel-good movie, although your impression will depend very much on your own experiences in life. The message is good, though, albeit surely not for each and every individual on this planet: Life offers you a thousand chances ... all you have to do is take one. That the chance that Frances took worked out absolutely perfectly, why not. It sure is nice for a change to see homosexuals not portrayed as heterohating scum, but as nice, tolerant and charming persons. Overall, a worthwhile and interesting film if you can accept the fact that sometimes everything does come up like roses....",Under the Tuscan Sun

Was this a film student project gone horribly awry? In a character driven movie, you'd think there would be at least a little effort made on the way characterization. Basically what this movie boils down to is the scenery with a cheesy plot, even worse dialogue and no real heart or mind behind it.

A divorced American writer who lost her San Francisco house to her ex and his lover travels to Italy and suddenly has the wherewithal to buy a run-down Italian money-pit villa where men emerge everywhere to make her feel better? Without having to resort to (gasp!) actual writing work? What happened to truly finding your self and caring for that person, regardless of who is around to fluff up your ego? A friend recommended this because I love Italy (the real one, not this 50s fantasy) and was recently divorced. Give me ""Enchanted April"" instead where women discover they are complete just as they are, without any hangers on or people to tell them how great/beautiful/amazing they are. Not against men, just against anyone defining themselves solely by a relationship.

143,taxib,Exasperating failure,4,2 August 2004,"The movie starts off promisingly, with the Diane Lane character discovering the infidelity of her husband and the ensuing heartbreak of divorce. Almost nothing works after that. The problem is the logic of the thing -- her two gay friends exchange their tickets to Italy for one first class for her. Okay I can maybe buy that. She goes on a gay tour and is sad, sad, sad. She runs into a flamboyant Blanche Dubois type and is instantly fascinated with her -- not my reaction, I found her cliché and unbelievable, but each to her own. Then she sees ""the house"" and her whole life changes. My b.s. detector went up big time when she jumped off the bus, left the tour, and managed to finesse the house away from the couple who had already made an accepted offer. (The bird crap on the head as a sign from God was particularly annoying.) Then there are the men in her life -- a married Italian hottie, a fickle Italian hottie, and the age-appropriate Italian not-so hottie with whom you'd like to see her end up but he's married and faithful, how boring of him. By the time she gets to the last-minute young American guy, you really don't care. The subplot characters also didn't work. Poor Lindsay Duncan obviously wasn't told whether she was totally insane or just quirky. The Polish workers were beyond cliché, the romance between the young Polish guy and the young Italian girl felt like a studio note, and Sandra Oh... oh, never mind.But the worst part is, it's supposed to be a story about a woman who buys a house in Tuscany and the renovation of it gives her new purpose in life -- and you really don't see the house. You kind of get a glimpse in the first shot. You see a couple of rooms get painted and a wall get knocked down. But you don't get the satisfaction of watching the transformation of a house from falling apart mess to enchanting villa. That, for me, was the biggest disappointment. I could have sat through all the 'I'm so sad and I hope I have sex soon' stuff, if I could have watched an exciting home renovation. But that's me.As for Diane Lane, she worked very, very hard but the material was so thin it looked like a lot of exertion for nothing. And the cutesy stuff she was forced to do was hard to watch, as I think of her as a more serious actress than that. As a final insult to our intelligent, there's a faucet sticking out of a wall that runs dry in the beginning, starts to drip as Diane Lane gets ... what? Juicier, I suppose.

The little amount of scenic photography that appears in this film is brief and unspectacular. The acting is forced, fake and f--ing awful. To think this was based on a book that women flocked to buy?

Diane Lane is a very good actress, and can make the audience feel for her without showing much character. We don't really know that much about her by the end of the movie, except that she seems to think she needs a man to be happy, and she likes wine and reading. Snore.

I find it perfectly comforting on those ho-hum / woe-is-me days when I could really use a hug or a drink or both. I have to report that I have watched this movie at least twenty times, both alone and with friends (misery loves company). I have even gone to the extreme of having the same food and wine as shown in the movie ready to partake when I /we get to the scene (which really makes it fun by the way). The big news here is that no matter how bad I feel when I hit the play button, I always feel much better by the time credits roll at the end Always!What I love most about the movie (spoiler alert) is the wistful yet posthumous advice Frances (Diane Lane) is constantly given from Federico Fellini (the late great movie director). He sends his advice through his medium, a classic blonde beauty (seriously classic) named Katherine (played by Lindsay Duncan), who claims to have been il Maestro's muse. Aside from the amazing cinematography that will make you want to purchase a one way ticket to Tuscany, the lovely and captivating acting, and the fun, move- your-body soundtrack, it is the foodie scene that may really capture your heart, it captured mine. I can make all of the dishes in the big foodie scene at this point, and I share this with great pride. LolWhen compared to the rainy-day, page-turner by Audrey Wells, well I should say, there is no comparison to the book really other than the location and the title.

Ah, well, trust me; I'm a huge book-lover (and Harry Potter fan), so I can say that if I had read the book and was an immense fan, I probably wouldn't have liked the film if it had taken the basis out of the original story. I truly sympathize with those of you who disliked this film because it did not go with the book in some way or another. ;)Although, since I love writing myself, I have a very wonderful relationship with this film and its delicious scenery, how the characters in it build in confidence, and the whimsical things that seem to be thrown in it artfully. Yes, there are some so-called ""cliches"", which is a word I hate using. We use that word to describe things that happen every day in our life, things that repeat themselves in storybooks and films and are heard so often that we are likely to vomit with expectancy of it all. But the thing that hit me about this film is that a lot of things happen that you really don't expect. The coming-of-age story has been told for ages, and will be expressed forever, with all its little tidbits of similar goings-on (serious situation happens, main character finds escape, love, broken heart, confusion..etc.). I don't think an entire genre of literature can deny its existence, now, can it? :)The acting is superb, and it has a lot of light-hearted moments that lift it up. It's basically about accepting yourself before you can truly find ""Mr.Right"", and realizing that you shouldn't put the blame on yourself for every single thing in your life that happens, and about taking chances because life can have pros and cons. I even think that some men would like it. This film was very inspiring to me, and although I didn't see it in theaters, I left my couch feeling very creative and content, as if I wasn't the only one who got inspiration from the little things life seems to hand out.",Under the Tuscan Sun

But the book is ostensibly real, while the movie is a lush fantasy of people living in the setting the book's author has created for us.

Love is always risky, and you depend on other people, so why only focus on making yourself more lovely and attractive. Attractive is the skill, not the present of God. You can build it. Build it first before love work.",Under the Tuscan Sun
170,nitricy,essential,10,16 December 2006,"This film is absolutely essential to watch for the broken-hearted, especially for those who can't start over-just yet. There couldn't have been someone better to portray Francesca than Diane Lane. I believe, even bitter skeptics of love or anything related will get the the urge to believe in it all again by the time the end credits are rolling. It's about taking chances and failing and unlike most Hollywood films, it's unpredictable at times (i'm sure many viewers thought Marcelo was the guy for her and they were going to live happily ever after between Rome and Tuscany). This film offers much more than what it's expected to. I'll never get sick of watching it.",Under the Tuscan Sun
171,stewart317,I was extremely disappointed by the acting and the scenery.,1,7 February 2004,"I had been told by a co-worker how much I was going to enjoy this film. What a disappointment! The location shots were minimal. Most of it looked like it was shot on a back lot in Hollywood. There were a few good shots of Positano, but other than that, not much real geography. The acting by Diane Lane was limited to repetitious ""grins"" and ""tilts of the head"", although she can't be blamed for the poor script or the improbability of the plot. Couldn't believe this was the same lady who was nominated for an Academy Award. All in all, a superficial and disappointing presentation.",Under the Tuscan Sun

173,cfleff,Charming tale of how a California divorcee works through a mid-life crisis in Italy.,9,3 October 2003,"I laughed and cried at this charming film about how an emotionally battered recent divorcee comes back to life while remodelling a 300-year old villa in Tuscany. In fact, I think I laughed louder and cried harder than anyone else in the theater - of course, I may have been biassed by my strong identification with the protagonist.  Like her, I am an aspiring writer who went through a devastating divorce while living in the San Francisco area (one in which my husband, like hers, took half of everything I had earned, after I had supported him through getting his PhD and starting a company). Tuscany, which is so beautifully and lovingly presented in this film, also has strong personal associations for me, as I spent six months studying in Florence when I was in college. Like the heroine, I even had an Italian boyfriend named Marcello! I have read reviews of this film claiming it was short on story, or that the philosophy presented was too ""fortune cookie"". I disagree. I thought the characters were well-drawn and likable, the scenery was gorgeous (including some of the men!) and the philosophy, if not original, was certainly worth being reminded of.  After all, well-worn bits of wisdom become well-worn by being relevant to so many people's lives! I don't know whether the movie will appeal to the typical gum-chewing teeny-bopper, but it should speak to anyone who has actually lived a while!",Under the Tuscan Sun

I know this movie is unrealistic, and when a woman goes through a divorce, and on a whim, moves to a strange country, life will most likely not be a fairytale. But at least for the two odd hours that the movie is playing, it makes you forget that. It makes you believe and hope that life can be that beautiful, and that no matter where you are in your life - you can start over again. Yes I am a dreamer, and I prefer to believe in happiness - and so should you! :)This is not among the best scripts or screenplays by any stretch, but it is a feel good movie.

It's about taking a leap of faith when you least expect it and however terrifying it is, daring to see it through. It's also a story about love and how you really only can give love, when your life is full and you truly love yourself. The movie shows you a beautiful sight of Italy where classic villagers and modern life go hand in hand. You see a woman who finds herself at the total bottom of her life, and the only way she can go is up. It takes some people a year, some almost a lifetime but the only thing that matters is the road. It doesn't matter how long it takes for you to get to where you want to, but if you make it, that's when your life truly begins. Home really is where the heart is.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Perhaps not unlike most divorced women, she searches for someone to replace what she has lost. As a result of an impromptu trip to Italy, she buys a villa in Tuscany and begins the difficult journey of rebuilding the villa and and also her life. Along the way she realizes it takes time to truly get to know people but what's most important is that she get to know herself. Once she shifts the focus from looking to others to make her happy to relying on herself for her own happiness, she watches the pieces come together to form a complete picture. Yes, this is a chick flick. Women tend to be more introspective and this movie reflects that fact.

I really enjoy her sarcastic asides through the film, her frustration and joy, and her tendency off and on toward blue language. I can imagine hanging out with her character, which is one of the reasons I enjoy the movie so much.The whole thing works for me as a bit of an escapist journey with a heroine who stands in wonderfully for the (female?) viewer.

It's a feel good movie for anyone who's been through heart aches and anyone looking for a laugh. It's taken in beautiful Italy, Tuscany and it's one of those movies that makes you want to jump on the next plane to Tuscany to bite into the grapes and hear the church bells! Not only does it have one love story in it, it also has another smaller romance involving two teenagers, which the directors didn't quickly put an end to, but rather took it through the movie steadily which played out nicely. The movie also has a small twist in it but I won't spoil it by saying what happens. It's a great movie, with an ending that gives anyone with a broken heart hope.

The hope of the old man tipping his hat or the tap bringing water into the old house, adds a little touch of magic to the movie, i was myself laughing when the old man tipped his hat. From the description of the Italian market, to seeing the lady in the fountain and the agent saving her, a sense of interwoven poetry and brilliance in the screenplay.

I love to watch it when the kids and husband are in bed asleep, and it's just me and my thoughts. I think you could call it a chick-flick, but I think any man who doesn't mind feeling something, would like this movie also. This movie deals with very real feelings regarding divorce. It's about a woman struggling to get some kind of life back after her marriage ends. I would recommend this movie anytime a woman is feeling down.

She is an actress of exceptional ability.  Her portrayal of different emotions from despair, sadness, fascination, joy, satisfaction, etc is absolutely flawless.  The scenery is amazing and it alone is worth every cent of your ticket.  But the film has much more substance than that.  It is much more than a chick flick. Definitely 10 out of 10.

After a brutal divorce, Frances (Lane, Unfaithful, A Walk on the Moon, The Perfect Storm) is persuaded by her friend Patti (Sandra Oh) to take a tour of Italy--where, on a whim that she hopes will rescue her from her desperate unhappiness, she buys a rundown villa and sets out to renovate it. Along the way, she gets advice from a former Fellini actress, meets a scrumptious Italian lover, and helps support Patti after her own relationship derails. The conclusion of 'Under the Tuscan Sun' holds some nice surprises, and the deft turns and observations along the way are delightful. Lane carries the film effortlessly by, exuding both heartbreak, sexiness and re-awakening passion. The film is funny and very entertaining.",Under the Tuscan Sun

Going through the emotional upheaval of divorce and then searching for love, hey! - most of us have been there, unfortunately most of us don't have the luxury of going off to Italy to soothe our souls. I thought Marcello was the one for her, but he was right, true love should come naturally, if you have to work that hard well, se la vie. The story has a beautiful message, that true love will find us if we just stand still for a little while, and... even after a devastating divorce there is laughter and joy again.

Well, finally, tonight we had our chance to watch it on TV. Did the fact that it was a french-dubbed version have anything to do with my reactions and critique? I'm not sure but I sincerely believe that even if it was in its original English version my comments would be the same. I suffered through the first hour of it and finally gave up. Could it be that I was actually looking forward to the commercial breaks?? Clichés did you say??? Full of it. Ridiculous dialog? Plenty of it. Honestly, I'm so glad that I didn't rent the movie as my wife so often suggested! The "" heroine "" of the story started to get on my nerves after about 15 minutes with her cutesy faces and simulated timidity. Oh yes...the scenery was just breathtaking and I suspect that this movie was made to encourage and increase tourism to that region of Italy; gay or otherwise... Some of you readers may be tempted to tell me that I should have at least watched the whole movie before this unleashing. Sorry, I just couldn't take it any more!!!",Under the Tuscan Sun

It is also about as entertaining as seeing wet paint dry. I have not read the book, but every scene in the film was predictable and nothing, absolutely nothing, other than the expected happened. This is the kind of film that is called ""heartwarming"" and ""endearing"". It is filled with predictably beautiful landscapes, predictably awful violin music and predictable magic moments. If you are a woman around 40 and feel that your life is slipping away, this film is targeted right at you. It is aimed at pleasing you just like sweets and will do you just as much good.

However, she sees a beautiful house and decides to buy it, where she meets one of the residents, the local estate agent.  She buys the house and starts doing it up, with the help of three Polish workers, and meets other locals at the same time.  Like an old man that changes the flowers every day, near her house.  When visiting one town, she gets harassed by the locals but pretends to be married to someone, that she does not know.  She ends up sleeping with him but alias, he sleeps with someone else, after a few months, after she decides to visit him.  Then her friend from San Franciso (the place where she used to live) visits her.  Everything climaxs into happy dinner party ending, with a fellow book writer, talking to her after the dinner.  There is a sub - plot where one of the polish workers, wants to marry a local, and they do, thanks to the help of Diane lane's character.  Nice shot scenes of flowers, average acting from the cast and Diane Lane, herself, plus a not too corny plot, make this film worth watching, if you fancy light entertainment at the cinema.",Under the Tuscan Sun

I might add that this was not greatly appreciated as I saw the movie on a flight between Greece and Sweden, people around me seemed not at all as interested/involved in the movie and Frances new life in Italy as I was. My own situation is that I am single, have had one great love in my life and spent way to much time on guys I haven't really had any feelings for and feel that I am looking for something new and exciting to happen, many of the situations Frances found herself in felt so near to my own life. Whether the writer of the book knows or not, this book was written for women like myself!!Needless to say, I am planning a trip to Italy next year and before I go I will have watched the film and read the book enough to know all I need to know..

Breathtakingly artful.Specifically, the use of framing and color is ingenious. The color balance between natural subjects and the clothing/interior furnishings shows, to me, a depth of thought and preparation that I consider among the most beautiful I've seen in a movie. Personally, I'm very surprised that a concept for a retail store called ""Tuscan Sun"" has not been launched. Not only could it carry the usual housewares, but foods, etc.",Under the Tuscan Sun
264,dafleadr,I liked the movie,7,7 February 2005,"It is a story about learning to love yourself. I think that any women out there who feel that they can not be happy unless it is with a man should watch this movie. I thought that the movie was pretty darn funny, and it has one of the best, most inspirational quotes in it: Between Austria and Italy, there is a section of the Alps called the Simmering; it is an impossibly steep, very high part of the mountains. They built a train track over this part of the Alps to connect Vienna and Venice. They built these tracks even before there was a train in existence that could make the trip; they built it because they knew...someday, the train would come.",Under the Tuscan Sun

As vexing as the scene is (in which the Italian men chase Diane Lane down the street), can you really suggest that instances such as that don't occur? After just returning from Paris (though never having been to Italy), I can say that it has happened to me...and I don't consider myself as attractive as Diane Lane by any means! Nor do I have blonde hair. Nevertheless, I was chased and heckled by men in the streets of Paris whenever my fiancé was out of sight! As annoying as it may be, it happens! Otherwise, I think this movie was pleasantly surprising...even my fiancé (who hates chick flicks) appreciated it. The movie's not monumental, but is endearing for its niche.",Under the Tuscan Sun
266,krystalanne72,Loved this movie,10,8 May 2005,"I thought this moving was charming. It may have been quirky because it was intended to be. It wanted to show the craziness of ""cliches"" and to clear up the ones that are absurd. I felt the water flowing at the end was a ending fitting of someone that just found love and a new life to start. Maybe it was a sign of fertility or maybe to show she was pregnant. None the less I have watched it at least 5 times now and I am not the type that like s to watch movies more than once even if I like them. I was intrigued to see La Dolche Viva and to read the book Under The Tuscan Sun. Not all movie are for everyone but this one was a great one for me.",Under the Tuscan Sun
267,f-moriconi2,What utter rubbish,3,11 April 2007,"I've just seen this film, and I've never laughed so much in my life! First of all I'm Italian and most importantly I live in Tuscany..... The things that happen in this film don't happen in real Italian life. Let's start: Italy is a bureaucratic nightmare, so if she(Frances) wanted to buy and live here she must wait months and months before she gets the house. In the village where she lives there are a lot of Italian stereotypes that you'll never find in Italy. In Italy, especially in small towns people speak bad Italian and mostly in dialect (even if you knew a little Italian you probably wouldn't understand)let alone speak English. The polish are quite uncommon in Italy, there are a lot of Moroccans and Albanians. Even if middle Italian beauty is higher than other countries,finding men like Raul Bova(Marcello) in the street is rare. The man that puts flowers in the vase everyday, in real life at the end of the film instead of saying hello,would have put his middle finger up ( in a rude gesture). Hardly anybody has fresco's in their home. The wedding dress the young girl wears looks as if its fifty years old. If you go in a fountain, the police would arrest you.....DON'T DO THAT IF YOU COME HERE!!!! If you ask a policeman for a lift(even if you are Naomi Campbell) he won't. In Florence hospitals you'll never find Armani or Vesace covers.I've found a few truths as well: The old ladies usually are quite funny. The explanation that Chiara's mother gave about marriage is realistic. The young guys of Rome are like that. The man who continually says YES and OK. The explanation of Marcello about traffic lights in Campania is true. The big meals.The good of this film is that it brings lots of tourists here.",Under the Tuscan Sun
268,sockgrabupchuck,is it a 1960's Doris Day movie redo?,1,9 August 2014,"This movie came out in 2004. I guess it must have been trying to somehow jump on the cultural bandwagon of gay women coming out on TV. Bad idea and a ruination of a great book! The women characters are most unbelievable paper dolls at best! Wrong time, way and place to make a cultural statement - and horrible dialogue. I loved the book and all the books by Mayes and looked forward to the delightful story of how she and her HUSBAND bought and remodeled their house in Tuscany. The husband was a great attraction because he was able to do the repairs and was also interested in aesthetics of food , wine and cultural history of Tuscany.this movie was like a made for TV movie. I think the script writer only read the book tile and looked at the cover photo to get her inspiration for the script. It reminds me of a 1960's Doris Day movie, second thought, the 60's Doris Day movies were better. I bought my copy at the thrift store for .25 cents. It was a wast of my money, but being so cheep, I din not feel too bad about tossing it in the trash. this movie sucks.",Under the Tuscan Sun
269,tina8525,"Under the Tuscan Sun goes way too long, is too boring and too stupid, too.",5,27 August 2014,"Great scenery, that's the best comment I can make about the movie. And the beginning is interesting. You have sympathy for the main character who finds out her husband is cheating, gets a divorce and the ex-husband gets the house. I felt sorry for her and wanted to find out what happens to her. So, I was interested in the beginning. But, about half way through I kind of stopped caring. About the time the main character, Frances, has sex with a guy she just met and without any commitment, I was done. And then later she is upset when her Italian lover has moved on to the next woman. What did she expect? There was no commitment there. I did like the wedding towards the end of the movie and the happy ending, but there's just too much nonsense to sit through to get to the end. And at the end some wonderful guy shows up. Frances gave his book a bad review. Why would some guy come find her in Italy when she gave his book a bad review? Just so dumb. I agree with another reviewer who thinks ""Only You"" is a much better romantic movie set in Italy. Putting in a F word was completely unnecessary and a semi nude scene where the woman is ""having her portrait painted"", but no actual painting was shown, only her grabbing the scantily clad painter's bottom, also unnecessary. And, of course, I didn't like the casual sex scene with Frances, the main character, and the Italian guy she just met. I wish Hollywood would stop putting these kinds of scenes into PG-13 movies. I expect higher standards and am usually disappointed. Some may think I'm old-fashioned, but I don't care. It's how I feel.",Under the Tuscan Sun
270,clock_tower_countdown,Excellent Italian Dream!,10,14 June 2005,"This movie is like a dream come true. The Italian setting is very dreamy and is filled with a lot of comedy and happiness. As well as love, this movie brings joy to each and everyone's lives. A woman finds herself buying a villa in Italy. A 300 year old villa, was a fashionable exit for this young American woman hoping to get away from her estranged and somewhat disastrous past with her ex husband. She finally realizes what she needs to do and not just sulk around over some guy. Her love problems come to hault when she meets an estranged Italian man whom isn't at all what she expected. The workers she hired to remodel her villa are as well what makes this movie a perfect romantic comedy. A boy who fell in love with a girl who's father won't let them marry because of their nationality. As well some mysterious people who find their way into this story. This movie is a heartfelt comedy/drama which finds it's way at peace with a lovely happy ending!",Under the Tuscan Sun
271,qenushilupi,Like a fairy tale,10,18 August 2017,"WARNING:SPOILERS I have seen this movie many years ago and I re watched it recently.The second time around my reaction to it was different.This movie is like a a fairy tale.It has a good ending because Frances was lucky.I like how the story is crafted.Every event and person pushes Frances to her new destiny. She takes risks and builds a new life in Italy.The fact she did't end up with Marcelo worked well with me. It was not meant to be. From what I know there are two houses named Bramasole in Cortona, the one the author of the book lives and the other one used for the movie. Interesting, feel-good movie. Probably the next step for me is to read the book.",Under the Tuscan Sun
272,elel82,This movie will give you a sudden urge to visit Italy!,9,16 October 2005,"A beautifully scripted movie with elements of humor, drama, and romance that is going to warm your heart. Under the Tuscan Sun will give hope to divorce es that there is life after divorce. Fransesca decides against staying in her current life and sulking in her divorce, and decides to begin a new life in Italy, where she ended up vacationing unexpectedly. Francesca randomly goes with her gut and buys a beautiful Italian home which is the base of the movie. She takes things as they come and ends up to get exactly what she's desired her whole life. (The only disappointment to me was that I wanted the Italian guy to come back to her!!) Overall it was an inspirational, funny, warm movie.",Under the Tuscan Sun
273,breedingnd1,Lovely movie,9,7 December 2005,"This movie is wonderfully romantic. It is sweetly written and just a good girl movie. Any woman who has had any sadness in her life and needs a new start will appreciate this movie. The views are incredibly and makes you want to fly to Tuscany and live there forever! The characters are those that make you fall in love and you will relive moments in your life while watching this movie. I will say you need to be in a loving or romantic mood before watching this movie. It does take a few minutes to really get good but when it does, it's wonderful. I hope you enjoy as much as I did. A Walk in the Clouds with Keanu Reeves is also like this movie. It has the same romance and drama but is much sweeter.",Under the Tuscan Sun
274,gradchick,Couldn't have been more dull,1,6 June 2006,"This movie kept droning on and on and on. The pace was ridiculously slow. I saw several options for interesting diversions from the pace, but none were taken. My favorite scenes came early on, and I kept hoping for more of the same, but there was none. I kept looking at the ""Chapter List"" to see how much more of the torture was left. There was nothing very redeeming about the movie at all. In general, the characters were unlovable. I didn't care at all about Diane Lane's character. Sandra Oh was good, but she wasn't in nearly enough scenes. The ""Young Love"" was undeveloped, and there was no indication that this was a ""great love"" in the works. The ""you reviewed my book once"" scenes made good bookends, but were a bit much to believe. I only kept watching it in hopes of something good happening, and the party at the end was not enough! Don't bother. Glad I got it from the library, and didn't pay anything for it!",Under the Tuscan Sun
275,Talon_driver,One of the worst movies I've ever endured,1,3 January 2006,"I watched this with my wife one night. We thought it was about the escapades of a woman fixing up an old house since the DVD cover describes the movie as a ""romantic comedy"". It isn't. This is a ""chick flick"" and not even a good one. Even my wife hated it. There is no plot, nor much point to the movie. You keep waiting for something good (or at least interesting) to happen, but it never does. There are a few laugh lines and a good reenactment from La Dolce Vita. That's it. When the credits begin to roll, you realize that there really isn't anything to take away from the movie, and that you have wasted 2 hours of your life that would have been better spent watching nearly anything else, not counting Tele-Tubbies. Let me echo other comments about wondering if/when anyone in the movie ever works to earn a living. If you have to watch this, at least enjoy the scenery.",Under the Tuscan Sun
276,alikacandon,SO UNDERATED!!! It's Way More Than A Chic-Flick!!!,10,20 May 2018,"I love so many types of movies... and this is one of my all time favorites! Never really knew or cared about Diane Lane until I saw this wonderful movie. I also gained a lot of sentiment for Sandra Oh after watching this film. Anyone who loves to travel to foreign destinations, in this case Italy, and for anyone who is a believer in fate, being in the right place at the right time and divine intervention will absolutely love ""Under The Tuscan Sun."" This movie is so uplifting, very inspirational and fully encouraging for the person who may be facing major life struggles, feeling displaced in life and in need of an extraordinary life change! Highly recommended... I guarantee you will watch this movie more than once!",Under the Tuscan Sun
277,harry-james,Top 3 favorite movies of all time,8,14 June 2018,"I watched this movie when it first came out 15 years ago, and I still re-watch it every single year. Through all of my own personal growth and aging 15 years, it still stands the test of time and I always find something new in Frances' story to connect with. Beautiful scenery, gorgeous music and an outstanding performance from Diane Lane. This film stands the test of time and I can't recommend it enough.",Under the Tuscan Sun
