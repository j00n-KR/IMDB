0,TheLittleSongbird,"Falls into the ""not that bad but could have been much better"" category",4,1 December 2013,"Free Birds is not really a good or great film, nor is it terrible. If there was a word to sum it up it would be mediocre. Is it the worst animated film of the year? No, that dishonour goes to Sir Billi(which was billed as Sean Connery's comeback!). Is it the best? Again, no, that's so far been between Monsters University and Despicable Me 2(have high hopes for Frozen, and that is looking like that will be even better than these two). Free Birds does have a few things that came off well. The animation has some nice bright colours and attention to detail(though the character designs could have been smoother in places), the soundtrack is catchy, the scene with the hunters destroying the turkey's nest is indeed tense and the voice acting has the right amount of zest and energy, Woody Harrelson is almost unrecognisable and is clearly having fun, Amy Poehler should do voice acting more often because she is born to do it and Owen Wilson brings some distinctive quirkiness as well(if at times on the one-note side). George Takei while bringing dignity to his part is very underused though, and it does feel like a waste. There are a lot of flaws as well unfortunately. The script lacks crispness and wit and has an overkill of turkey jokes that are both contrived and dumb, some gags are stretched out to pointlessness while the slapstick is heavy on predictability and over-broadness and light on fun and invention. With the target audience too, children may enjoy it if they understand the humour but it is likely to go over the heads of adults. If that is the case, considering that Free Birds is a family film(NOT a kids' film) the film only does half its job well, if children are not amused it's a failure. Where I was, the reception from both children and adults were largely the latter, but then again it will be different with you. The story is well-intended but is far too simple- even for a family film- and predictable, while it also doesn't do anything with the time travel idea(which had great potential) that comes at the expense of the humour, which very little hits the mark really. The message is good if clumsily and heavy-handedly incorporated(likewise with the few emotional parts that were more manipulative than heartfelt), and there's no better about the characters unfortunately who suffer from flat personalities(some like Jake irritating too) and dealt with far too simplistically to the extent we know little about them. Non-US viewers may also find that because the film is so rooted in American customs and their early history that that is a further reason why the humour is likely to be lost on them. In conclusion, the potential and intentions are there, and it is not as bad as others have said- because the animation, music and voices are good and one scene came off well- but it was lacking in a lot of areas- mostly the humour and the story- and had a lot of wasted potential(doing little with the time travel idea and under-using George Takei). Despite how this sounds, it isn't terrible but rather mediocre, and this is not being said with vehemence but with a heavy heart from a 21-year old animation fan(to avoid over-generalising that defending of panned family films are prone to). 4/10 Bethany Cox",Free Birds
1,SnoopyStyle,Stop complaining about PETA and relax,6,20 September 2014,"Reggie (Owen Wilson) is a scrawny turkey who knows that they are on the Thanksgiving menu. None of the other turkeys believe him. Luckily for Reggie, he gets pick by the President's daughter to be pardon. Jake (Woody Harrelson) is a strong slightly dumb turkey who takes Reggie on a mission. He takes him to a shed in Camp David which turns out to be the entrance to a secret base with a time machine. The two turkeys go back to 1621 Plymouth colony to take turkeys off the Thanksgiving menu. Reggie falls for the chief's daughter Jenny (Amy Poehler). The time machine is called S.T.E.V.E. (George Takei).The advertisements keep touting the fact that one of the producers (Aron Warner) also produced Shrek. Really? That's just stupid. There is also the tough sell that they're getting turkeys off the menu. Turkey is tasty. If one can accept the idea of Thanksgiving without turkeys, then this movie has a chance. 'Chicken Run' is more palatable because it doesn't propose to take all chickens off the menu. The animation is reasonable for a family movie. It's not the top of the line but it's good enough.I really like the idea that turkeys are the Indians to the Pilgrams settlers. It works quite well. Reggie and Jake are fine but I wish they get friendlier faster. There is one joke that made laugh hard. ""STEVE's not here, man."" It's a great stoner joke. I wish Cheech or Chong was doing it and they could keep it going for awhile. On the other end of the spectrum, the 'angry birds' joke was groan inducing. I thought the big capture is quite thrilling and the resulting low point very touching. I also really like the final resolution for the Thanksgiving meal because that is filled with great big pitfalls. This premise has its difficulties but I find most of it is resolved reasonably.",Free Birds
2,kosmasp,Chicken,5,5 August 2014,"Not nearly as good as the other time traveling animal (Mr. Peabody), but has some charm of its own. Although that might depend on your take of Owen Wilson (since he's the voice of the main character here). You might want to rate higher or lower I guess. The time travel thing does not work entirely, but what makes it worthwhile is the fact that it has a few jokes here and there (definitely not the ""twist"" towards the end though that's for sure).This animation works more the kids and less for the adults, though there are some stabs at American/native history here. It still is kept simple and the whole thing is predictable. There are worse things though and your kids/young ones won't mind watching this at all.",Free Birds
3,classicsoncall,"""Witness the awesome power of the pardoned turkey!""",7,25 August 2014,"So I just watched two time travel movies back to back, the other one was ""Timecop"". Hard to say which one made less sense but this one was somewhat entertaining. At least my five year old granddaughter thought so by paying attention throughout the whole story. Things got a bit carried away near the end when you had four Reggies show up all at once - in ""Timecop"" they would have all exploded or some such thing, on the basis that the same entity couldn't occupy more than one physical location at any given point in time. On the flip side, that might have been a good reason to have Thanksgiving dinner early. No need to get too carried away here. You've got a fun story that's got plenty of humor, and to the discredit of all the PETA folks, it probably won't turn your kid into a vegetarian.",Free Birds
4,tavm,"Free Birds is meant to be a lark about ""What if turkeys can control their destiny?"" and nothing else concerning certain opinions",6,4 November 2013,"Just saw this computer-animated movie with my movie theatre-working friend. It's about two turkeys who travel back in time to make sure that their breed is off the Thanksgiving menu. Will they succeed? Well, considering the way they are portrayed compared to the humans in the cast, I think the answer may be obvious. Let me just say that I found the whole thing pretty funny and I was willing to go along with the story knowing it has nothing to do with the way things are or even about possibly changing some minds about certain animals as food. It's just a fun lark meant to entertain for about 90 minutes for the families with kids as a distraction before the actual holiday where they always expect you-know-what to always to be served at that time, that's all...",Free Birds
5,utgard14,How did this get made?,4,25 January 2014,"Owen Wilson continues his trend of playing himself in every role, even animated ones. Here he plays a turkey that is totally interchangeable with every live action role Owen Wilson has played. So the story is about the Owen Wilson turkey and another turkey voiced by Woody Harrelson who go back in time (don't ask) to the first Thanksgiving to try to put a stop to turkey eating becoming a tradition. I'm not sure what they were thinking with this. From a purely business standpoint it doesn't make a lot of sense. First, you have a movie that, with its Thanksgiving theme, is targeted at citizens of the USA only. Then you have themes of anti-meat eating and anti-Thanksgiving celebrating that will certainly alienate a significant portion of that audience. Ultimately that leaves it with a narrow audience that will want to try it out and many of them won't like it because it's just not funny. I'm just bewildered that it got made. I wonder if the Bill Clinton-sounding president is any indication of when this script was first written? I wouldn't be surprised if this thing was sitting around for a decade or more. Oh and I love the lame Chuck E. Cheese product placement. It's not a terrible movie but not a good one either. Maybe worth seeing once but ultimately forgettable. Really small kids might like it more.",Free Birds
6,neil-476,Downright strange. What were they thinking?,7,6 December 2013,"Reggie is a scrawny turkey who is trying to persuade the other turkeys that Thanksgiving is bad for them. When they finally get the message, their reaction is for Reggie to go first. Fortunately he is reprieved by the President's daughter. However, he is taken out of his life of luxury by macho turkey Jake, who time travels with Reggie (in time machine S.T.E.V.E.) back to 1621, where they attempt to join forces with the local tribe of turkeys to forestall the inclusion of turkeys in the Thanksgiving festivities.This 3D CGI feature features the voices of Owen Wilson as Reggie, Woody Harrelson as Jake, and George Takei as S.T.E.V.E. Amy Poehler plays love interest Jenny from the turkey tribe, a kind of Flockahontas, if you will, who has a pleasingly daft recurring sight gag (in more than one sense). As the plot synopsis indicates, its story is bizarre to the point of dementedness. For all that I quite enjoyed it (I love time travel fiction, and there are some good time travel gags in it), it is essentially a kids' film but, maybe, one which is a bit too off-the-wall and dense to please its intended audience. I might be wrong.I have seen better characterisation and animation, but the 3D is good, and the autumnal backgrounds are gorgeous.Weird, but not unenjoyable.",Free Birds
7,anaconda-40658,It's Turkey Time!,8,19 December 2015,"Free Birds (2013): Dir: Jimmy Hayward / Voices: Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Amy Poehler, George Takei, Dan Fogler: An unusual animation about the victims of every Thanksgiving dinner. Reggie is a young turkey who learns of the reality of Thanksgiving but is spared when the U.S. President allows his daughter to take Reggie as a pet. Central plot regards Reggie kidnapped from his comfortable life by macho turkey Jake who knows of a time machine on a military base that can transport them back in time to clear turkeys off the menu. They transport to the eve of the first Thanksgiving in 1621 where turkeys are hunted daily. Reggie and Jake end up within a large flock of turkeys bent on staying one step ahead of the hunters. This becomes extremely ridiculous once the turkeys go to war with the pilgrims. Even the whole time machine seems like a bad third grade write-in yet the screenplay is detailed and features a solution that many may find more appetizing than the birds themselves. Directed by Jimmy Hayward who has fun with the traditional aspects of the holiday. Owen Wilson voices Reggie whose desire is to survive and fit in. Woody Harrelson brings much humour to the gusto of Jake whose desire is not to fail. Amy Poehler voices Jenny who is female counter to Reggie but she figures into the story in the unconventional way beyond just having a female presence. Other roles are as lively as turkey feathers and are more or less standard issue. Directed by Jimmy Hayward who made Horton Hears a Who, and features the freedom of family and unity.

8,KineticSeoul,"It's better to see ""Chicken Run"" again over this",2,20 May 2014,"This is one of those family animated movie that at first seems to have potential, but quickly goes downhill because of the lack of substance. It seemed fine and dandy until it went with the time travel direction and it just all seemed to fall apart. With generic and random things going on to fill up the running time to 1 hour and 30 minutes. It's alright to go in a direction where it's been done before as long as it brings out creativity that makes it stand out, but that isn't the case for this. I never really liked Owen Wilson in movies, he basically plays the same character in all of his movie except in this he plays a Turkey (kind of a annoying one). I though it was cool how it emphasis how turkey's are dumb, but it hardly plays a part in when it comes to the plot. The animation itself is good enough, but the execution is just poorly done. I could tell what direction they tried to go with this movie but it just falter in every level, including what is suppose to be emotional scenes. This movie might be fine for kids, but for adults it just makes people feel dumber as they watch. And the cute parts just seemed so forced and drawn out. It also portrays the humans as the bad guys and the Turkeys the good guys. Which is fine, but there just wasn't any connection or genuine chemistry that makes the audiences feel sympathy for Turkeys. Which might be a good thing if you consider eating a deliciously roasted turkey for Thanksgiving. Who knows maybe vegans might enjoy this movie, since it sets up a message that humans are evil for trying to eat turkeys. I actually went out bought some ingredients and made myself a nice tasty turkey sandwich after seeing this movie.2.5/10",Free Birds
9,Hellmant,It's biggest crime is it's not funny.,5,9 January 2014,"'FREE BIRDS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A new animated kids' film about time traveling turkeys trying to save their kind from being the traditional main course at Thanksgiving dinner. The film stars the voices of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson as the time traveling turkeys and Amy Poehler as Wilson's love interest. It was directed by Jimmy Hayward (who also directed the animated film adaptation of Dr. Seuss's classic children's book 'HORTON HEARS A WHO!' as well as the comic book flick 'JONAH HEX') and written by Hayward, David I. Stern, John J. Strauss and Scott Mosier. Mosier is the film producing partner of Kevin Smith (one of my favorite writer/directors) and also a long-time PETA advocate. Many have criticized the movie for being a big PETA commercial and anti-Thanksgiving. It definitely seems to support not abusing animals, and treating them humanely, but that doesn't bother me at all. It's biggest crime is it's not funny.Wilson voices Reggie, a turkey who's constantly trying to convince his fellow kind of the dangers of Thanksgiving. He's treated as a hated outsider for it and no one believes him. One holiday he's saved by the President (voiced by Hayward), as the 'pardoned Thanksgiving turkey', due to the President's daughter (Kaitlyn Maher) having a fondness for him. He goes to live at Camp David and finally finds peace and happiness, spending his days eating pizza and watching telenovas. Then, right before another Thanksgiving, he's kidnapped by another turkey named Jake (Harrelson). Jake enlists his help on a special mission to save turkeys from being on the Thanksgiving dinner menu forever. Reggie reluctantly helps him. They must steal a time machine (voiced by George Takei) and travel back to the very first Thanksgiving in order to complete their mission.I would definitely not say the movie is anti-Thanksgiving but you might not want your kids to watch it (that time of year) if you're planning on having turkey for dinner (like that's the only time people ever eat turkey). It is animal friendly and I don't have a problem with that, given I'm a big animal lover (my cat Keno is my best friend), but I still can't really recommend it (although I will for kids). It's just not funny, which is a shame given the smart story idea and talent involved. It's especially disappointing coming from Mosier (who also does a voice in the film) but I'll still look up to the guy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4",Free Birds

11,ironhorse_iv,Gobble! Gobble! Free birds isn't that good of a movie.,5,2 December 2013,"No, this movie isn't about the band, Lynard Skynard at all. Nor is the song 'Freebird' appear or mention in this film. I wish it was. Instead, Free Birds is a 3D computer-animated buddy comedy film produced by Reel FX Creative Studios. While, the animation isn't as good as, let's say, Dreamworks or Pixars Studios. This movie was alright in the animation part, but the plot was just awful. Directed by Jimmy Hayward, the movie is about Reggie the Turkey (voiced by Owen Wilson) who always trying to warn turkeys about Thanksgiving. However, it's constantly fall on deaf ears. It wasn't until, he was saved, by being pardoned by the President (Jimmy Hayward), that he is able to find a way to eliminate turkeys from ever becoming part of the thanksgiving menu. With, the help of Jake (Woody Harrelson) of the Turkeys Liberation Front, both plan to steal the president's time machine S.T.E.V.E (George Takei) so that they can travel to 1621 to change Thanksgiving. Sadly, this movie was all over the place, with it's over cramped complex plot. First off, it doesn't make any logically sense. If you think, time travel logic paradoxes is a headache in other films. This movie really blows your mind off, on how dumb, it gets with the time travel plot lines. It didn't help, that the film is also full historical inaccuracies. While, I might not be the target age group for this film. I felt like kids are smarter than that. I really doubt, families are really looking forward to seeing this movie. After all, nothing says, spending time with your family on Thanksgiving, then watching a film making Thanksgiving traditions look like the Holocaust. Yes, every year, we kill an animal as part of a ritual sacrifice, put the dead body at the center of our tables, and pray and give thanks over it in some form of communion, but gees, movie. It's not like giving satanic rights. It's not that disturbing. There is nothing wrong, with eating turkey like there isn't nothing wrong with being a vegetarian. I love turkey, and there are several health benefits of eating turkey such as low in fat, while being high on protein. I hate the film, for portray the hunters of the old days as over the top villains. They were trying to survive and feed their children. Food is food. Thanksgiving is a feast, showing that we have learn to survive our environment. It's a holiday celebrating family, peace, togetherness, and fellowship. We celebrate Thanksgiving to remember how far we've come, and the importance of community. The genocide metaphors are somewhat interesting take of society. First off, the turkeys of the past in the film are given these Native American look to them. Reminds me of 2009's Avatar. They representing wild, smart and free. The film might be saying, like the Native American genocide over the years, turkeys have become tamed, dumb and caged in in farms, similar to how Native American were put into reservations. I find it, kinda offensive, but not too much. It could be that the turkeys in the film seem to have anthropomorphic attribution in representing more than Native Americans society. Turkeys could had, in fact, represent modern society as a whole. As technology gets better, the less and less we have to struggle to find food, the more we lose that survivable instinct that our ancestors had to go through to fight hunger. We become more factory and farm feed. Like the modern day turkey, we're caged in, dumb feed, the same things every day. Free birds is asking us to break free from those chains. I don't consider myself an animal right activist, but I can understand the overall message of the film. Despite the film good intentions, the makers of this film come off as preachy PETA propaganda nutjobs trying to forced free anti-Thanksgiving values messages. I really doubt it wanted to destroy Thanksgiving, but it came across like that. The movie does have some good moral lessons here, but it's really up to the parents here on what viewpoints, do they want to expose their children to. The movie also talks about atheism, feminism, and not blindingly following someone, and most of all, to question everything. I have to question on where was the humor in this film?! Like weeks old turkey, the humor was really dry. It was hit and miss, with mostly misses. Nobody was laughing at this movie at the theater. Even the kids, who usually laugh at anything, were silent, most of the time. This movie was no Chicken Run (2000). I was deeply looking for something like this. The voice acting is mediocre, but doesn't stand out like other animation films. The movie ending is horrible. It's give up without even trying to solve the loose ends. At less, its gives us a post-credit ending, explaining that. Overall: not a great watch. The movie can go plunk itself.",Free Birds
12,Reno-Rangan,Mission thanksgiving. The turkeys time to fight back!,7,24 June 2016,"It is definitely an underrated animation. Okay, I agree, Disney is solely dominating the animation industry, especially at present. But this film is no masterpiece like that Disney makes yet not bad to ignore complete. Yes, there are flaws in it, but very acceptable as they're just minors. In the animations, the real world logics won't apply. So you should try to enjoy it than trying to find the errors.This film is targeted for children, but then anybody can watch it because it is a beautiful theme with some real laughs in it, only if you forget that you are an adult for a 90 minute. Technically the film quality matches with Disney, Pixer, Dreamworks and even the Sony animation. It is a fine achievement for an outside/new production house to come up with like this. I hope Reel FX would make more animations in the future and compete directly with these top companies.It was really a star studded cast. I did not know who were they all, but I identified them by their voices. As far as the story, too easy to predict, but somehow it managed to keep me glued to it with its entertaining contents. It is a time travel theme and a quite entertaining film made by the 'Horton Hears a Who' director.Some are saying it is anti-thanking giving film, but I think it is just a fun film. Although, it was kind of like 'Happy Feet', where a bunch of turkeys tries to loose their kind from the humans grip. But narrated differently, something like in the line of 'Penguins of Madagascar'. I don't think anybody can regret watching it, but then there are people with expectations, so it might fail at them. Overall, it was a decent film for sure if not great as other animations that came in the same year. Waiting for its sequel about 'mission turducken'.7/10",Free Birds
13,leonblackwood,Funny in parts! 5/10,5,29 March 2014,"Review: I thought that this movie was quite funny. The ending was a bit corny but it is a kids movie after all. It's well written and the storyline wasn't too bad for the kids. The animation was average for nowadays standard, but the colours were vibrant and bright. I really liked the parts when the turkeys were talking to the screen and when the 2 beefy turkeys were challenging each other all of the time. Anyway, there is jokes for the kiddies and adults so it's fun for the whole family. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I didn't really know what to expect from this movie because I didn't hear that much about it when it came out. After watching the film I was surprised that it didn't get a bigger audience because it isn't that bad, but judging by the money that it made, at least it made double it's money back. With all of the buzz about Angry birds fading out and every concentrating on Candy Crush, they should have released thus movie a couple of years ago. Anyway, there isn't that much attention to detail with the feathers and backgrounds, but the film does work and I'm sure that we will be seeing a sequel.Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $110millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there animation movies about turkey's travelling in a time machine to try and save there species. 5/10",Free Birds

15,dwpollar,Hilarious & inventive animated movie...,8,26 November 2013,"1st watched 11/23/2013 – 8 out of 10(Dir-Jimmy Hayward): Hilarious & inventive animated movie about two turkeys who go back in time to try to change the fate of future turkey's ending up on the dinner table during this festive time of year. The writing in this comedic tale is spot on -- while the voice performances and animation are very well done. The only downside to the movie, in my opinion, is the lack of inclusion of the song Free Birdbut seriously this was a laugh-out-loud movie that really only slows down during an attempt to throw in some romance. Owen Wilson is the voice of the one-of-the-kind turkey in a stupid current flock as the only one who knows they are getting fattened up to enter their death. The president pardons him from being the main course on Thanksgiving and he is living the good life until he runs into a wild turkey searching out a time machine to turn things around for his kind. Woody Harrelson is the voice of the wild one and the time machine, ""Steve"", leads them back to before the first Thanksgiving. There is some amazing and hilarious animation done between Woody's character and the leader of the pack in the old world when they try to outdo each other in a macho contest. I was wildly surprised with this movie with it's lame idea but the humor and pacing was great --- the turkey love part was a little much – but other than that this animated movie was excellent.

The movie does start off kinda slow and dull, but after about the first 20 minutes goes by it actually gets good and becomes entertaining. There are many funny lines of dialogue between the different characters. And the characters are very likable. Is it going to be nominated for an Oscar? No. Does that mean it is bad? No. This film has a well written script and has good visuals. This movie is very family friendly and I think the adults and the kids will both like it.

18,burlesonjesse5,Animation isn't groundbreaking but Thanksgiving film is harmless fun anyway,7,7 May 2014,"If you can get past the fact that the animation is not entirely groundbreaking (I might have thought otherwise had I seen it in 3D), then you'll still find a satisfyingly, sweet natured element to the Thanksgiving themed Free Birds. With characters voiced by the likes of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson, ""Birds"" tells an interesting and enduring story about a band of turkeys (actual turkeys mind you) that come together to stop their species from becoming the main dinner item for thousands of future Thanksgivings. They do this by going back in time to the first day of its inaugural November inception back in 1621. Owen Wilson voices the main character who is Reggie. Reggie, who is teamed up with his polar opposite in Jake (voiced by Woody Harrelson), also falls in love with a resourceful female turkey in Jenny (Amy Poehler). The three of them along with many other of their determined kind, try to escape and outwit a band of colonel hunters led by an evil, gun toting pilgrim named Myles Standish (the sequences involving the Standish character harbor an element of cartoon violence that might have propelled the MPAA board to give this thing a PG rating).Despite the inclusion of the intense action sequences just mentioned (they might possibly upset really young kids ages 4-5 years old) and a rather limp opening 15 minutes, this is still a pretty solid family film. Watching it, you realize that the story counts here, not the lack of eye popping special effects. The ending which I can't give away, is equally surprising and somewhat inventive. The adult humor which animation flicks add in to keep accompanying parents fitfully occupied, is good in equal bits here and there. The characters which are likable (Owen Wilson's Reggie is one you sympathize with and root for) and charismatically unlikable, don't fade in and out of the proceedings like in so many other types of computer-animated fare (with a large, varied cast).Overall, Free Birds doesn't quite set the world on fire. It's standardized, harmless fun that does just enough to get by. It also basically adheres to the same formula as any other computed generated exercise in the last decade (complete with a plot involving an innocent/ardently chosen main character followed by a love interest, an antagonist, a couple of protagonists, and a mentor/father figure). But it did come out at the perfect time in theaters (late November of course) and subjugates itself as a outdated yet satisfyingly grave, old fashioned kids movie. I recommend seeing it unless extravagant caricatures like the 3D Frozen and mega hit Despicable Me 2 are what you prefer. Free Birds to me, is something that might have been overlooked this holiday season based on its underwhelming box office take. It's the movie equivalent of a Thanksgiving food that you might have never ate. I say how do you know you won't like it, if you've never even tried it.",Free Birds
19,rannynm,Turkeys Have Feelings Too!,9,31 October 2013,"You should think twice before you eat that Thanksgiving turkey this year! Especially after you watch the movie, ""Free Birds""! This is a wonderful animated comedy, packed with lots of action and adventure. Two turkeys team up to travel back in time to try to take turkey off the Thanksgiving menu for good. If this doesn't sound funny enough, these two turkeys have nothing in common with each other, argue constantly, and run into some hilarious situations when they travel back to pilgrim days. In order to change the course of history, the turkeys, Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson), must first learn to get along and put aside their differences. Reggie is a smart, although a rather lazy and weak turkey, while Jake is a strong and brave turkey, but very dumb. This duo makes for some great comedy! Then a female turkey that Reggie has a crush on makes it even funnier! This role of Jenny is voiced by the very funny Amy Poehler, which could not have been cast any better. The director, Jimmy Hayward, also directed ""Horton Hears a Who!"" He is also known for his work on ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc.,"" and many more great animated hits. The soundtrack for ""Free Birds"" is also great.My favorite scene in this movie is when Jake rescues a bunch of baby turkeys, chicks, from a blazing fire. These adorable, tiny puffballs are clinging to his feathers, and looking up at this massive hero with huge eyes. It is just too cute! ""Free Birds"" is a family movie that is great for all ages.

20,eric262003,This Film's For the Birds,4,8 August 2021,"Okay so not every animated movie has to focus on a certain holiday based theme or an isse that is of great concern, but this movie ""Free Birds"" could've provided something for us with a little spark or some level of entertaiment for both kids and adults could enjoy. It ranks quite low on the entertainment level, lacks in anything regarded as funny, and never seems to poke fun at the basis of Thanksgiving traditions. Though the cartoon elements will hace an appeal to the kids due to it lightweight innocence, the movie has this weird fascination to trigger the traditions we've become accustomed to by rewiting history and change the landscape of our history. Sure the concept was interesting on paper, but ""Free Birds"" has these mood shifts that rock between taking a simple premise and then going all in to make matters more complex than it really should.Owen Wilson provides the voice of our leading turkey named Reggie who felt like an outcast to the other members of his species. Though quite aware of his surroundings, he knows why his fellow turkeys are getting fattened up, mainly because as a time-honoured tradion, they are soon going become chow for Thanksgiving. Reggie is given full pardon from the President where he later retreats to Camp David where he is living more comfortably consuming pizza along with the joys of telenovelas. Suddenly a spontaneous fellow turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson) on sends Reggie on machine to find secret time machine where they will teleport back to 1621 to stop the pilgrims from killing turkeys so that they could freely from ever becoming Thanksgiving dinner. Climbing into a machine known as Steve (George Takei) to 1621, they see turkeys on the threat of getting killed and eaten against an evil hunter (Colm Meaney) and a female turkey named Jenny (Amy Poehler) who's the chief's daughter and a love interest for Reggie. Under the direction from Jimmy Hayward who almost had his directing job killed with the god-awful ""Jonah Hex"", Heyward has decided to return to his roots like a comeback for him to some extent. Though works out nicely as a comedy and might do some levels of service to keep the younger age demographics enthralled in its 90 minute duration, with its quick pacing and energy. However it's very helf-baked in its efforts to please older viewers due to the repetitive turkey puns, muddled one-liners and formulaic slapstick. The idea of time travel is hardly made reference to even to be labeled as an afterthought. The movies focuses primarily Reggie and his fixation for pizza as a form of anything deemed hilarious and Jake just acting wild and dumb. This whole theme eventually gets stale very fast. And while it might have some level of intrigue at first glance, the gags lack adventure and the spark quickly short-circuits.The idea of traveling through time had potential to something of intrigue, nothing ever seems mentioned of it. While staying in the year 1621, there was no conflicts between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans instead the sacrificial birds are the ones putting up a fight against the Pilgrims. And sure iconic movie time-traveling classics like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures"" have their titles mentioned in this movie, ""Free Birds"" hardly ever focuses on time-travel to even get noticed. It's such a shame that a perpetually underrated performer a like George Takei's talents are wasted just like the machine he voices, it gets rendered under the category of missed opportunity while emphasis of the movie is saturated with mundane conflicts and uninteresting characters.The climax to the movie which should be the most excing scenes that sets up to an all-out confrontation misses the mark completely. They kill off a principal character, but not in conflicting way, but more in a manipulative matter just to generate reaction over suspense, fear or anger. The whole fireball incident was really only set up to keep those bored folks a level of noise to wake us up. It didn't need to come off dark, but some cartoon violence for a bit of laughs would have been sufficient.Yes I understand that ""Free Birds"" is a comedy played for laughs and not to be taken seriously. But if this was about turkeys fighting for their quest for survival to rewrite history where turkeys are not being eaten traditionally every Thanksgiving, this film is not entirely focused on animal rights. After all Reggie's pizza is topped with pepporoni and anchovies, enough said? There was a lack of research when writing this movie to regard this as accurate. Sure there were funny lines and some quotes were quite memorable (especially from Poehler). It's still badly flawed, uninspiring and overall forgettable that makes you just want to forget about this turkey of a movie.",Free Birds
21,moviexclusive,"Even though it doesn't quite take you on flights on imagination, this briskly paced action adventure still moves fast enough on the ground to be an entertaining diversion",6,30 October 2013,"Thanksgiving isn't a big occasion this side of the world, but even those with a most rudimentary knowledge of it will know that turkeys – lots of them – are consumed on that very day (preferably with cranberry sauce). 'Horton Hears a Who's' Jimmy Hayward's 'Free Birds' plays on that holiday tradition by imagining the unlikely scenario where an independent-minded turkey unwittingly teams up with a plucky (pardon the pun) member of his species to go back in time and reverse the establishment of that tradition.Like many such tales, our hero Reggie (Owen Wilson) is an underachiever who is looking for something more in his existence beyond being just another member of his species. So while the rest of the turkeys on the farm are immediately lured by food in the farmer's hand and think by extension that he is their friend, Reggie is all too aware that the farmer only intends to fatten them up so he can slaughter them - and no, he also isn't deluded that they will therefore end up in 'turkey heaven'.Reggie's journey starts when he is chosen among millions of his ilk to be pardoned by the President of the United States and sent to a protected reserve. Unfortunately, it is also at that place where he meets Jake (Woody Harrelson), the President - and we might add, only member - of the Turkeys Liberation Front who claims he is answering a calling from the Great Turkey that visited him years ago to go back in time to the first Thanksgiving and stop turkeys from becoming the holiday meal. It's a classic case of mismatched partners, but thanks to some witty lines from Hayward and his co-scripter Scott Mosier, there is still some amusement to be had amidst the familiarity.It isn't just make believe though - there is indeed a time machine to be found in the Government lab that Reggie and Jake break into, and with that, an actual time travel to the year1622. Oh, and did we mention that in between the mission of saving his species, Reggie finds additional motivation in the form of a love interest? That'll be Jenny (Amy Poehler), courageous where Reggie is terrified and altogether too attractive for the glib-tongued Reggie to resist.As far as toons go, this one hardly pushes the narrative limits of imagination. You can almost predict that Reggie will be confronted with a crucial turning point whether to stay with his flock or return to the comfort of his old life back at the reserve - and for that matter, if he will rise to the occasion to be a better fowl. In fact, Hayward demands a fair bit of suspension of belief by playing it fast and loose with the conundrums of time travel, especially as he and Mosier try to make the disparate events across time and space tie together into one coherent whole. We warn you - it doesn't take anyone with more than a bird brain to tell that they are clutching at straws, so you'd be advised to simply accept the creative liberties they take with logic and just plain common sense.To his credit, Hayward does a pretty fine job with the animation. The detail can't quite match up to established studios like Disney/ Pixar and Dreamworks, but this maiden effort from Reel FX Studios is colourful, energetic, and still visually captivating stuff to keep the young ones glued to their seats. Everything also moves at a pretty fast clip, and even if it does rely on familiar plot and character tropes, at no point does it get boring or repetitive. Hayward also has to thank his enthusiastic voice cast for that, in particular Wilson and Harrelson deliver their respective parts with much gusto.And so even though Thanksgiving as a holiday doesn't quite resonate as much here as it does in the United States, the humour, fun and excitement that it offers for kids and less demanding adults is universal. The best reassurance we can give is that it isn't a 'turkey'; in fact, despite being entirely formulaic, it still is an entertaining diversion for families, especially for those looking for a cinematic equivalent of a babysitter.",Free Birds
22,blumdeluxe,Underrated,7,10 February 2019,"""Free Birds"" tells the story of a very special turkey who is through a series of unexpected events catapulted into 17th century, trying to stop the first pilgrims from eating his kind on Thanksgiving.I didn't expect too much from this film but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. In my eyes there are some really nice characters and a good sense of humor present in the production and even though the plot is not a big surprise (as in almost every children's movie) it is solid enough to keep you watching and entertained. The message of the film is not wrong, it is not offensive and suitable for children of all ages.All in all I don't really understand all the negativity towards this movie. It is witthout question no masterpiece but a film I could imagine to rewatch at times and still having fun doing so. What really can you expect more from a movie about time-traveling turkeys?",Free Birds

This movie does enough to be mildly entertaining but contains few moments that will make you laugh, especially considering that this is supposed to be an animated 'comedy'.The film is silly and perhaps the filmmakers were expecting to get laughs out of the plot alone, but this isn't the case. I can see younger viewers enjoying this film, obviously kids are the primary target audience, but even so I doubt they would choose this over the many other, vastly superior, animated comedies.'Free Birds' is a sufficiently entertaining animated film, but it lacks the laughs to consider it a comedy success.",Free Birds
24,bankofmarquis,A Fun Thanksgiving flick,7,26 November 2020,"When asked to list films worth watching that have a Thanksgiving theme, the BankofMarquis likes to pull out a little animated gem that came and went pretty quickly in 2013 - FREE BIRDS - starring the voices of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson as 2 turkeys that go back in time in an egg-shaped time machine named STEVE (voiced by George Takei - more on that later) to stop the first Thanksgiving. This film succeeds more than it doesn't.The first full length animated feature film from REEL FX (one of only 2 they have put out thus far) FREE BIRDS suffers from that kiss of death - multiple writers revising the script over time. Directed by JImmy Hayward (HORTON HEARS A WHO), who is also credited with writing this film alongside long time Kevin Smith collaborator Scott Mosier,FREE BIRDS is actually a pretty fun film, despite the disjointedness of the plot.Credit should go to the stellar voice cast, led by Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson. They have tremendous chemistry together and are a fun pair to watch. Joining them is the always dependable Amy Poehler (who would shine as the voice of Joy years later in Pixar's INSIDE OUT). It was fun spending an hour and a half with these 3 - and the others in this cast: Colm Meaney, David Keith and Dan Fogler.But, for me, the star of this film is Star Trek's George Takei as the voice of S.T.E.V.E (the egg-shaped time machine device). He understands what type of film he is in and delivers just the right blend of comedy and seriousness that helps elevate the proceedings. And that is good for, as I stated above, the plot is a bit disjointed, so I would recommend you just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.The critics panned this film, but it made over $110 million at the box office (more than doubling it's production cost), so many, many moviegoers had the same, fun experience that I did.And...you will, too...if you give FREE BIRDS a try.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Free Birds

Stop trying to drag ratings down for a harmless animated children's film.

Most of the animated films of the last couple of years have been so totally dumbed down that they just don't have enough of that subtle stuff that keeps the adults amused as well. So this is a nice change, really. Woody Harrelson﻿ and Owen Wilson﻿ do a great job pulling off a Turkey buddy movie with Time travel. I don't know how terribly racist some people might take this movie, and I really don't care all that much. There were no Turkeys at the first Thanksgiving, but that doesn't matter either. The point of the movie is finding a place that you belong, and to never give up trying. Nothing really much else. There are some good solid chuckles in here, and the animation is really good. This one will be on repeat in your home for a while if you have the young'nses running around.

Soon, Reggie & Jake find themselves going back in time and get caught up in the middle of a turkey clan's fight for survival all while trying to avoid becoming dinner themselves.Free Birds is another cracker of a movie from DreamWorks and is a movie that the whole family will enjoy. I've read reviews of people complaining about the storyline and that the idea of turkeys going back in time is ridiculous. I've got news for all you moaners...it's an animated movie! Get over it! Is it any more ridiculous than a snail racing in the Indy 500, or a scientist who makes it rain food? Animated movies aren't restricted to ""rules"" and are supposed to be fun, which is exactly what Free Birds is.There are a lot of good funny moments in this movie including Jenny's droopy eye (the timing of which is done masterfully), the constant contests between Jake & Ranger, and the few in-jokes the movie has (the Angry Birds reference for one) as well. The animation - as we have come to expect from animated movies these days - is superb and is crystal clear in Blu-ray and the cast do a fantastic job with their characters.I could go on, but I'll just end by saying that Free Birds is a great movie and is very much recommended, so ignore the ridiculous hate and give it a shot.",Free Birds

Kids are too dumb to like anything else."" The only real saving grace this film has is the fact the voice actors are all talented and doing their jobs great. However, it's the rest of the film that makes it terrible and infuriating when it comes to the end.The story feels like copious amounts of drugs were used to write it and more drugs were used to ignore the numerous plot holes and paradoxes that come from their use of time travel. The jokes are so bad that I can't even imagine kids could laugh at it (despite what Hollywood tells you, kids DO have a sense of humor) and the end just infuriated me because, and I say this without spoiling much, the film is literally resolved thanks to product placement.""Free Birds"" isn't a movie; it's just an hour and a half long commercial put into some very cheap looking and generic animation that looks like it belongs with those Direct-to-DVD, bargain bin DVDs that are always in Wal-Mart and looks like no one but confused grandparents buy.Hi!

Probably not recommended for those over 10 years old or sober as it doesn't make much sense. However, the animators do put a lot of color on the screen although their anthropomorphization of the turkeys is so extensive they look more like purple aliens with very short, spiky hair. The increasingly irritating and one-note Owen Wilson leads as himself in a cast that includes Woody Harrelson who should by all that is right be doing something better with his time. Woofully underused George Takei acts as intermittent narrator in the time travel device called ""S.T.E.V.E"" (""TARDIS"" was already taken). The writers provide a couple of decent jokes: Guard: ""What kind of contaminant is it?"", Other Guard: ""A turkey, how should we address it."", Guard: ""With cranberry sauce, heh, heh, heh..."") but generally try to stay out of the way of the ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""-style range war pitting colonists against slow, slow-witted, flightless, harmless foul.

The rest of the story is bordering on genius story telling to go along with impressive animation, covering subtleties like feathers to water to fuse burning.Sadly, Disney bought its way into the Academy awards with Frozen, so the only way this was getting in was by replacing another genius story with less impressive animation like Ernest & Celestine.

This is a completely different film. After a turkey named Reggie is kicked out of his farm for warning the turkeys about how dumb they are for accepting corn from the farmer, because he knows what's going to happen on Thanksgiving, he's pardoned by the President of the U.S. (it's not Obama, he actually looks and sounds more like Bill Clinton) he spends his time watching Spanish telenovelas and ordering pizza. But when another turkey, Jake, convinces him to go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to prevent turkeys from becoming the main course, things get turned upside down. See? Completely different from Chicken Run. It's no surprise that Pixar had some involvement in this, although its not technically a Pixar film. By the way, it's not historically accurate (obviously) but the film felt it needed to make that point known at the beginning of the film with a disclaimer that reads: ""The events in this film are fictitious. Except for talking turkeys, those are totally real."" Along with Doctor Who references, it also manages to poke fun of other time travel films, like Back to the Future. This movie is just absolutely hilarious, but since the people who run the Academy now clearly don't appreciate great films (i.e. Brave winning instead of Wreck-It Ralph for Best Animated Film) this probably won't be nominated for that category. And even if it is, it most likely will not win. They just are biased towards Pixar. Oh, well. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",Free Birds

Its like a mad scientist combined Back To The Future with Turkeys. This is a movie that made me go ""Huh?"" and ""What?"" for the next 87 minutes of my life. This movie is one of the most random, careless animated movies I have seen in a while (Something like Foodfight!) This movie is full of sexual and gay overtones for some reason. Don't know why but Im sure they have reasons for putting it in.The movie is about a Turkey played by Owen Wilson who I will call Owen Wilson Turkey. He is adopted by the president who looks ugly (Animation isn't that good on him) and seems to be a Bill Clinton Sound alike. He likes to watch awful Spanish soap operas and eat pizza. When Woody Harrelson Turkey says he is chosen for a mission to stop thanksgiving.

Obviously, Owen Wilson wants the girl so decides to help.Im not going to talk about how stupid this movie sounds. Because everyone has. So lets get on to what is wrong with this film.The jokes are not funny for one thing. No duh, thats obvious. The movie is full of butt and Peck jokes that are overused. The acting... um... well I can say this. The acting is not really good. Mainly because the Wilson, Harrelson and Poehler sound so uninterested in the content of the script.Also... I began to notice at the end that this movie seemed to resemble this one other movie. The highest grossing movie of all time. Nominated for Best Pic- OH RIGHT AVATAR! This movie is basically a rip off of Avatar except with no aliens, but with a vegan message. They live in a tree also with rituals and stuff. How can you not see that this is Avatar? Aside from that, characters are not used enough. There are two stupid characters who we barely see. I know they are side characters, but they should at least have enough time as other characters! The movie breaks time itself and yet the universe doesn't implode. Had the writers even watched Back To The Future? One of my favorite films? Nope. I guess they haven't.Oh. You want to know what the worst joke in this entire movie is? SOMETHING THATS POP CULTARE? HERE IT IS!: ""Those Are Some Angry Birds."" AAAAAAAAH! *SLAMS HEAD AGAINST A WALL AND HEAD GOES THROUGH IT* Oh god. Now that Im over that line. The villain is non threatening and I do not care about anyone in the movie. They are just one note characters with no personality or any sense of humor.There is one plot hole at the end. So Wilson Turkey brings the pizza guy to give pizza to everyone. But here is the thing. What if they decide to start putting turkey on pizzas in the future? I have no clue.There is so much to talk about but my word count is going up.Is Free Birds A Bad Movie? Yes. Is It A Awful Film? No. Its a movie so bad its speechless. Not like that oh my god I hate this film so much speechless the kind of speechless where you don't know how to explain what you just watched.

36,punisherversion1,Time traveling turkeys not so fun after all.,4,30 November 2017,"245: Free Birds. An animated movie about time traveling turkeys who venture back to the first Thanksgiving to save turkeys from becoming the dish of choice going forward. This sounded like a very strange movie and usually strange movies pique my interest, this one did so I decided to give it a try. The creative team clearly stopped after time traveling turkeys. All the jokes are in the first 20 minutes of the movie and after that it becomes a standard animated movie where the turkeys fight off the settlers before we reveal an important character trait that changes everything going forward. The first 20 minutes were pretty funny and had some clever bits but after that, it become a slog to get through. The characters become irritating. I understand that this is a kids movie. I've enjoyed kids movies in the past. I'm a little goofy and silly myself from time to time. The idea of time traveling turkeys drew me into the tent to see the show. It just could not live up to the other end of the bargain. The other odd thing about the turkeys in the past which threw me off was the fact that some of them resembled native Americans even though we had the human versions in the movie already. Not everyone in the flock was like this, one of them was a short angry bird looking fool who spoke with a caricatured Italian accent. This movie was pilfering from quite a few other films. It had some bits of Avatar thrown in there. It had a lot of Avatar actually. This is a bit of a spoiler if you've not seen Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.......It had the ending of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes where an egg looking shuttle comes back from the past in the middle of the battlefield to stop the fighting. I imagine this was meant to be parody. In the end, this had a nugget of a funny idea but didn't know what to do with it. I give this film a D.",Free Birds
37,Animated_Antic,A very stupid and bland movie.,4,22 May 2018,"Sometimes a movie has a plot that is so ridiculous that you think it's honestly a joke. A movie with a premise so insane and absurd that the trailer for it seems like a fake one that you would find on the internet. ""Free Birds"" is one of them. Ever since I saw the first trailer for this movie back when I saw ""Monsters University"", I legitimately thought it was a joke. I couldn't believe that a movie with a plot as ridiculous as this could ever be made, but here we are. A movie about two turkeys that time travel to stop the first Thanksgiving, and it's just as bad as you could've imagined. Here's why this movie doesn't work.A turkey named Reggie (Owen Wilson) has recently been pardoned by the President of the United States and has been enjoying a life of luxury at Camp David. For a while now, he's been doing nothing but eating pizza from Chuck E. Cheese's (the only pizza company this movie could afford) and binge watching on a Mexican soap opera. He is then kidnapped by another turkey named Reggie (Woody Harrelson) who tells him that the ""Great Turkey"" told him to find him and bring him to a time machine to stop turkeys from being put on the Thanksgiving menu. To do this, they must go in an egg shaped time machine and traveling back to 1621 to stop the Pilgrims led by Myles Standish (Colm Meaney) from setting up the first Thanksgiving feast. Once they arrive in the past, they run into a group of native turkeys led by Chief Broadbeak (Keith David), his daughter Jenny (Amy Pohler) and his son Ranger (Jimmy Hayward). Despite the natives reluctance to fight back, Reggie and Jake decide to stay with the turkeys in hopes that they can convince the others to help stop the first Thanksgiving. There's more plot I could discuss, but that would get into spoiler territory.After the film was over, I was shocked to find out that the director of this movie also directed ""Horton Hears A Who!"" at Blue Sky. Though where that film had some good writing from Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio who would later join Illumination, this film has some really bad writing. Just from the brief plot synopsis, you could already tell how bad the story is. It honestly feels like a really unfunny joke being stretched out into an hour and half long movie. Not only that, the ending for this movie (which I won't spoil) is absolutely terrible. It's honestly one of the worst endings you could have come up with for a movie like this, and given this movie's plot, that's not saying a lot. The animation is also not very good which is a shame because it's coming from a pretty good studio. The animation studio Reel FX made this movie and are notable for successfully taking certain Looney Tunes characters like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner and turning them into computer animated characters. I don't know why but something about the animation here just seemed off to me. It felt a little unpolished and looked like it was made for a direct to DVD release and not a movie made for theaters and I found it pretty unforgivable. As for the characters, I found some of them likable but the others annoying and forgettable. I did like the characters of Reggie and Jenny and the likable chemistry the two had together, but I found Jake incredible annoying and tiresome and the other characters just forgettable. In fact, I mostly forgot about them by the time the film ended.Though honestly, forgetting about ""Free Birds"" is probably for the best. The plot was so stupid, the animation was pretty mediocre and while some of the characters were likable, the others were annoying or forgettable. There are other Thanksgiving movies out there, and in my opinion I think this is the right turkey to skip.",Free Birds

Still, the main characters (none other than the turkeys) and supporting characters (the time machine named S.T.E.V.E and the human such as the pizza guy, the president and his daughter) are quite likable, comical and adorable to a certain extent!In short, this movie has the ability to make us laugh and laughter is good for our health. I guess ultimately, the creators only wanted to convey that pizza is more than delicious and filling; it can bring people (and animals) together! Talk about the importance of food!Probably really, Free Birds (2013) is the greatest turkey movie of all time!",Free Birds
39,MsMovie,Not worth the price of a ticket!,3,7 November 2013,"Bear in mind, I am writing this from the perspective of a parent who just shelled out for kids tickets, my ticket, concession stand, and it wasn't cheap, and then to have this movie be SO awful and SO boring (yes, my kids called it boring!), well, I am very disappointed.All of the funny-seeming parts were in the trailer, and when you see them in the context of the movie they aren't very funny either. I was in a packed theater and there was hardly any laughing going on at all - that is a very bad thing. Laughter is contagious, but not in this film!The voice acting was average at best, although Owen Wilson was good, but one turkey cannot carry an entire movie, especially when the plot was so lame.The animation itself was OK, but without a decent story and characterizations, a movie is going to fail, and this one did big time! We didn't expect factually accurate obviously, you'd have to be crazy to think it was, but we were hoping the humans wouldn't be portrayed as either total morons OR really evil and vicious. Pixar doesn't show humans that way in Toy Story, neither did Turbo or Despicable Me 2.This movie is a definitely wait for it in Redbox etc, or even wait for it to come on TV. If you have 2 kids or more, you're going to be paying out a lot of cash for a trip to the movies to see this and you will be horribly disappointed.Highlight of the movie was the trailers BEFORE the movie - which showed us a couple of upcoming animated movies that might actually be good.The one thing I will say for the movie is they had great marketing - they suckered us in on election day in VA when we had nothing better to do, but let this review be your warning, go see SOMETHING ELSE!",Free Birds
40,tyson-hunsaker,"A bizarre, uneven, and sloppy animation too funny for its own good.",4,28 November 2016,"Free Birds isn't a movie to be taken too seriously and if you're watching it with your kids, probably best to not pay attention to its narrative or plot. The story goes from strange to completely bizarre and the pacing is noticeably bad. Despite its strong opening, this movie suffers from a script that had to have been so rushed it barely made the release. It also suffers from unlikable characters and ""what the.."" moments. To say it's a bad movie would accurately describe my feelings toward this holiday themed train wreck.All this being said, to say it doesn't have good sides would be a great disservice. First of all, this film is for kids and chances are, your 5-12 year old will probably sit through it and enjoy themselves. For the rest of us, there are a few intelligent and, quite honestly, funny jokes that make this a potential guilty pleasure. Animation itself is quite strong in most places. In fact, it's quite impressive animation considering it's competition (with better stories) compete well in the effects department. Color is vivid and the image is clear and sharp which makes any animation easier to watch.Unfortunately, the few intelligent jokes and references doesn't save this film. Although it serves its purpose of entertaining the kids for a few hours while the parents nap from the Thanksgiving dinner, it doesn't forgive the incredibly poor story and painful experience it is of sitting through this film. Better to find a different holiday animation flick.",Free Birds
41,Clank_Zoka,"Maybe Not the Worst, But Properly the Most Stupidest Animated Film I've ever seen",2,8 July 2017,"Before the fantastic The Book of Life, Reel FX gave us Free Birds and It is one of the most laziest and annoying animated comedies I have ever seen, the characters are not all that memorable, the story is stupid, the jokes are generically juvenile. I know It's a comedy and Your not to supposed to take It seriously, but I just didn't care what was going on.The only good things is the animation is half-way decent, It has some funny/quiet moments but that's not saying much, the Voice-Acting Is passable from Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler.Not much else to say but just bad, not the worst but defiantly Top 5, I'll say It's on par with the Nut Job being just mediocre.Watch the Book of Life instead of this, It's not worth your money.I'm giving this a 2/10.",Free Birds
42,Wirxaw,Fair is fair.,5,30 March 2014,"Well, first of all I will agree with the majority of reviews - the movie isn't brilliant or groundbreaking. It doesn't have strong sides or advantages. It's plot is recycled. But... at least it doesn't have that much disadvantages either.Sure, some comical cliché is present, but overall the script is rather... balanced. Some moments are sillier than others, but movie is watchable without cringes and twitches. There are no moments that reek of clinical mental illness during writing, or unnecessary exaggerations. Cute is cute, cheesy is cheesy, fun is fun.Compared to other two unorthodox recent movies, Despicable Me 2 and Meatballs 2, this movie is still better because it has less bad than good. And that's better, than less good than bad. It doesn't have imbecilic animation, it doesn't have intendedly deranged characters(and not in direct sense).So I give this 5. It doesn't deserve more by any means. But it doesn't revolt so much for less.",Free Birds

I keep reading, people saying there is a message. There is NO MESSAGE here. It's just fun. It's so bad it's good. The plot didn't make any sense and that's what was funny about it.I'm very relieved to finally see an animated movie made just for fun and without feeling the need to add an unnecessary message or plot or emotional attachment.

46,therunner42,Not Brilliant but Fun Anyway,7,12 January 2014,"This movie got some tremendously bad user reviews but my little girls were desperate to see it . Free Birds tells the story who of a turkey who tries to change history by going back in time to make turkeys a non-choice at Thanksgiving. Being Australian I had no interest in Thanksgiving and being an adult I had no interest in turkeys. I had resigned myself to 90 minutes of playing with my phone (hidden from view under a blanket). However, I found this movie fun and interesting. It disregards history with wild abandon and this makes it even more funny. Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson are great as the two key characters. There are real laugh out loud moments and my two girls loved the president's daughter the most saying her lines over and over in the car. Look it won't be the greatest movie you ever see and it certainly isn't at the standard of Frozen (but little boys make like it more). However, it is a fun way to spend the holidays and the four of us had a great afternoon.",Free Birds
47,filmfanperspective,Cinematic tryptophan!! (**),4,5 May 2015,"It's important to preface this review with two things. First, I gave my child the choice of which movie he wanted to see between this and ""Ender's Game"". Without skipping a beat, he said ""FREE BIRDS!"". Also, it bears mentioning that I'm not a fan of vocal leads Owen Wilson OR Woody Harrelson, and I actively try to avoid seeing movies they're in. Sometimes it's unavoidable, like seeing ""Wag the Dog"" and having Woody surprise me with his presence. Keeping these things in mind, I didn't think there would be much to whet my appetite; truth be told, there isn't a great deal here to enjoy for kids or adults, but at least I can say that I didn't abhor the experience, and it's family friendly. If that does anything for you.The idea is that turkeys are people, too. Yep. One turkey (Owen Wilson), who is 'different than all the others' (hence his purple visage), manages to become the one turkey the president pardons. The first daughter keeps him as a pet, and in the process, he orders pizza, watches telenovelas, and all while the humans are cool with the apparent personification of the turkey. The powerful turkey does not raise any red flags with humans of the present day, an interesting fact when contrasted with the humans from the past in the SAME MOVIE.Did I say humans of the past? I did! That's right, our hero turkey meets another powerful turkey (Harrelson), who has one goal in mind- travel back in time to get turkeys off the thanksgiving menu. This other powerful turkey has been able to (without opposable thumbs): infiltrate top-secret government plans on time-travel research, get past the secret service, defy physics and get into the time-travel 'egg', etc, and SUCCEEDS. Adding to the silliness is the fact that the film shows us that humans can't understand the gobbles of turkeys (obviously), but the time capsule (with a navigation system voiced by George Takei) understands the turkeys perfectly (of course). I'm willing to suspend disbelief for most animated films, but this film takes complicated subjects and plays with them so lazily I couldn't help but get perturbed.Once our 'hero turkeys' reach the past and the Plymouth settlement, the film makes the most sense, and has the most fun. The interaction among the film's main characters, while standard fare, makes the most sense, and provides a couple of laughs. Again, it's nothing new, though. The most damning representation of the value of this film was in the reaction of my child, though, who seemed disinterested, and in fact, ready to nap about an hour into the film during the colonial scenes.The film's co-writer and producer, Scott Mosier, is a frequent collaborator of Kevin Smith. My problem with all of Smith's movies has been the laziness of the script to not expound on a good original idea. While it's not ultimately his responsibility, I sense the same thing with this film from Mosier and crew. It's not terrible, but the original, silly idea of altering the future of turkeys is unfortunately extrapolated over 90 minutes of typical character development, confounding science, and nonsensical decision-making by the humans in the film, who supposedly have much larger brains/brain capacity. I certainly didn't feel compelled to think, laugh, or enjoy myself for most of the film.",Free Birds

49,Lomax343,Take an Eight-Year-Old,6,14 December 2013,"I saw this film recently with my eight-year-old son. He loved it, I didn't. I didn't exactly hate it (there have been films he's taken me to where I've had to shut my eyes and stick my fingers in my ears), but it was poorly conceived, lazily written, and disappointingly lacking in zest and humour.In terms of plot this is basically Chicken Run (a kids' film I DID enjoy) crossed with American folklore, time-travel, and saccharine morality. The end product is a bit of a mess.OK, it's a film pitched at the under-tens, and on that level it succeeds. It IS, however, possible to create an animated film that will hold the interest of adults while still wowing the kids; but for this you need to put in more effort. The plot doesn't have to be totally believable, but it should be coherent; and while slapstick can be funny, it isn't always funny just because it's slapstick. And it's not a crime to include a few jokes that the kids will miss but the adults will get (this film has exactly one).Films like this are part of the price of parenthood. Since, as I say, my son loved it, I can't really hold a grudge against it, but I was hoping for more.",Free Birds

This movie made me cry, I enjoyed the creative take on the historical setting, and the plot was creative and managed to not be too clique. The cast is almost entirely comedic actors like Owen Wilson and George Takei. However, despite most of these actors being normally associated with comedy, they were able to voice characters who could be serious in addition to being funny. Sadly most comedic actors can't find work outside of b movies and kids films, so when you see a kid's film with their names on it you expect something special. This was something special. I appreciated how the cast performed again at their most silliest and their most serious. I get that it's still a kids movie that for some people can end up as nothing more then a time waster, but there are people who can enjoy it. The ending was funny as well. Some of the scenes were funny, but some were extremely sad. Now it's kind of impossible outside of Disney to find an animated kids movie that doesn't include pop culture references. However, the pop culture references are kept to a minimum here and it's an honest effort to tell a sad but silly story in a historical setting.",Free Birds
53,brickmoviereviews,Free Birds: Family Friendly Holiday Fun,6,3 November 2013,"Who doesn't love Thanksgiving? Thanksgiving has everything: football, arguing family members, and of course, the turkey. Thanksgiving is loved by just about everyone, except the turkey. Directed by Jimmy Hayward, Free Birds is about two turkeys, Jake and Reggie (Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson), who team up to travel back in time to change the course of history and take turkey of the Thanksgiving menu forever.Growing up on a turkey farm, Reggie was always the outcast. He was small, thin, and had a blue head, while the other turkeys were all large, strong, and red headed. Unlike the other turkeys in his flock, Reggie was smart. He knew that the farmer was raising the turkeys for a Thanksgiving feast. After years of warnings from Reggie, the flock finally believed him when the eldest turkey confirmed that Reggie was telling the truth. As Reggie tries to rally the flock and stick together, they instead sacrifice Reggie to save themselves. Petrified, Reggie awaits his gruesome fate, until he learns that he will not be eaten, but instead he is this Thanksgiving's turkey pardoned by the president, and then given to his daughter as a pet.Now the most important turkey in the country, Reggie begins to live out his luxurious life. He watches Spanish television, orders boxes on top of boxes of pizza, and even walks around the house in pink bunny slippers. Things are going perfectly for Reggie, until he is kidnapped by Jake, another turkey, and recruited on Jake's mission, courtesy of ""The Great Turkey,"" to travel back to the first Thanksgiving to rid of the turkey-eating Thanksgiving tradition. After reaching a secret government base, Jake and Reggie find the Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy, or STEVE (voiced by George Takei), and travel back to Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621.Free Birds provides exactly what you would expect from an animated film. It is fun, and family friendly. It's a movie that will get the kids interested in the history of Thanksgiving, while it may deter them from eating turkey that day. This is a very kid-enjoyable movie. The plot is simple, the jokes are quick and quirky, and it actually followed the rules of time travel. Now, it certainly isn't the best animated movie of the year (Monsters University), but it definitely isn't the worst of the year either (ehmm, Turbo). It's definitely worthy of a family outing to the movie theater, and if you get the chance to watch in in 3D, do it.

Setting aside the fact that they probably weren't the main course if they were eaten at all, nobody should have expected this to be anything but a cheap kid's movieThe story feels like copious amounts of drugs were used to write it and more drugs were used to ignore the numerous plot holes and paradoxes that come from their use of time travel. The jokes are so bland that I find it hard kids would enjoy it and the ending I found even more infuriating which serves no greater purpose for education.The animation is very poor, the character movements re very stiff as though it's a slow frame rate. The acting is atrocious. There are scenes that are just plain wrong, like the animals getting stoned by a crowd of people. How on earth that got approved is beyond me. I find it shameful that a celebrated cast such as Owen Wilson, Woodey Harrelson, and Amy Poehler (who all know how to give real comedy) would be in this garbage of a film.This isn't a movie; it's just an hour and a half long commercial put into some very cheap looking and generic animation that looks like it belongs with those Direct-to-DVD, bargain bin DVDs that are always in Wal-Mart and looks like no one but confused grandparents buy.For these reasons Free Birds gets 0/10.

It has a ton of very funny moments, pretty good character development, and a couple of tear-jerking moments as well. As far as any slams against religion or perceived liberal propaganda, people are taking this movie way too seriously and things are being taken out of context in my opinion. It has a lot of moral lessons such as appreciating your friends and family, giving up selfish desires, and sacrificing yourself for others. Free Birds is definitely on par with other CGI animated features, and for the first full movie being released by Reel FX (until now the studio has only done client work for other studios like 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., etc.), they've hit a home run right out of the gate!

61,lopezmaggivonkarma,"""Free Birds"" My modest review",1,3 April 2014,"""Freebirds"" is the first animated film for Reel FX studies, which are finding a niche to compete with the huge market of Disney, Dreamworks and (in a lesser extent) Blue Sky. While these large companies also calved low box office films (eg: Chicken Little), it is generally difficult to face these monsters, though some probed with an overly frenetic approach as ""The LEGO movie"" or ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2"", questionable artistic decisions but hit the public with success. But ""Free Birds"" betting with a new proposal, sank worldwide while garnered terrible reviews. Generally before writing a review, you usually look at the opinions of others to know if going in the right direction, but is not the first time a very good movie gets very bad press and then the same critics should change their opinion with the advancement of time (eg, ""A Clockwork Orange""). Unfortunately, there is little chance of reversing the situation with ""Free Birds"". From now come large portions of paragraphs explaining the operation of the film, but in a nutshell the only failure ""Free Birds"" is completely lacking in comedic timing(Warning: spoilers in this paragraph) Its argument is original, in part. Two turkeys want to stop the culture of roasted turkey on Thanksgiving, so time travel (like ""Terminator"", not like ""Back to the Future"") to the first day of Thanksgiving and remove the culture of turkey in the traditional menu of that day. Even at a time when there are so many coincidences to ""Mr Peabody and Sherman"", like a predecessor.That does not mean it's a bold argument: the film does not have the courage to show us a world without turkey on Thanksgiving day, and even replacing the turkey for the pizza is not as unpredictable because the course of the movieThe problem is that the company Reel FX is so desperate to make a successful film that rises directly on the proved formula, unassembled minimal process so that the assault is not as strident. The story begins with different turkey to rest (à la "" Ratatouille""), but as the film is not about that subject , all the discriminated turkey conflict is quickly discarded (in fact , You never know exactly why his teammates got kicked out of the farm). After 6 minutes the turkey already in the president's house eating pizza and watching a Mexican TV drama, but as the film is not about that issue quickly the turkey is placed in contact with an effusive Jake, which the writers crave develop as a kind of soldier ready for war, but also write a lot of jokes and gags Slapsticks for him, so that the character is not convincing anywhere. All the initial launch in the time machine is chaotic because the film does not give the nonsense never, desperate for a joke to hit the target at the public; but the slapstick humor is stilted (the entire sequence of the nut is absurd), and Jake jokes contradict his development as an expert to warOnce in 1621 year, is so sad to see how the film's own committee decides to invent some new characters that only overshadow the protagonists, and other decisions. Ranger is a bit more serious than Jake, but ""Free Birds"" can not forget about Jake and then they snap together with Ranger for a series of jokes that have nothing to do with the context. The gag dancing between these characters may or may not make you laugh, but is unrelated to the situation. Meanwhile the villains take up too much time overshadow Reggie. When Reggie should be the hero, the script offers a number of Deus Ex Machina (remote laser; time machine) that bombard his chance to be someone interesting and safe. Also the movie spend so much time to prove the formula for success that the background of Jake (a turkey freed by his mother and failed to bring some eggs to rebuild a family) arrives late and in the middle of an impending battle; whereby one assumes that Jake is not a super prepared for the battle but an excruciating unprepared which enters the war without much hesitationThis review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose nowhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/81602867766/free-birds-film- review",Free Birds

64,neighborlee_fromPalmer,Comic yet appropriately stark retelling of historical setting,10,13 February 2016,"It's too bad that some reviewing this splendidly made and acted movie, seem to either have no sense of humor, or void of it only , when its about animal rights issues or so it seems. Movie reviewing is about objectivity, and if none can be given, none should be offered. Thats only fair to the medium.It shouldn't matter, whatever the presumed 'goal' is in a movie, if its done with humor and accuracy and style, regardless, it should be judged solely on that, leaving politics out of it,- but since that was brought up, as someone whose diet resembles this movie on some grounds, was delighted to see such a topic presented in such high class with clever reference to historical data.ONe can only hope as a species, we advance as we learn about our surroundings, comically and otherwise , as the protagonists in this movie do. Without creating spoilers, the irony is stark in this one . Some say this was void of any plot, not that it needed to be deep given the storyline which doesn't need to be necessarily deep to convey meaning in this case, but simple or not, the writing is clever and the use of acting voices to convey parallels to other movies was very clever and well done. Some of the deepest irony in this was the dialogue about one choice over another, and when you hear it, you'll smile and realize the movie has more depth and candidness than you might have been expecting, and given a history many of us never know or may learn of, the character swap couldn't have been more acute and appropriate . Near the end, you will fully realize this ( likely before), and it will make you smile and given some of us a sense of justice next to sadness . This PG movie does not insist on that, because while it does have historical reference as noted earlier, it does it in a lighthearted as possible way for the entire family. Laughter matters even discussing important topics, and this does not disappoint.Birds become the twice removed ( think history) through clever use of anthropomorphism , making a point yet retaining smiles from the audience as well as humility.The movie has hilarious in context, and I didn't have to push myself, to laugh, so the comments about it not being funny, are absurd and made up facts at their worst. I""m not kidding, I laughed right off, not even a minute or two into the movie, so those saying otherwise must have judged the movie on other fronts, because it was funny and tons of people have already said as much. Different views notwithstanding most would find this hilarious in conjunction with more serious topics this movie explored.The stereotypes were rampant in this, which made it all the more funny, with yes, clear underlying tones of indicators as to why our food supply ideas and beliefs should be re-thought out. I'ts not a 'heavy hit' tone, but it's clearly there and appropriate. We grow as a specie as we evaluate our past and learn and elevate ourselves as a result; there is nothing ever wrong with appropriate introspection.THe movie is so funny though even through the stark imagery and notes to history, that after while that dissipates and you just laugh out loud even though hidden beneath the surface that kids likely will not get and prob. best, is a tempest in a teapot of a story that needs to be told; it was done in style, lightly enough for mostly a children's story but with enough historical reference to give adults pause of the history they are part of.I want to reiterate, that the movie made its points , clearly and efficiently, without hitting the subject too hard because laughter is good for all of us and sometimes it makes history easier to grasp and more desirable as well.Easily a 10, a must see for the entire family, noting the PG rating of course.",Free Birds
65,YinYangReviews,"Not Good, But At Least They Tried + Controversy",7,12 January 2020,"To be fair, I can't blame them. This was Reel FX's first original movie by themselves, the same company who made The Book Of Life. The first 20 minutes/ 1st Act of they movie would be the best part of the entire thing, the other parts lost balance and just made the movie average. This is a fun movie for families to watch as long as you don't think deeper.By the movie itself, I would give it a 5/10 but people are too harsh with this project. Again it's Reel FX's first original movie and people made this movie controversial by it's ""Anti""- Thanksgivings message. We are talking about time traveling turkeys for crying out loud, why are people taking this movie seriously? For that I'll change my rating to a 7/10(P.S Can I mention the Chuck E. Cheese partnership they did?)",Free Birds

Other than some unnecessary stereotyping of American Indians, it's actually quite fun. Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson play off each other beautifully, creating some good laughs. There's also a good cameo from George Takei as a sassy time machine. Things get a little off-beat at times - there's a scene with a flame thrower and another with a sacred time knob. These scenes will either make you laugh or roll your eyes. The movie could have done with a little trimming to pick up the pace, but it's otherwise a solid movie. Definitely worth watching. I would recommend this for younger kids, or those looking for some light-hearted entertainment. While not as good as your average Pixar or Miyazaki, it's no trash either.",Free Birds

But i enjoyed it i focused mainly on the ""hidden"" jokes that would fly over some audiences heads and it was suprisingly loaded with them but there was legit no original character designs just remaking them as opposites but the controversy is unneeded but in the second act it was just not good because it had a typical romance sub-plot that worked in the end but the worst thing is that they tried to get us emotionally attached 6/10",Free Birds

70,jcl541,"Not bad, no liberal agenda, but not really family friendly either",6,10 November 2013,"First, for those claiming that there is some heavy liberal/vegan/PETA agenda in this film: Puh-leez! Did you even bother to see the film? Go back to your NRA meeting if you're looking for any agreement about that. If there was any kind of liberal bias, it was in the depiction of most of the pilgrims (and particularly Standish) as mean-spirited, evil, dishonest or clueless. In the film, the turkeys are stand-ins for the traditional role of the native Americans in films set in this period. Obviously, the turkeys are the protagonists of the film.On the other hand, everyone else is touting this film as ""family friendly."" Well, maybe it's on par with all the other animated movies out there, but in this old grump's opinion it's not a particularly nice movie for children. Note that it is rated PG, not G. A majority of the movie is filled with conflict, menace, mean and nasty antagonists and characters running for their lives - too much of the movie. I think it would have been better to build a little more sympathy for the protagonists with more humorous scenes, so that you would care a little more when they are in trouble (which in this film is most of the time). A little more time on the Reggie/Jenny love story would have been advised.Despite those drawbacks, the film wasn't all bad. Owen Wilson seemed to be playing a typical Owen Wilson character in Reggie with his somewhat awkward humor, and Woody Harrelson was suitable as the regimented Jake. I actually wasn't aware of the cast before seeing the movie and it was fun to realize whose voices I was hearing. For this nerd, the best part of the film was realizing who was voicing S.T.E.V.E. Oh myyyy!My 7yo daughter was not entertained by all the conflict and we agreed that the film was so- so.

71,supermandisco,Silly Turkey Fun!,5,18 November 2013,"A silly fun comedy should always be welcome no matter how bad it may appeal to some folks who expect a Lion King every time they view an animated movie. Same situation happened with Turbo, which had mixed reviews and I liked that one too. In some ways, this reminded me of Chicken Run which had another animated style. Owen Wilson's turkey hooked me instantly because in many ways his approach was like Lighting McQueen with his cynical point of view, and his startling scenes of yelps. This character actually overshadows everyone else except STEVE, the time traveling machine pod who has got to be every geeks wanna have list. Very functional, and very streamlined. Completely voiced by Star Trek familiar. I will give this feature a C+ because it had promising results and some of the jokes fell through such as the female's turkey eye occasionally coming jarred loose and having to breath inward to reset, never really worked. To me, I think the bigger turkey would have been funnier had Sylvester Stallone did the voice, and probably would have been more endearing, but Owen nailed his part, and I really did like his character a lot. I would actually consider to buy an illustrated book. As far as the evil type pilgrims, in my head I don't think they were in a position to be evil at this point as they were much too busy trying to learn how to survive than have reckless behavior, the space just didn't seem to be there to be this type of spoiled brattiness. However, to animals who are game for food and what not, people always appear evil, so I will take it from their point of view under circumstances. There was nothing wrong with the animation style, just delivery and possibly a crisper script to deliver much needed laughs to break up the nonsense of a tale. The pod of time travel transport was stylish, and I thought one of the most valuable things of this kid's comedy. But Owen's turkey deserves a better chance at a better movie, although this was one heck of a good try.",Free Birds
72,croxton3,A lot of laughs,7,31 August 2014,"My kids and I loved this movie, so I was surprised to see the low rating on IMDb. The negative comments seem to center on three things:(1) ""Cultural insensitivity,"" chiefly for portraying 17th century turkeys like Indians. I don't get this one. They are put in opposition to pilgrims, who are trying to eat them, and the Indian association seems natural. (2) A ""vegetarian"" message. I am relatively sensitive to such message (e.g., I thought it was rather heavy-handed in ""Jurassic Park""), so I can say that there simply isn't one here. It's about turkeys trying not to get eaten, not that people should never eat meat. (3) ""disregard for time-travel paradoxes"" (quoting from Wikipedia here). It's a movie about talking turkeys, and this guy is bothered by inconsistencies in time travel? If this bothers you, it's time to take off the bow tie and unfasten the suspenders, you need to loosen up.Okay, the plot is not great, and there really isn't a message (at least not much of one). The joy of this movie and others of its ilk is in the presentation. There are a lot of funny lines, and the animation is amazing. I love seeing how cartoonists can elicit the most focused emotions simply by depicting a turkey's face.If you are looking for a deep movie, this one is probably not for you.

75,PsnViolet,"Well, they're not lying, it is the best Turkey of a movie out right now",1,1 November 2013,"So yeah, a thanksgiving movie about two turkeys going back in time to keep turkeys from being eaten at the first thanksgiving. Setting aside the fact that they probably weren't the main course if they were eaten at all, nobody should have expected this to be anything but a stupid kids' movie. But, I at least expected it to be that, a stupid kids' movie. Calling this movie a stupid kids' movie is an insult to stupid kids' movies. Let's start with what I'll be generous and call a story. Owen Wilson is a turkey. E-I-E-I-O. I'll be kind and have that be the only time I make that joke. Owen Wilson turkey is the turkey chosen for the presidential pardon, despite the fact that he doesn't fulfill a single one of the qualifications, and lives a cushy life with TV and all the product placement Chuck-e-cheese pizza he can eat. Then, a buff turkey named Jake shows up and tells him that he's on a quest from the ""Great Turkey"" to stop thanksgiving from ever happening. And there's your problem right there, that's the dumbest thing I've ever written. And that's not even the dumbest thing to happen in the movie. From there, they break into a government lab and steal a time machine, voiced by George Takei, who turns in one of the only good performances this movie has, simply on his greatness alone, and the time machine somehow understands the turkey's voice commands. They end up three days before the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth, and they're immediately chased by an over the top villain hunter until they're saved by the local turkeys, and from there, you have three choices of plots, Dances with Wolves with turkeys, Pocahontas with turkeys, or Avatar with turkeys. Just replace the natives with turkeys or have the people be cannibals and it's pretty much the same plot. And then, the last few scenes happen. Thesis papers could be written about everything wrong with the ending. If anybody cares about spoilers, now would be the time to stop. So, anybody over the age of 10 should be able to figure out that Owen Wilson turkey is the ""Great Turkey"" that Jake saw in the past, but it takes 4 of him to even get close enough to have George Takei tell him. Yes, they do the time travel movie thing where he tells himself what's going on, but that could be forgiven if it wasn't done so stupidly. Then he does the thing where he goes back in time and starts the plot, again, cliché, but forgivable. Then, the movie gave up. There's no other explanation for what happens next. You may want to be sitting down for this next part. So, the turkeys are going to attack the settlers after they burnt down their home (with flaming pumpkin catapults(I know, stay with me)). The settlers rationally respond by attacking them with cannons (though to be fair, the turkeys destroyed their guns, which, to be fair again, you'd have to be dumb to have happen). Then, just as they're about to be destroyed by cannon fire, a group of Indians show up and say ""those are some angry birds"". If you're dumb enough to stay in the theater after that, like I was, then you'll realize that is the high point of this last act. Owen Wilson turkey comes down in the time machine and stops all the cannonballs mid-shot and absorbs all the cannons and the evil hunter into a magnetic vortex. Then, he comes down off the time machine, and George Takei tells them all that Owen Wilson turkey is the ""Great Turkey"", and he gives them the gift that will stop the settlers from eating turkey. Pizza. He brings a ton of Chuck-E-Cheese pizza for them. I tried to walk out then, but my sister didn't let me. And the Turkeys, Settlers and Indians lived happily ever after. Owen Wilson turkey gets Stands-With-A-Fist/Pocahontas/Natari turkey to fall in love with him and stays with the colonial age turkeys, and Jake stays in George Takei and goes off to, I don't know, fight crime through time or something. And George Takei finishes the movie off with one of his classic ""Oh My""s. I have exactly four good things to say about this movie. One is George Takei's always great to hear, even if he is totally wasted. Two, the only real laughs that didn't come from him came from self aware people in hazmat suits at the laboratory, and they at least knew how dumb the idea of turkeys messing with a time machine was, even if everybody else in the facility didn't. Three and four are two good scenes in this. One scene is when the hunters find and subsequently destroy the turkey's nest. There is actually a good scene here, it's shot well, there's actual tension, and it belonged in a better movie. The last is when Owen Wilson turkey takes Pocahontas turkey up in the time machine and they're looking down on the earth. Pocahontas turkey starts asking questions, and a better movie could have taken this aspect further. But none of that saves this from being an overall brain dead movie with about as much respect for its audience as it does for history. I have never wanted to eat a turkey sandwich more in my life, and I can't wait for thanksgiving this year.",Free Birds
76,bonetrain,Fun but....,6,15 November 2013,Its a fun little movie but the liberty taken reinterpreting the pilgrims as evil foolish dolts doesn't sit right. Either this is more of the not so subtle Hollywood remaking of history (subliminally in a child's mind) or its just plain poor creativity. To plant these images in the low informed child's mind needs to be called out. How many young children in schools today where achievements of past generations are now viewed as less than heroic or criminal will take away the image of Miles Standish as a cruel evil dolt and the pilgrims plight for freedom is not what they were about? Is this the social engineering the right likes to call out Hollywood and the socialist agenda for? I'm leaning toward a big maybe here. Evil white dolts trying to violently kill the main characters of the story (in a kids mind they ain't turkeys at this point).

81,faizan_afzal2006,The greatest Turkey movie of all time!,10,7 November 2013,"In Free Birds, a duo of turkeys time travel back to Plymouth Colony's first Thanksgiving in hopes of swaying them away from consuming what would become the traditional bird of choice. The movie operates with the same logic, heart, and passable animation quality as a standard Saturday morning cartoon -- which is slightly less tolerable when extended to 90 minutes. Will the wee ones laugh? Yes. Will they be aching to get the hell out of there when adorable baby turkeys run scarce and the final act runs completely dry of humor? Probably. Like animated specials of yesteryear Free Birds feels like three episodes of a TV show stitched together. In the first, Jake makes his way to the White House. In part two, Jake and Reggie infiltrate a government base where they hijack S.T.E.V.E. (George Takei), a talking time travel device who whisks them back to the days of the Pilgrims. And in chapter three, the duo encounters their turkey ancestors, including Reggie's new object of desire, Jenny (Amy Poehler). The movie's silliness isn't an issue. It's that Free Birds suffers from the shotgun approach where every idea sticks. It's chaotic and rarely interesting. We meet Jenny and the other turkeys (dressed in Native American garb because... they were here first and are being hunted by white men, maybe?) halfway through the movie, the Chicken Run-Esq intro is thrown completely out the window, along with hints of a Bill & Ted radix. Free Birds can't figure out which successful movie of the past it wants to rip off without mercy, so it just goes for all of them.",Free Birds
82,bzee97,Funny but rather confusing,4,2 November 2013,"I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because of the trailer, which showed a lot of the humor. However, after the first 20 minutes, I realized this wasn't just a comedy. I wasn't quite sure what it was! The Pilgrims were portrayed as a bunch of clueless, fickle people, and perhaps the most puzzling character was Miles Standish. He looked like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti western: tall, dark and glowering, with western-looking clothes. Other similar details took away from the experience: the presence of dynamite, chicken wire, horses, matches, cannons, and large buildings made me feel like I was watching a western, not a movie set in 1621 Plymouth.It's a pity, because some scenes are rather touching, and some of the funny parts are quite amusing. Unfortunately, the overwhelming feeling is of weirdness and confusion. The soundtrack and voice acting are both very good. The animation and editing are good, but overall, the story and humor are so randomly mixed together (and yet predictable?) that I wouldn't recommend this movie to others.",Free Birds
83,arie_glavi,Free Birds is one of the most intelligent movies to date.,10,20 November 2013,"Warning: Contains Spoilers.If you are looking to teach your children about vegetarianism, animal rights, atheism, feminism, not blindingly following someone whether it be the ""Great Turkey"" or the government while also being entertained by satire or a critique on bro culture- then this movie is for you.I've seen a lot of children's movies and have come to realize that the scriptwriters, directors, and producers (good ones at least) know that they are really making movies that should also entertain adults- since they are the ones paying for their children to watch them. That being said, there some major differences for movies that are more intellectual than cartoons purely for children. Movies made for children yet have enough adult humor and a complex enough story-line for adults is hard to find.Ergo, anyone who doesn't understand the complexities of the movie 'Free Birds' might be lacking a little bit in the department upstairs.Free Birds is a movie I would show my children- it is a extremely good moral film and ethics take center stage.Reggie, the intelligent turkey ostracized by his witless peers for trying to warn them that they will get eaten and won't go to ""Turkey Paradise"" when they reach the little shack on their farm, or that the corn fire in the sky (told to the masses by the turkey on the rock HINT: this turkey symbolizes a preacher and religion) is actually a sun, is a great role model for young children who are gifted and find it hard to fit in with their peer groups. He is the true hero in the movie, even though as he says to Jenny, his female turkey love interest, that he doesn't have any muscles. He is the epitome of the quote ""Those who are best suited to power, are those who do not seek it.""Jake, who is Reggie's comrade in the film, is a more brawn than brains type of character that while with good intentions at heart, blindly follows ""The Great Turkey"" in realizing his destiny in saving turkeys from being eaten at Thanksgiving. The ""Great Turkey"" appears to Jake after he escapes from a terrible factory for mass producing poultry, and the ""Great Turkey"" appears before him in halo of white light giving him his mission, a magical doorknob and also to ""Never ever give up.""Jake also blindly follows authority (The Great Turkey), and asks the turkeys to blindly follow him into war as well- they respond by asking important questions. Both are great characters and the differences among them are worth noting when it comes to their mistakes in the film: Jake makes the mistake of wanting glory and mistakenly leads the hunters directly to the turkey 'village' in the tree by a trail of powder from the horn he brings back to prove his feat. Reggie, on the other hand, is intelligent but gives up too quickly when he could have stayed. Both are real life mistakes that people make, and are a great teaching moment for children.Another teaching moment for children is that when Reggie undoes the traps set by the hunters, he does it by luck. A good moral lesson because only an idealist thinks anyone can do anything by only pure hard work- many successful people also had a little bit of luck.I especially liked how at the moment a new chief is decided, it is the female turkey, Jenny, who is chosen- and not her brawny brother, who was expected to become chief. Once again, another teaching moment for children about sexism and feminism and that women can be leaders, great leaders, as well. Jenny also does not get distracted by Reggie when he flirts with her, even though eventually she and him are a happy couple.When Reggie finds out that it was actually him that was ""The Great Turkey"" due to time travel, it was a great moment for teaching children about atheism- for those who do not believe in a God or God(s). Theists or Agnostics can still use this opportunity to teach children about different ways of viewing the world, so that their child can make informed decisions.There is much to be loved about the simple humor in the film; I found the characters that were people (The stoner pizza delivery boy, the general who 'has issues' and the President's daughter were spot on in terms of reality) were well versed in adult satire. The television blaring, the pizza replacing the turkey (any one who is a foodie must know how gross American fast-food pizza can be, and wonder how it can be so ubiquitous in American culture)... I could continue but I'd spoil all the fun for those who haven't watched it. It is also a great teaching tool for those who want to make their children aware of animal ethics, treatment and consumption of animals and animal products- vegetarians should delight at this movie. I rarely give movies 10/10. But there are so many moral lessons in this movie that are not easily apparent to the average American viewer (IQ's in the U.S.A. averages at about 98, chew on that while munching your pizza and guzzling your soft drink) or their children. But for those with IQ's a little higher, this movie is great film for both adults and children.It is a great Thanksgiving film, and hopefully, instead of meat, pizza or tofu could be served on the Thanksgiving menu.For those with IQs on the more average side, I am sure the visual effects will satisfy, although it is not a Micheal Bay film. Perhaps the turkeys catapulting flaming pumpkins or the squirrels applauding will be enough.",Free Birds

This stupid movie portrays turkeys as if they actually live on organic farms and are killed for meat one by one. That's entirely not true. Real turkeys modern day are raised by the millions in overcrowded factory farms. The turkeys only live a few weeks, are treated terribly, never see the sunlight, and are feed nothing but corn and antibiotics. They are even put through a machine to cut off their beaks so they won't peck each other. Each year over 45 million are slaughtered just for thanksgiving. But if people watch this stupid movie they are going to think that their meat actually comes from a fantasy cage-free field with a barn. The only thing they got right with this movie was the corn. And the whole plot is just ridiculous, cartoon turkeys traveling through time to get turkeys off the menu of the first thanksgiving. On the first thanksgiving they probably didn't even eat turkey. They mostly ate seafood. Even the characters suck in this movie. Turkeys are portrayed as being incredibly stupid and the main character's name, ""Reggie,"" just makes me think of Reggie Fils-Aime.",Free Birds

But it is still a good movie and certainly worth the watch. Also the obligatory ""this is a review it might spoil something"". I don't know what many of the other reviewers went in to this movie thinking so I will tell you flat out. This is a movie about TURKEYS THAT TIME TRAVEL. It is not some deep, complex movie that tells a detailed story. It's a light, funny movie to sit back and relax with. If you must have 50 different plot twists and 1000 characters for a film to be good, go watch game of thrones. If you want a nice funny movie that you don't have to think about, crack open a beer and watch this one. There's enough of a story to follow along and enjoy, but it's not excessive. The animation was good, though I didn't see the 3D version. I can't find any fault with the voice acting, and you will probably recognize many of the voice actors from other roles. The jokes were simple but effective- I was laughing pretty much the whole way through. Go in to it with the intent to enjoy a simple funny movie, and you will do just that.

This movie is just a semi accurate portrayal of how a highly intelligent turkey would probably act, given freedom and the timeship Henterprise.",Free Birds
86,jamesgrant22,The Best Turkey Movie Ever,10,14 September 2014,"This is far by one of the best movies of 2013. it has little bit of everything. Action, Love, Emotion, Hurt and comedy the 5 best combinations for a great movie. This one movie everyone will be talking about and still are talking about it. The animation and graphics are wonderful it plays right into the scene with the choice of music. You couldn't of ask for a more fantastic movie than this. Free Birds were #1 in the box offices in the Bahamas for 4 weeks they just couldn't get enough of it. But truly love this movie it brought out the emotion in me that's been hiding for so long and appreciate that. and congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done. I Highly recommend this movie for you to watch. and i hope it brings you the same love, joy and emotion it brought me.",Free Birds
87,isaiahsmith3,Still Shaking My head,1,9 March 2014,"This may be the first movie review I have ever written and I am now in my 40's. Thought I would get a movie to watch with my 9 and 11 year old on a Saturday night. Wasn't worth the $1.28 I spent to get it out of the R..box! I rented it first then I watched the trailer online after... I knew I was in trouble already! I think it's really sad that these filmmakers are making money off of children now! To be honest I turned it off after about 20-30 minutes, it was that bad! Bad animation, horrible story line, wacky characters. Got sucked in because of names like Wilson and Harrelson. I usually filter movies through another site and should have done the same here. I truly do believe the children's films are making a bit of a comeback ... but this one just does it no justice at all. Me thinking about the makers of this film is actually a lot funnier than the film itself. Living the American dream, lol.",Free Birds
88,amandaelaine_07,Very disappointing,3,17 March 2014,"There is a scene about 15-20 minutes in that has a obvious weed symbol (leaf) on the ground next to a normal leaf on dirt part of scene. It caught my eye while I was enjoying the movie. It is annoying that so many movies have hidden messages, symbols, and agenda. Why can't a children's movie be innocent and contain wholesome values? If the scene of the weed leaf was removed from the film than I would rate the movie a 7.9 to 8.3 on a scale of 1-10. The weed scene appeared after Reggie was captured by Jake and they were on a run away from the humans to a working tool shed nearby. After replaying the scene to the adults watching the film with me ( children not in room at moment), it was clearly a weed symbol! Why?",Free Birds
