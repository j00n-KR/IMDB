0,TheLittleSongbird,"One dull, soulless uprising",3,29 April 2018,"Will admit to enjoying the first 'Pacific Rim'. It wasn't great or perfect as an overall film, and somewhat of a case of style over substance, but it entertained and did well on delivering on its objectives. The involvement of Guillermo Del Toro and Idris Elba are reasons enough to see the filmReally do wish that the same can be said for its sequel 'Pacific Rim: Uprising'. The trailer was not good and the reviews not great (one of the weaker received films of those released so far this year), but saw it anyway due to liking the first film enough and wanted to see something that was pretty much the same sort of thing quality-wise (and perhaps with improvements). No such luck. 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' turned out to be a dull and soulless sequel and film, and one that comes over as pointless at the end of the day. Starting with what 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' excelled with, which sadly is not much, much of the cinematography and editing are slickly atmospheric, the production design is gritty and audacious and some of the effects are top-notch. Some of the action and spectacle is exciting, they're big and over-the-top but appropriately so. John Boyega is a reasonable and charismatic lead and the only actor to come over well. On the other hand, nowhere near as good a job is done with the direction, nowhere near as in command of or at ease with the material the action, making for a film that tries to be both silly fun and taking itself seriously but fails at both and neither gels. The film doesn't know what it's trying to be, it can be dully paced and target audience is not easy to figure out due to the film's muddled done.Boyega aside, the acting is very bad, especially from Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who are as irritating as they were before. 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' also has some cringe-worthy, childish and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation (enough to tick off the long list of cliches one by one in quick succession) where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. There are clumsy and unnecessary references to the first film too and there is too much exposition that really bogs things down.Although there are instances of them being good, other effects are cartoonish. A lot of the action doesn't work, not very inventive and not always cohesive let alone exhilarating. A big case of a lot of noise and attempted style but not a lot of brains or soul. Worst of all is the story, which is dull, ridiculous, barely coherent and with a cobbled together glued badly feel and a complete lack of emotional investment.Concluding, a mess apart from a few good things. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Pacific Rim - Uprising
1,Leofwine_draca,Lacks vision,4,31 December 2019,"UPRISING is the sequel to Guillermo Del Toro's PACIFIC RIM but the director chose no to return, busy making THE SHAPE OF WATER instead. Boy, do you miss his presence here. This is more of a generic, child-friendly production which the Chinese have massively contributed to in terms of dollars, so it's full of cheesy CGI action that becomes quite repetitive after a while. The story sees the aliens of the first returning in a different form, but it all leads to the usual cliches and tired genre tropes. Most of the original cast are missing and they're replaced by newcomers going through the motions. There's no real vision here, just repetition, and the whole thing seems to be an exercise in box-ticking rather than delivering real charm.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
2,SnoopyStyle,Transformed,6,28 April 2018,"It's been 10 years since the end of the original movie. With no more Kaiju, the world is trying to rebuild. Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) ran from his father's heroic legacy and lives on the edges of the rebuilding civilization. He deals in black market and tries to steal from a decommissioned Jaeger. He is scooped by street kid Amara Namani who builds her own mini-Jaeger. They get arrested and his stepsister Mako Mori recruits him back into the program. Amara joins the other young cadets training to be pilots under Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood). Ruthless industrialist Liwen Shao is pushing for Jaeger drones controlled remotely by a single operator with bumbling Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) working under her.The Guillermo del Toro style has been scrubbed down and transformed. Jake is a less than compelling lead which is not that different from the original. It starts with a lot attitude and a lot of fronting. Boyega does save it by his sheer charisma. The first movie is a kiddie idea taken seriously with fun. This one takes that serious take and injects some kiddie jokiness. It literally adds a Robin-like character. The attempts at jokes annoyed me. The city destruction has a sterile feel. There is still some fun to be had and it is still robots fighting monsters.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
3,Prismark10,More robots and monsters,5,18 May 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising still knocks bells out of some of the Transformer sequels.It is set ten years after the events of Pacific Rim. Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) is the rebellious son of Stacker Pentecost who died saving humanity from the first film.After an encounter with a scavenger Amara (Cailee Spaeny) who builds a Jaeger robot from spare parts. Jake ends up in trouble and his half sister helps him out by forcing him to teach at the Pan Pacific Defence Corps under the auspices of rival pilot Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) who spends the movie doing a Clint Eastwood impersonation.When the Kaiju return and threaten to cause further mayhem, it is up to Jake to rally the younger pilots to take on new dangers.This is an easygoing popcorn film, there is plenty of action. Director Steven S DeKnight is merely efficient, relying more on special effects than the script which can be cheesy and stupid at times. He lacks Guillermo Del Toro's panache and pomposity of the first film.Charlie Day puts in another irritating performance. It has now come to a point that any cinema showing a movie starring Charlie Day must offer patrons a freephone number for the Samaritans while the movie is on and free counselling for the next 48 hours.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
4,nogodnomasters,You can be whatever you want to be,5,2 April 2018,"The son of the hero of the first films re-fights his father's battles. It didn't work that well with ""Independence Day 2"" so you would think they would let go of the idea. Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) teams up with Scott Eastwood, the son of an actor, and Cailee Spaeny, because young female ""Rey type"" role models are hip to fight rogue Jaegars. There is an academy to train Jaegar masters which reminded me of a bad ""Starship Troopers."" There is a lot of machines fighting machines in case you didn't get enough of that in Transformers or Iron Man. And like those two films the battles are long and dragged out. Tween film.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
5,kosmasp,Kaiju/Robot Upgraded,7,14 December 2020,"The sequel to a quite succesful first part. If you liked the first one, you'll dig this one too. Not just because some of the characters come back (the survivors) and it has some interesting new ones. But because the movie feels like an homage to the kaiju genre, something you very likely liked while seeing the first one too and has not changed here.The movie itself is quite predictable and it does play with cliches (although even going against one expected thing is almost something you'd expect when it comes to a villainous character). But visually this is quite the achievement. You may care or not - but it does look really good. And that is one of the main ingredients needed in a monster movie like this.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
6,paul_haakonsen,The movie was all CGI and very little else...,5,14 June 2018,"Well, this was a sequel in every aspect of the term.Yeah, sure ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" had rather impressive special effects and CGI, just like its predecessor, but that was initially all that the movie had working for it, to be bluntly honest.The storyline and plot were so simplistic that it was also offensive to the audience. Was this really all that director and writer Steven S. DeKnight, along with three other writers, could manage to come up with? The storyline was way beyond generic and predictable.As for the acting in the movie, well, let's just say that this will not be much of an award-nominating or winning movie. John Boyega is just unfit for acting on a scale of these movies. It was up to the likes of Scott Eastwood, Cailee Spaeny, Burn Gorman and Rinko Kikuchi to actually carry the movie, despite it being Boyega being the main attraction.The kaijus in the movie were quite nice and interesting, as they were in the first movie too. And the impressive CGI really helped to bring these monsters to life on the screen. The jäegers, too, were also quite nicely brought to life on the screen. However, I never understood why the pilots would exhibit pain and fatigue when the robot chassis gets beaten up. That made no sense.I also love the model simulation of what would happen to the Earth if the kaiju reached their end goal as Hermann Gottlieb magically brought that scenario up in mere seconds after being told of where they were heading. That was just downright ridiculous. But also the fact that apparently that Japanese metropolis managed to evacuate in mere minutes, and for some reason they knew that ALL people were safely evacuated below ground at the base, and they ordered an all out attack. Yep, that was realistic.""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is crammed with plotholes and things that made little or no sense.It was entertaining enough for a single viewing, if you sit down with the intention of watching it for being an impressive CGI galore and very little else. I watched it to the end, but I can honestly say that I will never return to watch it a second time around.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
7,zardoz-13,Pacific Rim Downsized!!!,5,10 April 2018,"Mind-numbing nonsense from fade-in to fadeout, ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" lacks the stellar cast and the suspenseful Armageddon melodrama of its outlandish but entertaining predecessor. Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost and Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket made ""Pacific Rim"" more than just a juvenile diversion in collateral damage and urban renewal. Comparatively, neither John Boyega nor Scott Eastwood musters enough magnetism in ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" to overshadow our heroic memories of Stacker and Raleigh. Everybody knows Stacker died in the original, so he was never coming back. Becket's absence is never adequately explained, though he might reappear in a later sequel. Meantime, ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" violates the first rule of all good sequels. Never should a heretofore untold character related to a franchise hero be invented to replace him. Meantime, everybody should recognize Boyega from his two recent ""Star Wars"" spectacles, while Clint Eastwood's son Scott has acquitted himself more than satisfactorily with supporting roles in ""Fury"" and ""Suicide Squad."" Boyega and Eastwood represent Hollywood's new blood. Sadly, they are hamstrung playing superficial characters with scarcely any complexity or charisma. The same shortcoming applies to the new breed of Jaeger pilots who comprise a politically-correct, multi-cultural coalition. Unknown actors and actresses all, they constitute a bland bunch with their petty rivalries. Boyega and Eastwood must whip these recruits into shape, so they can maneuver skyscraper-sized Jaegers on a dime. ""Pacific Rim"" came out in 2013, and five years would slip away before ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" emerged. Despite the gap in time between the original's release and its uninspired sequel, you'd think the filmmakers could have conjured up something with more imagination than a lame imitation of ""Ender's Game"" (2013). Basically, all director Steven S. DeKnight of Netflix's ""Daredevil,"" freshman scenarists Emily Carmichael and Kira Snyder, and ""Maze Runner"" writer T.S. Nowlin do is grant the Kaiju a rematch. Along the way, they disperse the returning original characters, and the last-minute showdown never attains the impressive proportions of ""Pacific Rim."" This formulaic follow-up takes place in 2030, ten years after the Kaiju defeat at the Battle of the Breach. Not only has peace and prosperity been restored during the intervening decade, but scientists have also converted the rock 'em, sock 'em Jaegers so they can be deployed like drones. DeKnight and his writers introduce Stacker Pentecost's insubordinate son, Jake (John Boyega of ""Attack the Block""), but the son is nothing like his sire. Since the end of the Kaiju wars, dismantled Jaegers have been rusting away in scrap heaps. Some skeptics insist on being prepared for the return of the Kaiju. Thieves have catered to their paranoia by stealing Jaeger parts and selling them to these superstitious souls. Jake acquires his cash from pilfering these parts. Little does he know his principal competitor is an audacious, 15-year old orphan, Amara Namani (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), and she is beating him to those parts. Amara is assembling her own micro-sized Jaeger when Jake catches up with her. No sooner have they met than a real Jaeger thwarts her plans. Cutting a deal, Jake winds up back where he started before the Kaiju wars instead of behind bars. Former Jaeger copilot and old friend Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood of ""Diablo"") needs Jake to help train the new Jaegar pilots. Instead of calling it ""Pacific Rim Uprising,"" producer Guillermo del Toro and DeKnight should have named it ""Pacific Rim: The Next Generation."" Since she proved herself a decent pilot, Namani lands in the new cadet class, but not everyone likes her. According to Lambert, teens make better Jaeger pilots. Their youth, it seems, enables them 'to drift' better as co-pilots. If you haven't seen ""Pacific Rim,"" the mind-melding ability to drift is indispensable for pilots to operate these gigantic robots in combat against the supernatural ""Godzilla"" lizards from another dimension. Drifting might also apply to the audiences' willing suspension of disbelief in matters of such caprice.Meantime, Dr. Hermann Gottieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), who enlivened the original with their feverish comic relief antics, are no longer friendly. Newt now works for the domineering Liwen Shao (Jing Tian of ""The Great Wall"") of the Shao Corporation, where he serves as her co-chief of the drone development program. The change in the relationship between Hermann and Newt provides the sole surprise in this mediocre sequel. Remember, these two nerds saved the day for Stacker and Raleigh in ""Pacific Rim"" because they drifted with a hideous Kaiju's mind. Hermann still suffers nightmares from the ordeal, while nitwit Newt has discovered the love of his life. Yes, he keeps a Kaiju brain preserved in a glass tank at his apartment, refers to her as Alice, and maintains what might be described as a Platonic relationship with it! Preposterous as this all seems, it might have been less bizarre if the filmmakers had brought back Ron Perlman's sinister Kaiju collector Hannibal Chau from the first film whose presence is sorely missed. Newt's infatuation with Alice, and the profit-motive resolve of Liwen Shao to implement drones over drift pilots makes her seem shady when a rogue Jaeger storms out of the ocean and annihilates Sidney, Australia. Apart from Hermann and Newt, the only other returning ""Pacific Rim"" character is Rinko Kikuchi's Mako Mori. Sadly, Mako has been demoted from piloting Jaegers and is sidelined to the status of a pencil-pushing administrator. Mako must approve Shao's drone pilot proposal before the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) will institute it. Meaning, Mori doesn't survive long enough to make a difference. Predictably, the fearsome alien Kaiju monsters arrive in the second hour to challenge the green Jaeger recruits. DeKnight orchestrates this last minute apocalyptic battle in Tokyo, with the usual collateral damage, while ""Terminator Genisys"" composer Lorne Balfe's bombastic score does more to heighten this slam-bang smackdown than its staging. Not even an intriguing cliffhanger ending is enough to make ""Pacific Rim Uprising"" seem more than a 'downsizing' of its far superior predecessor.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
8,grantss,Incredibly bad,2,21 May 2019,"It is ten years since the world was attacked by creatures from another dimension. The creatures were only defeated due to the introduction of Jaegers, massive fighting machines, and the bravery and self-sacrifice of one man, Stacker Pentecost. Now his son, Jake, is a Jaeger training instructor and finds the fame of his father hard to live up to. Moreover, Earth's peace is about to be shattered as someone is out to unseal the breach and allow the creatures back in.I was pleasantly surprised by the original Pacific Rim. I am not generally into CGI-driven sci fi action movies but, despite its many flaws, I found it reasonably entertaining. It seemed to have more substance than your average CGI movie.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the sequel. Pacific Rim - Uprising is incredibly bad. Basic, largely nonsensical plot. Any semblance of a storyline exists merely to move you from one mindless action scene to another. Throw in some gung ho dialogue and acting and this movie has nothing going for it.Well, almost nothing: there are some nice views of Sydney, Australia. That was the main reason I even bothered to watch this, as some scenes were filmed outside my office.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
9,view_and_review,Mega Machines Round Two,7,26 March 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising is the sequel to Pacific Rim in which the Kaiju (giant monsters) invaded Earth which forced mankind to develop weapons to defeat them. The great minds of Earth came up with Jaegers (giant robots) to combat the Kaiju.What was the same? The Jaegers. A reluctant pilot being pulled back into the fight. Widespread destruction.What was different? The actors. The plot. The final showdown.Was it as good, better, or worse? I think it was better.First, let me take time out for this mass destruction disclosure. Both Pacific Rims would have you believe that densely populated cities with millions of tons of concrete and steel being strewn everywhere would leave minimal to no casualties. And to be fair, Pacific Rim is not the only perpetrator of this myth, many other movies have indicated the same. So let me be the one to tell you: impossible. I know that these movies are basically cinematic versions of the video game Rampage. It seems to be a millennial dream to destroy entire cities. But, no way are these poorly constructed skyscrapers going to be busted apart like sand castles and you won't have thousands of casualties to go with it. It seems that the people are more durable than the buildings. Maybe they should construct the buildings out of humans.OK, that's it for my MDD (mass destruction disclosure). Pacific Rim: Uprising was actually better in my opinion. Besides Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) being supremely militaristic the acting was good and the characters likable. They went for a little more humor and it worked. The destruction porn is kind of old hat but that is a large part of the movie. I'm more of a fan of seeing what the giant machines can do (an ode to my roots of Transformers, Voltron, and Robotech) regardless of whether or not they have the ability to bulldoze entire cities in one fight. Since this movie takes place 10 years after the first Kaiju attacks the Jaegers have nice new weapons and more moves. But what I liked most is that this movie was less predictable. Yes, the overall eventualities are predictable but how they achieve their goals is not that predictable and it was refreshing.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
10,deloudelouvain,Still waiting for a sequel that is better than it's predecessor.,5,9 June 2018,"Not that I was a huge fan of the first movie, I just thought it was another big production that always works in the theaters, but the story was kinda okay. This sequel on the other hand is like most sequels from movies like that, just bland, you just watch it because you saw the first one. You suspect they will make a third one and you wonder if you will watch that one. You probably will without much expectations, and I probably will also. In Pacific Rim: Uprising the acting isn't great, not awful but not great. Scott Eastwood looks like his father, there's no denying on who his real father is, but the acting isn't the same. The plot is kinda boring but you just watch it anyway. The CGI's are exactly what I was expecting from a big production like that, a bit like another Transformers movie. It's rare that a sequel outclasses it's predecessor and in this case it just confirms that. And yes there probably will be a third one, not very looking forward to that one to be honest.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
11,siderite,We SHOULD rise up against this kind of movies,4,15 August 2018,"Strangely enough, the quality of big blockbuster movies is reaching the point where they have the same level of quality as those of game cinematics. The acting part and the ""story"" are so forgettable that the CGI is all that remains. And the CGI is stupid. I mean, not bad, just completely dumb. I've seen this done real time in computer games. The creators of this movie bet big money on condescendingly telling their entire audience that they are cretins for watching and, of course, paying for this. The whole movie is stupid, not the CGI, the CGI is slightly more interesting.And you might think that I am one of those haters, but I am not. I actually loved the actors and how they played. Imagine good actors, waiting and training their entire life to get into the big leagues, and when they get there they have to perform admirably... on a dumb script. I am not going through it, just consider this: the entire premise of the movie is that kaiju blood reacts violently with rare earth minerals. So all you need to do is shoot him with rare earth mineral bullets! It was that bad.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
12,Hellmant,"Enjoyed the film to an extent, but not as much as the original.",8,29 March 2018,"'PACIFIC RIM: UPRISING': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sequel to the hit 2013 sci-fi monster flick 'PACIFIC RIM', which was directed and co-written by 2018's Oscar winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who also served as a producer on this sequel). The film was co-written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Steven S. DeKnight (who's previously only helmed genre TV shows, like 'DAREDEVIL', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'SMALLVILLE' and 'ANGEL'). The story is set 10-years after the events of the original movie, when society is threatened by new Kaiju creatures, and a new younger team of Jaeger pilots must do battle with them. It stars John Boyega, Cailee Spaeny, Scott Eastwood, Jing Tian, Adria Arjona and Zhang Jin (in new parts); while Charlie Day, Rinko Kikuchi and Burn Gorman all reprise their roles from the original movie. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a modest hit at the Box Office as well. If this chapter does good enough, many more sequels are planned (including spinoffs) to create a whole new sci-fi movie universe (similar to the 'STAR WARS' franchise). I enjoyed this film to an extent, but not as much as the original, I am still looking forward to more sequels though. The story takes place ten-years after the Battle of the Breach. A Jaeger has gone rogue and is causing massive destruction. It appears as though someone, or something, has released more Kaiju monsters into the world. Jake Pentecost (Boyega), son of the late great Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba in the first film), leads a new team of young Jaeger pilots to stop this new threat. The movie definitely has some cool visuals, and some pretty awesome robot vs. monster fight scenes. Boyega is also very charismatic in the lead, although Eastwood kind of sucks as his rival, still the film is severely lacking what del Toro brought to the original. This movie has a very strong TV feel to it too, thanks to the inexperienced new director. If you're a fan of the 'DAREDEVIL' and 'DOLLHOUSE' type shows you might enjoy it, but I'm a movie lover (not a TV fan). I prefer quality over quantity, and this film definitely doesn't live up to it's predecessor. I am still looking forward to more future installments though, like I said, and hopefully they'll be much better than this.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
13,FeastMode,spectacle,7,22 July 2019,"Fun and awesome popcorn flick. beastly action on par with the first, if not better. and i think the human parts are a VAST improvement. i actually cared, whereas in the first one i want to skip all of those scenes. and it was less cheesy. and much funnier with good banter. this seems to be my new transformers after that series nose-dove to oblivion.there was definitely some dumb stuff. this is a turn-your-mind-off kind of movie. i think boyega and spaeny did a great job. boyega was very different from his star wars role. overall i like this better than the first, in that one the human parts are sometimes unbearable. i would say this movie is 8/10 level with regards to action, but the dumbness made me give it a 7/10 (2 viewings, 12/5/2020)",Pacific Rim - Uprising
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Not what you want, or indeed expect, from a sequel of this kind, size or in fact (supposed) calibre.",5,26 March 2018,"Most of 'Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018)' isn't what you want, or indeed expect, from a picture of this kind, size or in fact calibre - considering it follows a passion-fuelled Del Toro effort and is produced by him, to boot. The stuff that you do want isn't nearly as good as it could, and perhaps should, have been. The majority is messy, schlocky, clichéd trite that is never anywhere near as fun as the first and considerably sillier as well. It's a piece that culminates in a seemingly forced finale that doesn't have the heart or skill that its precursor had and, as such, is difficult to engage with from an emotional and even visual stand-point. They should have let the Kaiju rest. 5/10",Pacific Rim - Uprising
15,bowmanblue,Junior mechs,6,1 April 2018,"I was a massive fan of the first 'Pacific Rim' film. It was loud, dumb and yet strangely well-shot for an out and out B-movie (something to do with its very-talented director, Guillermo Del Toro). It had its flaws, but it was still enormous fun. So my hopes were high for 'part II.' However, the reviews came in and they weren't overly-positive. And yet, my hopes remained high. I shouldn't have got excited.The original told the tale of a breach in the ocean floor which allowed giant monsters to enter our world. The humans' response was to - believe it or not - create giant robots to beat them into submission (please ignore the fact that our military apparently couldn't defeat the monsters on their own, but never mind). Part II starts showing the devastation caused by the battles along coastal cities. A young girl (no more than 13?) has lived all her life among the ruins and has - somehow - managed to scavenge enough parts to build herself a fully-functional giant robot. She can pilot this on her own and out manoeuvre full-trained soldiers in their own mechs.This all occurs within about the first ten minutes and I found this whole situation just a little hard to suspend my disbelief for. Unfortunately, this small nugget of the plot basically sums up the entire film. I could spend quite a long time listing one totally unbelievable plot point after the next. I know the whole story is over-the-top, but the fact that it turns out that soldiers are no longer used to pilot the robots; instead a bunch of kids are trained up. Why? Who knows. You just have a teen-kid movie where they fight in robots and has one unbelievable story element after the next.It's not all bad. John Boyega is very watchable as the lead. It's just who's around him that brings the whole thing down. The film does its best to expand on the original idea and, for that, it succeeds. Plus the battles are as fun (and the final fight is truly awesome!). However, my main gripe is that just this film is probably going to be appreciated more by youngsters than hardened cynical cinema veterans such as myself. I'm sure I'd have loved this if I was a twelve-year-old boy and then gone out and bought the toy. Oh, yeah, that girl's 'build-your-own-robot' is annoyingly cute and looks a bit like 'Bumblebee' from the 'Transformers' franchise. I think they want you to not just watch the film, but also buy the toys. I won't be doing that. And, if Part III does get made (maybe) I'll wait for this one to appear on Netflix.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
16,ThomasDrufke,Bland and Forgettable,4,4 April 2018,"I've seen enough movies now where I can figure out what makes a good movie good, a bad movie bad, and why some movies fall under the good and bad category. I think the first Pacific Rim could be considered the latter. On one hand, completely silly and taking itself a little too seriously (much like the F&F films tend to do from time to time). On the other hand, it's visually spectacular with a few fun performances. However, I saw that film before I went to the movies around a hundred times a year. Now, I'm much more aware of the type of filmmaking that caters to audiences that don't care to see a well-strung story or a well-performed film, but rather, big robots fighting big monsters. That's what Pacific Rim: Uprising is. Although Steven DeKnight did a great job of running Daredevil season 1, there's really not much quality character depth or originality in the story at all here. In fact, the supporting characters and performances are some of the most bland and forgettable I have seen in any big budget movie in years. I don't pretend to be a huge fan of robot/monster films like the Godzilla or Transformers franchise (and I realize how annoying it may be for some to hear me compare this film to those) but this film is about as middle of the road as you can get. Let's not even talk about Scott Eastwood, who is somewhat likable because of his family tree, but it sure looks like the apple falls very very far away. There are simply some decisions made in this movie, whether that be acting, story, or visually, that are simply frustratingly pathetic. But hey, if you like to watch dumb robot/monster films then this one may be for you.4.7/10",Pacific Rim - Uprising
17,MLDinTN,why was this movie made,5,19 November 2018,"The biggest question I have about this movie is Why? The first film had cool robots and silly story, well this film has even worse story. It seems the kaiju were defeated and the world is trying to repair itself. The son, Jake, whose dad saved the world, gets sent to train cadets to operate jaeger. It seems new technology is introducing drones to pilot the jaegers, making rangers obsolete. Of course, there is a bad apple that uses the drones for destruction and to bring back kaiju. And all the pilots get killed in an attack, leaving Jake, hot guy Nate, and the cadets to pilot the last 4 jaegers. So you got crazy battle scenes that are too unrealistic to be really cool. Of course against all odds, our barely trained cadets defeat the kaiju and save the world in the nick of time.FINAL VERDICT: bad sci-fi film. Only recommended for 13 year old boys whom are still into video games.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
18,cricketbat,Let your logical mind drift,5,28 December 2018,"Much like its predecessor, Pacific Rim: Uprising is strongest when the giants robots are fighting the enormous aliens.

19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews.....,6,14 June 2018,"Pacific Rim UprisingThe reason giant robots aren't currently in use is because scientists have yet to figure out how to have sex with them without being crushed.Conversely, the mechas in this sci-fi movie are used for humanities other fixation: war.Years after his father impeded the first Kaiju attack, Jake (John Boyega) reluctantly agrees to train a new generation of Jaeger pilots alongside his old partner (Scott Eastwood) when a new breed of hybrid monster shows up. Meanwhile, scientists (Charlie Day, Burn Gorman) struggle to understand their enemy's newfound abilities which seem to thwart the Jaegars at every turn. 
 
Trading in most of the original cast and visionary writer/director for younger more diverse actors and an upstart director, this studio sequel mishandles creator Guillermo del Toro's vision by minimizing the larger human themes for more mindless metal melees.Moreover, monsters aren't the main adversary of giant robots, cross-border steel tariffs are.

20,westsideschl,Detention,3,5 July 2018,"Some studios (and their producers, directors, writers) are like fast food merchants. They don't care about your health just making money. 
Here's the litany:
1. Lots of magical science words/concepts to lend credence to what otherwise is just junk fantasy like plasma, other dimensions. Fake military tough talk & attitude. Yes, it's a bit of a challenge (and turn off to paying customers) to try and educate while entertaining. 
2. Lots of industrial set props like duct tubing and electrical wiring hanging everywhere. Lots of aged industrial metal and concrete for ambience - cheap to rent. 
3. A broad, basically TV show resume, cheap to get eye candy actors (usually w/tight t-shirts male & female) whose other main attribute is rote reciting of lines.

6. Lots of fake science, like a talking hologram (voice coming from where?); lots of suspended computer displays w/colorful graphics. Aerodynamically impossible flying machines w/the customary swooshing sound as they pass by (they all sound the same for some reason) and land vertically w/out the blast incinerating a vast area. 
7. Even the monsters (Kaiju) are beginning to look the same no matter what the movie - lots of teeth, horns, spikes, drool, and bad attitudes (off to detention for you guys/gals).

21,Platypuschow,Pacific Rim Uprising: Big dumb fun round 2,7,14 January 2019,"Pacific Rim (2013) was big, it was dumb, and it was oddly enjoyable but when I watched the trailer for Uprising it looked like 2hrs of stupidity painted liberally with cgi.I'm not wrong often when it comes to these things, but I was wrong here. Uprising is stupid and it is heavy on the cgi (As it had to be I suppose) but it's also a lot of fun just like the first movie.The cast however are mostly different and that's a very mixed bag. Scott Eastwood is awful, he's just the absolute pits and has no place in front of a camera. His father was dire initially as well, so if he follows suit with his father he'll be a bearable actor by around the age 60 mark!Next we have John Boyega whose choice of roles explains why I'm not keen on him. He played a Storm trooper gone good in Star Wars, he was a chav moron in Attack the Block and here he's a criminal turned hero. Sorry but that just doesn't work for me, why is he always the good guy with bad roots?And finally of those note worthy we have Cailee Spaeny who was excellent, very likeable, very talented and I hope this girl has a bright career ahead of her as based on this performance she deserves it.The movie itself is exactly what you'd expect, it follows on well from the previous movie and adds to the universe well but ultimately is just dumb take your brain out over the top fun. And you know something, that's okay! Not every movie needs to be smart or well constructed, sometimes you just need to see big flashy cgi robots beating up big scary cgi monsters!I hope there is a third (And probably final) movie to wrap things up. The franchise is never exactly going to produce outstanding movies but for simple silly fun they tick all the right boxes.The Good:Big dumb funCailee SpaenyThe Bad:John Boyega is simply not up to filling Idris Elba's bootsI struggle to get behind criminal protagonistsScott EastwoodFelt like it should have been longer",Pacific Rim - Uprising
22,The-Sarkologist,Another Mecha-fest,4,24 March 2018,"Ever since I realised that the original film was actually a pretty cool film a part of me was interested in watching the sequel. The thing is that it is a sequel so don't expect it to have the flair that the original film has, even though the original film is basically a bunch of mecha fighting huge monsters from the sea. Actually, that is all the original film was, yet for some reason, after the second time I watched it, I realised that it is one of those films that is pretty cool (and I really should update my original review).
 Anyway, Uprising is set ten years after the original film and the hero of this film is the son of the hero of the original. However, he is completely the opposite in that he is basically a no good academy drop out that pretty much lives his life on the seat of his pants. However, one day he gets busted with an illegal mecha (I'll call them mecha, even though the film calls them Jagers, probably because mecha is copyrighted by somebody).
 In a way they give this film a bit more of a plot, and have revealed a bit more of what was going on behind the scenes. As it turns out the race behind the Kenji are called the Precursors, and are attempting to take over the Earth, I suspect that this knowledge came from the fact that a couple of scientists linked up to one of the brains in the original film. In fact some of the characters from the original film came back, though it is always tricky watching a sequel so long after watching the original film. Another thing that is happening is that while the Jagers are still being used, there is some development to create Jager drones, though as it quickly comes about, things don't turn out as expected.
 Yeah, expect mecha vs monsters in this movie as well because, well, this is what the franchise is all about. In fact this film reminded me a lot of the old Godzilla films, though while they were paying homage to these films, they were obviously striking out on their own and giving the film its own flair. I guess that is another reason why I actually quite liked the film. Okay, it may not be particularly deep and meaningful, but it still has a charm of its own.
 Oh, and they dropped hints of a possible third movie in the future (actually, they were pretty blatant about it).",Pacific Rim - Uprising

This time comes sooner that they think and everyone has to do his job to protect the humans.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie despite the fact that I did not have very high expectations or hopes for it. I was disappointed because the plot was simple and boring and the direction which was made by Steven S. DeKnight lucked of imagination and the story-line did not make any sense. Finally, I have to say that if you want to watch another action movie then you should watch it but if you have already watched the first movie and you wanted something more or better you should lower your standards and your expectations before watching it.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
25,cruise01,"Big, loud, and smashing action film but lacks in energy from the first movie.",9,24 March 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising (4.5 out of 5 stars). Pacific Rim Uprising is pure awesome and fun. Only if you enjoy movies that are robots smashing robots or robots smashing Kaiju. And a lot of destruction with a battle in a city. This film may not top Guillermo del Toro first film which was fresh and new about Jaegars battling Kaiju's and that film had a bit of style with a neo night time battle. And seeing one Jaegar dragging a freighter and using it like a bat to hit the giant monster. Uprising may not have that style that the first movie did. But it is big, loud, and action packed for a science fiction film and that is all you can ask for in this sequel.What was good about this film? It is action packed. So if you want to see a movie that has more visual effects and action than substance of a plot. This is the film. Director Steven S. DeKnight (director that did Netflix's Daredevil) managed to have some creativity in giving these Jaegars a different look. Every one of them was different and had their own special weapon if it was an electrical whip, a giant spiked cannon ball, or a gravity pull weapon. Also, the action sequences are big and loud and exciting. I found the first film to have a lot more Kaiju fighting Jaegars action. I ll discuss that in a bit. But this film does introduces the concept of people building giant Jaegar drones. And there is one rogue Jaegar that the gypsy avenger has to fight against in a Siberian setting. But the climax taking place near Mount Fiji with three big Kaiju's fighting with a few Jaegars was definitely worth the price of admission. And makes up for the lack of Kaiju action in this film.The visual effects were spectacular. Seeing these giant robots fighting monsters was awesome. Also, newcomers like John Boyega did good playing Jake Pentecoste. A guy who is still carrying the conflicted emotions about his father played by Idris Elba. Scott Eastwood was also good, but his performance felt like he was still coming off from the set of the Fate of the Furious movie. Cailee Spaeny was great for her first performance debut, also struggling with emotions about the past after the Kaiju attacked. Which when going through the neuro hand shake like the first movie had a similar set up. Burn Gorman and Charlie Day were both good as the awkward goofy scientists. There is a twist in the film which is setting up for more sequels. What did not work with the film? I felt like this film did have less action than the first. There is one big Kaiju battle with the Jaegars in the climax. While the rest of the film just had the good guys trying to stop this Rogue Jaeger. And the drones from attacking. But the climax does make up for the rest of the film.Overall, Pacific Rim Uprising is a really good film. The visual effects are top notch. The action is loud and big if you love robots smashing monsters. The plot and concept does throw in a twist surprise that wants to carry over for more movies. I just felt like the direction is a little bland compared to the first film. Del Toro created something new and fresh and had that punching through a wall music score that just made you excited. Uprising was lacking that energy the first movie had.I definitely recommend seeing this film on the big screen for its visually exciting action.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
26,Floated2,Watered down sequel,2,29 May 2019,"The original Pacifim Rim was entertaining and had an interesting story with Charlie Hunnam. This sequel feels much more forced, more childish and watered down in that sense. With a story which has been done many times before, this film just wasn't nearly as entertaining and engaging as the original.There is a much different tone, where this felt a lot more child-friendly and felt like a live action cartoon. Most of all, the characters just did not have any interest compared to the original, and were too many. The story was confusing and felt over the top to the point where the focus was hard to follow. The robot visuals are nice to look at but as a whole, this sequel felt worse than the latest Transformer's film (not Bumblebee).",Pacific Rim - Uprising
27,eddie_baggins,"Pointless, just re-watch the original",2,21 November 2018,"I'm not sure there's too many people out there who would call Guillermo Del Toro's 2013 robot/monster infused popcorn event Pacific Rim a classic of any sort but the eye-candy clad and seriously entertaining experience looks like a genuine masterpiece when placed alongside this charmless and trite sequel.Somehow turning the prospect of giant robots and oversized monsters going at each other in a battle of life and death into an utterly boring and tiresome exercise, Pacific Rim: Uprising is the early death knell to a series that should've been a brand name that became the perfect excuse to turn your brain off and enjoy some big screen spectacle that is home to cheesy one liners, over the top CGI infused carnage and some A-listers hamming it up for good measure.Taking over directing duties from Del Toro, debut feature film director Steven S. DeKnight brings none of the child like charm or enthusiasm the Mexican auteur brought to the table with his entry as we instead get a lame and tame tale of Idris Elba's Stacker Pentecosts' child Jake (played by a struggling John Boyega) turn from troublemaker to Jager pilot, as the world finds itself once more under threat from the dreaded Kaiju monsters.The first Pacific Rim had a similarly dumb plot and characters that were more like walking caricatures but there was a sense that everyone involved was having a great time and despite better judgements, you as an audience member did to.That's completely lost here, there's little fun to be had with the bland and uninteresting action scenes, the main cast are all completely forgettable, while even returning cast members such as Charlie Day's Dr. Newton Geiszler and Burn Gorman's Hermann Gottlieb are more of a tacked on accessory, with Day in particular getting an embarrassing character development that is both lame and totally misguided.With a pulse-free plot line and thrill-free action there was little chance Uprising ever had at succeeding and there's little mystery as to why this unwanted sequel failed to capture the dollars at the box-office, guaranteeing the Pacific Rim brand is now dead in the water.Final Say -Not even the most hardcore of Pacific Rim fans will find much to enjoy in Uprising, an utterly forgettable and disposable new entry into the wannabe franchise that somehow manages to turn it's over the top foundations into a bland, charm-free and tiresome event.1 child mechanic out of 5",Pacific Rim - Uprising
28,leonblackwood,Could have been much better! 4/10,4,22 August 2018,"Review:
I wasn't that impressed with the first movie in this franchise, so I didn't jump out of my seat when I heard they were making a sequel. I was impressed with the CGI but the storyline, and the annoying characters, really let the movie down. The technical jargon also got on my nerves after a while, and the battle scenes looked a right mess in places but the attention to detail was amazing. Anyway, the movie is set in 2035, ten years after the Battle of the Breach, and former Jaeger pilot, Jake Pentecost (John Boyega), son of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), makes a living by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the black market in Los Angeles. After tracking part of a disabled Jaeger power core in a secret workshop of a 15-year-old Jaeger enthusiast, Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny), both are arrested by the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps after battling to escape in their single-pilot Jaeger, Scrapper. Jake's adopted sister and PPDC Secretary-General, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), gives Jake a choice between prison or returning to PPDC as an instructor, with Amara as his recruit. Jake decides to train the recruits at a Shatterdome in China, alongside his former co-pilot Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood). While Mako is delivering her final assessment about a new set of drones, her helicopter is shot down by a rogue Jaeger, Obsidian Fury, which immediately kills her before she can send her report. Her death prompts the PPDC council to authorise the drone program and order their immediate deployment. Just before Mako died, she transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in Siberia, so Jake and Nate travel there in their own Jaeger, were they meet up with Obsidian Fury, who destroys the facility before his death. After examining his body, they realise that he was controlled by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on earth. When the drones reach their respective locations, they are taken over by cloned Kaiju brains and simultaneously attack Shatterdomes worldwide, inflicting heavy casualties on PPDC forces and incapacitating almost all Jaegers. Herman Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) seeks out Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day), for help, only to discover that Geiszler is the mastermind behind the attack. His mind has been taken over by the Precursors, the alien race who created the Kaiju. Seeking to destroy the world for the Precursors, Geiszler, now their emissary, commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open new breaches all over the world. Meanwhile, Jake and his team realise that the Precursors goal is to activate the Ring of Fire by detonating Mount Fuji with the Kaiju's chemically reactive blood, spreading toxic gas into the atmosphere and wiping out all life on Earth while terraforming the planet for Precursor colonisation. Of Course! After a heavy battle between the Jaegers and the Kaiju, Geiszler merges his Kaiju into a Mega-Kaiju using robotic parasites, that quickly overpower the Jaegers. With only one of the Jaegers left to save the planet, and most of the cadets either dead or harmed from the wreckage, the team try to work out how to take down the Kaiju. After Nate gets badly damaged, Jake and Amara pilot the last Jaeger, and they weld a rocket to its right hand, which sends them into the atmosphere, free-falling back to Earth, colliding into the Mega-Kaiju, which finally kills him. Before they make impact, Jack and Amara survive by ejecting out of the Jaeger in an escape pod. Geiszler tries to escape, once he sees that his plan has failed but Nate manages to catch and lock him up. Can someone please tell me why these directors have to over complicate such a simple concept? I found myself falling asleep once they started to mention all of these different sets of droids, and when the various organisations came into play, I just lost interest. Boyega's comedic acting style saved the film but the corny script and overdramatic soundtrack contributed to the movie being a terrible sequel. On the plus side, it did look good, in terms of the robots and the huge sets but it wasn't enough to save the film. With no form of character building with the crew and no outcome after saving the world, it really was a poor watch in my eyes. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Steven S. DeKnight, who was lucky to get such a big budget to make this movie because he has never directed a film before. He previously directed episodes for Angel, Smallville, Dollhouse, Spartacus and Daredevil but it is directional debut, I honestly think that he could have done better. A lot of the teenage cast was annoying, so I wasn't that bothered if they lived or not, and Charlie Day's constant blabbering got on my nerves. With no movies in the pipeline, especially after this bad sequel, Steven has to be grateful that this movie made a profit, even though the critics weren't that impressed. If they decide to make a 3rd movie, they really need to think about spending some of the budget on some decent actors, and try and give the cast a back story, so when they die, it really does mean something.

29,TheMovieDiorama,"Pacific Rim: Uprising certainly isn't ""cancelling the apocalypse"".",4,25 March 2018,"They had such an easy task, simply place giant humanoid robots against catastrophic terrestrial monsters and watch the carnage unleash upon itself. Del Toro effortlessly achieved that in the original, this sequel however just made too many bad decisions to be classed as enjoyable. Ten years after the war from the previous film, a group of young jaeger cadets must rapidly learn how to control their machines in order to prevent the kaijus from destroying the world...again. Ohhh but if only it was that simple. We have four screenplay writers, with DeKnight also directing. They somehow turned a simple popcorn blockbuster into a stupid mindless mess that is plagued with horrendous plot choices. Honestly, this script was diabolical. No hyperbole, no over exaggeration. Just. Pure. Stupidity. The unfunny humour was forced into every scene in an attempt to establish personalities. The amount of exposition was enough to make the kaijus savagely tear each other apart. However most regrettably, the story was painfully woeful. A primary antagonist, really? A small group of teenagers are tasked with saving the world? Come on! It's like 'Power Rangers' fondled with 'Transformers' and somehow gave birth to this. Too much of the runtime was spent dabbling into corrupted drone jaegers and not enough attention was given to the kaijus. Charlie Day...I mean, I can see the Golden Raspberry nomination now. Awful awful awful! Plus, not enough Kikuchi, which is a crime in itself. The third act was the saving grace of this mess. Why? Because that's what people paid to see. Destruction, chaos, colossal fights with an inventive arsenal of weaponry...it's what dreams are made of kids. The sound editing was phenomenal, the technological noises of the plasma cannon and gravity sling was music to my ears. After you wait an hour and thirty minutes, you get the film you truly deserve.

Pacific Rim: Uprising is such a ""product"" - soulless, predictable, interchangeable, redundancy in extremo. Of course, the movie got a pro production value and the guys behind the cam and the CIG-department know their business and the actors, well act, but this is the kind of movie you will watch and forget and will make no impression to most of us at all.I guess, for a younger audience maybe still exciting because of the Mechs.

32,southdavid,Specific Dim: Downvoting.,3,4 April 2018,"OK... so here's the thing. I didn't really like the first ""Pacific Rim"" and that one had the creative vision on one of my favourite directors, Guillermo Del Toro behind it. It's perhaps not that surprising then that I didn't really enjoy ""Uprising"" either. There are plus points over the original, it doesn't have Charlie Hunnam in it, for one thing... which improves matters no end. His replacement is John Boyega, whose natural wit and charm makes him a compelling character, even if he's sometimes crudely pasted into a role that clearly wasn't the original idea. Boyega is Jake Pentegor son of Idris Elba's Stacker, sacrificial hero of the original. Having flunked out of Jaeger school, he's drawn back in when the law catches up to him. He rejoins just as the pilot scheme is in danger of being replaced with fully automated robots, that it until one goes rogue and attacks the remaining bases that a in the process of being decommissioned. From then on it's just ""Power Rangers"" with a bigger budget. It's actually pretty impressive how boring they've managed to make a film about giant fighting robots. Part of the problem is that the film talks about the characters and Jaeger's as if you're naturally supposed to know or care about them. They engage in consequence free/ damage free fighting (until the plot requires) until the films end. Admittedly, I did like the development involving Charlie Day's character, that was at least a little bit unexpected . . . but beyond that it's a tepid lifeless experience that you'll have forgotten before you've left the cinema.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
33,jamesrupert2014,Juvenile monster-mecha mashup,4,9 January 2020,"Heroic giant mecha fight rogue giant mecha and giant monsters in this lackluster, by-the-numbers, sequel to 'Pacific Rim' (2013). The film is made for kids, necessitating ridiculous premises such as a 15 year old constructing a fully functioning mecha-suit out of scrap, undetected, and on her own. Any moment of tension or drama (including characters' deaths) is immediately undercut by a quip or a cutaway to the essentially 'comic-relief' villain, presumably to avoid distressing the audience. The derivative script is full of strained banter, predictable 'sassy-talkback', and deadening clichés and, at times, the imagery is not much better, with the mechas striking heroic poses and flailing around with their various 'melee' weapons as they fight the same craggy, poorly defined monsters that they scrapped with in the original (although I agree with comments that the sfx team deserves credit for generating many scenes in bright light rather than in the dark, underwater, or in pouring rain as was often the case in the original). The acting is on par with the material, with no one going much beyond a hackneyed plug-in genre character. I am decades past the film's target audience but, as a lifelong fan of kaiju films, I'd be fully prepared to enjoy it if it was any good, but it's not, so I'll check it off my life-list and forget about it.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

John Boyega is pretty likable here, even when moments he wasn't trying to be. The rest of the cast are also pretty enjoyable, I mean everybody really shines also. The effects are also great, fight scenes are a fun rollercoaster ride.

This is a sequel to Guillermo del Toro's 2013 Pacific Rim. It's directed by Steven S. DeKnight, in his first time directing a movie, although he has done some tv. He's not as good as Guillermo del Toro but then again, who is. This one takes place about 10 years after the first movie and John plays the son of Idris Elba's character, from the first one. There has not been any monster sightings-or Kaiju, as they are called here-but they are still building and training the Jaegers, or giant robots that are used to fight the Kaijus. When an unidentified Jaeger shows up and starts wrecking havoc, John joins Scott-man, he looks more like his father every day-and Cailee-a new recruit-in fighting the rogue robot and soon discover that there is a new plan to bring more Kaijus into our world. Charlie returns, working for a Japanese company that has developed a new drone robot-no pilots inside-that is supposed to replace the Jagers. There are lots of giant robot battles, both against other robots and against the Kaijus and a plot is uncovered that has one of the humans betraying them-the person has been possessed by a Kaiju brain. Now I know that this movie is not for everybody. But if you like giant robots and monsters duking it out, then you should enjoy this movie-I know I did. And the end leaves things ready for another sequel.

A long majority of the film is spent outside the giant mechs, doting over a slew of thin, bland, mostly-new focal figures instead.It seems frightened to cut loose, withholding the payout for fear it can't measure up. Those worries are well-founded. Once the monster threat finally rears its head and the city block-sized laser swords start flying, Uprising is a pale impersonation. Gone are the unique, individualized robotic designs of the previous film, replaced with a standardized set of forms that would easily run together in action scenes without their helpfully colorful paint jobs.Well-founded rules and restrictions for the universe, an important set of boundaries established and obeyed in the first film, are hand-waved away as soon as it's convenient to do so. What few returning characters remain are reduced to simple archetypes, emotionlessly going through the motions alongside the new cast members. It isn't even all that much fun to watch, despite all the flashing lights, rumbling buildings and well-trodden action movie conventions.

38,XweAponX,I was expecting to hate this like everyone else,10,8 June 2018,"Especially without Guillermo Del Toro directing.  But in fact I liked it, this is a faithful sequel. And it has the two crazy guys, so my score is mostly for those guys because they were perfect, they brought so much to the first film and they carry on with the utter inanity here, those two guys just work well together regardless of who directed them  And of course this is aimed more toward kids, with all of these young actors playing recruits. But they don't take over the entire plot like I was expecting them to. It's too bad Guillermo did not participate in this one as well, but he had other things to do. This movie doesn't have the high quality stamp that a Del Toro movie has, but due to the first half of the movie that I just watched right now, The story being told here is way over the top of the rails. It's a direction the story went that I accept based on what happened in the first film, I felt it was plausible. There are a lot of surprises in, things that you wouldn't expect and it was all handled well. Unfortunately the special effects we're not handled as well as they were on the first photo realistic film. Despite these issues, I am enjoying this quite a bit. And it deserves the rating I just gave it. I eagerly await the flood of nonhelpfuls, but this movie really isn't as bad as all that, none of the negative reviews I read give a valid reason why this isn't very good other than ""they hated it"", of course it's not as good as the first one, but is certainly not horrible or bad. I mean this is not like Star Wars episodes one through three at all: and that is exactly what I was expecting. It is done well for not undergoing the meticulous direction that Del Toro would have put into it. And the director is only experienced with television shows and as a writer, but I am familiar with his work especially with ""Dollhouse"", he penned one of the best episodes of that, one that became iconic for that show. So much that it was used for publicity. And he had experience as a consulting producer and as a director as well. It's different experience than Del Toro, but he did a lot here to make continuity between the first film and this one. We are missing some of his incredibly bizarre creature design which Del Toro always handles by himself in most of his films, but he did great homage to Del Toro's work. And if you look outside of IMDb, other reviewer's have given it a better rating. Not to mention it made all of its money back which it certainly would not have done had been as bad as they say. This is another film that I heard about because of the people talking about it and what I heard was not ""I hate this"", but rather that they were surprised that they liked it, like me. I don't care if I am the only reviewer on iMDB that liked it, but I did. And nobody is going to take that from me.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
39,alindsay-al,A poor big monster movie,3,12 April 2018,"To start off this review I loved the first Pacific rim film and felt is was a very unique film, this sequel has finally come out and with a new director this film falls very flat compared to that first film. The premise of the film sees a disgraced ex jaegar pilot forced to return to help save the world with help from fellow pilots. John Boyega plays the lead in this film and he does a decent job, the guy is very charming and charismatic in this film which helps make him the likeable character in this film. However, his character just isn't particularly interesting or serious, at times it feels like a Tony Stark rip off without the dramatic flaws of that character. The supporting cast is just full of poor performances, Scott Eastwood plays his co pilot and he is so cliché in this film. He plays the generic tough army guy and there is absolutely nothing special about his character to make you care about him. The group of cadets in the film are just a bunch of whiny kids that don't really grow or develop throughout the film. The scientists from the first film are back played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman and they are just so cheesy in this film especially Day who is just so annoying and stupid throughout the entire film. The story isn't what you go to this film for but I at least need a decent story for the characters development and this film just doesn't have it. It's very basic and the development of the characters feels flawed and forced into the movie, this film also ends incredibly abruptly which I hated. The script for this film misses the mark so much, this film attempts more humour then the original film and it just doesn't work. The humour comes at times when it feels really out of place, mixed with a lack of compelling drama this is a big mix. The one part of this film that is great is the style, the action scenes are still cool to watch and really unique for this day and age. Even though it is less interesting then previously seen the action feels huge in stature and stakes to suck you in and enjoy the action scenes when they are taking place. Overall this was one of my most anticipated films for 2018 but it has turned out to be a huge disappointment and a poor film that isn't worth a watch.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

43,jimbo-53-186511,Little more than visual eye candy,5,6 January 2019,"Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) is the son of Stacker Pentecost who tragically lost his life when the Kaiju last attacked 10 years ago. In the present day, Jake makes his money by wheeling and dealing with stolen Jaeger parts from a decommissioned site, but it appears that he has a rival when he tracks down a young girl Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) whom is building her own Jaeger in anticipation of an attack from the Kaiju. When both are caught for using an unlicensed Jaeger, they are given a choice; either take part in a programme as trainer and recruit respectively or face jail time, they choose the former and whilst everyone is awaiting an attack from the Kaiju, it appears that the real threat is much closer to home...Having enjoyed the original film (which to my surprise was met with mixed/largely negative reception) I looked forward to this sequel and was hoping for a decent expansion/continuation of the story, but sadly I just did not get as much out of this sequel as I did with the first film.There are a whole host of problems with this film; it isn't as emotionally involving as the first film (despite the various attempts that are made to wring out emotion), the characters aren't as interesting or particularly well developed and despite my best efforts I just couldn't get involved in the story and just didn't find it all that interesting. Director Steven S DeKnight has perhaps tried to emulate Del Toro's style as director in the original film (as one of the producers one can assume that Del Toro must have had some involvement in this side of proceedings), but it simply doesn't work as well here. The mind-meld sequences don't hit home in the same way here as they did in the original film and DeKnight's haphazard approach to directing and writing also doesn't help - he pulls the film in far too many directions and if I'm honest buy the time I'd realised where the film was ultimately going I really didn't care all that much.Still as a very basic film it is perfectly acceptable and watchable; a lot of the action sequences are fairly well-handled and despite some rather muddled plotting the film is relatively well-paced. The characters, whilst not being particularly interesting, at least do have a fairly good camaraderie (with some in jokey humour which is mostly hit with some miss) and to their credit they are a fairly likeable bunch.Still despite some of its very basic strengths this is not a particularly good film as the story is rather muddled, threadbare and fairly uninteresting. Therefore it's left to the visuals and action sequences to carry the film (this was the case in the first film, but I felt they complimented the first film rather than carried it). It's noticeably weaker than the first film and whilst it isn't unwatchable - it moves too well to render it boring, but at the same time with a fairly dull narrative Pacific Rim: Uprising is little more than visual eye candy.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
44,lukem-52760,NOTHING SPECIAL.,5,17 February 2019,"There was nothing really special or exciting about this sequel but i did like it more than the first film & that was because of the stars John Boyega & Scott Eastwood were ok.
The first film by the great Del Toro is alot better.John Boyega is just cool & is a very good actor & i liked him from his breakthrough role as Moses in Attack the Block (2011) so i knew this guy would make it big & he did so yeah he is a great rebellious lead & a nice guy character & Scott Eastwood makes a good solid more serious lead next to John who is more fun so they do make a good team & friends on screen.The monster are cool nothing amazing just good to fight against really & the big robots look cool pretty much the same as the first film in alot of ways just all set 10 yrs later but uprising does have a very cool slick edge to it & that's because of John Boyega as the lead & the start is very fun & cool because of his performance so yes he carries the whole movie & is a great lead.So yes uprising is a good fun Action packed sci-fi adventure but nothing really special like i said & it often feels like a Transformers film mixed with power rangers but it's solid fun but i will make one big complaint & THAT'S I'm sick & bored of seeing c.g.i cities being destroyed by fighting in the city it's very boring now & is in every big budget movie going like all the Transformers films & Marvel & Dc films & many many more it's very repetitive & boring & cheap looking now!!!

After a clash with a criminal gang he links up with Amara (Cailee Spaeny) a 15 year old hacker who has built her own mini-Jaeger, Scrappy. After a run in with the Pan-Pacific Defence Force, Jake is back as a Ranger with Nate (Scott Eastwood) and Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) training Jaeger Pilot Cadets and Amara is a Cadet.Cue stock tensions among the Ranger Trio and also within the Cadet group.There is a plan however to pilot all future Jaegers as drones, this will require only one pilot per Jaeger. Meanwhile a rogue Jaeger appears, demolishes the UN HQ and attempts to assassinate the UN Secretary General! There is something odd going on! The first rogue Jaeger attack made no sense, only a Bond villain undergoing a psychotic episode would order it. It put the entire masterplan at risk.Some good fight scenes between Jaegers, especially in the first half of the film. But not even good acting by Boyega and Spaeny save the film. It is a mess. The Kaiju return but that is spun out. It was really disappointing, 5/10 at most. 114 minutes but it seemed much longer.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
46,aidanratesmovies,"Not disappointing, just sad",5,16 February 2019,"Pacific Rim Uprising plays out more like Independence Day Resurgence than a true sequel. Jut like Resurgence, the film is so full of forced unnatural dialogue and unlikeable characters, it almost seems identical. So much in a way you would wonder why the studio couldn't take a hint the first time around? The film is saved slightly from John Boyega in the leading role, but this is a small relief, when everything and everyone that made the first film what it was, is made into a otherwise unlikely group of cliches that you can't help but want to reach out and fix. Pacific Rim doesn't even come close to the feel of Del Toro's original, in fact it comes closer to a toy commercial. You're better off watching the first one, or even more, staying home and watching Independence Day again. It's never too early for the fourth of July.

47,peterp-450-298716,I should stick to my plan not to watch sequels anymore.,3,17 August 2018,"It does not matter who your parents are,
where you came from,
who believed in you
and who didn't.
We are a family now, and we are earth's last defense.What amazed me the most was the fact that I couldn't remember much of ""Pacific Rim"", even though I thought it was an original-looking film years ago. No worries. Little by little everything is explained again in such a way that I partially knew it again. And even though ""Pacific Rim"" wasn't high-quality cinema and simply a very expensive monster film with superb looking computer-generated images, the film impressed me at the time. ""Pacific Rim"" was brainless amusement with a high entertainment value. This sequel is simply a duplicate with other main characters in identical Jaegers. But it's so irritating and annoying mostly. I was hoping this time the Kaiju's took control and destroyed planet earth. That way we don't need to be afraid of a possible sequel in the future.Since the design and subject are identical to that of the initial film, one could say that it's thanks to Guillermo Del Toro the first film was kind of a success. But that's a bit simplistic to state, in my opinion. I rather think there are several factors that ensure that you can't really call this a successful film. This time the entire Jaeger program shifts from a mature world to that of teenagers. We end up in a cadet school where young people are trained to become Jaeger pilots. A bit like in ""Ender's game"" but now it's not in space. And of course, there's one of the cadets who can't stand the newcomer Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) and believes she doesn't belong there. And who will be the hero in the end? Yep, not hard to guess. Anyway, it all feels a bit like a kindergarten. The Goonies in giant robots who save the world. Haven't we seen that before?Also, the acting wasn't something to get enthusiastic about. Cailee Spaeny was acceptable with her youthful enthusiasm and rebellious behavior. John Boyega sometimes played the indifferent Jake with reluctance. Scott Eastwood was again suitable for the character Nate. And not only because of that creepy resemblance to his famous father. But the acting by Burn Gorman, Charlie Day and Tian Jing was at times simply bad. Bad enough to make me squirm.Only the graphical part remains. Just like the 2013 film, it's a visual spectacle. And just like the acting, there are also ups-and-downs here. It's fun to see huge robots and enormous monsters smashing into one another. But to be honest, it's the same old thing as in the previous movie. And the final battle in a Japanese city close to ""Mount Fuji"" just looked ugly. It wasn't as if this clash of the titans took place in between blocks of flats made from cardboard. Just like in those ancient Godzilla films. But it's a close call. The duel on the ice, on the other hand, looked extremely great. A computer-graphic masterpiece.Do you like to watch huge robots and by extraterrestrial created monsters battle each other? Then I guess this film is right up your alley. Have you seen ""Pacific Rim"" years ago? Then you can safely skip this one because you won't be seeing something really new here. To be honest, I sometimes had the feeling that I was watching a modern version of the Power Rangers. Only the creatures who emerged from another dimension resembled those that the Power Rangers fought against a long time ago. Ridiculously long time ago.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

This picture fails to even do that. The characters are dull and we are given no reason to care for them or any of their problems, the fight scenes (which, lets be honest, are the reason we all showed up) are unimaginative and one-note, and the final film is so unmemorable that you'll have forgotten the character's names by the time you've passed through the theatre doors.

50,rannynm,"Big Robots, Big Monsters, Amazing Visuals",8,12 April 2018,"This action-packed film is pretty decent. I like that the plot continues from the last movie. The characters are as interesting as their story. The one problem is the sequencing. Some scenes are pointless and are ordered in such a way that they don't make sense. However, if you like fighting robots, you'll love it. Pacific Rim: Uprising is the sequel to Pacific Rim. It takes place ten years after the war, which took place in the first film, was won. Jake Pentecost (John Boyegas), a carefree, retired pilot, is living life in a messed-up world. Through unwanted circumstances, he meets a 15-year old hacker named Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny). With common personalities and different pasts, they create a bond that no one can break. With this new bond, old friends of Jake's and new friends of Amara's collaborate to fight the Kaiju for what is left of humanity. This film is directed and written by Steven S. DeKnight, known for producing the Netflix series Daredevil. DeKnight pulls the story together without losing your attention on the main crisis with the Kaiju. My hats off to the special effects team. The robot close-ups are so realistic, it seems like you can reach out and touch them. The robot fights are also extremely real. The intense music by Lorne Balfe makes the movie extremely engaging. It is also surprisingly comical. Jake Pentecost's sarcastic tone makes you question whether the group is really living in a life or death situation or not. 
>My favorite character is Amara. She has a spark from beginning to end in the movie. Her ability to create her very own robot or Jaeger is amazing. Her curiosity and her attitude about doing the right thing is pleasant to see in an action movie. Seeing the connection between Jake and Amara develop throughout the film is a favorite part. The message of this film is that ""despite who your family is, who you think you are or what you've done in the past, you can still be a hero.""

The success of Pacific Rim, which was financed by Legendary back when it had a deal with Warner Bros to make movies like that, along with the merchandise and home media and tv sales, forced Legendary, now owned by Wanda from China, to create a sequel, this time released by Universal, called Uprising. The reaction to this movie is awful. Here we have John Boyega, fresh off his turn as Finn in the first two of the star wars sequel trilogy, as the main hero. Add to that a mixture of asian and british actors and actresses, and a higher budget, and this movie became somewhat of a box office failure, with the third and maybe final movie in the series in the wings. At least Legendary has other projects that are far more successful, such as the Godzilla monsterverse with Warner Bros that continues with Godzilla King of the Monsters next year and Godzilla vs Kong the following year after the successes of the 2014 godzilla reboot and Kong Skull Island.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

55,moviexclusive,"As long as all you're looking for is fun and thrilling robots-versus-monsters spectacle, this straightforward blockbuster of a sequel should do fine",6,22 March 2018,"With all due respect to newly minted Academy Award winning director Guillermo del Toro, his 2013 love letter to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda's monster films was an all-too self-serious affair that took the fun out of watching giant robots fight against giant monsters. So as admirable as del Toro's intent of injecting dramatic heft with the concept of 'drifting' (i.e. where pairs of pilots gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings in order to operate the neural load of one of them giant mechas known as 'Jaegers') may be, the movie just wasn't as fun as it should have been, which was probably one of the reasons why it underwhelmed at the US box office.How much you love Steven S. DeKnight's continuation of that universe depends on how much you were in love with del Toro's empathy metaphor as well as his tone of sobriety. Indeed, much as one of the lead characters - namely, the teenage orphan Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) - has to overcome her own traumatic loss of her family in order to properly pilot a Jaeger, there is much less emphasis here on the so-called psychic link that the pair of pilots have to forge in order to 'drift'. At the same time, DeKnight and his three co-screenwriters have opted for a much lighter tone throughout, which is evident not only in the wry banter that the characters engage in but also in almost all of its robots-versus-monsters brawls now take place in the brightness of day (than the darkness of night).Truth be told, 'Pacific Rim Uprising' is a lot more straightforwardly entertaining than its predecessor. Compared to the wounded survivors of the previous movie, our hero is here a roguish slacker Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) - who, for what it's worth, is the son of Idris Elba's martyr hero Stacker - happily passing his days partying and selling parts from decommissioned Jaegers on the black market. On one of his scavenger hunts, he runs into fellow scrounger Amara, who is collecting parts for her own DIY Bumblebee-like Jaeger creation named Scrapper. Given a choice between jail and service when arrested, Jake opts to join his former partner Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) to train a new generation of Jaeger pilots at the Pan Pacific Defense Force's new Chinese headquarters, while Amara chooses to enlist as one of his cadets.Like we alluded to earlier, character isn't so much a priority here as it was in del Toro's 2013 original, so it doesn't go much further with the new additions than Jake as a reluctant hero with outsider cool, Nate as a square-jawed duty-bound soldier and Amara as a Jaeger fanatic whom Jake will come to personally mentor. Fans of the original will welcome the return of some of the surviving characters - including Jake's half sister Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) and the two vaudevillian scientists Dr Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Dr Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - and be heartened to know that they are important pieces in the narrative puzzle.Without giving away too much, let's just say that there is a good conspiracy woven in that has to do with a rival drone project led by tech tycoon Shao Liwen (Jing Tian) of the shadowy Shao Foundation as well as the leftovers of the 'kaiju' from the earlier apocalyptic-cancelling battle fought a decade ago. Uncovering the puppet master behind a rogue Jaeger is what brings Jake and Nate on a globe-trotting mission from Sydney to Siberia and finally to Tokyo, the last of which is also where the climactic battle with a trio of Category 4 and 5 'kaijus'. Besides being utterly befitting of the cultural origins of the 'kaijus', the cross-country trek also adds freshness to the stream of nicely choreographed CG destruction.Oh yes, the very raison d'etre for most audiences of the 'Pacific Rim' universe is really to witness mountain-sized robots and monsters punching each other, and DeKnight satisfies that desire for spectacle by pulling off some impressive, even jaw-dropping, shots of mayhem. There are two mano-a-manos between the Gypsy Danger 2.0 that Jake and Nate pilots and the aforementioned rogue Jaeger of pure gleaming steel, the first in downtown Sydney and the next on the ice in Siberia; and the piece de resistance is no doubt the showdown in central Tokyo that sees three 'kaijus' transform into a mega-'kaiju' (much like how the Power Rangers 'zods' combine into a Megazod). To his credit, DeKnight eschews the nausea-inducing cinematography of the 'Transformers' franchise, so you can see the battles in their full glory; notwithstanding, there is no shaking off the feeling that the fights don't feel as epic as they ought to be, even coming off cartoony at times.And so, while del Toro's franchise opener was probably too sombre for its own good, this sequel pivots quite drastically to the other extreme, thereby diminishing the stakes involved as well as the gee-whiz grandeur. We do wish there were more personality to the Jaegers though, apart from being the one with the electric whip or the 'gravity slings' or the plasma swords. That said, it is engaging in a fun way which the original never was, in huge part due to Boyega's infectious charisma as well as his spontaneous chemistry with his co-stars Spaeny and Eastwood. The action too is frequently thrilling, and the visual effects work top-notch. If only it had more edge and threat, as well as more personality, this 'Uprising' would indeed be worthy of its title.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

59,Troy_Campbell,"Adequate action, but disappointing overall.",5,25 March 2018,"I love Guillermo del Toro's 2013 Pacific Rim. Having seen it a handful of times, it's what you could safely call one of my guilty pleasures. It's big, it's loud, it's downright ludicrous; but it oozes panache and del Toro's trademark giddiness for cinema. This follow-up, with Steven S. DeKnight replacing del Toro behind the camera, is just as big, loud and downright ludicrous as its predecessor, yet it lacks that critical, intangible spark that makes those elements delightful rather than a tad numbing. Having defeated the city-destroying alien Kaiju ten years ago, the world has settled back into normal life and Jake Pentecost (John Boyega, a likeable anti-hero) - son of the apocalypse-cancelling, self-sacrificing hero Stacker (Idris Elba) from the last film - is a thieving rogue stuck in Daddy's shadow. In order to avoid prison Jake and newfound pal Amara (Cailee Spaeny), a precocious orphan screaming out for a role model, opt in for military service. It's good timing too, because of course there's another Kaiju attack mounting and preternaturally talented pilots for the Jaegers (aka big robots) are needed. Intricate plotting and profound character development is obviously not high on DeKnight's priority list, but this doesn't excuse the gigantic plot holes or painfully juvenile humour that is lazily dished up by the writers. Thankfully the action, spread across four major set pieces, is mostly satisfying, albeit without as many jaw-dropping moments as the original. (A climactic Kaiju ""enhancement"" is pretty awesome though.) Five years worth of improvements in CGI technology and an increased budget also allows the larger-than-life sequences to be staged in broad daylight, rather than masked by heavy rain or night-time skies, which DeKnight capitalises on with plenty of wide shots and relatively judicious editing. It's really just a shame that the Wow-factor seems to have been lost in a sequel that feels like it's more often ticking off boxes than going for broke. And whoever thought it was a good idea to bring back Charlie Day and Burn Gorman for their excruciating comedic double-act needs to be fired from the studio. The adequate action sequences and Boyega's easy charisma ensure this isn't a complete dud, but with returns diminishing quicker than expected, Uprising is a disappointing effort that could very well be the end of the Pacific Rim franchise.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
60,Jeremy_Urquhart,It's sort of watchable I guess,5,13 April 2020,"Despite loving the first Pacific Rim, and being a huge fan of monster/kaiju movies in general, I didn't have high expectations for Pacific Rim: Uprising. The first trailer wasn't exactly great, and then the reviews came in and they were pretty middling. I never ended up catching it at the movies, despite the first Pacific Rim being one of my most enjoyable experiences at the cinema, and so when it finally popped up on streaming services, I gave it a reluctant shot.Look, there are aspects of this movie that are pretty bad, but as a whole, I wouldn't call it terrible. The action is still somewhat fun, in a mindless way, but admittedly not as good as the set pieces from the first. I'll give it credit for being colourful, and setting a lot of its action in the daylight, which is rare to see in modern monster movies. John Boyega does the best he can (he really does deserve so much better though- I generally like him in the recent Star Wars movies, but even there he's a little under utilised), and Charlie Day is somewhat entertaining here. The robots and monsters still look cool, but again: maybe not as cool as they did in the first movie.So those positives are pretty mild, to be honest. Makes me think 5/10 could be generous, but I got a kick out of some shallow, over the top actions scenes and cool robot/monster designs. It's not enough to make the movie technically good, however. If you're not as easily impressed by such simple things, you're likely going to dislike almost 100% of this movie.The story is all over the place, with several subplots cut between with little rhyme or reason. There are a group of annoying, poorly developed teenage characters in the film, and honestly, I only remembered they existed every time they were cut back to. That's how forgettable and inessential to the overall film they felt. The characters were serviceable in the first film, and some return here, but for the most part, they're not interesting enough to truly care about.Del Toro had little involvement in this film and it shows. He injected a true sense of fun and awe into the first Pacific Rim, and a mild level of self-awareness that allowed you to enjoy the film without taking it too seriously, while still marvelling at its surprising beauty and take it just seriously enough so that it didn't feel like a joke, or a parody. It's a surprisingly clever film, even in the screenplay department. Sure, it's not an absolute masterpiece, but it knows exactly what it is, what it needs to do, and how to engage its audience, and it's a massive success as a result.This one is less admirable in that regard. The storyline feels even less essential, and only exists to provide breathing room between the action scenes. The monsters themselves take too long to show up, and in a mid-credits scene, a premise for a third film (that'll probably never happen) is teased; a premise that Pacific Rim: Uprising should have simply used instead! The story here is so lacklustre and all over the place that I'm surprised it was approved for shooting.Pacific Rim: Uprising won't be a disappointment to most people who wouldn't expect much from a Pacific Rim sequel in the first place, but for people who found themselves surprisingly loving the first (like myself), it might well be. You could technically do worse, but you could also do so much better. For example, you could just rewatch the first again. It holds up, and was crafted by a filmmaker who knew exactly what he was doing. Its sequel may be sporadically fun in a very shallow way, but it has no focus, poorer humour and characters, and little reason to exist beyond showing some fairly cool robot and monster scenes.Avoid unless you're an absolutely diehard fan of the genre; even then, some disappointment with this film is very likely.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

64,rockman182,Pacific Rim Uprising (2018),6,26 March 2018,"When I first saw this trailer, I was like ""wow this looks like crap."" It looked remarkably unspectacular, and the annoying repetition of that 2Pac song did not help. The first film was just okay. I'll say this over and over, Guillermo Del Torro is a fantastic visual filmmaker, but his films plots are always lacking. That was the case for Pacific Rim. Seeing that he departed and his script for the sequel was revised left me with less hope for this film. As it is though, I have seen it. Its about what I expected quality wise but it gets the basic job of delivering giant monster vs robot action.The film follows the son of Stacker Pentecost, Jake (played by John Boyega). He is a former Jaeger pilot and is taken back into piloting Jaeger's when a threat of rogue Jaegers and new Kaiju re-surfaces. He also befriends a young girl named Amara, who is quick to learn how to maneuver a Jaeger. Just attempting to summarize the plot of this film was painful since the terminology sounds so dumb. Basically, it follows the events of the first film ten years later.Robot v monster action is on point. Its the least we expected and we got it. The action scenes are fun enough. I didn't really care for so much back story of characters so the character involvement and the ""human element"" of the film was not very interesting. The film is quite bland outside. Charlie Day returns in the film and is part of a plot point that I thought was kind of dumb. The story isn't anything groundbreaking but its not like this was expected. I also can't get into the universe of the Jaeger robots. They all look the same to me, and I can't remember their special names.This is at least a much more entertaining version of the last two Transformers films. Its also more coherent in its action and story, which really isn't hard to do. Its a good enough fil debut for a director taking the reigns from a well established filmmaker. I know the film series is attempting to build another film. I'd rather not but its not really in my control. I'll tune in but I hope for a massive turnaround.5.5/10",Pacific Rim - Uprising

66,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An adequate sequel that delivers on the action expected of it.,6,8 March 2019,"I think the trouble with some sequels, no matter how much I loved the original films, is that there's almost an unspoken meshing of elements that made the first movie enjoyable but can be hard to reproduce a second time. That being said, Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018) does a pretty good job of continuing the story that came to a mostly definitive end in Pacific Rim (2013). Unfortunately, it looks like they also took a play out of Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) and have teased at a further sequel past Uprising.I will admit that some sequels like Pacific Rim: Uprising have an easier time advancing the plot of the story since most of the exposition has been covered in the previous movie. There was certainly a creative and natural twist that helped bring back the Kaiju so that audiences could see giant robots fight them again. It was also fun to watch these Jaegers battle, much like we all enjoy the clashes between superheroes to see who is stronger (a la Captain America: Civil War (2016)). Even so, there was still something ""off"" about Uprising, and I think I know what it was.In the original Pacific Rim, most of the characters were unique and had clear goals and motivations. However, in Uprising, there is certainly less of that. John Boyega's Jake Pentecost didn't chew on the scenery for nearly long enough, merely falling into line when the danger became apparent. Scott Eastwood's performance was also equally distracting, especially with how much he resembles his father. While Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) was an empowering female character in Pacific Rim, Jules Reyes (Adria Arjona) seemed to be merely thrown in for ill-defined sexual tension. I also wasn't wild with the Ender's Game-esque addition of teenage pilots either. Still, the promise of Kaiju/Jaeger fights was satisfied.An adequate sequel that delivers on the action expected of it, I give Pacific Rim: Uprising 3.0 stars out of 5.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
67,RforFilm,"Pacific Rim: Uprising feels like a sequel created by committee. It has enough satisfying robot action, but not enough to save it from standard character and plot",6,26 March 2018,"In the time between the previous Pacific Rim and the new sequel, I've gotten around to watching anime that had been it's inspiration such as Neon Genesis: Evangelion and Mobile Suit Gundam. I had previously said that the first Pacific Rim was only a monster movie homage (and it still is). Now that original director Guillermo Del Toro had just won his Oscar for The Shape of Water, I had to question my previous statement. I've come to see that the Japanese love seeing their world in a larger scope and what technology can bring to warfare. What makes a lot of this anime, and Pacific Rim interesting is that it shows how much something unknown would force a change to the world military and the definition of an enemy. As a character study, Pacific Rim is there to be a crowd-pleasing spectacle first. This doesn't mean the movie is bad (in fact, I named it as a favorite of 2014). This simply means that there's nothing wrong with liking a movie about mech-controlled robots fighting space monsters. It just so happened that Del Toro created a world that resembled that similar kind of anime that was appealing to a mainstream audience. Let's see if this story can continue is Pacific Rim: Uprising.It has been ten years since that Bridge between worlds have closed and the monsters are no longer a threat to Pacific Ocean based cities. A former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost (played by John Boyega) is living the life of steeling former mech parts on the black market. He's eventually captured, along with another Jaeger engineer teenager Amara (played by Cailee Spaeny). His adopted sister, now General Secretary Mako Mori tells him that he has the choice of either jail, or returning to China to the Jaeger program, now as an instructor.Jake takes to offer and comes back not just to train the younger Jaeger pilots with former copilot Nate Lambert (played by Scott Eastwood), but with the threat from Shao Corporation from wanting to replace the human run Jaegers with drones. Cailee, meanwhile, continues to work with the other candidates, who resent her since they worked hard to get in while she was plucked. When a rouge Jaeger attacks Sydney, the drones are approved of, with the supervision of Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day). The Jaeger pilots try to find out who was behind the rouge mech and to see if the Kaiju monsters have returned.The reason I brought up the anime earlier was to show how inspiration and homage can lead to a creative and original project like Pacific Rim. Pacific Rim: Uprising feels like that it's more or less, copying rather then taking inspiration. Guillermo Del Toro is replaced by Steven S. DeKnight, who is certainly trying to replicate the original. The problem isn't the robot battles, which while they take a while to get to, at least have a lot of great imagery. What falters is the script.A lot of the plot elements, the rebel told to reenlist, the teenage tough girl, the evil corporation; these all feel like elements from other franchise stories that we've already seen. Because they all take the typical routes, Pacific Rim: Uprising is lacking in surprise. The original movie may have not a lot of original characters either, at least knew that the plot was mainly to defeat the monsters. This tries to pass off as character driven, but comes off as being an obvious product written by committee. So it is disappointing that you have to sit through a lot of predictability before you get to the battles the trailers promise you.I'll certainly give credit to all the actors for trying their best. In fact, I may like John Boyega as a better lead then Charlie Huffman was before, as Boyega is more charismatic. It should come as no surprise that the script was written by four people, indicating that there was more of a focus on building a franchise rather then a genially good story. I don't have a problem with it as long as I was entertained, which I was, but it just takes too long to get to the good stuff.I'll give this six Kaiju brains out of tem. If your just looking for from giant monsters and robot fighting, then you'll probably be satisfied. This is your standard blockbuster, which I imagine will be fine for most people. It's just that since the first one was made by Guillermo Del Toro, my expectations were a lot higher. Take what you get and see if Pacific Rim: Uprising is enough to keep you entertained.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

70,markthomassintek,In essence the sequel is in the same vein but and I'm very surprised and happy to say it is a whole lot more.,10,23 March 2018,"REVIEW - PACIFIC RIM UPRISINGAs every film fan knows sequels are NEVER as good as the original. In a vast majority of cases this is indeed true with only on a very rare occasion where a sequel is as good or better. The first Pacific Rim was an ok film, original story with silly human controlled huge robots fighting to protect the Earth. In essence the sequel is in the same vein but and I'm very surprised and happy to say it is a whole lot more. A cross between Transformers, Power Ranges and the inclusion of an anti hero with a great and surprising twist made the time sat watching this very enjoyable. Not as good as some but definitely better than others, kids will love it for the robots, adults will enjoy it for the concept and story. One definite positive was the robot fighting sequences. The biggest gripe for me with Transformers is that its all too fast and you can't take it all in but with this you can, with some fighting slowed down to allow you to do so, well done. The length of the film was perfect also, fast paced enough to keep you interested and not dragged out as some films tend to be. Rating 10 out of 10",Pacific Rim - Uprising
71,abisio,Funnier and more entertaining than the first one,9,25 March 2018,"Pacific Rim (part 1, the one directed by Guillermo del Toro) was a great movie but it was too serious for its own good.
The follow up keeps using a very similar structure to the first one but brushes off most of the over dramatic situations; thanks in great part to John Boyega and Scott Eastwood; a couple of actors that work very well together as demonstrated here.
Jake (John Boyeaga) plays Idris Elba character's son. He is a hot head living a very disastrous life that one day is caught stealing Jagger parts with a teenager Amara. Both are sent to Jagger's pilot training camp; however while Amara gets to be a cadet, Jake (who already was a Ranger) is sent to train the new recruits.
His old mate and Jagger co-pilot is Scott Eastwood; they spent most of the time fighting but you can smell a great chemistry among them.
Most of the surviving characters (but not Charlie Hunnam) are back and all of them get important parts in the events. 
The action scenes are more elaborated than the first one; but that would mean nothing if the story was not well orchestrated; but it works.
John Voyega is in my opinion the best thing about the new Star Wars series; he already demonstrated his commanding qualities on the under appreciated Attack the Block. 
Scott Eastwood has good comedy mojo that works very well here; but Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as the two nuts scientist of the first movie that carry most of the history and the comedy.
This is really a follow up of the first movie; so there are a few things that might not be clear if you did not see it; but in any case it is a lot of fun to watch.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
72,kjproulx,A Noisy and Disappointing Follow-Up,4,18 April 2018,"The first Pacific Rim was a very divisive film. Sure, it had its fair share of fans, but critics and fans either had a blast with it or it just wasn't for them. For myself, I was on the former end of that argument. I really enjoyed watching the spectacle of the first movie. Even though it was flawed, it was all about caring of the characters and whether or not they lived or died. Some people found it to be hollow, but there are counter-arguments to make about that as well. That being said, there aren't many arguments that can save this sequel from being disliked. Pacific Rim: Uprising is the perfect example of a film that desperately relies on the spectacle and characters of its predecessor in order to impress. For all these aspects and more, here's why I think fans of the first and newcomers might as well stay away from this sequel.Pacific Rim: Uprising follows Jake Pentecost as he is thrust into the war he never thought he would join. Being the son of his fallen father who helped save the planet in the first film, that was the one connection that made this film lazy in my opinion. From the visual style to the one-dimensional characters, to the nearly non-existent chemistry between everyone, I found this film to be lackluster from start to finish. Audiences come to see these movies for the spectacle of monsters fighting robots, but when the majority of that fighting takes place in the final 30 minutes and you've bored your audience by that point, then there isn't much hope for an enjoyable experience.I'm usually the person who talks as highly as I possibly can about a movie, looking for positives where most people find negatives, but I'm finding it very difficult to defend this one. Without ruining it for those who wish to see it, there are returning characters from the first film who are completely wasted here and their character arcs are ridiculous and frankly too stupid to agree with. The entire time someone from the previous film was on-screen, I found myself wishing I was back in the theatre when the first film came out. Everyone from the new characters to the old characters was poorly executed here and I was more than disappointed by that.Yes, the final act does have some cool fight sequences, but I'm more just commending the filmmakers on a few cool action scenes rather than saying that I actually enjoyed them while watching. Yes, the effects are great, but I was bored by the time they showcased them. On top of that, the stakes are silly, due to how the Kaiju's make their return to Earth. Honestly, I found myself either wondering how much time was left or hoping for an exciting twist that would grab my attention, but none of that is present throughout this film.In the end, Pacific Rim: Uprising is everything that I didn't want from a sequel. Being the first feature film that Steven S. DeKnight has directed (having only worked on television beforehand), I went in with a little apprehension, to begin with, but his work on television or smaller films may suit him better. This movie is just about as generic as you can get. I would like to say that this film would make a good example of how visual effects look on a home television experience for a rental, but I still think the better recommendation for that would be the first film. Overall, I've seen far worse movies out there, but Pacific Rim: Uprising isn't anything worth talking about.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
73,kuarinofu,Written and directed by Kaiju,5,23 March 2018,"A sequel to a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. What was expected? Bigger robots fighting bigger monsters. The same thing with little tweaks - as most sequels do. What we got?
A product. A film generated by an AI. I wasn't there, but I assume it went something like this. The first meeting of the creators of this movie follows.
Ok, Google, what do modern kids like?
1. Robots (Transformers)
2. Scary cool monsters
3. Robots fighting monsters
4. Robots fighting robots
5. Memes from 2009 (Trololo sing) really? + memes from 2017 (the salt). 
6. Horribly executed kid rebel subplots (Divergent, The Maze Runner, The Hunger games whatever)
7. Action
8. Forced drama?
9. Bad jokes?
Ok, let's take The Independence Day Resurgence's basic plot and fail miserably at everything. Done.
In other words, there is nothing in this movie besides action scenes. The plot lives on its own, there are no characters, and even their substitutes are completely disconnected from the dead plot. Nothing they do matter, it just follows typical cliches until the end. It even gets confusing at some point, but then you see the light at the end of the tunnel. It rushes the ending knowing that by this point nobody cares.
All the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Most of the actors are just having fun knowing that there's no need to get invested into anything here. Sadly, Scott Eastwood's face is stuck in one emotion and is unable to display anything else.
CGI crews did a good job, I guess. Looks fine. There's even one creative action scene involving buildings. Other than that the action is generic, even IMAX can't make it feel better. Maybe it would've been more impressive but the overabundance of CGI city destruction in modern blockbusters seriously lowers the threshold for getting impressed by CGI.
I'd compare this to a long video game cut-scene, but modern games have more character development and creative visuals in their cut-scenes. For instance, pretty much all Blizzard cut-scenes are visual masterpieces. 
Final verdict: not entertaining on the big screen and a total waste of time for home viewing.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
74,Darkside-Reviewer,A Colossal Letdown,4,23 July 2020,"Pacific Rim (2013) was a very enjoyable movie that combined two awsome ideas Colossal sized monsters and Colossal sized robots piloted by humans. Every kid who grew up in the 80s and 90s watching TV shows like Transformers and Godzilla wanted a movie like this to be made. In 2013 Pacific Rim finally gave us a kick ass movie for adults about Colossal sized robots fighting Colossal sized monsters and with Guillermo del Toro as the director we weren't let down by the end result.Pacific Rim (2013) made a lot of money at the box office and got decent reviews so of course that means there has to be a sequel that capitalises on it's success thus Pacific Rim Uprising was released in (2018) five years after the original movie.Only a handful of the original cast members returned for this sequel and one of the main characters from the original Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) was written out of the franchise his character gets no resolution or even an acknowledgement in this sequel he simply dissappears. As for the remaining characters Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is killed off in the first thirty minutes of the movie after less than three minutes of screen time and only a few lines of dialogue. The two mad scientists from the first movie Dr Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr Newton Geisler (Charlie Day) are the only two original characters left in the movie by the thirty minute mark and they are honestly the most likable and interesting characters in the entire movie without them this movie would have been so much worse.The first movie was geared more towards adult audiences and included monsters being shot full of holes by plasma cannons, punched, decapitated, impaled and even cut in half of course the blood was blue to avoid an R rating but it was still enjoyably violent. Pacific Rim Uprising mainly features the Jaeger robots fighting each other so it's all sparks and falling metal parts. Only in the last twenty minutes of the movie is there a fight with the Kaiju monsters and while there is some blood and some okay fight scenes the violence is toned down for a more kid friendly audience making the fight more like an episode of the Power Rangers than Pacific Rim.The cast includes (John Boyega) and (Cailee Spaeny) who are basically just comedy characters with unlikeable personalitys. The supporting cast are pretty much the same teenagers who break the rules, fight and save the day at the end.This isn't a Pacific Rim movie this is just Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen only the robots are piloted by teenagers and John Boyega but with the exact same unlikeable personalitys, lame jokes and child friendly action scenes that make Rock Em Sock Em Robot toys look more badass.I don't recommend watching this movie if you enjoyed the first Pacific Rim. This movie killed the franchise so hopefully we won't have to suffer anymore bad sequels.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
75,anselmdaniel,Silly campy fun,5,8 May 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Pacific Rim: Uprising is the sequel to Pacific Rim. It follows the story of Pentecost's son, Jake, that continues the fight against the kaiju and precursors. The previous entry's characters return in the sequel with a few new characters in cadets. The story follows John Boyega as Jake Pentecost in the Kaiju return.Pacific Rim: Uprising is a movie that requires the audience to suspend their disbelief. There are many plot holes that the movie hopes the pacing will erase. If the audience thinks about certain plot points, they will realize that it does not make sense. One of the revelations in the story is Geizler becoming a kaiju emissary. He becomes this by continuously drifting with a kaiju brain at home. The movie does not explain how Geizler could have moved a kaiju brain the size of a small couch from the lab all the way home without anyone noticing. This is not the only item that does not make any sense. The physics from the first movie is disregarded here with kaiju and jaegers performing more like puppets. The story's fast pace continuously propels action into the viewer in the hopes they will not notice any faults with the story.There are some baffling moments in the movie. One of these is the playing of the trololo video when characters are preparing for battle. The movie bombards the viewer with references and action that it becomes more reminiscent of a Transformers movie.Despite the plot being poorly written, the movie has some draws. The effects and action is riveting. Every jaeger vs jaeger and jaeger vs kaiju battle was well done with dazzling special effects. The only downside is the computer generated images being too obvious on the screen. Since the battles take place in broad daylight, the kaiju and jaegers stick out like they do not belong in the cityscape. The practical effects and sound effects are well done with no glaring flaws.Overall, ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is hard to recommend. Fans of the original may dislike it for its rapid departure into the realm of Transformers. New audiences may like the movie for its quick pace and action. I would still recommend ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"".Grade: C.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

79,Antagonisten,Unworthy sequel,3,4 July 2018,"I didn't really fancy the first Pacific Rim movie that much, but it did have a certain level of artistic flair. Benicio del Toro has the ability to add that to all of his movies. It is very noticeable that he has stepped back in this case and left most of the work to others, only retaining a production credit.On the surface this movie is not that different from the original. It's still giant robots boxing with japanese-style monsters. But the narrative from the first movie, the voiceover that at least gave you the feeling of a deeper story, the philosophical tidbits... All of that is missing completely. This is something more resembling one of the crappier Transformers-sequels, ""here, this is the premise, now everybody fight and destroy things!"". There is nothing really wrong with the special effects or the action sequences, but it's just not satisfying. The effects look slightly worse than in the first movie, but overall they are fairly well made. Much of the fighting is set inside a major city, that feels very much like a model. It's not a believable city, and in general the feeling of huge robots and giant scale is somewhat missing. It's more like one of those old Godzilla-movies where a model set with cardboard houses is destroyed, eveything just topples a little too easily. This was something that I felt was very successful in the first movie, there was a real sense of epic fighting going on. It was enforced by really well-made music and sound effects. All of that is much weaker here, even though it feels big-budget it still looks a bit cheap. Making effective action scenes is not easy, and even though they spent the money, they didn't get bang for their buck.Honestly, I would probably recommend people to pass on this movie. If you liked the first one, this is most likely not going to do it for you. The lacking weight, the lacking flair and storytelling. It's basically more of the same, just that much less well-made.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Tips for parents: 
Some subtitles when people speak Mandarin. By the way, have you noticed that more and more movies have Chinese characters in them? That's because American movie studios are trying to get more of their movies into the extremely lucrative Chinese market. In fact, this movie exists mainly because the first one in the franchise did so well in China.
Some Russian profanity with subtitles.
One of the Jaeger robots flips the bird.
If your kids love the Transformers or even the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie movies, they'll like the fighting robot action of this franchise too.
Some profanity.
Tons of destruction and fighting.Uplifting theme: 
""We make our own luck."" - Hologram
Never give up.
Family and friendships
 
Things I liked:
Good special effects for the most part.
I loved the respectful nod to Idris Alba's character from the first Pacific Rim movie, as well as the funny line when Dr. Newton Gottlieb says, ""Your father was a great speech writer. Did you hear the one where he canceled the apocalypse?"" ha ha 
I always appreciate some humor.
The sound effects are really good. You can hear the weight of the heavy footsteps of the various machines and monsters.
I loved Tian Jing's outfits, especially her long, white coat towards the beginning of the movie.
I thought John Boyega did a great job and I loved his hair cut. 
If you can, see it in 3D, but sit farther back in the theater. Things I didn't like:
Some people may actually want to wear ear plugs while they watch this because it's so loud.
Super clichéd beginning where a teenage genius builds something incredible and races off with a covered face for the big reveal later. In fact, the whole movie was super predictable.
Jake Pentecost's rotten attitude was annoying and tiring.
Jake Pentecost and Amara Namani constantly bicker. It's supposed to be endearing, but it was just annoying. Several times he yells, ""Shut up!"" which is a phrase I really dislike.
If you haven't seen the first movie, you might be a little bit lost in the story; however, there is a quick recap to bring you up to speed at the very beginning of the movie.
The character development seems super contrived and cliche.
It actually becomes boring watching robots fight each other and smash everything around them over and over and over.
Yep, this movie leads into another sequel. (sigh)
I heard another movie critic explain that this movie felt way too corporate for his taste. It's true. Everything seems very calculated and researched to profit the most from cultural tastes. For example, the two main pilots are Jake and Nate. Those are the top two baby boy names in America.
Robots often fight monsters, but when the rogue Jaegers fight the good Yaegers, it looks like just another Transformersmovie.
Guillermo del Toro was going to direct this movie, but he stepped away from it in order to direct The Shape of Water, which he ended up winning an Academy Award for as Best Picture in 2017.Funny lines:

85,PyroSikTh,Still a lot of Fun despite it's Flaws,7,27 March 2018,"Pacific Rim movies are hard to review. You go to them to watch giant robots fight giant monsters, and everything else around it is superfluous. How do you judge a movie that's so vapid by nature, and seeks little else? Were there awesome fights between giant robots and giant monsters? Yes? Then it's a good movie. Recommended. Thanks for reading my review.But seriously, as much as I enjoyed the first one, I didn't feel it was quite as great as everyone made it out to be. The fight scenes between robots and monsters were great, but there was only really one or two meaty ones in the whole movie. The characters were intentionally cheesy which I guess is both a blessing and a curse, and Charlie Hunnam was simply awful. It did have fantastic CGI and attention to detail though, and the world-building was top-notch. It's a pleasant way to waste a couple of hours.Uprising, in this regard, is probably just as good/bad. We pick up ten years after the events of the first movie, with Jake Pentacost, son of Stacker, wasting his life away on the lawless Pacific coast, partying and breaking into Jaeger scrapyards for parts to sell. Eventually he falls afoul of the Pan Pacific Defence Corps and is given the choice between re-enlisting or going to jail. He's paired up with his old rival, and tasked with training a bunch of teenagers to be the next generation of pilots. It's at this point that the plot starts to divert its focus between Jake and the young cadets. While I didn't mind this so much, the cadets are all severely underdeveloped and fairly pointless, other than to put teenagers in fully fledged Jaegers for the final battle, and inspire all the pre-teens going to see it, I guess.It's been ten years since the breach was closed and the Kaiju war was over, so now the biggest threat to the PPDC are rogue Jaegers made by pretty much anyone. So as much as Pacific Rim was about giant robots vs giant monsters, Uprising is more about giant robots vs giant robots. Narratively it works really well, and the twist midway that sets up the next Kaiju invasion is an unpredictable success that adds to the world building of the first and leaves things open for a third movie really well. However pitting giant robots against each other just makes it feel a little more like Transformers or Power Rangers than a Gundam/Godzilla homage. It doesn't help that the Jaegers this time are much more agile and lack the weightiness and attention to detail of the first film. There's even a smaller Jaeger that rolls up into a ball and bursts out like a Pokemon.So lacking the real draw of robots vs monsters, how about the other draw, the CGI? Eh. In some regards it does look great, but in other regards not so much, especially when contrasted with the first film. Almost all of the action scenes in the first film take place at night time, which was a great choice because it emphasised the cityscapes, the Jaeger's lighting, and the glowing parts of the monsters giving them a truly alien appearance. Not only that but the darkness made it easier to mask the less savoury aspects of the visual effects. Uprising does not have that benefit, staging almost all of its action scenes in daylight. It lacks the attention to detail, and in some places even looks a little cheap. It certainly doesn't help with the Transformers/Power Rangers comparisons either. But don't take these criticisms too hard as, for the most part, the CGI is still really good. Five years of refining the technology has enabled it to still look as crisp and realistic as it does (despite the Jaegers doing flips and battling with agile swords like ninjas).Another criticism I have is how previous characters were dealt with. Mako Mori does feature again, which is great, but her screentime is limited, and her character is dealt a massive disservice at the start of the second act. Characters like Becket and Hannibal aren't even mentioned. Gottlieb and Geiszler are back, but Geiszler does feel a little out of character (which I must note is actually for good reason), but other than that it's a completely new cast. Scott Eastwood isn't completely terrible, but he's not particularly great either. He fills the void left by Charlie Hunnam really well, all things accounted for. John Boyega is actually really good. If anything the writing of his character is what let him down rather than his performance. Cailee Spaeny was also a bit of a surprise considering I pegged her as that annoying mary sue teenager who tags on to Jake the entire time. Tian Jing appears in another pan-Pacific movie again as well, and while she does get more to do than she did in Kong, it's pretty obvious she's setup just for the Chinese audience, becoming a bit of a convenience at the last minute and stealing the thunder from other characters that would've deserved it more (cough Mako Mori cough).I've waffled on and on about what I didn't like about Uprising. It's what I have the most to say about a movie that literally boils down to giant robots vs giant monsters (seriously, how do you spin that in a positive light with more than a few words?). But really I did enjoy myself. It delivers on it's Jaeger promise, despite being a little light on the Kaiju, and the plot it offers is probably better than the first film. All-in-all it's probably about equal on the enjoyment scale, so I give Uprising an entertaining, if unsurprisingly flawed, 7/10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

92,stevenrotherforth,Alright where's our Charlie? What have you done with him?,5,17 July 2018,"Pacific Rim : Uprising I would be lying if I told you that I didn't get any enjoyment from this movie but I can't whole heartedly recommend it to you either.
If you are considering watching this sequel to Guillermo del Torro's 2013 movie then it's probably because of the fondness you have for that first film.
This time around John Boyega leads the cast as the son of Idris Elba's character from the first movie.
Boyega is probably the films saving grace as he lights up the screen whenever he's on it.
Scott Eastwood lends support as the two try and train up a new generation of Jaeger pilots.
It's been ten years since Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba saved the day and Hunnam's character is suspiciously absent this time around.
Sadly Pacific Rim : Uprising fails to share any of the traits that made the original so endearing.
Don't get me wrong the first film was ludicrously silly but it was aware of this and it was crafted by a very talented director.
The sequel however is a series of overly polished CGI set pieces that do no real justice to size and scale. Because of this the whole movie looks unnatural. Lighting is off, there's a brightness to the picture that screams green screen!
I'm not saying the effects are bad. How can they be with a budget of $150 million?
I can't quite put my finger on it but there's something not quite right with the whole look and feel of this movie. It doesn't feel like a follow up to Del Torro's film.
Perhaps it's nostalgia playing with my mind.
It doesn't help that we get no explanation to where Raleigh Beckett (Hunnam) is or what's happened to him.
He saved the world for Pete's sake! He should at least get a shout out.
Also Rinku Kinuchi's character is under utilised. Especially when Mako Mori was such a huge part of the first story.
The disconnection from the first movie stretches to Charlie Day's character as his story arc takes a jarring turn and once again it doesn't help sustain the magic from the original movie.
I think the word franchise was on the mind of all those financing this movie. So instead of retrying to capture lightning in a bottle, what we have is much like Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom.
This is another movie that is a stepping stone to the next big money spinner.
There'll be plenty of toys and lunchboxes sold off each of these movies.With the negatives out of the way there are some positives.
The chance of seeing Boyega and Hunnam team up in part three is a welcome prospect.
I did enjoy the crash bang wallop of it all. The purchase of the Blu-ray is worth it just to give my Home Theatre system a good work out.
Despite the contrasting look from the first film, the HD transfer is very good it will make the most modest of TV sets look impressive.
That said Pacific Rim : Uprising is only just above average and a disappointing sequel to the original movie.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
93,p-jonsson,Good special effects extravaganza,8,2 August 2018,"This movie is, to me, a quite nice special effects extravaganza. In some ways I actually liked this movie more than the first one.Sure, the underlying story is totally ludicrous. Come one, fighting giant monster with big clumsy robots that requires two people in some strange mind melt to maneuver is just ridiculous. Just send in a couple of fighter jets with some suitable devices that go boom and be done with it. But then, the purpose of these movies are to show off giant robot special effects and on that note they certainly deliver.This installment in the franchise seems to be more geared towards the younger audience as far as the story and the cast goes. Some people like it, some don't. Personally I'm fairly neutral.As with the previous movie the story is not really that much to write home about. It has plot holes big enough to drive I giant robot through. I just had to say that didn't I? Still, there are some parts of this story that I liked better than the first one. It is a quite straightforward story with clear heroes, clear bad guys.It does not really have any of that lazy stupid plot twist where some dumb ass politicians are trying to shut down the program to save money. Sure the program is in some danger but this time it is due to a new program that actually sounds reasonable and could improve things. Of course said program gets sabotaged but hey, we, the audience, want our big silly robots right?The story is also mostly devoid of any stupid SJW crap or silly green preaching. The ridiculous crap about Dinosaurs being the first invasion and that we had terraformed the planet (global warming and all that stuff) so a second invasion was more likely to succeed was just an insult to the more intelligent among the audience and took off a star or two from the first movie for me.On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. It delivered where it counts, that is in the special effects department. Loads and loads of special effects mostly involving giant robots and Kaijus slugging it out with massive property damage as a result. They are literally beating each other up with skyscrapers for Christ sake!The story, acting and everything else is adequate. Nothing more and nothing less. I do miss some colorful characters like Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) from the first movie. The characters in this one was more bland that has to be said.It seems like a lot of people on IMDb and elsewhere have their pants in a twist over this movie and rates it one or two stars out of ten. That's just nonsense. A one star rating is for a movie that is truly awful in all aspects. The special effects alone elevates this movie above one star. You might not like the turn towards the younger audience or something else in the movie but it still does not make it a one star movie.Sure if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan and do not care about special effects then I guess you could feel this is an awful movie but then why did you watch it in the first place? It is the second installment in the franchise so it should come as no surprise that the movie lives and dies by it's special effects.I would say that if you like giant robots, monsters and special effects and don't mind a fairly thin story aimed for the slightly younger audience then there is a fair change that you will find this movie entertaining.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
94,Magow-Intermean,Pacific Rim Uprising Review,8,13 April 2019,"Ten years after the end of the Kaiju War, Jake Pentecost (John Boyega), son of Stacker, makes a living selling stolen tech. But an arrest lands him back in the Jaegar pilot programme under Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), with old mucker Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood) and scrappy scavenger Amara (Cailee Spaeny), just in time to meet a new threat.
Here's the thing about movies where giant robots beat up on giant monsters: they should be fun. Guillermo del Toro's 2013 Pacific Rim only sometimes delivered that, with its quasi-realistic focus on traumatised survivors teaming up to meet a monster invasion. Uprising, however, packs in more gonzo invention and giddy destruction than its progenitor and the director, Daredevil's Steven S. DeKnight, manages to twist the franchise in some surprising new directions.
John Boyega, employing every ounce of his considerable charisma, is the roguish Jake Pentecost, son of Idris Elba's heroic apocalypse-canceller Stacker. But Jake turned away from the Jaeger programme, and now skulks about scavenging tech to fund an extravagant snack-food habit. A chance encounter with a teen Jaeger builder, Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny), and her Bumblebee-like creation Scrapper lands Jake in jail - until he agrees to go back and train a new generation of recruits.
The action delivers in ways that the Transformers franchise hasn't managed in a decade.
It's all an excuse to give Jake some outsider cool in the pilot programme, because soon everyone is preoccupied by bigger issues. Tech tycoon Shao Liwen (Jing Tian) is pushing a rival drone project to replace the Jaeger pilots, with Charlie Day's Newt Geiszler now at her side. When a rogue Jaeger appears in Sydney just as Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is about to vote on the drones, it becomes apparent that kaiju are not the only threat.
There are probably allegories here about the proliferation of nuclear weapons post-World War II, as well as the current rise of robot weaponry, but this is not a film meant to provoke deep thoughts: it's a film where giant robots raze cities. The property damage is mind-boggling, and the action delivers in ways that the Transformers franchise hasn't managed in a decade.
This rushes through its character beats, especially Adria Arjona's embarrassingly underserved Jules and the identikit trainees, none of whom stick in the mind like del Toro's misfits, but then, there's a lot to do. It's not a spoiler to say that the kaiju eventually reappear (though not as you might think) and the destruction ramps up to even more devastating heights. The result is frequently ludicrous, but it is bigger and cleverer than we had any right to expect.
These Mark 6 Jaegers with their electric whips, ""gravity slings"" and plasma swords deliver all the giant robot thrills you could wish. Thanks to Boyega and Spaeny, you might even care about the human characters, too.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
95,room102,"Not awful, just ""meh""",5,22 March 2018,"It's exactly what you'd expect it to be from watching the trailer. It's more of a TRANSFORMERS movie than PACIFIC RIM. Giant robots fighting each other, quick cuts and shaky cam. Basically, John Boyega is Finn again and the girl (Cailee Spaeny) is Rey or just a general Mary Sue. Scott Eastwood unfortunately didn't inherit his dad's acting genes and he's just an average actor.Three actors from the original movie are back but they are shadows of themselves and not nearly as interesting as in the first movie.With the first revelation of the movie, the plot started to remind me a bit of the plot to ""Robocop 2"". The second revelation, which happens after the middle of the movie, was actually pretty good and I felt the movie finally starting to be interesting but it was a missed opportunity to make it something more.The result is a brainless movie. A sequel that doesn't come close to being anything like the original. It's watchable but only if you turn your brain off and want to see mindless movie about robots.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
96,Mike_Devine,Sad attempt at a cash grab,3,23 December 2018,"In a world of CGI-driven movies where huge explosions, extravagant monsters and stylized action sequences tend to dominate, 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' fits right in. The only problem is, 'Uprising' is even a worse effort than its predecessor.The real draw in this film is supposed to be the battle between the next generation of Kaiju and Jaeger pilots, chiefly John Boyega and Scott Eastwood in roles that were actually well suited for them. The other fresh face here is young rebel Amarra (Cailee Spaeny), who tries to prove her ability as a pilot despite her age. And then we have Charlie Day, who abandons his facial hair but holds onto his fingernails voice in a ""really, man?"" reprisal of Dr. Newton Geiszler. Altogether, this is definitely a motley crew of a cast, and it kind of shows.There's really not much to write home about in 'Uprising,' as it comes off feeling like a desperate attempt for a cash grab to suck every penny out of a franchise that never really existed to begin with. Sure, Guillermo del Toro takes great pride in the monsters he conceptualizes, but even those feel like an afterthought in this film. It's also impossible to really form any sense of attachment to any of the characters portrayed here, so that leaves audiences with very little to latch onto.It's not like anyone expected 'Pacific Rim: Uprising' to be a masterpiece.

100,DeBBss,We All New It Was Bad...,5,4 July 2018,"When I first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim: Uprising, I immediately knew it was going to be trash. I hoped that the director and the writers knew that this movie was going to be bad, and just make this movie a 100% jaeger vs kaiju, but of course it wasn't. I just wanted to see jaegers and kaijus fight, and we do get to see that, but there wasn't enough. The first Pacific Rim was more about the story and setting up the universe, so I was okay with all the talking and boring parts. In Pacific Rim: Uprising there was a lot of talking and explaining, which I thought was not necessary; and if there is a lot of talking, then at least have a good story to back it up. The story was average, nothing special. The way I see monster movies is that it's all about the monsters and destruction, and not so much on the story. I wanted this movie to be ridiculous, and some parts in the movie were ridiculous, but the lack of action and fun really made me disappointed.Story: 4/10The story is the exact same as the original's, but some differences. The story is very average for a monster movie, but the pacing was terrible. There was huge chunks in the movie that was just talking. When there wasn't any fighting going on, the movie just felt boring. If there was constant action and some storytelling, then I would be okay with it. The writing was awful and awkward, and it felt like a 12 year old was writing it. I liked all the different locations in this movie. There was around three different locations, Australia, Tokyo, and Antarctica. Pacific Rim: Uprising has a lot of creative ideas. There was a fight scene, jaeger vs jaeger, I thought that it was another pilot controlling the enemy jaeger, but it was a kaiju brain. Unfortunately, the movie didn't go into much detain about that kaiju brain. This movie focuses a lot on the boring things and not so much on the interesting things, like the kaiju brain controlling a jaeger. Overall, this movie doesn't focus on the fun parts, but mostly on the unnecessary parts, and the pacing is really boring.Characters: 2/10The characters are by far the worst part about this movie. The only decent character is John Boyega's character. Scott Eastwood did an okay job being the uptight captain. The biggest issue I have is the teenagers. There was a lot of unnecessary things in Pacific Rim: Uprising, but the teenagers take the cake. I really don't know why the writers added in the teenagers; the teenagers were just boring, and stereotypical. The idea that there was no one left to pilot the jeagers, and that the teenagers have to step up and pilot is just stupid. So, you're telling me that there is no one left to pilot the jaegers in a military facility; where did all the professionals go? One character that was just pointless was that girl that showed up for a minute talking to Boyega and Eastwood, and she's apparently a love interest. If you're going to have a love interest, then don't make the girl show up for just one minute, and leave and never show up agian. Overall, all of the teenagers are one dimensional and stereotypical. Boyega and Eastwood are the only decent characters. And the love interest was just weird.Action: 7/10The action offers a few things new to the table, like the jaeger vs jaeger and the giant kaiju made of three different kaijus. I liked the idea of three kaijus combing together to make one massive one; that was a proper boss battle. There were three locations, my favorite was the one in Antarctica. The Antarctica fight was creative, I just wish the fight was longer. Most of the fight scenes were in broad daylight, but I prefer it in the dark, like in the first movie. The CGI was good, and there wasn't one scene where the CGI looked bad, so that was a good thing. The biggest issue I have is that there was only one kaiju fight (The boss fight). For a monster movie, there wasn't enough kaiju fights. Overall, the action was okay. There wasn't enough fights, but when there was action, it was great.Overall, Pacific Rim: Uprising was an average movie. Pacific Rim: Uprising didn't have enough action, which made it boring. The story was just bland and it didn't offer anything new. The characters were done poorly, with each character having terrible dialog. I don't really recommend spending money on this movie, as it's just going to bore you to death.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It's brutal to watch them on screen, they don't fit in with their immense lack of talent and awful plastic surgery marionette faces. Take them out and it would be a much better film.

I wasn't going into some intellectual film made to made you think. I was going into a cheesy popcorn flick, with action. And that's what I got. My expectations were met. I got exactly the kind of film I was hoping for. Was the first one better? Yes. Do I still like this one? Yes. It's a live action Saturday morning cartoon. Nothing more. If the first one was ""Transformers"" mixed with ""Godzilaa"", this is more of that, but with ""Power Rangers"" thrown in there as well. Without spoiling anything, I will say I wish the last scene had been left out, or put on the Bluray as an alternate ending, because if the studio decides they don't want to make a 3rd one, that last scene was pointless and I will be disappointed. John Boyega was one of the best parts of this movie. His character is well written and you understand why he does what he does. He was actually the most interesting character in the movie. John Boyega has come a long way since ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and that was only 3 years ago. (He was also producer on this film as well. Good for him!) If you enjoyed the first one, you'll get pretty much of the same. Nothing more. Nothing less. It is on par with the first one. Neither better nor worse.

The speed of the movie is off it starts ok then slows down for a long period then speeds up again. For a movie like this it needed to be shorter.But the graphics were good and the battle scenes (what few there were) were what I was expecting. Not as good as the first but not so terrible it's unwatchable. I would say go in with lowered expectations and you might actually like this one.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

113,austin0731,"A complete mess, with very few redeeming factors",3,24 March 2018,"A complete mess, with very few redeeming factors. I don't even know where to begin with the sequel to Del Toro's Pacific Rim, while I don't usually like to just bash a film like this, quite frankly I don't see anything much to praise at all. The first Pacific Rim did a great job with establishing character and heart, while the story is filled with plot holes, ridiculous premises and just an over the top vision of Kaijus fighting Jaegers. But, Del Toro made it work, with his passion, attention to detail and amazing action Pacific Rim actually managed to capture the audience's hearts, not to mention the killer score. Yet, this time round it was a complete mess and a real shame too. Characters that were established in the first film completely wiped away or underutilized to cheap cop out characters that just pop up like it's some kind of soap opera just makes everything laughable. With an abundance of characters who get little screen time and not enough time to establish themselves to a bunch of annoying teenagers that get way too much time, Uprising really just had the worse character work I have ever seen. Even the action could not redeem the film, something that seemed so simple yet completely missing. Something that even Michael Bay doesn't fail to do in his Transformers franchise yet somehow, Uprising makes Kaiju and Jaeger fights boring, unoriginal and laughable. The lack of regards that the jaegers had towards minimizing collateral damage to the cities just give us an idea of how little we should care to the choreography and battles. With Kaijus that are so insignificant they don't even give that sense of destruction and horror that a gigantic monster terrorizing a city should. How bad could they have been to accomplish this is just bizarre. And now to my largest complaint, the complete misuse of the amazing Pacific Rim theme. I sat in that theater patiently waiting for that climactic battle when they would finally bust that beat.They didn't do it in any of the earlier fights, and I thought, fine. Then for some reason during some weird construction montage they played it, and I thought well, it doesn't hurt to have more of it. But then came the final climactic battle and no theme, no theme? What on Earth were they thinking? A true mess, doing absolutely everything wrong, it wasn't even just boring but rather hatable.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
114,TheVictoriousV,Where is my goddamned Chau?,4,13 March 2019,"Never has the departure of a great director been so obvious. Gone are the vibrant neon lights, rainy Asian cityscapes, genuinely imposing machines, and cubist characteristics of Guillermo del Toro's ""robots vs. kaiju"" extravaganza Pacific Rim. Its sequel, Pacific Rim: Uprising, looks like any other sci-fi action film while barely functioning as a film in general, only fulfilling the criteria of having noises and images.I can only think of one improvement: the weakest aspect of the first film was no doubt Charlie Hunnam, who ends up quite dull in most of the things I see him in, no matter who stands behind the camera. This time around, our hero is John Boyega, which doesn't help as much as it should.Returing favorites include Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori, once a pilot of the Jaegers (the colossi used by mankind to fight monsters, piloted by two persons linked mentally via ""drifting"" technology) and Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as the two scientists who so rarely got along. Note also a severe lack of Hannibal Chau, or the now deceased Stacker Pentecost, the son of whom Boyega plays. Scott Eastwood plays Boyega's former Jaeger co-pilot, who reveals to him that times are changing in the world of kaiju-battling machines. Cailee Spaeny, Jing Tian, Adria Arjona, and other diverse faces also appear.The plot involves an impending drone protocol that's sure to make the Jaegers obsolete, as well as a character from the last film being transformed into a villain with a generic evil plan, and a connection with those responsible for the kaiju.None of this is especially memorable and I had to enlist the help of Wikipedia's needlessly detailed plot summaries to correctly recall certain deets. The music needs more Djawadi. The visuals more Del Toro. The characters have few notes to offer whenever they aren't providing callbacks to the previous film. Should I praise the fact that the cast is at least diverse, even though the decision seems based on the fact that movies like this do well in China (normally not a nice place to try out black representation)?The first movie also provided Asian imagery and performers (not necessarily just Chinese), although it seemed more to do with the love letter Del Toro was writing to kaiju cinema. I read somewhere that the original Pacific Rim was when Hollywood first realized just how lucrative and useful ""pandering to the Chinese market"" is, especially when the movie does poorly domestically. This could be wrong; I wouldn't be shocked if it wasn't.Pacific Rim Uprising is certainly not essential viewing. Action-packed images, plots, and so-called ""characters"" like these can be found just about anywhere else. However, if teenagers or any of their equals desire something that's visually similar to Transformers but takes their intellects more seriously and is less absurdly offensive, this works fine. Not that they care.For the record, I don't quite admire the first Pacific Rim as much as I did during my initial viewing (as Del Toro films go, I prefer The Shape of Water although my initial ratings may fool you), mainly as it needed to be cheesier. Compared to this, though, it still looks like quite a masterpiece. Thanks for that, Uprising.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

116,carlos37andre,Better than I expected,6,19 July 2019,"I was genuinely surprised by the fact that the first hour of this movie is actually pretty good. I like the main characters enough, it had some pretty cool first fight scenes, the plot kind of made sense, it was pretty much a solid 7 or even a 7,5. But after the first main attack I thought it sort of fell of the hill a little bit, it seems that they went more for the silly jokes in the last half, the big fight scene is cool, but you feel like there isn't much to it. And of course, some things don't make sense at all (like the fact that the robot's broken face would instantly kill them, when they drop basically from space).I also can't complain enough about these franchises that try to set up more movies, without first taking care of the movie they are actually producing first, and that's what the last scene of this movie is. Will I watch if they do a third one in the Kaiju world? Probably. I just can't help but get sick from it.But overall, besides the not memorable score, and forgetting the fact that this movie isn't even close from how good the first one was (and also doesn't have 10% of it's personality), I think the cast is really good, and it has enough monsters fighting robots to make you entertain for almost 2h.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
117,kevinxirau,Kaiju and Mecha clash once again.,6,29 March 2018,"In 2013, Guillermo del Toro made ""Pacific Rim"", a passion project that not only brought something refreshing to the big screen, but revitalized giant monsters/kaiju to mainstream media. Now, Steven S. DeKnight continues the saga with ""Pacific Rim Uprising"". Plot: Ten years after the war, Jaegers became the new global defense organization and Jake Pentacost (Jon Boyega of Star Wars fame), son of Stacker (Idris Elba), is recruited to train the next generation of pilots. A rude awakening comes when an unknown human force comes with a plan to bring back the monstrous Kaiju and our new heroes must rise to the challenge.This is a fitting continuation of the world established by del Toro with a few new things to offer. The story is decent enough and has a couple of plot twists I didn't see coming.The action is faster paced this time thanks to improved technology and each Jaeger and Kaiju has new tricks up their giant sleeves. I'm especially fond of the mini Jaeger Scrapper. A few original characters return with the actors reprising their roles, though Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) has little screen time. Boyega, Eastwood, and Spaeny are strong enough to carry the story with their own charm, though the rest of the new cast are unmemorable. The humor falls flat most of the time and the themes don't hold as much weight as those in the first film. I guess since del Toro is not in the directing chair (instead, he's the producer), it lacks his unique filmmaking touch.All in all, ""Uprising"" is a fun romp with substantial spectacle, a fair cast, and nice updates, but it lacks the nuances of its predecessor and has not only a couple inconsistencies but things that require more suspension of disbelief than before. A third film is planned, so hopefully improvements can be made. There's also talk of a possible crossover with the MonsterVerse (starring Godzilla+Kong), which I would love to see. If you're a fan of Japanese pop culture or just want to pass the time, then this can do it for you.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The first Pacific Rim was a whole lot of awesome giant robot badass fun. Unfortunately this movie did not live up to my expectations.On a positive note the animation was outstanding.
Similar to the first one this movie is all around pure eyecandy. The fight scenes were also well done and fun to watch, but not quite up to the first movie's standard.Story-wise this movie is nonsensical. There is barely any actual plot or character development. The big surprise twist fell flat and was highly predictable. The comedy was also lacking compared to the first.This movie also had a noticeable drop in originality compared to part one. While the premise is not exactly new, Pacific Rim was as close to a live action giant robot anime as we are going to get. Unfortunately Pacific Rim 2 feels like a combination of bad anime plot points. The movie is also predictable and very cliche. This goes along with the characters who feel more like walking stereotypes of sci-fi and action tropes.On top of all that while the fight scenes were entertaining there is a noticeable drop-off in quality. There were just too many bland moments in the movie.Overall the movie is a Mindless popcorn entertainment film, but I just wish it was more. A 5.5 out of 10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

So I had red most of the complaints about this was bad effects and being ran by a bunch of children. Well that's in part right, but in the context of the movie it makes sense. I actually liked the way this movie stated off and up until 2/3 of it thought it was decent (granted not wonderful). However the end battle was very week, as if they ran out of money and had to just shoot something. I mean you don't even see the ending move that supposedly finishes things...
I loved the first movie and thought it was great, original and all that stuff. The 2nd was obviously not good. From reviews I read I still figured what the hell and watched it and through the first half of the movie hoped and figured maybe it was too harsh a judgement, but the end pretty much killed it, at least for me. I was certainly hoping for more.
I hope they don't make a part 3, or if they do they seriously rethink things. The other reviews I read were right about one main point about it being a bunch of kids, and in the movies you can't kill off kids, which then simplifies and more or less ""G"" raids everything as you just can't kill off kids right? So I hope they either don't make a part 3 or if they do they think it through",Pacific Rim - Uprising

132,Endless_01,What a big joke.,4,4 June 2019,"The aftermath of Pacific Rim continues with the formation of new Jaegers for the defense of the planet against a new internal threat. In itself, a very predictable and typical argument, at least we hope that the action scenes or the fights against the kaijus will be trained and unique, but no, we don't have that either.Following the bad tradition of ruining a saga in the sequel, Uprising is a bad joke for the fans of the original movie. Pacific Rim stood out for its fantastic effects and intense, well-coordinated combat scenes, with a physical realism never seen before in movies of giant monsters fighting. Del Toro did an excellent job with the original, however I think he cries secretly after having discovered how the sequel to his work ended.The action is quite mediocre, without the same realism in the physics that we had before, with some quite dry choreographies and without intense action, the story itself is... bad, it simply sounds like something that anyone with no experience in cinema can do to try to create any sequel, it doesn't sound like something done with passion or respect for the director's original work. Even so, despite all those negative things, one is still missing, which is the tip of the cake. The protagonists, the characters; they are so annoying and cliché that we simply can't feel sympathy at any time for this, leaving the side that there is zero progress in their development in a reasonable way. They don't even have enough time on screen for us to worry about them, they are all irritating teenagers that in the end the only thing they managed to provoke in me is that I support the Kaijus more.

Without watching the first movie, audience could still understand the main story that there are still monsters coming from underwater to attack the world and the heroes are the pilots inside mega robot head. On this second movie, we could also see the newcomers, John Boyega and Cailee Spaeny whose characters developed each other, from strangers, friends, professionals, and then family. I am happy that the Director and all of the crew could consistently make the intense relation between the screen and the audience, so that the audience can feel also the drama and pain inside robotic pilot's mind that makes us never leave our seat from the beginning to the end of the story. I have no idea exactly how budget for this movie, but because this movie is screening mega robot and big monster with special effect and high qualified cinematography, it might cost really expensive, but money does heal audience's heart of watching other boring movies and we can enjoy this Pacific Rim: Uprising.

The world has begun rebuilding from the devastation caused by the conflict and for the most part humanity has moved on. However for Jake Pentecost (John Boyega), he exists as a hustler in a yet to be recovered zone that was heavily damaged by the conflict. Jake lives for the hustle, finding and trading one item of value for another from cookies and cereal to parts from down Jaegers.Looting and operating parts from the former combat giants is very illegal but with the massive payout from their parts, the lure is too great for Jake to ignore. This pursuit leads him into trouble and reluctantly paired with young scrapper Amari Namani (Cailee Spaeny). Jake gets a choice of prison or returning to train Jaeger pilots as he is the son of the late hero Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), and naturally has many unresolved issues of sharing the name of the beloved hero.
Figuring training a class beats jail, Jake agrees to teach Amara and a new class of Jaeger pilots with his former rival Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood), and to say they still have issues with one another would be an understatement.
Despite this, training moves along as planned and Nate and Jake even work well enough to pilot a Jaeger at a ceremony that will usher in a new but controversial new age in protection for humanity.When an unexpected threat arrives and causes mass devastation and chaos, Jake and Nate must get to the bottom of the threat. As their investigation moves along a massive threat is discovered which pits them and their untested recruits against a threat old and new which threatens to end humanity.
What follows is a FX laden finale where cities are laid waste to and massive combatants engage is a truly impressive visual spectacleWhile ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" does use a familiar plot threads, it does so in an engaging way. The film does have a very basic plot and does not delve too much into character development and leaves some of the threads it opened unresolved. What it does have is a good amount of action after a slower than expected buildup. The action is visually appealing and exciting and delivers a much better experience than the last few ""Transformer"" films did. The cast works well with one another and it was nice to see Charlie Day and others from the first film return as Day always makes his scenes engaging.
While you may have a sense of seeing much of this before in giant monster and robot films, it is done in an appealing way. There is much of the film that you can see was clearly included to make sure the film appeals to audiences in China and Japan but in the new global film market, it is vital for films to do well in those markets, and with a film based in the Asian Pacific Rim, it only makes sense to do this. Eastwood and Boyega work well with one another and the finale opens the door wide open for a third film that looks like it would extend the franchise by taking things in a new and exciting direction.

Pentecost Jr would rather live the life of a cash hustler over the glory and excitement of being a Jagger pilot and if the world should ever be in danger again: all the glory that goes along with saving the world like his father. As he repeats throughout the film however Jake ""Is not his father!!""As the film advances though Jake is put in a situation where he has no choice, but to be thrust into the life he despises and has been running away from since his father saved the world: Training Jagger pilot cadets! Soon after starting orientation of 7 brave young trainee's who respect and admire Pentecost danger emerges and quickly skyrockets to the level where the fate of the world once again is in the hands of a Pentecost!!The acting isn't quite as good in this sequel to Pacific Rim, but I think the action scenes flow so much better. I know some of the reviews aren't very kind to this movie, but to me despite the cliche' moments it really flies by and seemed like a fun thrill ride to me. All the catchy phrases they use like ""Drifting"" together and being ""Drift compatible"" with one another to share the load inside of the Jagger so as not to overload a single brain was pretty awe inspiring to me. The soundtrack maximizes the glory moments and really draws in my attention along with the sound effects, and visual effects in general.Just to reiterate about the acting: It's pretty good yet they still seemed to find an absolutely horrendous Asian actor that is so unpolished as an actor that she wrecks the flow of every seen she's in. Her name was Tian Jing and I just don't understand how there isn't another actor they could have used that could have been more authentic as the CEO of a multi-billion dollar Mech-warrior/Jagger manufacturing company.

138,thisseatofmars,"Honestly, I'm just just glad we got a sequel.",6,4 April 2018,"Pacific Rim is one of my favourite movies of all time: it is a work of genius and love. I'd place it in the top two or three slots of ""best movies"" in my life. It is a rare, rare thing indeed when I leave a movie theatre feeling grateful; the original Pacific Rim took me right back to childhood and made me feel a wonder I hadn't felt in years. I love Pacific Rim for the same reason I love giants: giant monsters, giant robots, what have you. Maybe it's the same love and wonder as the kind that inspired the like of countless folk tales, the Titanomachy, Goya's El Coloso, Godzilla, Gulliver's Travels... and what a joy to see the giants contend with one another. Pacific Rim Uprising is not as good as the original, and I'm going to outline why in this review: but, before I do so, I want to say that the movie gets a lot right. I was both surprised and delighted in parts of Pacific Rim Uprising, and I'm happy to say so, because I don't like to run any movie down, or to pick anything apart. You'll see a list of names a mile long constituting the credits at the end of any movie, and blockbusters like these usually takes years to make. Who am I to denigrate something that so much effort went into? A movie really is bigger than I am. However, I love the original, and I need to dissect the sequel's lesser parts. There is effort in Uprising, and the effort pays off in parts: but like Jake Pentecost (protagonist and son of the hero from the first film) and Scott Eastwood's character (son of one of the greatest actors in history) Pacific Rim Uprising is in the shadow of its ""precursor."" I'll start with the good:
-Pacific Rim Uprising has wonderful action and great set pieces. Seeing the different locations was fantastic, like the the frozen north and exploring more urban environments. The fighting spirit from the original lives on: wonderful fun and joy in titans smashing up a city. 
-The fights are (usually) very well depicted. A fight scene is like a story in itself: you have the set up, escalation, climax, then boom, resolution. Spectacle like this is why we go to the movies.
-Some genuine surprises: I did not expect to see a kaiju brain in the giant robot, for example, and I did not see Newt's plot twist coming.Now, the bad. First and foremost, one of the teenage jaeger pilots, on the way to fight for the end of the world, uses the jaeger's screen to show the ""Mr. Trololo"" singing video. Yes, really. I'm not joking. They played the ""Russian Rickroll"" for us. Wow. This... ripped me from the moment and the immersion of the movie. I guess the filmmakers were trying to cater to the youtube audience, figuring that much of the audience of this movie are, what, teen, basement-dwelling trolls? I can't begin to count the many reasons how awful playing this meme for us was. Pacific Rim is meant to exist in its own world. The original crafted its own universe: it introduced us to such terms as kaiju blue, the drift, the neural handshake, the Precursors: brilliant world building and writing. Playing this meme feels even cheaper than product placement, and that's something. It's not even a joke, it's a reference: the same criticism of Family Guy. Family Guy doesn't tell as many jokes as it does make references. It's a cheap grab for laughs, mentioning or showing something that you have laughed at or enjoyed in the past to get a laugh now. Also, showing Mr. Trololo was just inconsistent with the logic of the movie. Most jaegers need a co-pilot where they mentally ""drift,"" sharing one another's thoughts. In the movie, when the kid springs the singer vid meme, it's a surprise to the co-pilot: but wouldn't he actually know, if they're inside one another's heads? And also, these kids are piloting gigantic robots as big as skyscrapers. The cost of one of these jaegers would be what, billions? And these robots are used to fight the apocalypse: literally, *fight* the apocalypse. Can *you* imagine a WWII fighter pilot surprising the other soldiers by playing Internet memes on the way to, what could be, doom for the human race? This meme really did spoil part of the movie for me and its inclusion was on my mind as I was walking out of the cinema. When I saw the original, I felt gratitude when leaving the cinema, for that aforementioned wonder. Del Toro never pulled crap like showing a meme or reference in the original; it wouldn't have even entered his head. Why? Because del Toro doesn't pander to or patronize his audience. He has class. Pacific Rim is a movie about giant monsters and robots, but he never thought the subject was beneath him. That's why people are happy to celebrate and give him awards. Also in poor taste was a scene where one of the pilots uses his jaeger to flip off one of the jaegers. Yes, really. I don't know why the filmmakers thought to patronize us further and make these scenes so goofy. From here, I'll list the rest of my negatives in point format.-The music from the original is almost nonpresent. The soundtrack from the original is part of what gave Pacific Rim its soul, and it was ultra cool to boot. Really, go to youtube and listen to the Pacific Rim Main Theme now. It makes you want to jump up on tables or go for a run. (Seriously, it's part of my jogging playlist.) The trailers had a remix of the main theme with 2Pac, which adds nothing, and isn't even featured in the main film. -The robots usually look great, but they move much, much too quickly. In the original, the jaegers moved slowly. This helped build in us the idea of the terrific scope and gravity of these giants. -Nearly all the players from the original are blown up. Becket, the protagonist from the original, is mentioned, but his disappearance is not explained. (If it is, I didn't hear it, and I was paying attention, so it wasn't explained well.)-The actors aren't ""punished"" like before. Guillermo del Toro was happy in building a ""torture device,"" referring to the jaeger pilot cockpits. In the original, you could see the actors straining to lift their legs to move the robots; here the actors are (very) obviously running on treadmills. You could make the case that the technology has developed since the events of the original film, but seeing the strain on the actors adds to the drama of piloting the mechs. -The giant robots of Uprising do not have the same presence, personality, or character as the jaegers of the original film. Crimson Typhoon, a robot in the original, had a head inspired by HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Cherno Alpha, who is named for a pagan Russian god, was shaped like a nuclear reactor, and I still smile thinking of Cherno rampaging into battle against Otachi like a wild bull. It's such a shame Typhoon and Alpha don't return, as their bodies are still laying at the bottom of the ocean. In Uprising, 90% of the screen time is given to Gypsy Avenger, which is ""Gypsy Mk II."" Its body is just the same as gypsy but with a more standard, robot head. Really, Gypsy Danger's bullet-swivel head in the original has much more charm than a homogenized design. 
 
-This lack of personality is the same with the kaiju, the little screen time that they get. The monsters showing up for Uprising's climax do not have the same character as the monster from the original film. The three of these kaiju are all grey with glowing blue eyes: yeah. There is zero of the personality or presence in these monsters as Leatherback, the skull-faced King Kong, Knifehead, the goblin shark abomination, or Otachi, the creature literally filled with surprises. The only real surprise offered to us is that these three monsters fuse into a single giant, a surprise spoiled by the movie's trailer. This ""mega kaiju"" is impressive, but has a disappointing end...-The final confrontation is an anticlimax. In a scene very (perhaps even too) similar to when Gypsy Danger slays Otachi high up in Earth's atmosphere, Gypsy Avenger simply flies into the sky and then crash lands into the kaiju, killing it. No final fight. Imagine if Luke Skywalker just jumped from a catwalk and landed on Darth Vader or the Emperor and ended the fight that way? Pretty lame, eh? That's what you call an anticlimax. 
 
-The jaegers and kaiju are mostly present in the day. While daylight helps us see more detail, the night and constant rain environments of the original helped added to the drama and mystique of the giants. -The cast. Annoying kids, and John Boyega speaks in a thick slang rife with incorrect grammar (he does a spot-on impression of Scott Eastwood's character in the movie and shows that, yes, he knows that it's ""you weren't"" instead of ""you wasn't."") I haven't seen Scott Eastwood in a movie before and I never realized how incredibly similar he is to his father, right down to the cowboy tough guy voice and squinty eyes. The female lead exists only to tease these two dudes; there's some weird love triangle that is never explained and goes nowhere. The young cast isn't exactly stellar, either, and all feel tokenly diverse. -Weirdly, many more bystanders are killed in the rampages of Uprising as opposed to the battles of the original, where we knew people were held up and protected in anti-kaiju bunkers. Having so many bystanders killed onscreen takes away from the fantastic that fueled the soul of the original; these killings are a poor attempt to add grit to where there should be none. The original showed no bystanders getting killed, so the cities the giants fought in were like great sandboxes for these creatures to wrestle in.So, there you have it. I could go on: the scene where Gottlieb and Newt beat up the very large, armed security team is contrived (two tiny scientists, one of which has a cane,) and Newt's ""demon voice"" is lame, for example, but really: I'm just happy that we have a sequel. There is literally nothing else I want to see in cinemas, and I haven't been to the movies in months. Come back, del Toro!",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The storyline was weak, and the characters even weaker, although they were developed, and were not as memorable as they were in the first film, and the film itself just didn't make sense when compared to the original. Disappointing and almost as bad as Transformers 2-6.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
142,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Very enjoyable. Surprisingly well written. Del Toro's visual mastery is missed.,7,30 March 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising is a very good looking robot versus monster movie that is worth seeing on the biggest screen possible as it has massive scale...but it lacks the visual style and orchestration that Guillermo Del Toro brought to the original. What somewhat makes up for this is a cast of characters that actually bring something to the table in this picture, in contrast to the last film which short of Idris Elba's rousing speech, was lacking in that department. John Boyega, channeling his star making turn in Attack the Block, is terrific, and the rest of the cast is solid. The movie had a nice amount of dry humor and wittiness to it as-well.But where the writers really shined in PR:U, is in the story, which manages to re-introduce the kaiju in a way that was consistent with the universe and wholly unexpected. I also really liked how the movie handled the bad-guys, as it didn't really let us know who the baddie was until late in the movie. It kept me on my toes, and I liked that. I also liked that, in keeping with the first film, this movie felt like a story that encapsulated the world, as the main players weren't just all Americans and brits. It's a very inclusive film universe, and never in an artificial way.What kept me from liking the movie more, was the unremarkable action choreography. Yes, the movie didn't look as good as the first, on balance, but it still looked damn good. But none of the action scenes really wowed me, and in a movie about humongous robots fighting ginormous monsters, that's pretty important. If you have access and money and time to spare, I would highly recommend seeing this in IMAX, on the biggest screen possible. The smaller the screen, in my opinion, the less enjoyable the viewing experience will be.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
143,neener3707,"Spectacular Visuals, Disappointing Story, I Still Enjoyed It",5,23 March 2018,"I enjoyed it because I didn't go in expecting thought provoking cinema like 8 1/2 or 2001: A Space Odyssey. I knew this simply would be a meditation in spectacular action sequences, and in that aspect I enjoyed it. The beginning is slow and I found myself waiting for the cliched (will discuss in second paragraph) story to be over so I could enjoy the amazing action battles. And the massive action scenes were very enjoyable, entire cities destroyed, bad ass robots fighting giant alien creatures while smashing into skyscrapers. I enjoyed all of that thoroughly and the last half of the film was chock full of visually pleasing action. But nearly everything other than that was either average, sup-par, or cliched.So for the story, many aspects half been done before and now have become cliches. Son of the greatest fighter also shows much potential but gets kicked out for being a maverick, only to return wen the agency needs a maverick, and will he live up to his fathers ultimate service. I've seen this over and over again and felt no interest in the framing story. The acting was a combination of averagely good acting combined with some not so good acting. For the most part acting was average with a couple good performances and a couple of pretty bad performances. I also found some of the plot lines/points to be unnecessary but I won't reveal them because they are spoilers. All in all, if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Like the original, you have to suspend disbelief to get through the inane moments where decisions are made for the sake of action instead of effectiveness. Like- No one every thought to launch drones or missiles?Fight scenes got my blood boiling. Satisfying and well orchestrated is all we can ask for with a popcorn flick.

150,hiraishinnojutsu,Cool action scenes with poor execution on character developments and rushed story-telling,7,22 March 2018,"I got to admit, at first, I'm a little bit sceptical about this movie. I mean, the first movie is great, I love it very much, but why should there even be a sequel? the Kaijus are all gone, no other evil monsters in sight whatsoever, but they still have the Jaegers around? even improved? For what exactly? Did they predict the aliens that create and send the Kaijus into our world would somehow find a way to enter the realm of humanity once more even after 'The Breach' (or portal) was closed forever and ever? okay I need to stop there before spoiling the plot even further, but the point is, how would they (the filmmakers) deliver the story into a perfect continuation of the first movie without screwing it all up? Well, as it turns out, they couldn't.First of all, the story or plot got pretty messy by being got too rushed right from the intro to the end credits. Some of the elements are also pretty much doesn't make any sense, I mean, a lonely fifteen-year old street girl with no one around to nurture or protect or educate her on how to survive without any house or family built her own small Jaeger from scraps of the unused parts of old Jaegers alone? ALONE?? REALLY?? Hey, I now it's only a movie, but at least don't make it too stupid for everyone too accept please...The bad parts just don't stop there, the human dynamics between the characters were also got a little bit too forced to hold the already rushed plot up until the end. Like when the fifteen-year old girl (her name is Amara by the way) bullied the short-haired Russian girl into submission by means of martial arts (which Amara claimed had learned from her life on the street, which seems really preposterous), then in the next moment, when they got separated after some accidents that Amara caused, the russian girl got suddenly nice to her without any kind of hint where both of them shake hands as a sign of peace or whatsoever before.Well of course I can spent hours upon hours ranting about the bad part about the movie, but, where's the justice in that? I think it's to give the movie some credits where it's due. The action scenes at the end, GOD I love it. The cooperation between the four new Jaegers (one of it is actually from the first movie, but, since it got improved and with a new name, I consider it as a new Jaeger), their weapons, their capabilities (before being crushed into piles of junk by the larger monster like the fate of all Jegers no matter how much you improve it) take you to the moment in your childhood with those memories of your favorites giant robots like Gundam, Evangelion, Voltron, Mazinger, etc.The jokes are on points too, they felt Marvelish (like the jokes in almost the entire action high-budgeted movies these days) and everyone literally had a good time laughing inside the studio where they watch. Before I finished, I just wanna tell you guys, the movie has no mid-credit scene (but I don't know about the post-credit one since I got out early because I wasn't expecting any of it from a non-Marvel or non-comicbook movies), but, it has a final scene before the end credits (which serves as a replacement for mid/post-credit scenes) that would tell you that the pacific rim-verse won't end in 'Uprising'. it will continue through it's own universe/franchise as long as it still profitable for the studios and the filmmakers (as long as people still wanting to spend their money and time with their friends, families, or just themselves watching it on the theaters). We'll see what the continuation of the Pacific Rim-verse will bring us into, for better or worse.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

152,Wirxaw,Pathetic Rim.,4,27 April 2018,"To say that this movie is wrong is to understate it. If I could begin with one positive thing to say about it - it's that the giant robot fights can give Transformers a run for their money. Alas, this is as far as it goes.Pathetic Rim swipes old characters under the rug, adds the black stormtrooper.... excuse me, getting a deja vu here..., introduces the characters ""way"" out of proportion(on the Marvel\Transformer level of stupidity, despite this being a damn Del Toro franchise), and barely tries to stay coherent throughout the runtime.Instead of trying to do what honest sequels ""must"" do - reconnect with the story and make the viewer feel like they are watching Part Two, Pathetic Rim throws a few expositions, introduces us to an irrelevant situation that has Last Knight written all over it, shows a few scenes that are supposed to be reminiscent of what we've seen in the original. Oh, and, of course, once you see characters randomly reciting the events of the previous movie... you know that the writer has the experience of a first-grader. Not once, not twice, multiple characters will blatantly try to make this movie look like a sequel by laying out that major events of the original.What is the movie about? Well, let's see... Last time I checked, the Jaeger Program was scrapped. Frankly, for a good reason. And that's before the victory. A few years after - we see numerous Jaegers around the world. Why? As a deterrent? Or to use the resources to build toys instead of rebuilding the damages? Of course, in light of all the Jaegers, there ""have"" to be places with ""decommissioned"" Jaegers, just waiting for brave looters to dig in. That's not just Last Knight, this is A Force Awakens rip-off if I ever saw one. But why rip off trash?Somewhere in that mess of the girl from Last Knight and the ridiculous situation of AFA, we get our black stormtrooper, who is apparently an ""already"" prodigal son of late Marshall Pentacost - adhering to the nature's call of his race. Seriously. Don't you dare get offended. I am not a director, who put a black protagonist in a position, where he enjoys gangster stuff, looting and thug life. Just pointing it out.After the aforementioned irrelevant situation - the two protagonists find themselves among the ""new generation"". Somehow - the whole deal is overseen by China. I understand that they are powerful, but does Europe count for nothing in this world anymore? God forbid they mention Russia, obviously, but, besides the base being located in China, which I could understand, because it's a ""Pan Pacific"" Defense Force, we also meet a large... that's right... Chinese corporation. And that's not even Last Knight, that's Age of Extinction. I get it, Chinese silicon infrastructure is world-leading, and USA is trying to appeal to them... well, tried to, before Trump... but besides that - they aren't that far ahead. Not in military. Not in machinery. Not in science. Any kind of precision german engineering, at least some Tesla ripoff - fine. But another movie with a large Chinese company building drones? No, thanks.For a little bit, we are supposed to believe that this corporation is bad, because this is how it goes. Until a rogue Jaeger shows up and tears Gypsy a new one. After that - it's only questions. What was in that Siberian base? Plan B? Why was there only one rogue Jaeger? Why did the antagonist have to be where the plot needed him to be? Why were the Jaegers made out of butter back on the base? Why is the girl suddenly drift-compatible? Why was there the female object for our two protagonists? Why was the head lady suddenly a pilot? And, of course, why was the movie resolved like a deadline? No, not even cliffhanger - deadline. A cliffhanger promises something, this isn't even a promise.It's not a waste of time, however, it can play ball with Transformers just fine. But it's not Pacific Rim. Del Toro showed us what the genre could do. What Godzilla, Transformers and even others ""should"" do. In the original, we saw Gypsy Danger smack the kaiju with a freighter, a god damn freighter. That scene alone gave the movie an extra pair. What can Pathetic Rim show us? A plasma cannon that kind of crushes down one skyscapper after another on a kaiju. Even Man of Steel would cringe, and that's saying something.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It's not like the original was a brilliant and subtle arthouse movie about the depths of the human condition. It was a very average popcorn flick cobbled together from table scraps of much better sci fi universes with non of the moral issues, religious themes and philosophic concepts that made them interesting. Without the inexplicable clout of director del Toro's name I highly doubt it would have received the universal acclaim it got. Beyond some fun world building it was nothing more than a bad episode of Power Rangers. Too serious to work as a comedy, too silly to work as dramatic sci-fi. Pacific Rim Uprising on the other hand is like a good episode of Power Rangers.
It shares a lot of the same weaknesses as the first one ( I really hesitate to call it the ""original"") but personally I found the main characters more likable and relatable. The story albeit nothing spectacular was a bit more intriguing than big robot fight big monster boom and it didn't overstay its welcome. Please Hollywood keep your schlock under two hours. You're not writing Lord of the Rings here.
As a fun popcorn movie this is alright. Way more watchable than its predecessor, not plagued with as much visual noise during the action scenes and with no pretense of being anything more than pure entertainment. Admittedly all the destruction and chaos it puts on the screen has zero impact on the viewer and you can see every piece of conflict and character development coming from a mile away but that's just how modern blockbusters operate.On a sidenote: stop hating on John Boyega.

167,MichaelNontonMulu,A Sequel With More Robots and Major Fights,8,22 March 2018,"This was a sequel of the film that I quite enjoyed back in 2013 , but with mostly different characters. I believe it would be best to see the first movie before seeing this one to understand better on the war history plus the plot involving those characters. My personal view of the movie was it had a lot more action compared to the prequel. If you are a fan of those Jaeger fights in that movie, you would be amazed with the major screen time involving these fights. Especially since there were exciting Jaegers like Gypsy Avenger, Bracer Phoenix, Guardian Bravo and Saber Athena. Those fight scenes were totally amazing and intense and those who love to see big robots fight against other robot and big monsters should be satisfied.The special visual effects of the Jaeger fights were totally awesome and looked amazingly real to me, obviously with a major budget of USD 150 million, it was really worth it. The sound effects of Dolby Atmos was very good, though at times (during conversations among the pilots in the Jaeger, sounded a bit too loud and seemed broken). And seeing those big robots and monsters in a large studio was certainly the right choice as it gave the feeling the robots were really enormous. I think seeing this in IMAX would be a lot better.Aside from those cool actions and special effects, the plot itself was not really great. John Boyega was able to portray his character brightly and he was surprisingly very charming and looked to have fun in here. Newcomer Cailee Spaeny was not bad either, while Scott Eastwood was pretty standard and not spectacular. The disappointing part would be the rest of the Cadets (and the supporting characters) whom I think did not have sufficient screen time to give us any sense of closeness and empathy towards them, including Jing Tian whose character felt a bit out of place. And the plot of Kaiju's re-appearance was probably a bit too short which did not give adequate room to absorb & understand. Maybe because the movie was not long enough as it was not even 2 hours including the very long end credit scenes duration to appreciate those wonderful visual artists.The movie also had some fun light moments, as well as the emotional moment in the middle which affected my wife a bit. It may not win the critics heart, but for my wife and I who love to see this kind of action movie, we thought it was intense, pretty awesome and we can still have fun by disregarding some of the obvious flaws mentioned above. I personally think that the movie might be appealing to certain type of audience, but definitely not all in general, which would be a sad thing if it's not successful commercially, especially since the ending hinted a third movie to complete the trilogy. There was no end credit scene if you are wondering, so you can hit the restroom immediately. If you are not a fan of this kind of genre, you might feel the movie to be too childish, light, illogical and so on. Especially if you do not like Transformers or Power Rangers movies. But if you are like my wife and I, then by all means, see this one and enjoy the Jaeger fights. For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Pacific Rim - Uprising
168,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Pacific Rim if it didn't have Del Torro's passion and creativity,6,28 March 2018,"I remember after watching Guillermo Del Torro's big epic monsters-vs-mech movie Pacific Rim I said to myself that it was the live-action Transformers and Power Rangers movie I always wanted to see as a kid. After finally seeing the long-awaited sequel Uprising by Steven S. DeKnight, I felt like that movie had more in common with the forgettable modern versions of Transformers and Power Rangers of recent years. There were times it really did feel like this movie was filmed by Transformers's Michael Bay based on the sense of humour and the plot but minus the overabundance of explosions and racial stereotypes. It would make sense since DeKnight was once a part of the writer's room for Michael Bay's Transformers cinematic universe.The original's rich anime-style that was brought to life by Del Torro's focus for eye-popping colour and dirty detail is gone. Instead the scenes are blandly lit in regular daytime with not enough dirt and too much cleanliness to recreate the lived-in feel it once had. The film focuses more on the use of Jaeger technology after the war but sacrifices exploring most of the unique lovecraftian creature elements. DeKnight's story choices either alter or ignore the more interesting parts of the original's mythology for a conventional, blander plot. And it felt like a lot of the times it was a disservice to what came before.The use of the characters is a hit-or-miss depending how you view them. John Boyega gives the charm, charisma and depth in his performance that this film was lacking (which probably helped by the fact he was a producer on it). As the one improvement from the first film, Boyega as the late Stacker Pentacoast's estranged son Jake brings more leading power then what Charlie Hunman ever did. Another standout is breakout star Cailee Spaeney as the Jaeger pilot recruit Amara. However, it's a shame that these two interesting leads are mostly paired with boring side characters. They range from Scott Eastwood's overly serious and dull Nate Lambert to the other forgettable Jaeger recruits. These recruits become nothing more then Pacific Rim's equivalent of glorified red shirts that would be killed off in a Star Trek episode. The use of Charlie Day's character Newt felt the most problematic. In the original, you could see Del Torro's love and fascination for monster biology being injected into the levity Day brought. With Uprising, Newt becomes more of the annoying guy you would find in a Michael Bay film. Without giving away spoilers, the plot does explain his change in character but it felt like it was a creative choice that didn't payoff. It feels also insulting that Rinko Kikuchi's return to her role as Mako has such short screen-time and does not give her much to do at all.It took a while for me to get used to DeKnight's swifter and quicker fighting style for the more advanced Jaegers. The big city-destroying battles are not as terrible or disjointed like Transformers but they lack the sense of awe, wonder and creativity Del Torro put effort into crafting. The closest Uprising ever gets to resembling the original is the last half-hour with the Jaegers assembling in Japan to take on the new groups of Kaiju. But even then the battles don't give enough time or attention to show off the Kaiju's personality and abilities. As a big monster fan, I would have preferred the Kaiju to have been better used.While Guillermo Del Torro is credited as a producer, there is nothing of his love for monsters, robots and world building I can feel in this inferior sequel. It is also dissapointing since I like what Steven S. DeKnight brought to TV in the past with Spartecus and Daredevil season 1. Unfortunately his debut into film feels so forgettable. If one good came out of this aside from John Boyega getting a non-Star Wars big franchise role, it allowed Del Torro the time to create his Academy Awarding-winning fishman movie The Shape of Water.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

170,vesil_vesalier,Ha ha! and then Ha HA! and then Ha... Huh??,5,28 March 2018,"Okay, so I have to try and write a spoiler-free review of PACIFIC RIM: UPRISING, and that's harder than it sounds, because writing a spoiler-loaded one would be much easier.Especially considering how many flaws there are in this film.Guillermo del Toro opted out of this film, to do THE SHAPE OF WATER, which I haven't seen yet, as of this writing. Honestly I wasn't all that crazy for the first PACIFIC RIM, even with Guillermo at the helm. He's good at fantasy, and fantastic creatures of his own personal design, and beyond the Kaijin, there's nothing of that in either of these films. Meshing his very creative designs against Japanese anime themes just didn't churn out a masterpiece of film.It was better than this one, though.The original idea is that Jagers, with the Kaijin threat gone, are now being made by the average Joe, and the government won't allow it. Then, a company comes up with the concept of drone Jagers, instead of using human pilots, for some reason. The two primary characters, Jake and Nate, have to pilot one of the Jagers for the summit in which the decision has to be made as to whether or not the Jager program should be changed, from human drivers to automated ones, when there is an attack. I won't spoil anything, so I'll just leave it at that. And then the plot starts to move (and twist, and turn, and veer, and...).The actors all turn in good performances here, though John Boyega as Jake Pentacost, the son of the late Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba from the first installment) stands out here. Sure, there are times when his humor falls a little flat, but there's more than enough times where it actually made me laugh, to make up for it. The kids do well, specifically Cailee Spaeny as Amara, who leads the charge in that regard, but that also reveals one of my main problems with the film: the kids don't have enough time in front of the camera, save Cailee. Their training regiment is largely off-camera, so it's hard to get behind the characters because we hardly see them throughout the film (save Cailee).Scott Eastwood plays Nate, the straight-as-an-arrow military dude, but I found his delivery sometimes lacking. Was it because he's the son of the legendary Clint Eastwood? Was the director afraid of telling him to give it a few more takes, to really deliver a scene or two that was rememberable? Because I didn't see any.The real problem with UPRISING is the need for the storytellers to keep shifting their course, trying to surprise the audience. Every time you think you understand what's going on, there's a sharp twist on the wheel, and we veer into an unexpected spot, surprised at where the plot is suddenly going. The surprises, instead of being like gifts of joy being shined down upon us, are more like being suddenly struck by another car from the side, as time slows down when you reel from the impact. Only to come out the other side dizzy and disoriented (and possibly injured). There are just too many HA HA! moments in the film, and eventually I found myself numb to them, because of their frequency.On the other side of the coin, there are impressive battle scenes in this movie, and even a few breathtaking dramatic moments. My favorite one is in the snowy Arctic, which I will not say anything more about as to avoid spoilers (but it's awesome). The CGI used for battle damage and realistic battle scenes between oversized enemies was nearly flawless. Can't say much about the score, because I didn't find it all that memorable. There were songs used in the film, but they didn't really add anything to its atmosphere.The collection of these problems and/or lack of impressions by themselves would have probably only shaved a couple of points off of my rating, but... Once the surprises start rolling in as though they are being delivered to you on an assembly line, it gets harder and harder to accept what you see as the final act of the film comes home. You start to wonder if maybe you'd been suckered into the theater just to feed a franchise, instead of enjoy a movie.And who's to say that's not what I've done, now that I've paid to see this? Because I certainly won't be doing it again.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
171,vesil_vesalier,And now the spoiler review of UPRISING. Ta Da!!!,5,28 March 2018,"If you actually find yourself looking away from the screen, saying ""What?"" more than three times, something is wrong with the movie you're watching.Here is the spoiler review I'm doing for PACIFIC RIM UPRISING. A movie that shifts its track more often than a drunken tornado... assuming that somehow a tornado could drink.It starts with the reprise of our beloved Dr. Newton, played by Charlie Day. Now, I don't have a problem with Mr. Day's performance, because it isn't his talent where the problem lies. The problem, for me, starts with him, because his motivations for his actions seem a little more than forced, and even silly. Apparently he's a very lonely man, so he's bonded with a Kaijin brain, for some odd reason, and we're never told why or how this has happened.Oh, sure, there's the movie's explanation of it, the fact that he bonded with the Kaijin from the first film, but... Dr. Hermann did the same, and he didn't suddenly lose HIS marbles from the experience. So what happened? How did Dr. Newton go from saving the world by destroying the Kaijin, to being in love with them?The movie never explains.Then, the suspicious actions of what seems to be our main villain of the movie, a corporate CEO played by Tian Jing, who seems ruthless and power-driven, are completely washed away once it is realized that the Jager drones she's been spending her life trying to make have been hijacked by Kaijin brains, fused to her creations. It would have been nice to see her PLANNING this, instead of being surprised by it, and then having all hell break loose once the Kaijin start doing their thing... but... Instead, it is revealed that good ol' Dr. Newton is the one causing all the ruckus. Surprise! Didn't see that one coming, did you?No, and there wasn't a good reason to. Even when he explains why he's trying to destroy the world, his reason is weak, to say the least.On and on the twists and turns come throughout the rest of the film. First, we fight the Kaijin, and the kids are doing all right. Then, we have to SURPRISE! you again with a sudden surprise army of healing robots, fusing the dead Kaijin together into one, gigantic horror that NONE of the pilots can defeat, or even harm.The main threat is revealed, that Kaijin blood mixed with certain Earth elements results in devastating explosions, revealed by Dr. Hermann. Originally thought to be a weapons design, or a propulsion unit possibility, it is instead revealed to be the final destination of super-Kaijin, whose headed for a bath in Mt. Fuji, where said elements are apparently (and conviently) plentiful.It's like they designed a bunch of threads, and took some time to make them really pretty. Then, they needed to sew the threads together, but they couldn't figure out a way to make it all match up. And then finally, they just threw it all together, making certain that all the loose ends were tied up.Ta da! You get a horrifying mismatch of patchwork storytelling, complete with an impossible to follow script and a near-constant stream of Ha ha! Ha ha! Got you! moments that eventually make you numb to the entire experience.But the battles between the Jagers were good. And the one in the Arctic was exceptional. It's not enough to even come close to saving the movie, but... At least it's SOMETHING.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It's that simple!",Pacific Rim - Uprising
175,regula1,You're Better Off Watching The Original,6,23 March 2018,"Pacific Rim Uprising has all the hallmarks of a sequel to a film that wasn't originally meant to have a sequel, but because the original made enough money and had enough public support for a sequel, the studio didn't know exactly how to continue the story, and this is what we got.Essentially, this film is both a second chapter to and a retread of the original. Ten years after Gypsy Danger closed the breach that the Kaiju were coming from, the son of General Stacker Pentecost, Jake (John Boyega) is forced to resume his father's work and face a renewed Kaiju threat that has the potential of wiping out the world.At first, this film attempts to forge a new direction. There's a more jovial and self-aware tone, we see smaller, home-made Jaegers going up against the more familiar big boys, and a scrappy new protagonist who seems to have some genuine personality (Cailee Spaney as Amara Namani).The bond that begins to develop between Jake and Amara is the one genuine highlight of this film, and it does resolve in a satisfying way. However, as Uprising turns more formulaic and relies more and more on the gags and banter of the first film, it really turns into a yawn.Character development is even more lacking in Uprising than the original Pacific Rim. The original got away with this because it only focused on about five main characters. Uprising tries to give a sense of camaraderie between a group of Jaeger cadets, but aside from Amara, the others are entirely forgettable and interchangeable, especially when they all wear helmets.Ultimately, this film tries too hard to recapture the lightning in the bottle that was the original, and in the end in more ways than one it comes off feeling like a bad rip-off of Independence Day: Resurgence, which was itself a bad rip-off of the original Independence Day. Best to remember what good there was in the original Pacific Rim, and leave this one to the bargain bin.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

As long as you can let go of any tethering to reality or physics, this was an enjoyable sequel.

There were some predictable situations and a Checkov's Gun scenario you could see coming an hour in the first 10 minutes.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

178,iamjacksmoviechannel,"Fight, Explode, Repeat",5,25 April 2018,"""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is proof that Hollywood will always find a way to destroy large amounts of property..even when it doesn't really have to.Jake Pentacost is the reluctant son of the Idris Elba character from the first film, assigned to train young recruits until remote control jaegers start going rogue. From there much of this feels ripped off from a Transformers movie than any of the nuanced work Guillermo del Toro did before. Steven DeKnight takes over directing. He starts out with a fun chase but by the time we get to the hour long final action sequence, I felt more than pummeled. John Boyega does a decent job, this is more life i've seen out of him since ""Attack the Block"". Compared to Elba though, it's clear inspiring skips a generation. Scott Eastwood and the rest of the cast fair much worse, they're so non-existant you forget they're in the movie when not on screen.Except Charlie Day of course whose always a fun watch and gets the best line in the movie; ""Giant robots again, real original guys.""

179,jwcstorage,Dont bother - Its a disservice,2,26 April 2018,"The only thing I can say positive about this is... It was a movie, with actors, and scenes... a beginning and ending... and sequel baiting. GDT wanted nothing to do with this dumpster fire so he was obviously not attached at all, and it painfully shows. This is a disservice to the first film aimed at 2 groups of people: kids, and the Chinese audiences.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I dont even know where to start. Basically if you are, or have, kids or young teens you/they might like this, or if you're a Chinese person in China, you might like this. Its not even good as a dumb popcorn flick. I kept wanting to bail on this movie but I stuck it out if only to warn others. It is basically a live-action cartoon with every trope you could think of. 
The main character starting out by running away from his problems? Check!
One character is being annoying and continually interrupting someone trying to say something important for humors sake? Check!
Eject system not working at a key moment? Check! (Man they gotta improve those eject systems!) 
A China funded Chinadoll primary character who is actually pretty pointless? CHECK! 
I could go on but... this movie isnt worth it honestly. If you liked Pacific Rim, go re-watch Pacific Rim. There is literally nothing that made that film worthwhile in this one.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
180,neobateman,A sequel that feels more like Michael Bay and less Guillermo Del Toro.,3,21 July 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising is the sequel to the much appreciated Pacific Rim. The first film was an unapologetic action blockbuster with a unique style. I was not the biggest fan of the first one, it had a fun plot, good performances and amazing special effects. However apart from those things, Pacific Rim was a somewhat dull movie with very little substance. This movie has no substance, and also none of the flare that Del Toro's predecessor had. John Boyega is a newly discovered talent after his breakthrough performance in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. I was initially excited to see him in this film as the lead as I strongly believe he can be a front runner for many more summer blockbusters. He brings everything to the table and attempts to make his character fun and likeable. Overall he gives a good performance and is a better choice for a franchise like this instead of Charlie Hunnam. Boyega has charisma and only his sheer likeability as a person saves this character from being totally uninteresting. He plays Jake Pentecost, son of Stacker Pentecost, the one who saved humanity from the Kaiju, 10 years prior. Jake is a drifter, who doesn't care about his father's legacy. This is a cliche that has been overdone in movies but I honestly find it acceptable in a movie where huge monsters fight huge robots. My problem with this character was that his arc was handled very poorly, he changes too quick without the audience receiving the opportunity to fully accept it. There is a cool dynamic set up between Pentecost and Lambert (Scott Eastwood) and Rinko Kikuchi is fantastic in a very limited role, bringing back her character from the first film. These are about the only good performances in this film, Boyega, Eastwood and Kikuchi. Charlie Day, who was hilarious in the first film is absolutely terrible, especially with a character choice that could have been interesting but just felt like a setup for Pacific Rim 3. I can already see him winning a Razzie next year, he was positively awful. The story is also incredibly flat, with the Kaiju only having a prominent role towards the final act. In fact its the last 20 minutes that feel like a movie, the rest is mainly just filler. This film was a gigantic waste of time that couldn't even be redeemed by some flashy action scenes and three solid performances.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Fantastic movie, produced by Guillermo Del Toro.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
182,pokedom,A shame really,4,29 March 2018,"I never saw the first one. Sue me all you like, but I've heard it's great and I'd love to see it sometime soon. Especially after seeing this movie, which just isn't that great in general. And I really wish this movie was good so I had even more reasons to watch the first, but... not really...Guess we'll start with the good. The effects and action are quite good. I can tell they put effort into them as they're easily the best part of the movie. The end fight scene is pretty great, and nothing ever looks fake. There's a couple of shots that aren't all there, but for the most part, excellent job on the visuals.I like how this movie treats itself like an over the top anime. Like the characters in the robots yell out stuff like ""PROTON CANNON!"" and ""GRAVITY SPIKE!"" and the like. Even the villain is completely over the top and stupid, which I quite liked. It's a movie about giant robots stopping over the top aliens called the Kaiju. Not only is it a movie about that, it's the second movie to be about that. So I like that it doesn't take itself seriously, but the problem is the movie is trying to take itself seriously.That's a good segway: the movie treats it's subject matter like it's the most important thing on planet Earth, or any other dimension aliens like to crawl out of. It tries to make the Kaiju more of a threat by giving them a goal. Having not seen the first movie and not heard much about it... was their a reason for the aliens doing the things they do? Can't we just have the basic set up ""aliens arrive now we fight""? Now the aliens are going for Mt. Fuji to blow up the world. Was that really a necessary addition? They even make it look like everything that happened in the first movie was actually just the aliens trying to go to Mt. Fuji the whole time. Really? I mean I can't vouch for the first one, but I doubt that was necessary.Speaking of Japan, this movie has the most obvious China pandering I've seen since Transformers 4. Most of the plot takes place in China, there's a lot- and I mean a *lot*, of Chinese actors, and the final city destroying (and almost world destroying) climax takes place in Japan... the one place China hates. It's pretty obvious that this movie was made for China, with the bland plot and hokey acting from everyone that isn't Chinese. Also big action scenes designed to trick suckers into buying tickets... something China is notorious for.The characters are paper thin. John Boyega's accent was awful, and his character was doubly so. Within 5 minutes of the movie he's already unlikable and I wanted nothing to do with him. He literally sold priceless robot stuff to a dude for Oreo's. Any joke he made fell completely flat, and most of the humor is dumb memes. The Chris Evans lookalike was pretty flat and monotone. The one kid girl actor was a waste of time being honest. She builds a robot. That's it. And the robot was pretty pointless. In the one chase scene with it John is trying to take over as the pilot (WE NEED A PILOT flashbacks) she's piloting the robot fine and he's just like ""just step out and let me drive"". Dude, she's got this under control. Chill.Speaking more of robots, they were all dumb and stupid. I'm sure this was all explained in the first film. But why did they put pain receptors into the robots? Guys are out here fighting off the Kaiju, but in order to do so, they gotta fight off a hologram of the Kaiju to move the robot in the right ways? But the hologram is basically the Kaiju and has weight... despite being a hologram? I'm confident this was explained in great detail in the first movie. But to an outsider looking in, it looks awkward and stupid, and makes them question who green-lit that feature.So yeah, this movie isn't that great. Lucky me, I had no emotional investment in anything that was going on because I didn't care or know about anything going on. But that's never a good thing. Credit for action, credit for effects, minus points for basically everything else.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

When the Kaiju got killed by then end of the movie by the ""fist of fury"" from a flying Jaeger, I almost felt bad for him. That is how bad the movie is.I mean, the 1st installment by del Toro wasn't pitch perfect but overall very enjoyable, this one is just way below bar. None of the main characters came to life, Spaeny as Amara is definitely a miscast, she tried way too hard in every single scene, what came out wasn't her character, but her effort to deliver the lines. Comparing her performance with Dafne Keen's in Logan ... not much comparison I guess, but to be fair, Spaeny wasn't alone, Boyega and Eastwood were equally bad. Part of that had to be with the dialogue - I don't know who wrote the screenplay but the entire dialogue were just laughable, and idiotic to a whole new level.Halfway through the movie I realize that if I stop treating it as action/sci-fi movie but a comedy, it'd be more enjoyable, and that was what I did.

191,cochrandarin,Yet another movie that shows us that the poor souls on this website have forgotten how to enjoy a movie! (sigh),8,28 August 2018,"I'm reviewing this to save you from yourself! Many have forgotten how to be entertained. And this movie is entertaining. Every time I post a review on this website, I keep thinking it's the last time I will do so, but I feel someone has to come on here and tell all of these poor, depressed, negativist that sit around watching a movie with a note pad and scrutinizing movies to the point that it's more like a college assignment than entertainment, that there IS hope. Listen carefully to this truth; You can actually watch a movie that is not going to be the best movie that has ever been made or that you will ever see and actually...(gasp)...be entertained despite the movie not being very realistic! having plot holes, unbelievable in places, and no character development...after all, do you really go to see a movie like this to see some big, long psychological character development, or do you see it to watch giant monsters and robots smashing and throwing each other into buildings? 
If you watch porno (which I don't) but if you do, you don't care about character development do you? If you watch a war movie, do you really care all that much about anything other than bombs and jets and shooting? If you watch a martial arts movie, is there anything better than a perfectly placed round-house kick to the bad guy? 
So....yet again, I feel I must come to the rescue! 
It sounds cliche, but it's true; Turn off your brain....that's what some movies are meant to do. Make us forget about the troubles and cares of life for a while. 
Put down the note pad....this movie has lots of unbelievable stuff in it, but gees folks, EVERY sci fi action move has them. 
It will NOT be the best movie you have ever saw in the sci fi/fantasy genre....it's not Aliens or the LOTR movies or the Chronicles of Riddick, etc. But that's ok...most movies are not. 
IF you allow yourself, you will be entertained and that's what movies are supposed to do, right? The action is awesome...the fight scenes are better than the first. The acting is a little rigid sometimes, but that's no biggy. 
The CGI is out of this world and in some ways better than the first in my opinion. 
It's a winner...enjoy...be entertained and don't bring the notepad. That's my advice. Someday you'll thank me for it.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

How can you go wrong with such a movie, one can think. The plot however is extremely incoherent and thin. The lead actors are not charismatic and comes off as B actors. The cadets looked like straight from a disney movie or something. The villain was quite cliche. The asian actors have more charisma than the entire crew put together, they should have given them more screentime. Choreography and the CGI of the fighting scenes were done badly, but for the most part of the movie, that is what people wanted to see, mechanical robots fighting, it delivers on that part, but eventually you get numb with all that destruction to the point you don't feel any urgency when buildings get smashed and there are potential civilians inside that might get killed, you just don't care anymore.

Writer-director Steven S. DeKnight (Daredevil 2015 TV Series) with writers Emily Carmichael, Kira Snyder & T. S. Nowlin seem woefully unprepared for the task of bringing a cinematic project to the big screen. One of the biggest gaffes seen in Uprising is taking a solid plot and pumping it full of vacuous, episodic humor. In fact, the opening scene of Uprising is just as poorly made as the very last scene, which should surprise no one. Uprising shines when it comes to the giant robot Jaeger and Kaiju monster clashes, but beyond that, there's just not much there to recommend this movie. This sequel to the masterful Pacific Rim (2013) is not very good - which makes us wonder why we had to wait five years for it. Entertaining? Somewhat. Worth your time?

I was a bit fan of the first movie and always hoped for a sequel, how disappointed I was with this follow up. Apparently the first one didn't do great, so I guess I should just be glad this one got made at all.
Certainly more a kids film this time around, a mix of Transformers and Power Rangers.
The casting wasn't the best, John Boyega was frankly just awful in it. I think John was brought in to add the humour and ""street"" element to it, missed the mark big time on both.
Overall, worth a watch for the visuals, but don't expect it to come near the first movie in overall entertainment. Potential for a 3rd movie with great action could be in the pipeline, let's wait and see.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

203,ahao76,My face is well set up.. Beauty is a burden.. Greatest Joke of the year..,2,23 June 2018,"First of all, this movie is still acceptable for me.. The main reason why i hate about this movie is the character Jake keep on dwelling over his dead father's success.. So many times he's telling others his father tells him this and that or how great his father is and die as a hero.. Blah blah blah non stop.. No need for that ok.. I have watch Pacific Rim part 1 before.. It's no big deal.. There is another white guy (His father's partner in the Jaeger) die along with him in the battle.. Why his father gets all the credits as a hero and not even mentioning anything about that guy at all? The image he's trying to create for himself failed.. Such a boaster about his dead father.. Now i want to say this about John Boyega (The character Jake). Totally not handsome ok.. Stop cheating yourself and others.. I don't want to say other flaws of the face, one very fatal thing a handsome face should not have is his damn big nose.. He's got the biggest nose i have ever seen, please look at his damn nose for god's sake.. If big noses = handsome then clowns are handsome too.. He even said this so shamelessly in the film, ""My face is well set up.. Beauty is a burden.. OMG.. I roll on floor laughing and almost drop dead from laughing.. And that STAR WARS - The Force Awakens, STAR WARS - The Last Jedi did the same thing too.. Making him as a lead is fine.. But why try to make us think he is so damn handsome when he is totally not!! I'm sure there are lots of truly handsome actors like Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Brad Pitt etc.. Even if movie makers try to cut cost, please open your damn eyes don't pick on a hideous looking guy and try make him into a handsome role.. There's lots of cheap and handsome actors out there.. John Boyega (Jake) seriously i'm not trying to insult him, all of us got some strong points and weakness.. I like the movie he acted in Attack The Block.. But trying to be a handsome superstar is definitely not your thing.. Wake up and stop clowning around.. STAR WARS - The Force Awakens, STAR WARS - The Last Jedi and Pacific Rim Uprising.. Already gave us 3 nightmarish movies trying hard to be handsome is enough.. Please don't kill me and people around the world who share the same thought as me by saying those kind of words again...

204,darryl-42069,A wasted pile of potentially good material.,4,24 March 2018,"I really do love the first Pacific Rim movie. I thought it's one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, and a prime example of how to do a sci-fi movie with giant robots done right. Guillermo del Toro knows how to do it right, so when the new Pacific Rim movie was announced, but del Toro won't return to direct, I'm both cautious and excited for this movie. After all, we could trust the guy who's one of the showrunners of Netflix's highly successful Daredevil series, right? Right?Well, the lesson: Never trust anyone except the original directorPros first. John Boyega, amazing guy, amazing actor. Scott Eastwood once again successfully took another step forward to be as good as his father. Cailee Spaeny really took me by surprise, she's not just the kid in your typical sci-fi movie that needs to be saved, and she did a great job. Jing Tian once again impresses me ever since I saw her in ""The Great Wall"" last year, and she did a good job. Rinko Kikuchi once again delivered a good performance as fan favorite Mako Mori from the first movie (I was a bit disappointed that she no longer uses Japanese all of a sudden again, that's what makes her great). Charlie Day and Burn Gorman also returned from the first movie as scientist duo Newt and Hermann, and they did a great job too (though it leads me to one of the cons)The plot for the movie, in my opinion, isn't as bad as most people says. I think the idea behind it is great. The action scenes were just as you thought it'll be: dumb, destructive, and most importantly, fun. The humor for the movie also worked pretty well. And for those you that are wondering: yes, the Pacific Rim theme is back and it's glorious.And.... that's all about it's pros, because there's lots of things that are wrong about this movie. First, it lost all the charm of the first movie. The first movie had these dark, gritty, neon look on it, while here there's light, and more cartoony colors on it. The CGI is way more obvious than before. del Toro is smart, using dark environment and effects, like rain, to make the CGI less noticable. Here, it's all over the place and it's truly a disappointment. The producers made Charlie Cox's Newt a complete 180° personality (he's a villain now) and it bugs me despite it is explained in the movie (Damn Percursors...) There's a lot of things left unexplained in this movie (like why Kaiju blood is extremely reactive to Earth's ""rare minerals"" despite it's not explained in the first movie, or why the Kaiju's attack Mount Fuji, when there's definitely other volcanoes that's rich in ""rare minerals"", or what is this ""rare mineral"", and so on and so forth) I believe there's a lot of deleted scenes left in the editing room. The last scene in this movie clearly sets off a sequel ala Independence Day: Resurgence (does that really necessary?). And last, but not the least, WHY THE PRODUCERS DECIDE TO KILL OFF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER IN THE FIRST PACIFIC RIM?!!!! I mean do you really need to go that far? RIP Mako Mori, it's nice to knowing you :-( Overall, this movie kinda disappoints me. Sure the new cast are great, the characters are likable, and the action scenes were as great as the first one, but the movie lost all the charm that makes the first one so memorable. It's just a waste of potential. For those who just wants to see robots and monsters fight each other, this movie is a good choice to waste some time and have fun, but for fans of the first Pacific Rim like me, I think you'll be disappointed with this movie. Shame on you DeKnight...",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It was more of a fun movie than the original, as I'm sure it was meant to be. I enjoyed it, perhaps as much as the first, but in a different, fun kind of way.Usually a sequel is aiming to be just good enough to support a third movie. This sequel did its job.

Supposedly battle hardened Yager pilots who are ready to teach the next generation. This then sets up the next ridiculous thing from an adults point of view they then cast the rookie pilots all in the age range of around 16 so the young leads can appear more veteran and its been done before and yes that movie was pretty awful too.The comedy is childish and the acting is what you would expect for a movie aimed at kids.The action is good but I couldn't but help feel like I was watching a video game rather than a big movie production.This could have been taken in the opposite direction to become a Mech franchise leading to clan wars with the occasional Kayju thrown in but sadly they went this direction and pretty much like Power Rangers bombed at the box office I really expect this will do pretty much the same.If you have young kids they might enjoy it but for anyone else its just pretty awful.,Pacific Rim - Uprising

That's all.For the rest, a lot of flaws: the Jaeger vs Kaiju fight is only happening at the end; the acting - except the girl's - is almost non-existant (the lead actor and his ""team mate"" should both consider a different job, really), the plotholes, the plain idiotic character development (e.g. the lead character's ""I'm not like my father, I don't give hero speeches"" only to give a typical one moments later, or telling a story about his father to the girl he already had a neuronal connection - thus sharing all his memories, including this one - a couple of days before), managing to manually target a tiny spot on Earth surface basically from space, and so on.Conclusion: if you're able to shut off your brain completely and just focus on the fights, you might have a good time (assuming, of course, that you like them or how they were done - I agree with a previous viewer that the robots are too light compared to how they should be). Otherwise, you won't be left with much after this - although the original movie deserved a sequel...",Pacific Rim - Uprising

236,CulvertonSmith,Another Unnecessary and Generic Hollywood Sequel,4,27 March 2018,"Now I have seen the first Pacific Rim, and honestly, I thought it was okay. I certainly didn't walk out of that movie anxiously awaiting a sequel, or even remotely wanting one. So when I went to see this movie, I wouldn't say that I was exactly excited. I got exactly what I expected, it was bad. Now it wasn't horrible, it almost achieved being average, but ultimately it was bad. The cast in this movie is quite forgettable, nobody stood out. The only person I thought came close to working was John Boyega, though even he didn't quite get there. He did do his best, but his character really didn't give him anything good to work with. That was it, everybody else blended together in some very okay performances, I literally couldn't name one other performance that came close to being memorable. Charlie Day is one of my favorite working comedians, but his role in this movie is utterly pointless. An absolute waste of his talent. He does what he can, but he has nothing to do. The writing is pretty generic, the movie moves from one uninteresting part of the story to another. It's set up very much like a bland action movie. At times it's actually pretty bad, which causes for some unintentional comedy. There are some moments in this movie where they genuinely try to get us to care about what is happening, but due to the lack of relatable characters and engaging writing, I didn't care at all. They try to make us feel for characters, but it doesn't work when they feel like characters, rather than like real people. This is most definitely an action movie, and unfortunately the action ranges between being bland and actually bad. Not all of it was cut up excessively, but most of it was. The action lacks any sort of flavor or any feeling of originality. When your action is reduced to quick cuts of big things punching at each other, I tune out. For effectively the whole movie, I was simply waiting for it to be over. As we followed clichéd characters across unoriginal storylines, I was impatient for the credits to roll. By the time they finally did role, I got excited that this boring mess was finally over. If I'm excited to leave the theater so that I can have the experience of your movie behind me, I'm sorry to say that your movie has failed me. I haven't even mentioned the film's broken attempts at comedy. Fortunately it wasn't too excessive, but every time they try to get a laugh out of me, they just fail. The only times I laughed were at how absurd the plot was, which isn't a good reason to laugh. I'm happy to say that this movie didn't annoy me, although I certainly didn't enjoy it. If you liked the first Pacific Rim, I cannot recommend this one. Where that movie succeeds at being fun, it's sequel succeeds at feeling unnecessary and generic. While this movie is actually bad, it's not awful, I didn't run out of the theater screaming. I never had high hopes for this movie, but I was hoping to at least be entertained. I regret seeing this one, I hope you don't make the same mistake I did.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

239,sefrafer,Pacific Rim: Uprising of lost money,6,25 March 2018,"Most of us who watch these movies are fans of the giant robot stories (mecha) of incredible animated series like gundam, evangelion and of course Mazinger z is that far from the robots and the incredible fights is that there is an interesting plot, a story that plunges us into the worlds created for them, and this second part does not have an interesting story to tell, and this may be because its director Steven S. DeKnight is his first film and although he knows how to do entertaining series, he does not know how develop a plot in the short term, do not know how a character develops in 2 hours of film and definitely do not know how to balance the humor in the plot, the film hurts the clear image that the first tape had, the created universe was thrown overboard for Guillermo del toro, you know that the thing is going wrong since we changed to Warner for Universal, the details that made the film great are no longer there, but CGI does not make it better in fact Aijus are too inferior and the story of his return has larger plot gaps than the Jaggers, if there is something good is the actors who do their work John Boyega and Scott Eastwood do a very good job but it is not enough to save a movie that only offers entertaining moments, but not memorable in the long run will become what transformers is for Michael Bay just a movie to make money and not to give us how original it was.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
240,wescarpenter-48666,Pacific Rim Uprising Film Review By Logan Coleman,8,20 April 2018,"Pacific Rim Uprising picks up 10 years after the first film. This is great popcorn film for the entire family. The cast that stood out were John Boyega, Jing Tian, Cailee Spaeny, Rinko Kikuchi, Burn Gorman, and Charlie Day. For the people who complained that the first film took place too much in the dark, they will be happy with this film because it primary takes places during the daytime. I would settle for a compromise of the battle scenes taking place at sunset for the future films. I am hoping there will be a prequel to this film that takes place before Uprising and after the first film. I also believe there will be a direct sequel to this film, as well a potential crossover to Godzilla and King Kong in the Monster Verse. I had one issue with the handling of a particular character This sequel robot looks a little bit comic bookish compare to the original film which looked more realistic. This film is not as good as the first one but it is a good film. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving these film 8 stars out of 10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
241,umashankarpati1997,Justice made to del Toro's Pacific Rim.,8,24 March 2018,"Picking up ten years after the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) canceled the apocalypse, we now follow Jake Pentecost (John Boyega), son of famous hero Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), and current scavenger of old Jaeger parts. When he and fellow scavenger Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) come across the PPDC's radar after stealing and scrapping with authorities, they're given a choice: join the corps or go to jail. They choose the former even though corporate titan Liwen Shao (Tian Jing) plans to put the PPDC out of business with her drone program led by Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day). It's quite evident that debutant director, Steven S DeKnight, is not trying to replicate del Toro's rather inimitable style - Uprising is a brighter
And when Jake escapes that encounter and confronts Amara (Cailee Spaeny), a scrappy 15-year-old who's fending for herself in the ruinsPacific Rim: Uprising has no such thematic ambitions, and no interest in wasting time on explanations, deepening the mythology, or exploring new corners of its worldJake was trained as a jaeger pilot, but abandoned the program; now he scavenges through decommissioned military sites and puts jaeger parts on the black market. In the early going, the film seems startlingly familiar. Like Mako Mori in the first film (played by Rinko Kikuchi, who reprises the role in Uprising), Amara has personal traumas that interfere with her ability to Drift. But where Mako's battle for serenity was a major plotline in Pacific Rim, Uprising acknowledges Amara's trauma, then forgets itBoyega and Spaeny are both charismatic, strong screen presences, and that becomes crucial to the movie, charlie day is the show stealer.
CGI is perfect and BGM is thrilling.
No silly humor. Only con is that the path of the movie could have been better but expecting story line from a action movie is debatable. The pros of this movie suppress the cons.

242,peterjdickinson,Oh Dear,1,18 June 2018,Hollywood is no longer capable of creating big budget fluff. This deeply stupid film starts out cartoonish and rapidly turns into a cartoon with none of the charm good cartoons display. This is not good and it appears to have been written by someone with a checklist of modern film making. The tragedy of it is the whole cliched mess is not an accident but entirely deliberate because the people behind it thought they knew what the public expected even though they seem to live in another reality.

249,packor,Felt like I was watching transformers,6,6 July 2018,"And in fact, it is just as good as transformers. That's not really saying much.The problem with the Transformers series and Pacific Rim is that they are really just action movies dressed up with robots. Transformers attempts to spice up the mech genre by having them do acrobatics and fancy, unrealistic combat moves. They look like ninja turtles or those kangaroos from Warriors of Virtue, except they're giant robots. Pacific Rim doesn't have the fancy flipkicks, but it suffers from the same dilemma: they fight just like humans.You have to ask yourself, if you just want to see moves, why don't you just go watch a martial arts film? It has much better action sequences that isn't bogged down by ""slow, clunky movement"" becsuse ""robots"". Or if you want to see high tech weapon suits performing great looking feats, most anime do it much better. In fact, in Pacific Rim one, the fighting scenes between the pilots was hugely superior to the robot scenes.Let's be real. What's the real reason you watch robots films. You want to be wowed by amazing technology. Neither Transformers nor Pacific Rim deliever. All you have are robots performing fancy human looking feats and fancy looking human weapons.Throw in your plot, and both series have decent plots, and voila m, giant robot movie. But that's all they are. There is no wow. They may as well have been standing still for the whole movie. Decent alien invadion plot with plot twists that can somewhat keep you guessing. Sci fi wow factor is almost zero. Robot wow factor is low. They feel like first generation robots, which is boring. The plot for the second story is not as good as the first. The fighting scenes are better which makes this one slightly better.In conclusion, decent action film, with robots as substitutes for humans.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

253,nosknut,"Amazing visuals, limited script",10,24 March 2018,"I have watched the 2013 movie more times then i can count (20+). It never gets old. The opening prologue is always entertaining and the action scenes never stop to amaze. The story is always engaging and characters are well developed in a script with untold depths.Uprising is definitely a movie i will enjoy watching just as many times, however it will lack something. The character development and the feel and story arc of the old movie. Despite the upgraded Yeagers with more human like movements aren't as epic as the old heavy duty Yeagers and it makes for a slightly less entertaining action sequence as i could just watch Arrow for that kind of fight scenes, i did enjoy the action very much. The plot is fine all tho slightly less revealing and engaging then the old movie. Sadly the movie takes the stupid-fan approach making everything very simple so people don't have to think. Logically it did make sense, however i would expect something more complex from this franchise. The kaiju were a disappointment as i don't go to Pacific Rim and expect my little pony colors. The Kaiju from 2013 were black sacks of goo and that was the whole point.The greatest disappointment however was their attempt to match Marvels humor. Marvel did it a few years ago and it got old very fast. At this point it simply ruins the story by interrupting well designed epic moments and turning them to ash. I was like a child when they attempted the startup sequence; The single greatest moment of the movie. What defined the first one, and they ruined it. Compelling people laugh is fine. Forcing them to laugh is not. As for the Scientist screaming meaningless lines at the battle and pointing out how unoriginal everything was ... I wanted to leave the room and scream however stayed for the action.All in all i think this was a great movie given it was supposed to be a collection of epic fight scenes. It delivered exactly what i expected from it and that is why i am giving it a rating of 10. I do however want to point out that Pacific Rim has the potential to be so much more. The characters all deserve their own movies telling us who they are and how they got to this point. Kaiju and the Precursors need to be explored extensively throughout many movies and we do need to see more of how the world was shaped by the events leading up to uprising.At this point, what we need is a live action Digital streaming show portraying the rangers and their daily tasks with a complex plot leading up to something that isn't anticlimactic.Message to the Pacific Rim Uprising creators:
Looking at the likes of The Expanse, Game of Thrones and Westworld, it is clear the a great plot does make more money then jokes. People like quality entertainment where they need to think hard to understand what is going on in combination with VFX and action that is basically engineering porn. Cheap jokes and simple plots do nothing but tare everything down..

In a time where we're being bombarded with superhero movies and cheap thrillers, it was nice to see a giant monster/robot battle. The same holds true with this movie. It was nice and it was different from what else is out there today. That being said, the movie was rushed and disjointed. It felt like 98% of the original cast was cast aside in favor of rebooting the sequel with teenagers (we don't even get a mention of the main character from the last film). The story development focused solely on Pentecost this time around and even then that fell through. All other characters were just forgettable, even Mako.The story itself was interesting enough. Kind of a far stretch, but something to grasp on to. It clearly sets itself up for a sequel, and, you know, I'll watch it because at the end of the day I enjoyed the monster battles. Hopefully, however, the sequel will have better battles than this movie because it paled in comparison to expectation, especially when you have to wait an hour just to see some fighting.Overall, I'd rewatch the first movie over this one any day.

The story is nonsensical and just goes all over the place, the characters are very poorly developed and written (what a pathetic waste of Mako), the soundtrack is forgettable (literally can't remember a single track), and the special effects, while up to standard with most Hollywood blockbusters, is definitely a step down from the original. The original Jeager cockpits and sets in general look a lot more realistic and interesting then this, which just feels rather cheap and generic, and the weight of the Jeagars and kaiju in the battles is lost, making this not feel like Pacific Rim in it's action sequences and instead feel like a Michael Bay Transformers movie.

Post credit scene? There is a ""beginning of credits"" scene.
If you haven't seen the first one, don't worry this movie gives you a quick recap in the first 60 seconds. At the same time, if you haven't seen the first one, watch it instead of these 111 minutes of giant ""Rock 'Em Sock 'Em"" robots.The first movie was not without its faults, but at least it was watchable. This sequel has none of the heart, emotion or intrigue that the first one had.What made the original film exciting and interesting was the newness of it all. It was a new take on the Kaiju genre. It was a new and interesting way to utilize giant robots. The aliens were cool. The doomsday anticipation was intense. The talent was impressive - Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam (as Mako Mori and Raleigh Becket respectively) were strong in their roles and helped viewers ignore any missteps the film made. And sadly, no sequel was ever going to be able to capture any of those things in the same manner. Even so, we expected more than the bad writing, hanging plot points, and poorly-developed characters and lackluster relationships that we got.Boyega is fairly believable as Elba's offspring - except for the fact that the character came literally out of nowhere. And while otherwise there's generally nothing wrong with his portrayal and he's decently charming, he alone does not have the Elba charm to carry a film surrounded by weak castmembers.Scott Eastwood (as Nate Lambert) is nothing more than a pretty face in the film. He doesn't fit his role as a soldier and commander and certainly doesn't play well off of Boyega in the role of frenemy/buddy. But the lack of chemistry doesn't stop there. Cailee Spaeny is quite impressive in her debut role as Amara Namani, yet the character ultimately falls flat due to the same lack of chemistry with Boyega. Her storyline basically amounts to a poorly copied reiteration of Mako's story from the original without any of the heart. And while the rest of the teen actors aren't necessarily bad, they are also not utilized much in the film, have zero backstories or character development and ultimately serve as nothing more than plot devices needed to drive robots. Even Charlie Day (as Dr. Newton Geiszler) failed to impress.There is one improvement from the first film and it is the cinematography. The fight scenes are beautiful to watch and are masterfully staged. Yet, without a half-decent plot, coherent dialogue or emotional stakes, they aren't worth the two minutes of occasional thrill. On top of that, this is the first film where we can actively say the sound mixing is genuinely treacherous - while the dialogue was nothing to write home about, we did want to hear it and that was made virtually impossible half of the time.Featuring: A female character that has no purpose except to facilitate an unnecessary love triangle that isn't even explored.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

266,augustkellerwrites,Wasted Potential,5,4 June 2018,"Equipped with an interesting setting and likable lead characters, Pacific Rim: Uprising is the epitome of wasted potential. Copping out at every turn and displaying a complete lack of trust in its audience, the script to this sequel immediately devolves into spelling out everything that its viewers need to know (either through blunt voiceovers or on-the-nose dialogue). This sets the tone for the entire movie as we're exposed to every cliché in the book (an exhausted plot line and flat supporting characters) as well as inattentive techniques (negligent pacing, transitions and effects). There may be some thrilling fights and the cool monsters but the entire ride rings hollow all the way through.While the design and potential of Pacific Rim: Uprising may have many wanting to give it a shot, its void of substance limits the film to only the shallowest of successes. In the vain of Transformers or the Fast & Furious franchise, this film has oodles of popcorn appeal and a major absence of craft or distinction. Pacific Rim: Uprising is fun at times but, just like its over-indulgent action sequences, the film is wholly unoriginal and bordering on insulting.Writing: 4/10

The acting is very satisfying. Tian Jing has a much more important role than she got in Kong: Skull Island and she delivered, to the surprise of many who have been bad-mouthing about her acting all these years. She should be given more credit and respect for her effort.
Great way for family entertainment and I certainly look forward to Pacific Rim 3 when (if) if is made.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

They are not in this movie, that's for sure.Horrible story, script, and everything else. It has nothing going for it other than viewers' hope that it will get better. It won't get better.This movie lacks substance. It lacks originality. It was made by people that do not care about what they do. They just turn-up for work and get paid, and that's it.Nothing more need be said about this bilge.Made with Chinese money. Just avoid all movies made by the Chinese. Avoid like the plague.

Having gone to see the original film twice, I wanted to remember that rather than a bad sequel.But this is actually almost as good. The only things I'd criticize are the prehistoric plot devices of a locker-room fight between two young pilots (will screenwriters ever tire of that?) and the absurdity of a young woman having built her own giant robot.It's also true that nothing here quite comes up to the originality (how could it?) and impact of the original. But the special effects are impressive, the direction moves along, and the plot is no worse.I'm giving it an 8, because there's no way to directly assign the 7.3 it deserves, and I'd rather round up than down on this one. And a thank-you to the producers.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Yet except for a promptly-forgotten Canadian TV movie, the numerous Gundam permutations have never been explored on the big screen (although a live-action...but sadly not big budget...adaptation has been just been announced; no writers, director, nor cast, so it might or might not exist in a few years). Practically an embryonic Marvel universe, rife with creative potential.Would that Guillermo del Toro had turned to this existing mythos for 2013's PACIFIC RIM--he surely could have worked kaiju into his script somehow-if only in service of creating a viable franchise going forward. A Gundam adaptation, or merely inspiration, could easily have resulted in a sequel far more satisfying than watching talented actors squandered on Steven DeKnight's insulting hodgepodge of inept direction, incompetent story-telling, and encyclopedic list of rando cliches.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

I was also surprised how well handled the character represented by Cailee Spaeny (Amara Namani) was, though its was also very 'cliche'.I took 3 stars away because there was a couple of big jumps in the movie that I just straight up noticed. Also, some pointless sequences and lack of character development. Not to mention the motivational speeches, cause what a military movie without them haha.

278,lockout-59506,Save yourself,1,11 May 2021,"This movie was so terrible. The main character Jake (Boyega) lands into a Jaeger after supposedly not being in one for years and immediately gets put into the field. First time out in a Jaeger gets a low sync between the 2 pilots and yet they released them into a highly populated area. Later on in the movie boyega tells the teen genius he met in the scrapyard that making a strong connection is the only way to drift, yet him and his co-pilot seemed to have no problems at a low sync level. The fight scene that follows is even more atrocious the details. They get their tail kicked but of course throw a couple of moves and at one point they use a gravity beam as an attack. They then completely foget about it right after when attempting to catch a falling helicopter, which they obviously didnt catch.Honestly, I should have turned this nonsense off at that point. It gets even worse. Fight scenes continue to boggle such as the fight at the off grid, decommissioned facility when the rogue Jaeger shows up again. This time it's even more loonier with both Jaegers full weight on an ice sheet that they currently break through during the fight but on purpose. At one point a Jaeger is lifted out of the water with both Jaegers slamming back down onto the ice without breaking through. Of course at the end of this battle, without any additional time or training in the Jaeger, the main characters Jake and his co-pilot Nate pull some magic move out of a hat an defeat the enemy with what looks like easeThere is just so much bad to say about this movie. The acting was terrible by most of the cast and the first 10-15 minutes looked like some post apocolyptic kidz in the hood nonsense. Speaking of kids, apparently they are the only ones who can pilot Jaegers and save the earth now. And when I say kids I truly mean kids as in teens. Even weirder most of the kids look like younger versions of the pilots of the first movie. There is also the confusion around the main character Jake. There was never mention of brother or son by marshal or Mako the entire first film that I can recall. I even skipped through the first movie to see if can find one but couldn't. When the Marshal gave his life at the end of the first movie, there was no ""tell my son..."" message or thought about him or anything. His existence is one of the weirdest parts of this movie! I would suggest not watching this as it will destroy any fond memories you had of the 1st movie.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

281,sullybolly,Not The Sequel We Wanted,4,18 April 2018,"TTL;DR: Pacific Rim: Power Rangers EditionIt's got better action sequences than Power Rangers but it's got the same feel.
TL;DR: A generic, cliche, checklist of a film that's aimed at children. It feels rushed and wanting to jump onto the franchise bandwagon, or at the very least, to cash in on its name. There's no heart put into it at all.It's got pretty looking things and has somewhat cool action sequences though. So at least it's got something going for it, albeit not much.At least it goes by quickly.
It starts off very unoriginal and pretty much maintains that throughout. The writing's just there to get the characters by basically. It feels very disjointed and awkwardly cut a lot of the time, like they are missing vital and interesting scenes for the plot. It's as if the film's in a rush to get to the big action sequences, which are the main highlights of the film, and that's not saying much, or should be the case. They aren't terrible sequences mind you, but they don't hold a candle to the first film either. Especially how the Jaeger's themselves are handled. It feels more like CGI fighting together, instead of big, powerful, heavy machines and monsters, like the cinematography the first film pulled off. The danger's not really there either.All of the characters are bland, like literally all. None of them are special. There are so many things about them that can be explored which aren't, and unfortunately because of this, unlike the Jaeger pilots I didn't have any kind of connection with them. Nor do they with each other. So anything dramatic gets lost in the wind. That's not to say that they don't have potential or that the actors are bad (well at least most of the mains ones), it's that none of them are fully utilised at all.It looks like a Hollywood budget film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's a movie aimed solely at children. A complete misunderstanding and veer from the first film. The people involved in creating this just don't have any passion or interest in the world, they just care about the paycheck and the norm/cliche that's good enough for kids. It's quite disappointing.It's definitely a sub-par sequel and I definitely have no enthusiasm for the franchise if it carries on this way. A soft reboot that follows after the first film and is lead by Guillermo himself would be much appreciated.A below average film that at least goes by quickly. Benefit of the doubt, 4/10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It had its good moments with character and some good acting at times but most of the time it threw random plot holes in too fast, for example:(LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD)o Why does some random 13 year old girl build a Jeager in a warehouse?? I mean, its not like she can lift several hundred tons of metal by herself in a tiny warehouse and then put it together, as if she knows what she's doing, and the fact that it works perfectly, even better than some of the bigger ones.o If there's Jeagers all over the world, where'd they go in the end? So, supposedly the Kaiju-Jeagers destroyed them all, but seriously? Every jeager in the world is taken out by about a dozen kaiju-jeagers? Plus, it would appear jeagers are super easy to repair, because they stinking repaired 5 of the jeagers that got destroyed in about a day or 2...o Since when did Pentecost have a son? It doesnt make sense at all that he wouldnt even mention this guy in the first movie, or why he acted like Mako was all he had, or why he wasn't present when his dad died? It would've saved a lot of hassle if they just replaced him as Raleigh Becket's son, because at least this would tie-in with the last movie.o So Newt makes a gigantic army of these tiny kaiju-cyborgs in the basement of a billion-dollar company with thousands of employees and none of them care to notice? How does he do this anyways? He built them himself? Plus the fact that they had their own opening garage doors??o Obsidian fury literally was just a kaiju brain in a jeager. It wasnt even ""infected"" like the other jeagers. So somehow, Newt manages to make his OWN jeager powered by a kaiju brain and NOBODY notices????Honestly though, despite all this, it was super fun to watch, and if you like movies like this it will definitely be one of your favorites.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

They should have gone a whole different way. On a side note, I did like scrapper but its very under used. The lead guy dropped out the class, but appears to be a good fighter, so they
should have made him a badass fighter who could fight more than one Kaiju at a time. Get rid of the kids recruits and just stick with the girl who controls scrapper. Keep the story the same until the remote control rigs show up. Make gypsy and scrapper work together, Scrapper to take out the energy source that activates the remote Riggs and gypsy to fight the Kaiju.

The original had far better character design, mood lighting, camera movement, etc. The amount of detail in the original was exceptional, all the way down to the monster's internal organs in jars. Amd important to the premise, the giants on screen felt larger than any other monsters we'd seen on the screen at the time. The monsters and robots in this movie could have been exchanged with those from any other movie that came out this year, they didn't feel large for lack of discipline by the director, and the character development would have fit especially well in suicide squad.

Because in 5 years they got all the time needed to make an awsome sequel instead of a movie fast forgotten once seen.I really hope the third movie will have more work behind it (please come back Guillermo del Toro).

Worry little about ""story"" or ""character developing"" (there is actually some) because it is the giants that take the center stage.

315,wilfmckie,Pacific Power Rangers Rim,3,8 January 2021,"Jesus wept, look how they massacred a modern cult classic. This is one of those sequels where you can tell from the opening titles and first few minutes alone that it's going to be dreadful, didn't need to exist in the first place and was written and produced solely for the sake of profit. The lack of the original writer-director, Guillermo del Toro, is a massive detriment here, as he had a clear smart vision that mixed various genres to create a gritty, engaging, at times terrifying, adrenaline-boosting, original blockbuster that had effort and mature imagination injected into it. Uprising meanwhile doesn't feel like a Pacific Rim film, but rather a generic live-action young adult anime that just happens to be set within the Pacific Rim franchise.Everything about this film sets it apart from the first one for the worst; the tone and mood, writing quality, visuals, colours, characters, creature and robot design. All the new characters are either cliched, annoying or underdeveloped, and the familiar faces are either dumbed down, disrespectfully discarded or entirely non-existent, which is a massive loss since the survivors from the original - Raleigh, Mako, Herc, Tendo, Newt, Hermann, even Hannibal - were well-written, had an emotional bond with the audience, and were still engaging and fit the story even if they were just side characters.In the original film, all the Jaeger pilots were muscly disciplined well-trained adults who looked like they'd spent most of their lives in the military and took the job of fighting Kaiju as a matter of life and death. Even Chuck Hansen, who was arrogant and egotistical for the most part, still took it seriously and didn't mess about when in battle. You could feel the weight and power of every punch or step the Jeagers took, and even Striker Eureka, the fastest and latest Jaeger in the world (up until that point), didn't feel too flexible or light. And whenever the Jaegers fought, they did their best to avoid damaging the city they were defending, keeping the fighting to the coastline in the water whenever they could and only utilising public property when absolutely necessary, like when Gypsy used shipping crates and a tanker ship as weapons and only did so because they were disposable and didn't endanger human life.Then in this film, they just get a bunch of college students, models, underage teenagers and twinks in colourful suits fighting against colourful Kaiju in colourful Jaegers that move swiftly and nimbly like something from Power Rangers, whooping and bantering as if they're on a rollercoaster, arrogantly flipping Kaiju off and destroying buildings without a second thought, causing massive damage without a care for how long or how much it will take to rebuild as if they're playing a virtual reality video game, thus completely eliminating all sense of seriousness and urgency in war whilst still attempting to come across as a film taking itself seriously.Furthermore, the plot is pathetically planned, the direction is embarrassingly cheesy, the Jeager designs are either copied from the first film or uninspired, the attempts at emotional investment are ridiculously mediocre, so many plot holes and questions pop up the more you look beneath the flashy action and CGI, and with the exception of John Boyega - who at this point is probably gonna go down as the most poorly used actor of his generation - all the performances from the newcomers are either stale or irritating, whilst the actors returning from the first film aren't even a quarter as enjoyable or committed as they were before.The only parts of this film I'll ever want to see again are the fight scenes on YouTube when the 'heroes' get their asses kicked, as this film had me legitimately rooting for the Kaiju by the final act.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

This movie is a big budgeted version of all those cartoon series geared towards kids. I wouldn't dare to say that I loved part 1, now that I have seen part 2, but I did. Part 1 didn't have the best story line in the business of SF but it did have emotional parts which we could connect to. Part 2 is all action with nothing to relate to the characters.Part of the movie is in Chinese and we know why. It's a huge market and having few of the characters will add allure. The third part, I'm sure, will have Indians and Japanese.Another problem is that the story line is predictable. You can assume what's gonna happen and all you can wait for is for the CGI to kick in.

As an example, compare John Boyega's inspirational speech bear the end with Idris Elba's From the first movie. Elba gave us ""The Apocalypse has been cancelled!"" The speech in the sequel was so poorly written and uninspiring, I can't remember a word if it.

honestly I would give it a zero, but the cgi still good, so this movie get one star for the cgi work.
although the cgi is good, however, no one should waste two hours watching this none-sense movie.
I consider myself a good critique, and most of my friends like my reviews about movies, and usually I can make a good points about a given movie or tv show.

Else stop here.Now, When compared with the first one which I rate it as a solid 10, this movie lacked a lot of original content. It borrowed a lot of action cues from the first one and tried to recreate it but didn't turn out as good. Also, a lot of original characters from the first movie completely vanished for no reason at all. If they were too pricey to cast. Then I can let that slide. My biggest critic is that the action sequences didn't have the weight like the first one did. The movements seemed much fluid than the first one. For robots and monsters that big it just seems a bit off. The last one is that the action sequences were all placed during the day. All the Jaeger's build and movements seemed plasticky.

Also the story-line was basic. Yes, they kept the same story as the first part but they added some aspects that to me was illogical; that it was forced.

Dare I say, I almost hated it. The second time I watched it, I appreciated the effort quite a bit more. What I liked: 1) The story makes sense, even if some of the moving parts don't. (See 1 and 2 of my dislikes.) 2) It does a good job of telling its own story while setting up the next film (I would suggest that the next be the last, for a fine trilogy). 3) Again, thumbs up for John Boyega. 4) I also liked the new Jaegers, especially Saber Athena. What I didn't like: 1) That love triangle. Yeesh! One of the best things about the first movie was the absence of any such nonsense. Please drop it if you make a third film. 2) I wish they hadn't given the female lead such a similar story and flashback (""drift"") scene to Mako's. Reusing scenes like that feels like a cheat and doesn't have the same impact the second time around. 3) O_o That awful, awful soundtrack. Pacific Rim's soundtrack gets me pumped. Uprising's so-called music?--takes me out of the action and makes me frown. Am I watching a Saturday morning cartoon or a Jaeger vs Kaiju movie?! Please, please get Ramin Djawadi back if you can, but by no means use any more of that noise I heard during Uprising!I do hope there's a third film with Boyega--and maybe a return of Charlie Hunnam's character--following through on the last scene of Uprising.

I enjoyed this more than the entire Transformers franchise.If you want to watch a clean, family-friendly film that will keep you excited by the character development and world-building, I think you'll enjoy this film. I gave it such a high rating hoping to help balance the criticism of the nay-sayers. I will say some of the science didn't make any sense, but it is science fiction! Take off the critics' glasses, suspend your disbelief, and have fun!People claiming the acting is bad are also not taking into consideration how amazingly multicultural this cast was. I was actually impressed with the chemistry between all of the different characters, and how much diversity there was. Remember that many of these people come from different acting backgrounds and were performing in a second language.This is clearly a film meant to draw in the Chinese crowd, but in my opinion it was much better than other similar movies (The Great Wall).This is the kind of film that looks like it was a blast to create, and the actors and actresses portrayed it that way.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Definitely not.Good acting, likeable characters, interesting story, and of course, more good old giant mecha vs monster action.To those calling it a movie oriented towards kids, you don't walk into a movie like this without hoping to connect to the inner kid in you. That said, only some of the actors were kids and even they didn't get as much screen time as some of the adult protagonists.The story was coherent and the script felt well thought out.

373,pajamawolfie,"Had a lot of fun, even if it wasn't a great movie.",7,30 March 2018,"If you want to see some giant robots punching other robots and giant monsters in the face, you're going to have a blast. Especially if you go with a bunch of 10 year-old boys. Or are one inside.If you're looking for a good sequel to the story and tone of the original ""Pacific Rim"", you'll probably be disappointed.As a sequel, this isn't that great. A lot of what was established in the first movie was thrown out the window or just forgotten about. The Jaeger program was disbanded because it cost too much while there were actually Kaiju to fight. Now the Kaiju are gone, so they built like ten more Jaeger, plus some drones? Stacker Pentecost had a son no one mentioned? Drift compatibility is much easier to attain now? A plus: While the character Raleigh Beckett is not in the movie, he's briefly mentioned but not confirmed to be dead. I seriously doubt we've seen the last of him.But on to the movie itself. It was definitely geared more towards the young fans. Most of the cast is teenagers, rather than the battle-hardened adults of the first movie. The fights are during the clear day rather than in the rain at night, which gives them a very different atmosphere. In addition, the runtime was under two hours. That suited me fine; it's a loud movie and I can only take so much monster-punching action in theaters before getting a headache.The plot isn't that important, but it's okay for a big dumb action movie. Promising cadet who was kicked out of the academy years ago for being a rebel is forced to train some new Jaeger pilots in case the Kaiju attack again. A big company is building Jaeger drones so they don't have to train cadets anymore. Something goes wrong with the drones, then Kaiju attack. The reason for this is briefly explained, then we get to that sweet Jaeger vs. rogue Jaeger vs. Kaiju action.The new Jaegers themselves were really cool, and tried to top the previous movie's Jaegers in every way. Liked the chain sword on Gipsy Danger? Well, get ready for Saber Athena, which has one on each arm. Why have a regular sword arm when you could have a chainsaw arm? Well here comes Obsidian Fury, with TWO chainsaw arms! And so on.So the action was awesome, but did I have an emotional reaction / investment in the story? Yes. Nothing life-changing, but I cared. There is a plot twist that I didn't see coming and it was a blow to what I'd previously thought about someone. A character dies and I was genuinely sad about it. I was actually worried when the biggest monster showed up and there looked like there was no way of stopping it. Main characters were likable. I was internally cheering when something happened near the very end to help the main characters save the day, even if it was a little silly. (You'll know it when you see it.)This is going to be a huge hit in China, not only because Transformers-type movies do well over there, but because a popular Chinese actress, Jing Tian, has a pretty big part in this film. I liked her character a lot.Which all leads to the nigh-inevitable third Pacific Rim movie, which they set up in the end.And, man: poor Tokyo just can't catch a break.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The story build up was average and at times slow. The climax was the only good part in the movie and that too was over extended. The fighting scenes were overly destructive and unrealistic, and nothing new was shown, The CGI was poor and overall experience of the movie was a disappointment.Overall I would say the movie is a no watcher and save your hard earned money and wait for the movie to telecast.(which will be very soon as this one wont stay in the theaters for long)",Pacific Rim - Uprising

I would group this film in the same group as transformers, or fast and furious films (Switch-off films, if you will) - if you go into them looking for faults, you'll find them by the absolute truck load, but go in with a blank mind, you might be surprised by how much fun you can have. John Boyega's charisma carries the film between the action scenes - his position and relationship in relation with Caliee Spaeny (who I was surprised to learn is 19 - she plays a 14-15 year old very convincingly), is established early on, and for the most part, works well. The supporting cast do what they have to - Scott Eastwood's character arc is predictable, but provides great moments of clarity. I believe this film is definitely an improvement from the first - the big action moments are far easier to understand who is punching who, the lighting and colouring has been revised so that everything happens in daytime, which is great. Would I recommend this film? If you, like many others, go to the cinema to switch off for a couple of hours, this is a great film.

Does this Pacific Rim Uprise or fall flat from its predecessor? My answer is yes:Del Toro is vastly known for the 'Dark Fantasy' theme in his films, so his move away from the Directors chair unfortunately takes away much of the 'dark mood' from the first. Solely focused on being a fun YA action movie, it seemed like a basic attempt on something with a much bigger premise.

I am aware that its not a 10 but given the poor understanding i think this film deserves a boost. First of all it was engaging through out the film yet there were small details missed like having literally no one to fight on the entire globe and using inexperienced children. But overall the cinematography had amazing quality, not being a fan of fight scenes I throughly enjoyed them specially the one between the rouge one and gypsy. The movie had some quality twists. Such as i thought the head of shao(?) to be the villian and how they introduced the true villian was WAY better than your average marvel movie. From the death of the monster to the beeping of the car alaram it was well constructed. I think its important to appreciate those little twists like the decieving last roar of the monster or the failure of the last escape pod. Everyone is capable of understanding those twists and in a way it is more educating in the overall film techniques than a simple and sort of dumbed down transformers movie.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

John Boyega is actually pretty damn good in it. He's a very charismatic lead, gives some great speeches and even manages to sell the utterly pathetic ""action"" scenes. He's not the only one, either. He's great, Charlie Day is really good as the bumbling sidekick turned evil mastermind, Adria Arjona is still too hot for this world, and even the token wunderkind engineer is one of the better takes, on that played out trope.Which make it so irritating, that all their good work is totally and utterly wasted in a film that simply wasn't worth making.Kinda makes me wonder what could have happened if you'd had this cast in a film with a script that wasn't better served as toilet roll.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

402,JusticeAction,"""How to Ruin a Franchise"" Pacific Rim: Uprising",2,1 October 2018,"Make no mistake, ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is an awful movie. Despite being a sequel, the world of the movie is set in a completely different universe with very little to no relation or connection to the original classic. Overall, this movie undoes and destroys everything about the original. The whole movie is a Rehash of the first film with a heavy addition of forced humor, childish jokes, and dialogue that is exactly what people who don't like Marvel Movies think all the dialogue in Marvel movies is like. Filled with Cheap heavily Lit CGI spectacles and characters that look like five feet tall toy action figures, with no focus or development at all on character, story, and importantly realism. All aspects that were very strong in the first film. Furthermore, there are some features that may entertain. It is a giant robots vs giant alien monsters movie, so if your interested in those things this could be worth a watch for you. But if your looking for a good Sci-fi action flick with good characters, development, writing, etc. I recommend you avoid this. Especially if your a big fan of the first Pacific Rim you will definitely loathe this movie. Personally, I couldn't make it through watching the whole movie because the acting and dialogue in this is really bad. However, Children will definitely enjoy this it's a movie geared towards kids. On a final note, this sequel dropped the ball big time, with all that was established from the first movie. I really believe the artists and filmmakers behind the making of this misunderstood the property they were working on, as well as the audiences they had. Which is really unfortunate since this property has a really great, interesting, inspiring, cool, world and concept. Hopefully there will be better fortune if any for ""Pacific Rim"" movies in the future. Because this somewhat of a sequel is a downgrade beyond a joke. (2 out of 10 Stars)",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Unfortunately, the sequel falls up short in all of those areas, and yet it is still a satisfying Sci-fi action movie that isn't as well received as other similar movies.On its own, Scott Eastwood and John Boyega do a good job carrying the film and doing the best of what they've been given. The set pieces are well executed, unique and exciting with a focus on Jaeger on Jaeger (robot) action that was sorely lacking from the first entry. The Visual FX are still impressive as the scale and dimensions are well represented. There's also a nice twist in the film that was hard to see coming.This is a solid movie that is well worth a watch for Sci-fi action and Giant Robot lovers.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

But this sequel is just terrible. I'm not even sure where to start, but I think the movie took a turn early on when it introduced a young girl (I'm not being a chauvinist, a young boy would have been just as silly) who builds her own Jaeger from scrap parts in an abandoned warehouse. From there it just goes downhill. I will admit, there was an interesting plot twist I didn't see coming, but it was far too little, too late. None of the characters were very likable, and the movie was ultimately very forgettable. I'm actually having a hard time remembering all the things I disliked about it, but I'm sure it's only because there were so many.

I wasn't going in expecting some movie about the human condition and the trials of every day life and overcoming adversity in dramatic fashion, nope I wasn't expecting that at all.
I expected to see some awesome fight sequences, great looking creatures (took a while to get to the real meaty stuff though) and fantastic cgi.
I'll admit that most of the humor didn't really work in the film's favor, it just wasn't very clever and at some points seemed extremely forced (the ending might just make you cringe).
But what was the purpose of the film? What was the intention behind it?
I think it accomplished what it set out to do, and bashing it for being something it never tried to be in the first place is just silly.
It would have been nice if there were more kaijus scattered throughout the film, but the climax of the film did boast one of the most awesome giant monster battles to hit the screen.
One thing I wasn't a big fan of was parts of Cailee Spaeny's portrayal of Amara, I salute her for giving it her all (I'm assuming), but there were scenes where she just didn't have enough grit, enough fight in her, parts where the actors around her were looking fierce and she just looked out of place.
Also the film could have done without all the Chinese dialogue and subtitles, we get it, they are Chinese and in China, speaking it doesn't sell it any more, it's 2018, we get it.

I enjoyed the special effects the music and a good story line in the first one. But, this wasn't as good as the first one. The special effects were great though.
But here I am giving 8 stars because I want to see Pacific Rim3 as well. This movie could have been a lot more then what it became. All the old characters were killed and new kids were not upto the mark. It seemed as if all the world organizations have gone out and the rein have been given to kids. And the kids were doing whatever they liked. The world was comming to an end but no other goverment cared to make there defence strong in the 10years of peace they got.I missed strong characters in the second part.

I felt that the film was a love letter for adults that love Robots fighting Aliens. The Monsters were unique and interesting. The fights were bone-crunching. The Sounds the Kaiju made were great.Unfortunately, Pacific Rim: Uprising loses the gravity and heart of the first film and is really made for kids this time round. There are a few ""cringey"" moments and it all seems a lot more light-hearted. The storyline is ok but it feels like there is a great film in there and it just couldn't get out. Perhaps they should have spent a little longer improving the storyline and having slightly less kids.Anyway, don't get me wrong, the action scenes are incredible and they are worth the admission price alone, but it feels like a missed opportunity. The ending also feels a bit rushed. 
I think I'll get the film when it comes out and just fast-forward all the talking bits and just watch the Robot action and Monster fights. That's where this film succeeds.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

435,Syphied,Pacific Rim: Down falling,2,3 April 2018,"There is not much more to add to the points already mentioned by other users reviewing Pacific Rim: Uprising 2018. But here goes.To set the scene, the film is set ten years after the first success of defeating the Kaiju and closing down the rift. With no purpose for older Jaegers, people use them for scrap hunting and the military for training. However, another not-so-surprise Kaiju assault now puts these newer Jaegers through a new brutal onslaught with the mission of shielding the fate of humanity. Whereas the first film was dark, well-paced and realistic, Uprising juxtaposes this by introducing lousy characters and filling most of its screen time with fight scenes that seem to be copied and pasted out of transformers. The mechanics behind robot fighting from the prequel such as skill of the pilots and the reliance on strategy have become obscure. Instead, the audience is forced to sit through the first movie retold from a child's point of view; there is no logic, no understanding of physics and no realism. And when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Ramin Djawadi's famous soundtrack clings to only two minutes of the entire movie. Although the end of the film has set itself up for a sequel, there would be no way on God's Earth that any director could recover the franchise from where it has fallen. Children will enjoy this film but be sure to bring a blindfold to prevent yourself from catching an eye infection.
 
To summarise, Uprising does not live up to the sequel, is too rushed and has no sense of realism.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

439,preparefives,Pacific Rim: Uprising is the second part of this film's series.,10,29 April 2018,"This part was made by Steven S. DeKnight in contrast to the first. Main actors of this film are Scott Eastwood, John Boyega and Cailee Spaeny. The genre of Pacific Rim: Uprising is science fiction. The action takes place ten years after the events of the first film in 2035. First part has the happy ending, but in the second part new adventures are associated with the case from the first part.
All story is connected with the robots, which were created by people to protect humanity from humanoid monsters called Kaiju. One example is Godzilla, who is similar to monsters in this movie. In the new part, people created a robot control function with remote control, unlike the earlier known robot control in a special cabin that was in his head. But this decision will be followed by irreversible circumstances. However, people created new generations of robots with unique weapons and abilities.
Pacific Rim: Uprising surprised me with the number of special effects, insane graphics - which was missing in the first part. In this film every detail was worked out and it is very good. Also, the actors were competently selected. In the film, there were no people who had already lit up in a large number of films of another genre, such as Mark Wahlberg from the last part of the Transformers. In some moments the film has a sharp plot twist that reveals and complements the main storyline of the film; also, these moments can't be always predictable.
I can say with great confidence that I recommend that this movie to science fiction fans in conjunction with the militant. But, I believe that it is best to start watching the film from the first part to understand the whole meaning of the film and all the ""Easter eggs"" of the film. I give 10/10 to Pacific Rim: Uprising.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Was it entertaining? Moderately. 
Was there decent laughs and a fair amount of giant robots fighting? Absolutely. I'm not sure anyone expected to walk into this film expecting to watch the next oscar winning cinematic marvel - it was basically what you'd expect an un-promoted sequel that no longer has the biggest pulls of the original film (Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam for those who were wondering). John Boyega is a loveable sass mouthed rebel youth come good, and banter with his smack talking little friend and Zac Effron-esque copilot make for an entertaining enough film even if there is little character development and a relatively predictable storyline. Burn Gorman and Charlie Day make for the best of the comedy and there's enough rock 'em sock 'em robots action to at least make you feel like you didn't get ripped off for your ticket price - even if you did expect the power rangers theme to start at playing at some point.

453,flipa-631-241575,Don't waste your time,4,8 April 2018,"I'm usually not one to trash movies in reviews but this movie sucked and people need to know that if they're thinking of seeing it. I loved the 1st one but they butchered this sequel. The plot line was flimsy, they didn't try very hard coming up with a plausible transition into this film from the last. It was a failed attempt at a ""next generation"" type scenario but the next generation was completely different and far inferior to the original. Instead of assembling a new squad of jaeger pilots they decided to go with kiddie cadets, and In doing so effectively turned an action blockbuster into a teeny-bopper flick. It looked more like Enders Game 2 than Pacific Rim 2, very weak character development, poor character interaction, lousy corny dialogue and a VERY predictable course of action. Whereas the original pacific rim was an action packed adventure this one was like the Mickey Mouse club. On top of that the movies main conflict sucked and wasn't explained well & when it was brought to light it was a reach at best, not a plausible connection it was outta left field the writers dropped the ball. The movies only saving grace was the final 30-40 min action sequence, it was visually pleasing with decent effects, but again that said it was underwhelming In terms of its relevance to the story as a whole. This was the old paper bag over the head punch In the face type deal, they lured you in off of the success & popularity of the 1st one and once they reeled you in they delivered a crappy final product. Unless you're 13 you will be very dusaoomted, nothing like the 1st it's bad",Pacific Rim - Uprising
454,Dreamer_Disease,Pacific Rim: Uprising Or Something,6,1 April 2018,"Maybe uploading, up to something, upchucking but the movie wasn't that bad, was it; usually, you give me a hero I can root for, John Boyega as Jake Pentecost. A pretty spunky brunette Cailee Spaeny as Amara Namani and plenty of Jaegers and Kaiju and you would think I'd be a happy camper, but not happy, not wowed, but okay another big monster movie. I feel like John Boyega is trying to distance himself from Star Wars, so let me say that this is not the way to do it, but he makes an effort.Try harder, and I don't say this just to him but everybody, the whole time I was sitting there thinking something was missing, short one Charlie Hunnam, one huge chunk of backstory, and yet they have found a reason to make one more of these movies. Somebody had a plan alright, but it wasn't a great movie. I didn't think much of the first one, that's why I didn't see it in a theater, but it got me to watch this one, if you can get past wanting to be dramatic, your inner child will consider this film pretty decent.As Fandango is now sated, whatever were they thinking with this, it's just not there, I mean any of it, one of the things that intrigued me about the first one was the relationship between Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori and Raleigh Becket, where they didn't go with the love story angle. No worries here, no love story but no story period, we know the Kaiju are coming back, but the excuse is flimsy at best, that's just what it was an excuse. Honestly, that could've been it, making more money from China and Japan but big robots, big monsters, that's about it, and trying to appeal to women, African-Americans, and Asians all at once.Let's not forget about the kids because Power Rangers surely isn't fitting the bill anymore and some adults need to remember that they were once fans of several anime shows starring robots. Maybe they figured if Independence Day: Resurgence could make a quick buck then this will work, and so it has, and I might even get Pacific Rim: Uprising if it's cheap on Amazon. So in the tradition of all monster movies, yes they come back for one reason or another, and it's up to a few young kids to save us, the NRA might like this movie if they were into building giant robots... I shouldn't go giving them ideas. Not like this movie had any and maybe I'm perhaps too hard on this film, but anger is one thing, and disappointment is another, and that's what I was, I hate when people say I have potential, so too this movie had great potential but couldn't make it.Okay Jake Pentecost who was never mentioned in the first movie, even though his dad won the war, even kid in Independence Day: Resurgence had a bit of a tale, anyway Jake and his adopted big sister Mako are trying to lead the fight with the return of the Kaiju. That right there was a significant plot hole, but I'll save that for spoilers, like the reason ""Gipsy Avenger"" was fighting ""Obsidian Fury,"" I told a friend if I went into porn I am so stealing that name. Speaking of relying heavily on or straight up taking, did Scott Eastwood as Nate Lambert try to give us some of that Fast and the Furious family speech, tugging on our heartstrings?It's all the movie had to go on since the story again just wasn't there, if you cut out the Kaiju entirely and went straight to Jaegers fighting Jaegers; oh right, Transformers or who remembers Robot Jox which is doing worse than Pacific Rim: Uprising, seriously people? Besides not having any real story or backstory and relying on tired clichés, visually it's stunning if you like your CGI and there is plenty to go around and the battles, well I did fill like a kid again. Though unlike when I was a child, and I missed an episode of Power Rangers, I wouldn't have been too upset if I skipped this but yes I'm glad I saw it. If only to be reminded that if they do make a third one, I think I'll wait just a little bit longer.It's not dull, it's entertaining but maybe don't get your hopes up and try not to overthink it much like the Jaeger names. Do they only pull two names out of a hat, with the following exceptions of Gipsy Avenger the hero, Obsidian Fury the evil Jaeger and spoiler alert Scrapper which was truthfully the most realistic name? I can't remember any of the names on the soundtrack of this, but I still remember the trailer music was a mix of songs, and that was badass, saying for the record.Using the Fandango rating system, I'll give Pacific Rim: Uprising a three out of five because I liked it, disappointed, maybe a bit sad but by no means would I say I hated it, it's an easy way to kill time and I wouldn't pull out my phone. So as you go to buy your tickets for this, I'd advise you not look any further for there will be spoilers ahead but this movie does have my blessing but oh why couldn't it have been better for Pacific Rim one.Charlie Day as Dr. Newton Geiszler and Burn Gorman as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb were back again and while I deny most of this lack of a story, there is a great twist with Dr. Geiszler, which kept me in the movie. Was Mako Mori so replaceable that they just found Tian Jing as Liwen Shao and flipped her from villain to hero so quickly, and you knew Mako wasn't going to make it, robots, helicopter yeah, how much did this movie take from Independence Day: Resurgence? As for my favorite scene, probably Amara Namani, and not just because I have a thing for brunettes this is the first thing I've ever seen Cailee Spaeny in and all her scenes with John Boyega or her in Scrapper were good all around.So that plot hole and maybe it's dumb, even if you have no wars to fight you still have a military, but that's just it. The Kaiju were gone, but you still need an army of Jaegers, and you're building even more than were in the first Pacific Rim, taller or more does not always mean better. Then you want to take this army and put them under the sole control of one corporation, when has that ever not spelled trouble in something like this. Then we have the smart guy that turns into the bad guy and the bad guy suddenly becoming all good and what not, I guess, and of course, you had to throw Scrapper into that fight to only show-off some.I wouldn't cut this off if it were on TV, I just wanted to know, and the sad thing is I still don't know enough like maybe I need to look for a book or a comic. Only if I don't do it for The Walking Dead, I won't do it for this movie. Take your kids to your couch, but if you have money to burn and want some fun movie experience well know Pacific Rim: Uprising Or Something.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

456,naum-rusomarov-944-460795,A Kaiju-sized middle finger to del Toro's Pacific Rim,2,28 March 2018,"The first film was an ode to Japanese mecha anime and Kaijus. It was serious, loud, sweet, and perfectly executed -- the ultimate guilty pleasure. This film is none of that, it's a sloppy attempt at making money on the glory of the first film.The storyline doesn't really make any sense, the characters are forgettable and stay undeveloped throughout the entire movie, and for some reason the CGI and compositing are atrocious. In one of the scenes, you can clearly see that John Boyega is acting in front of a green screen. The color palette and physics of the film have also been changed; while the first one was slow, dark, and gritty, thus showing the massive scale of the Kaijus and the Jaegers and their battles, the sequel is bright, fast, and has an unusual blue tint. Now the Jaegers for some reason can do backflips, bringing the film closer to Power Rangers and the Transformers. Finally, some of the panning shots in the film were obviously done to show the new robots in their full glory. If you take into account the underage cast, this film is nothing more than a two hour long toy commercial. I did not like this film, and I hope this is the end of the franchise. I don't even know why they made a sequel to the first film. Two stars for the effort.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

If you want big moving serious acting and drama with billboards and such this isn't the one. But if you're looking for your run of the mill monster movie with monsters and fighting robots then this movie is just what you need. The acting is great and the Yeagers are cool. There was just enough story to keep the movie moving along. Hoping to watch #3 even though I doubt this one will have a big enough following to make it happen.,Pacific Rim - Uprising

467,designsbygus,The rare sequel that really satisfies,10,13 April 2018,"Let's start on level ground here. It's made quite clear in the original ""Pacific Rim"" that the Breach was closed. Yet in the trailer, we see Jaegers fighting kaiju. I was concerned about how this sequel would explain that, wondering what the new source of the conflict would be. Would the filmmakers just cheap out on the plot and basically say, ""Huh? Oh, yeah, breach was never really closed. Our bad.""? Thankfully, no; what we are given instead is a stunningly imaginative and well-crafted plot which intelligently explains the reappearance of kaiju, while also honoring concepts set up in the first movie.One thing movie-goers have complained about for several years now is the too-long, too-revealing trailer, the kind which gives away the best jokes, major plot elements, etc. Did the trailer for ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" (PRU) show us Jaegers? Of course it did. Did it show kaiju? Well, explanation for them aside, this is a ""Pacific Rim"" sequel, so that's to be expected. Did we see any familiar faces? Yes, Burn Gorman's Dr. Gottlieb clearly makes an appearance. Yet even with all these, upon reflection I can say that in my opinion the PRU trailer gave nothing away.Gorman's performance in PRU is quiet enjoyable. And I was impressed with the range shown by John Boyega. I don't mean just the range he showed in this movie; I'm referring also to the range he's capable of from one movie to the next. This young man created a persona for PRU that is strikingly distinct from his Finn of the recent ""Star Wars"" sequels.""Pacific Rim"" took the concept of ""kaiju vs mecha (the Jaegers)"", rarely seen outside of anime, to a new level. With the bar set so high, PRU really had to deliver to be more than just a ""more kaiju vs mecha"" money-grab. Deliver it did. I found myself deeply engaged as I watched the plot unfold. The filmmakers clearly put thought and effort into this, and in the end this collection of twists, turns and switchbacks adds up to a richly satisfying movie. I readily give ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" 10 out of 10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

469,iamiraclelingcoran,Disappointing.,4,26 April 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising is such a huge step down from its predecessor at every level. I thought the first installment was a good movie - very entertaining and visually impressive. It wasn't great, but at least quite good. This film, however, attempts to complicate its own story with absurd twists and plot points that it trips on its own creations. The dialogue falls flat, and barely any characters are fleshed out. After walking out of the cinema, I couldn't even remember a single name from the newcomers because no character stood out as interesting or compelling. There is room for enjoyment in this film (especially when robots are fighting Kaijus or hostile robots or Kaiju-robots), but the audience's detachment from the protagonists of the film makes the experience a passable one. The cinematography is nothing special, often sloppy. The visual effects are quite good most of the time (except for some very obvious green screens), yet it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first. The action sequences are mostly forgettable, and doesn't live up to what its predecessor has established. Overall, this film is a total disappointment.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

For most part, it is. However, when compared to the first it lacks that certain reverence for its inspiration which shows most apparently when watching the action.Character scenes aside, since the first was no winner in this department either, what Pacific Rim did amazingly well was craft gargantuan mechs and monsters that we can remember. Uprising almost feels like the director was following a checklist, but forgot to watch the first one to see how Del Toro put it all together to make it special. The result is a 'cool' and 'badass' robot v monster fight scene collection that ultimately fails to resonate.As a sequel, it also fails to cover any new ground. This is most likely due to having to basically cast a whole new group of characters, give them scenes rather than simply starting off where the last left it. Consequently we don't really get too much more info in terms of what or how or why things happen, only that the Kaiju are coming again and we gotta stop them.Pacific Rim Uprising fixed the pacing issues from the original, but thats about it. Otherwise, more doesn't always equal better sums it up pretty well.

By comparison, any of the Transformer movies (which are also monumentally dumb) read like the great works of Shakespeare (and, well... Megan Fox.)""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" takes the franchise to a whole new level of silliness and camp.

498,ihavemagicpants,Not as good as the first but still decent,6,31 March 2018,"Before you see the movie know... this movie can't even begin to follow the original. It was nearly impossible to top that movie. So many people are expecting Del Toro and that's just not who the director is so don't walk in expecting the same visually spectacular world he creates because won't see ANYTHING near his realm, sadly.
So, that being said...The beginning 1/3 of the movie just was trying to tie the stories together and that is a huge part that made it boring. it jumped so fast into things with the new characters but still not actually giving you an actual backstory somehow. The undevelopment of the main characters' back stories makes it difficult to care about them as much as you do for the characters in the first movie. They had an amazing opportunity with the tie ins but it ended up flopping into the movie rather than tying in. There was a few attempts at helping make them come to life but without the beginning introductions and back stories it made it seem unbalanced and odd. You do feel a development happening with the 'bad' characters and who you believe is behind it. So, it does keep your attention. Once it hits 2/3 of the movie I feel like it took too long to get into the story of why and how they are in the newest situation. The fight sequences could have been done SO much better and because they're pretty much all daylight and in the city it loses the depth of the fighting abilities at times and feels like a transformers kids movie. When it's all said and done I did find it decent. I want to rewatch it because I feel maybe I missed some things that made the movie better. I didn't hate it but it just wasn't the follow up I hoped for. The concept and story behind the second movie is very interesting but wasn't developed properly, in my opinion. If you're someone who wants to see it but has really high expectations but likes seeing/ hearing fights on the big screen verses home tv and you can get in on a discounted time/ day it's not a bad watch. Stay in the theater until the movie is done. Otherwise I'd say maybe wait for a rental. It's sad seeing so many people are rating it a 1 or 2. People expected too much from a director with no similarities in style. If people saw it as a movie on its own, lowest I could see is maybe a 5.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

500,erik_eklof,An action movie as it's meant to be done,8,24 June 2018,"Pacific Rim: Uprising, and more broadly, Pacific Rim in general, is perhaps the epitome of action cliché. It delivers on all the fronts an action movie needs to deliver on. I feel that most people rate this movie unfairly, as they come into it with the same mindset as they would with a Kubrick thriller. But I came to watch giant robots slug it out with giant monsters, and boy did I get what I came for. This movie, like any good action, delivers its feeling primarily through the action, not through the storytelling or the plot. However, I must add that Pacific Rim 2 didn't actually do that bad a job in either of those departments. It was relatively readable, predictable, and, as mentioned, cliché, however it did a good enough job to keep the viewer (me) questioning my theories throughout the duration of the film. The final ending could have been paced a little better in my eyes, however. It felt as if they had run out of script at the very end and were filling for time.In conclusion, I felt that too many of the critics came into this movie expecting a Léonesque action drama one could analyze and critique to no end. In order to enjoy such a movie one must take off their coat, replace their whiskey with soda and take a careless dive into a bucket of popcorn. Ease off, this is the kind of movie that fills you with that same childlike creativity and imagination that I can tell some of these other reviewers have probably lacked for quite a number of years.If anyone needs me, I will be in my study, doodling Jägers and Kaiju to my heart's content.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
501,DaLawrence,"A comedy, with no actual stakes",3,18 June 2018,"INITIAL PACIFIC RIM 2013 BACKGROUND REVIEW:
Okay, so I had not seen the first Pacific Rim (2013) up until last year. It simply passed under my radar. Having seen it though, it was allright with one aspect that really stood out: the CGI. The graphics, movement and sound of the Jaegers were depicted in such a way, you would actually ""feel"" or rather understand how massive they were and how strong their punches could be.
The story was kind ok really, nothing too exciting and the characters were likeable and a bit developed.PACIFIC RIM UPRISING ACTUAL REVIEWThis time around...i was kind of laughing here and there, sometimes quite loudly.
The only thing I understood from the introduction is that smuggling Oreo and Ketchup was a thing...like seriously?
Oh yeah and you have that little girl who built a fully functional Jaeger (albeit not the biggest) from scratch. It was kind of far fetched, but alas, I let it slide.We fast forward a bit... the Oreo smuggler and the little mechanic are now back in the pilot program. In the first movie we had quite a bit of time assigned for the pilots' training and their hardships that came with it. Here...we get like 5 mins of ""I can't drift with the stupid brain."", a speech and boom...we got 7 new pilots.
The characters were bland, they barely had anything meaningful to say to kind of give us an insight into their background.The fight scenes were....ok, though not as good as in the first movie. The Jaegers seemed more like toys, too agile for their scale.The kind of plot twist with Newt being the actual culprit in the Kaiju reappearance was a bit of a surprise to me although I kind of expected something in that direction since they showed us ""Alice"".The final stand though...oh...my...God...who even thought it was a good idea. It was way too convenient. You had a rocket booster too far...you know what...here's Scrapper...oh and did I mention he can now weld? Escape pod not working...don't worry, Scrapper to the rescue. Also correct me if I am wrong...but if I recall correctly, Gypsy Avenger was nuclear powered, right? So...launching her into the atmosphere and then slamming her into a Kaiju wouldn't set off the reactor?Anyways....this movie was clearly bad compared to the first...too many plot holes and convenient circumstances, acting was kind of emotionless, CGI was worse than the first movie.I'll give it a 3 for the Oreo smuggling. That put a big dumb smile on my face.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Good things cost money, guys. And the first movie was a blast, admit it!Now to the sequel part.I do want to say about the actors first and about the overall feeling and chemistry between those characters in the movie. I do not have anything against John Boyega...but his acting is so poor You do not even know what kind of a person he actually is. He looks like a thug who does not have anything to him....and here they tell us, this is the son of Marshall Pentecost, a Ranger and a fully trained Jaeger pilot... I don't believe it. I just don't. What happened with him? Why is he in the slums, why is he like that? What the hell? We do not have an answer to that... And the actor does not help us with understanding either... Just another Finn but in a Jaeger.The script and the overall plot is just so missing here, it feels like a cartoon for children.

The young cadets, that are showing their middle fingers to a still living Category 4 (while there is another Cat 4 and Cat 5 around) Kaiju - really awesome((( *sarcasm*
The previous part and the books showed us, that almost every Jaeger pilot (even a veteran) is damn serious when it comes to even ONE Kaiju, regardless of their Category. Here we see marry superhero team of Jaegers having fun with Kaijus.... all that while monsters are trying to destroy the whole world.What I felt after watching this film - is 1/4 of amusement and 3/4 of disappointment. The overall franchise had such a big potential, but yeah - it needed some effort. The filmmakers decided to go the easy way. I'd even say - the easiest of the easiest ways. That is why this movie turned out to be so cheap-looking(( You just don't believe in what is happening on the screen. It looks childish and dumb. The seriousness of the situation is just not there - everyone is happy and easy-going. The Kaiju's are being opposed only by 4 Jaegers, not weaponry or aviation. ALL the Jaegers in the world were either located in one place and reduced to 4 machines only...or the other Organizations holding Jaegers just did not care... Cause well, the previous movie showed that the Wall did not work and Jaegers were needed. So yeah, several years should have been enough to build some more Jaegers in order to secure the Earth.Anyway, the movie just did not receive enough attention and work in order for it to be full as the previous part. It could be a blast, but it isn't...",Pacific Rim - Uprising

514,jshmartes,"All style, no substance",5,25 March 2018,"I loved ""Pacific Rim"" when it came out five years ago. Not only did I want to see giant robots fighting monsters, but I also wanted to see a great film in general. And Guillermo Del Toro certainly delivered, with great visuals, good plot and good characters. I didn't mind a sequel if there was any coming out which it certainly did, but to my disappointment, Del Toro would not return on the director's chair, and instead focused on a fairy tale film set in the Cold War. Of course, that film would be ""The Shape of Water,"" which won him for Oscars including Best Director and Picture.I was fine if there was another director, as long as he or she knows what they are doing with the source material. Of course, ""Uprising"" has a director, some returning characters, and new characters to introduce us to the next chapter of the Jaegers.Then I saw it...If you are looking for a movie with dumb action, this is the movie for you. If you are expecting something that would be on the same line as the first film, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.I am disappointed with the movie. There, I said it. I wish it were the contrary, but it is, in fact, the former. ""Uprising"" is nothing more than a cash grab to sell toys and make money of the ""Pacific Rim"" name. The plot structure is holey, half of the characters were bland, next to nothing, and the action is staggering.I knew I wasn't expecting much since no sequel can surpass an original unless if it were a miracle, but I really did not like this film. I, unlike other people, try to find some depth with movies like these. Sure, it's a monster film with a ridiculous plot, and you're there to see the monster fights, but if the action feels weightless, empty, just random things throwing at the scene, then it's just bland.I don't want to compare the film with the first movie, but when you rewatch that one, you feel a sense of scale, weight, and overall depth. The first film was enriched with world-building, some interesting character arcs, and the Jaegers and Kaiju feel different and unique in their own way. This film decides to ditch everything that I just wrote in the previous sentence and climbs a broken ladder filled lousy plot structure and terrible characters.Whenever there is a moment to introduce a plot-point, to at least take a breather, the very next minute an action scene happens that comes out of nowhere and has no build-up. There are no moments of reflection as to what is happening in the plot, nor any point of character development; it is a fast-paced plot that is focusing too much on getting from point A to B to C all the way to Z. Whenever there is a moment where there is about to be an epic scene, that epic scene gets tarnished by tasteless humor. There is one scene in the film that made me question humanity, I don't want to say what it is, but it involves an old Youtube viral video. That is all I have to say.The movie introduces the concept of evil Jaegers, which I thought would be great to expand a further mythos to the Pacific Rim story, but it just didn't work. They were pretty much wasted. A potential plot point, and it doesn't get expanded.Let's talk about the characters for a moment. I'm going to talk about the new ones first, and the returning ones in the coming paragraphs.John Boyega's performance is fine and likable, but his character has no depth whatsoever. The only emotional depth that his character has is that he is the son of one of the principal characters from the first film and that he is somewhat related to one of the returning characters, that's it. No change, no self-reflection, he remains the same man with a rebellious attitude that resembles Will Smith's character from ""Independence Day,"" by cracking immature jokes and always claiming to be the sexiest one of the bunch.A character doesn't have to be dynamic, he can be round, but if he is flat and is the one to bear the weight of the story, cut him out.Scott Eastwood's is meh, I don't know a thing about his character or his background; the only depth that he has is that he use to be Jake Pentecost's friend before they had a falling out. No change, couldn't care less.The new young cadets training to be Jaeger pilots, absolutely abysmal and forgettable, except for one character, Amara, played by Cailee Spaeny (performance was genuine); she has an ""arc,"" but she can get into some people's nerves. Amara is also a Mary-Sue in the beginning because somehow she built a small-sized Jaeger all by herself. Here's a fifteen-year-old girl who somehow knows about robot engineering and makes one all by herself with no help whatsoever. Give me a break.There is one other cadet who I thought could be interesting but she has no backstory at all. She is supposed to be Amara's rival who was forced to work with her. Here is a moment in the film where there could be some development or bonding. Nothing. One moment, the rival hates Amara, in the next scene, she's giving her friendly advice. What? When did this happen? Also, the cadets somehow learn to control the Jaegers with no trouble or training in the third act. Are you kidding me? Hell, I didn't care for either cadet if something happened to them.Only three characters from the first movie come back. The two scientists and Mako Mori, the Japanese Jaeger pilot. Dare I say, they were the only good parts worth watching the movie. Problem is that one of them is wasted and the other has something to do with the plot that I find so idiotic. Also, there is no mention as to what happened to the previous characters or as to where Stacker Pentecost's son Jake was in the events of the first movie. The movie forces you to accept it.OK, let's get to the nitty-gritty, the special effects. The Jaegers are Transformers, and the Kaiju are just a big clay deformed mess. The designs are not unique, there is no different personality between individual jaegers and they feel like toys, weightless. I kid you not, one of the robots literally looks like it came from the Transformer movies. The kaiju is very hard to look at; they looked the same, and they have no stand out features that make them memorable like the first film. They merge together to create a bigger kaiju, but that doesn't make it any better.To sum up ""Pacific Rim: Uprising,"" it is a rehashed version of ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" and I mean, literally, a rehash. The plot points are beat-for-beat the same, and if you, my friend, have seen ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" then buddy prepare yourself to a derivative mess.In conclusion, I wanted this movie to be good, but it's not. It is a soulless attempt for money. A waste of time. If you are looking to see a dumb action, this movie is for you. But for the rest who hope for a great film in general, don't bother.""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" gets a 5 out of 10.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
515,Luca_Rachiteanu,One Big Mistake,6,2 June 2020,"Story/Plot:
This sequel offers a story with a far more
complex plotline. The plot twist is unexpected and believable. The return and use Kaiju is quite clever if I might say.Casting:
Before mentioning the elephant in the room, I also have to mention the acting of Charlie Day and Cailee Spaeny (no need to mention the already acknowledged John Boyega). Their performances are spot on, always fitting well with the character and situation; their roles, in my humble opinion, were the hardest to handle.The CGI problem:
While both the script and casting was done impeccably, the main problem presents itself with the CGI motion and choreography of action scenes. The first movie understands the motion of the fictional machinery it depicts and creates the choreography accordingly, for example the weight of a moving robot which is the size of a building and how would such a robot move around (I assure you that not easily or lightly). Pacific Rim: Uprising fails to recreate the eye-catching fight scene methods used in the first movie and thus fails to entertain because it lacks the quality which made it successful. Hope if there will be a third movie, the production team will be considerate of our wishes.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Weird, he never mentioned it in the first movie. The only child i know from Marshal Pentecost is Mako.Lost realism, in the first one you can see how Del Toro tried to make it as real as possible. 2 Pilots tried to move a giant robot, it's mass should've made them hard to move, also jumping isn't possible with mass over 1000 tons. In the first one they even need a rocket throster on their back to jump.Some weapons are just plain impossible or not making sense. Check the first one you won't see a weapon that isn't impossible. I know it's already impossible to make giant robot and their weapons in the first place. But they show you in the first movie that's likely possible. So yeah it's like ""screw physic!"".Not make you feels like a pilot. This is what Del Toro tried so hard in the first movie.Jaegers looks similar with each other, part make them different from each other is color and weapon, not the entire body of the Jaeger.A kid, make a Jaeger from trash. What is this transformers?Lost sense of hugeness, they're big, huge, their height is almost the same as a skyscrapper. Playing with depth of prespective give you feels how big a Jaeger is, now it's gone.Pilot are not in sync. As in movement and when they're hit. Also too much talk, aren't they have to drift or already in drift when they're near base? When you're already in each other head there's no need to talk much.Pilot's suit. Jaegers aren't made in the same place. So are their suits. Also the suits is like some plastic glued on black suit.Just because it's already 10 years technology is like 50 years advanced. Don't make it as reasons to make an impossible physic.The Uprising looks like only rely on franchise's name to sell their products.
The first movie could be enjoyed by anyone from from any age, but this is like only for around 10 years old kids. Especially these teens cast, make it feels like Power Rangers.Also i thought they were going to show Hannibal Chou, because he appeared in the end credit scene.

518,Chimar99,"From an Adult - Watch it for the action and some pretty good performances from ""kids""... Makers, r u listening?",7,22 May 2018,"My first review here, seriously had it with IMDB'ers bashing of movies.Yeah, this movie has kids, but so what? At least the first half makes good use of them. Expect the second half to be cheesy.The action however is good and John Boyega puts a solid performance - at the very least he is comfortable with himself. Scott Eastwood is good too, but I think he will do better in tougher roles - my brain almost tricked me into seeing Clint Eastwood in a few scenes. Yep, he has inherited his father's looks and also tends to play like him every so often. The girl (Cailee), too, delivers a solid performance.I LOVED the way these Jaegers have been designed - Much more sophisticated compared to the first movie. They look and fight like badasses for a ""kids movie"" (the main Jaeger and the rogue one). The fights with the rogue Jaeger are definitely well done - 9/10 for that alone.As a man, I am naturally drawn to hardcore but involving action and adrenaline. That is how I de-stress every so often. Movies requiring more thought can be put off for other times. If you can digest some of the cheesiness and get over the fact that there are a lot of kids in this one, I recommend you give it a try to unload the stress at the end of the day, have a laugh or two, and enjoy decent action.Are the MAKERS listening?I am a marketing consultant, and like in my field, I genuinely hope the makers of all films come on IMDB and read the reviews every so often, at least the sensible ones.... or am I being naive? The story in here could have been improved upon big-time, the cheesiness discarded (for example: Boyega's character conveniently concludes the Jaeger's intended destination, kids suddenly are in-charge and fight better than the veterans who go down like ninepins, not much depth in how the story unfolds, etc.), more justice can be done to the original theme - Jaegers with sophisticated weaponry beating the heck out of equally defiant Kaijus in hard won and believable fights, as well as some mature emotional drama and loss.This movie doesn't know what audience it is targeting.Seems like in order to get kids onboard, you are turning away your main audience - mostly guys like myself here from the first movie.Hollywood, out with the cheesiness!",Pacific Rim - Uprising

525,laughing_stockings,Better than the first,8,6 June 2021,"So I read a review that complained this movie was a copy of the first movie. I want to point out that the plot is different. The character arcs are different. That basically means it's not the same movie.The first movie showcased all of Guillermo's signature style. It had strong creature concepts and visual design. He is good at world building in that one part of the world is very well built, while the rest of the film's universe is undeveloped all together.It also suffered from his greatest weaknesses in that his characters are shallow and copy tropes.That is not to say the first one was a bad movie. I just wished it did things differently to be better.This movie fixes one of the greatest flaws of the first movie. It sets up expectations of a grand fight between the Jaeger and the Kaiju, but most of the fights end quickly. I got excited for nothing. Who can remember the Typhoon Jaeger and its triplet pilots getting killed in less time than the film spent introducing them?The characters in this movie feel more balanced. Boyega's character, Jake, is the son of Elba's character in the first movie. Jake was trying to live up to his father's legend.A new main character introduced in this movie is Amara. We are introduced to her as a Jaeger parts scavenger and tinkerer with unique talent.We are introduced to aspiring Jaeger pilots, who are training for a specialized role in a world where Jaeger pilots weren't probably necessary any more. They haven't figured things out yet, but they're giving it all.As the world tries to move on, a new threat strikes from nowhere, and suddenly the Precursors (the bad guys from the first movie) and Kaiju are back.For all of the things this sequel does better than the original -- complete character arcs, an intrigue subplot, themes of courage and loyalty, a more balanced contributions from the minor characters -- it deserves a score higher than a 5. I give it an 8, because it stays true to the universe and to the characters, while having a more complete plot and better stories in the fights. (That last kill, though, should not have been telegraphed.)",Pacific Rim - Uprising
526,VideoStreet,An embarassing sequel,2,6 April 2018,"The introduction of characters so generic you could find them in any other ensemble action film. There is the leading man, the son of Idris Elba's character from the first film, who is bafflingly given the identity of hoodlum rogue which contradicts his heroic, military background that was established in the prologue and is only there to have a forced ""you could have been somebody"" (there is an actual line of dialogue that says this almost exactly) character arc. There is a feisty newcomer who is suitably annoying given how juvenile she is (somewhere around thirteen years old) compared to the adult tone and subject matter of the movie, another forced archetypal jock rival whose adversarial attitude towards the protagonist is never given any real explanation, and a token love interest who the main two male characters obtusely squabble over. This love triangle, both thankfully and bafflingly, is dropped from the story almost immediately and is left inconclusive. Two of the best characters from the first film, the characters played by Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day, return here and tease some potential charm and personality in the film.
Unfortunately, the writers have no idea what to do with Kikuchi's character and she is killed off early on. Day's character has a larger and more embarrassing role than in the first film. In the third act it is revealed that Day had been working for the monsters the whole time and the audience is asked to believe that he is some kind of evil mastermind. It's understandable how the writers would want to beef up Day's role, as no one else in the cast has even an ounce of charisma, but there is a reason he is cast almost exclusively as a goofy comedic side character.The film is directed by Steven S. Deknight who was one of the showrunners Daredevil and Angel, genre action shows that worked well because they focused on soapy character dramas rather than excessive special effects and action. I was worried that the larger budget of a big Hollywood production would steer focus away from character development and interactions and go for pure spectacle instead. There is actually a lot of attempt at emotional grounding, but the efforts come too late in the film for the audience to care and the characters lack the depth or pathos to reach the kind of emotional peaks seen with both Daredevil and Angel. The opening set piece of the film had no robots or monsters, which is the entire conceit of the series, and instead there is a generic heist wrong scenario which can be found in any number of other action films. This is followed by another paint by numbers chase scene which, while utilizing some special effects and robots, could easily be inserted into any other Hollywood action film. About an hour into the film there is one almost good scene. In the cadet program, with the little kid character, there is a fight between her and an aggressive older girl with a little bit of martial arts and some genuine emotion displayed by the actors which is unseen throughout the rest of the movie. The setup is typical for a scene in a military boot camp but the young age of the characters makes it a bit more unique, with the tension placed on soldiers in training amped up with adolescent angst. The problem is that the story is focused on three separate narratives: the main protagonists conflict of fighting rogue robots and monsters, the cadets' interactions in robot boot camp, and Charlie Day's story gradually building towards the final conflict of the film. Nothing gets the attention needed to develop in any interesting way, everything is glossed over from one cliche and uninteresting plot point to the next.A big problem with the main conflict is that the robot fights are boring. The first film was colorful and focused on the gigantic heaviness of the action. In the sequel, everything is grey and cold and lifeless. The fights happen mostly in flat, wide open spaces, where the size of the robots is meaningless. The action only sort of comes together at the very end where they fight in the dense metropolis of Tokyo: how they didn't think do something like this earlier in the film is beyond me. This scene also delivers the only ""oh, cool"" moment I had which was when several giant monsters morphed into an even more giant monster. Somehow I feel like this was the first thing the writers thought of when coming up with ideas for this sequel and just never came up with anything better.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

532,Sonneilon,Big robots vs Giant monsters = mindless fun,7,30 March 2018,"It's almost mindless because it's so easy to sit there and compare it with the first movie AND several other movies. We watched the first afterwards and I'll admit, the original has more style and personality to it. Those in the know knew Hunnam wasn't returning. Fine. Neither did Will Smith for ID4:2. Unfortunately 3 other characters didn't show up either; Herc Hanson (ok 4 if you include the dog), Ops Tendo Choi, and Hannibal Chau. The movie is a departure from the first, which is what the storywriter planned (per the IMDB trivia). Now check these analogies (work with me here):-Boyega hunts for usable scrap in destroyed Jaegers. Rey hunts for usable scrap in Star Destroyers. (SW7)
-Boyega tries to 'save' a parentless female. Finn tries to save Rey who is parentless on a Tattoine wannabe planet. (SW7)
-The new marshall is Chinese (as opposed to Herc hanson from 1st movie?). The leader of operations in Independence Day: Resurgence was Chinese. (ie; chinese leaders in sci-fi movies)
-The Earthlings will take to the fight to the kaiju in a future movie. The Earthlings in ID4:2 will take the fight to the locust-like aliens in a future movie. Only difference? You don't get a dorky scientist saying ""We're gonna kick some alien ass!""
-Scrapper is a bakugan. (anyone whose kids were young around 2010 might remember this toy and remember the lil robots roll up into balls)
-Eastwood and Boyega's characters have issues. In ID4:2, both pilots have issues with each other. And in both cases, they make up.
-Cadets training scenes feel a bit like cadet scenes from Ender's War.
-Like Nolan's Batman, most of the action takes place at night. Or in the dark. 
There are a ton of other analogies that I can't remember off top of head. But it feels like Uprising pick and pulled from Star Wars Ep7 and ID4:2. Maybe because Boyega helped produce and SW7 was fresh in his head?To be fair to the movie,the story progresses from the science-side of things. If you can get past all the obvious references, influences and analogies, the movie is just fine. Nothing award winning here. And Boyega doesn't use a utensil to scoop out his sprinkles.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
533,giorgionov-1,Pretty good for a sequel,7,5 April 2018,Honestly I had no expectations. They could have made a terribly unoriginal sequel but they had the balls to shift the tone to a more humourous one (honestly the gritty tone in a movies with aliens and robots it's ridiculous) they came up with the neat idea of kids pilots and the fights are more fluid. The are some missteps here and there but you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs I guess.,Pacific Rim - Uprising
534,Straighthate,"Not as good as the original, but entertaining still",8,18 April 2018,"Pacific Rim was a milestone to me. Since the times of Robot Jox we didn't have any giant mech-related movies, and though the movie had its drawbacks it was awesome imo. Del Toro and his team created an immersive experience for all mecha fans.
My expectations of the sequel weren't so high as I already knew del Toro dropped the project. However, I must say I enjoyed it. Some people were frustrated due to teenagers becoming jaeger pilots, but I believe it to be a hint or reference to well-known Evangelion. Sadly, the jaeger action scenes are scarce, I wish there'd be more of them. First part of the movie is a bit tedious but then the film picks its pace. 
Plot was surprisingly good imo apart from not so interesting self-made engineer girl line.
CGI are awesome, new mechs are awesome, action scenes are fascinating.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

540,bluedemon_dragon9,Misses the point,2,18 July 2021,"Pacific Rim is one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, this sequel made no attempt to engage with any of the concepts that made the original compelling. The connective tissue of Pacific Rim was the emotional bond between the characters: the movie wasn't about giant robots, it was about desperate, flawed people in a seemingly impossible situation slowly learning to trust and support one another to achieve something greater than themselves. The giant robots were just a cool aesthetic vehicle though which to tell a very touching story. Pacific Rim Uprising was just a movie about giant robots, and it didn't even do that part well. The jaegers had none of the character of the originals, and the fight scenes were mostly visual noise frequently interrupted by cuts to other, even less interesting scenes.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The difference between fight scenes at night vs broad daylight may not seem like a big deal, but for some reason it really stood out to me. It just feels like this one was more geared toward kids, and potentially selling action figures. I didn't hate it by any means, but it really lacked what made the first one so unique, and intriguing to me.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
543,InsignificantReviews,A disappointing excavation of an awesome monster universe,6,1 April 2018,"Any sequel or trilogy or whatever comes after isn't just a movie for me, it's a continuation of a story that has a good foundation to build upon. Guillermo Del Toro's (GDT) Pacific Rim created an awesome universe with subtle details about the past that kept the audience guessing and theorizing about things not explicitly elucidated in the movie. I don't think GDT expected to create a universe, I would guess that his idea was to make a stand alone monster movie with sufficient justification for the characters actions. This is why I think they (producers, directors, the head people) shouldn't have excavated Pacific Rim. Or at least not in the cheap way that they did. Overall, this movie is forgettable. I honestly don't remember half of what happened and I'm a fan. The dialogue isn't special; sometimes preachy and naive. The characters were weak; I didn't care if any of the new characters turned into paste. The only character I cared about in this movie was a continuing main character from the last movie. The visual affects are spot-on for a well lit monster fight and that's expected for a $150 million movie. But the setting for these fights were too giddy for my taste. In the first movie, most of the fights were in semi lit conditions and in water, you could make out what was happening and the fear that something might jump up out of the water was palpable. In Uprising, the fights take place in concrete jungles during the daytime; you can see the Jaeger's with all their power fight these beastly Kaiju. Lots of distruction, mayhem, trite team rallying, and just basic comic book style fights. There was also a stark tonal shift on this movie; this is not the dreaded and dark Pacific Rim setting, it's relaxed and sporadically attempts humor. I guess this is the movie telling us that everything is sunnier now, and this negates the intensity attached to any monster-action movie.Now that they've rebooted Pacific Rim and hinted at more movies in the future, I hope they at least expand Kaiju and Jaeger mythology if anything.I watched all the trailers and kept up with the hype and lore. The movie's main plot points arent revealed in the trailers but the reason most of us will go to watch Uprising, the action, is. Uprising is exactly what you expect it to be. A monster movie with above-aversge fights and nothing else. I knew this before going in, but I left disappointed because Uprising felt like a clear money grab.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

From the start PC2 is off on the wrong foot, where PC1 had a powerful intro that set the stage for an action blockbuster, PC2 limps into a first act that I would have trouble remembering if I had written it myself. Gone are the heroics of Gypsy Danger nobly fighting on with just one pilot, here our hero is presented as a plucky 20 something with daddy issues and his sidekick is a whiny teen mechanic.Everything I loved about the first film is absent from its sequel, Guillermo Del Toros direction is clearly missed with almost no personality given to any of the Kaiju (a paltry 3 of them with no distinguishing characteristics) and Ramin Djawadis original theme remains yet is only played once, over an hour into the film, with no additional score at all!John Boyega shows just enough personality to stay awake while the rest of the cast simply turn up as well, Idris Elba knew he wasn't starring in Shakespeare in the original but at least he had the decency to ham it up a bit. The exception to this is Burn Gorman and Charlie Days portrayal of bickering scientists and friends, however even this is destroyed with the reveal that Charlie Days character is actually the villain being controlled by Kaiju?!?! It's weak. The third act does too little too late to redeem the film, with three personality-less Kaiju morphing into one really big personality-less Kaiju which the heroes have to effectively suicide bomb to overcome. Overall this is a clear cash grab that even has the balls to tease a third film, despite being nearly devoid of any merit at all. 2/10",Pacific Rim - Uprising

It still captures the essence of the Pacific Rim franchise with ample of magnificent Robots punching Monsters scenes with some beautifully choreographed fights.

But also other characters like Herc Hansen we didn't get to see. Also I think they could have done a lot more with Mako Mori. But anyway, the original was more serious, it was a bit over the top but not too much. While Uprising was very over the top imo, especially the fight scenes. Uprising also suffers from weak character development and tries more to be a Transformer-like kids movie.I think they should have just let Del Toro direct Uprising as well instead of DeKnight, not that DeKnight did a bad job, just that Del Toro could have done it better. Hermann and Newton were a bit cringy in the original but I think that was done intentionally, while in Uprising it felt like they had a bigger role to play, which I liked a lot.Still I don't think it's a terrible movie, it's just not really that good either, while the original was imo a pretty decent movie.

574,lln_books,More Transformers than Pacific Rim,5,26 March 2018,"*****This Review Contains Spoilers****
This is a movie of missed opportunities. Why do sequels today insist on disposing of characters you love from the originals (and/or vilifying them)? Why do they believe bigger, bolder FX substitute for solid storytelling? Why did they think ""Pacific Rim"" needed to be more like ""Transformers""? The Jaegers move with ridiculous ease and their weapons are unrealistic for a movie whose tech has supposedly only advanced 10 years from the clunky cruisers of the original. They come with loudspeakers so the pilot's voice can book like Optimus Prime. They even have a Bumblebee in the form of Scrapper.Biggest problem: I just didn't care about the new characters as much as I did for the originals, mostly because no real time is spent developing them. I would have rather seen a storyline of Jake and his adopted sister, Mako, reconnecting than have Mako shoved out of the picture to make way for the Jake/Amara storyline. How much more interesting would the movie have been if Mako had been given the storyline that instead went to the new character Shao? What a waste of a beloved character. There is a romantic triangle that goes nowhere again because no time is spent showing us why we should care about it. And there is a whole line-up of new Jaeger pilots who are mainly only distinctive due to their being absurdly young. I watched the final battle with a line from ""Phineas and Fern Star Wars"" stuck in my head: ""We're children and they're letting us fight. That's how hopeless it is."" Neither did I like what they did with Newt (nevermind that they never explain how he pulls off everything he does in the movie).As I said, it was an okay movie, but how much better it could have been with Del Toro penning the stories of the characters he clearly loved. I would have liked to see his ""Pacific Rim 2"" . Please, Hollywood, stop giving us popcorn sequels to Prime Rib originals!",Pacific Rim - Uprising

I'm not even going into the details because its all been said on other reviews and I am just too pissed off to type all the BS acting, actors, killing off a main character, Mako like she was nothing and on and on. The only good thing about the movie was the battles but even those looked too overly cgi and not like the first movie. THe fans were waiting for something great but all we got was a slap in the face and a waste of money. I suppose if it was geared toward children and they got a kick out it. Good for them.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
596,battleshipcreeper,This movie disappoints me,2,3 April 2018,"The story that the writer and director were going for I thought was pretty good. The story that was shown and executed. Was terrible. The movie had lack of explanation. They didn't explain the bugs that attached the 3 kaiju together wasn't explained at all unless I missed that part. They didn't really explain how the scientist was infected. All that was explained was he kept drifting with the piece of the brain from the first one. The teenagers were just annoying and yes I understand teenagers are annoying because I am one. After the attack on the base. The jaeger that was on the ground right next to all the kids was completely destroyed. They would never have enough time to fix it the way they did. With any amount of top mechanics in the world that would not be possible in there time frameThe movie could've been easily another half hour to 45 minutes longer if they would've just explained things. Like they never said what jakes ""record"" was unless I missed that too. I apologize and retract my statement about this if I did but I never heard anything about his record unless towards the beginning When mako asked Jake to be the second pilot of jipsy Jake was completely against it because he hated jaegers. But then she just says ""do it for me"" and I understand sibling love. But seriously. Right when she said that. He was immediately like ""ok sure"" like no. They should've done more convincing with that The fight scenes were dull. The only one I liked was the fight between jipsy and the jaeger with the kaiju brain. And even that fight scene could've gone longer. The end scene when jipsy dive bombed the big kaiju just was a little to much like transformers 2 with devastator at the top of the pyramid I overall was so disappointed with this movie mainly because the first one was so good. It was one of my favorites for a while and still is. But this movie is just bad",Pacific Rim - Uprising
597,koltenbuster,If you haven't seen the first one in awhile you might be confused. But a great movie!,7,6 April 2018,I haven't seen the first Pacific Rim for about 2 years. So at the beginning I was confused. But this movie was not so bad. I like how they used John Boyega. He's becoming a great actor. The scene when there was the machines fighting each other was so action packed. Theres some moments that get you on the edge of your seat.,Pacific Rim - Uprising

600,aymanx-boy,First movie in cinema First review,8,11 April 2018,"I want to share my experience with pacific rim
I call it an experience coz it's my first time in cinema
The first time I watch a movie in Imax cinema
2 days ago I said that i don't like kaiju mecha movies
I find them outdated 
But with a simple word called faith
I found myself sitting in front of a movie called pacific rim
My first intention was to pass some time before my uncle comes
I wasn't even intending to finish it
But then it starts
First of all Imax has great potential i tried Vr but 3d glasses and a giant screen makes it far better
The sound effects are great too
For the movie I stick to my word that kaiju mecha things are outdated
But I was tricked the whole movie coz i tough that it was based on an anime a manga or at least a book or a novel to search for at the end of the movie
Making names and types for the robots and monsters was the best part of it
it makes you believe that this movie belongs to a universe 
But it was not so big salute to the director coz it was original
The story was cool especially when death comes I was touched by that 
To sum up it's my first experience in watching in a cinema and in writing reviews my opinion shouldn't be taken into consideration coz it was based on feelings more than logic
But here is what I learned, always try new things and watch what u don't want to watch but do it in good cinemas so that at least if u don't enjoy the movie enjoy the effects
And sorry for the long post",Pacific Rim - Uprising

And then the new cast fight a giant CGI monster at the end of the movie, and destroy Tokyo whilst doing it, therefore killing millions of innocents. Erm! reminds me of Man of Steel. I sound very negative, but, at least I can say that it is a fun movie, I guess I'm just a cynical person, who criticizes everything.

603,ekomo-90822,Great actions and special effects,9,9 June 2018,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. This is an Sci-fi action movie that's entertaining, albeit w so so storyline. But then again, storyline is not the reason we watch action movies in general, or is it?The acting, while not Oscar material, is pretty good. There are some surprises, humor, great fight scenes, and nice climax (though not as grand as the first one). The first one has more things happening, but a bit darker. This one is more uplifting and happier, maybe that's why the takeaway isn't as strong.

610,frankmcsheffrey,Woeful,2,1 January 2019,I suggest you miss this film if you are able to count to 10 without using your fingers.

Yes, it's stupid and fast paced, but so was the first and that was made by the great Del Toro, who's fingerprints are still very much all over this film if you look hard enough; just look at the names alone!Just watch the film, turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.

PACIFIC RIM UPRISING 
#pacificrim #pacificrimuprising Here's my review without giving away anything . Unfortunately Im quite disappointed with this film . Almost 1/2 hour into the movie and the scenes were almost hard to watch - the main character is an Amazing actor - John Boyega who was one of the producers of the movie (ONE ! Of the producers) who acted very well given the script he was given . I applaud his performance for what it was worth. But again , it was kinda embarrassing watching the first 20'ish mins of the film as it had not much connection with anything to do with the main plot, they should have at least maybe turned back time and showed the audience who may have not seen the first one a recap of what has happened to get to the point they are in the movie now. Secondly, it was centred around too much kids , this is PACIFIC RIM 2!!! Step up! Why down by putting children as the forefront of the film - I thought it was really quite irritating and Derek wasnt a fan from the beginning of filming and I gave it a chance but tonight it was not good. The only one I was ok with was the main little girl but also that was just being nice . I thinking this movie should have stayed in the adult realm and less about kids. To make matters worse - they didn't develop the characters so they went into battle after a scene of a couple of them failing a practice run . And not to mention killing a very prominent actor from the first film just to get an emotional rise from the audience.3rd- not all movie need sexual content - but they had to add an unnecessary triangle of the 2 main guys and a sub-main character in the film - again quite annoying!Also this film has 4 writers! 4! and 14! Producers! Wtf ! too many hands making the soup spoils the soup!! Also not to say anything but 2 of its writers are women- who dont come from anything remotely close to writing a script like this and the movies' director is straight from a television background!! Again wtf!!! How did these people get picked for this job for this movie , Im dumbfounded how the industry picks people to do certain jobs they are not qualified to do. Especially for a sequel the box office smash! So disappointing 
I REALLY WISH GUILERMO DEL TORO DIRECTED THIS LIKE THE FIRST PACIFIC RIM - but alas he was probably focusing on the OSCAR WINNING MOVIE - THE SHAPE OF WATER - which was awesome I loved it!The ONLY SAVING GRACE Of this movie was the Special effects - THE JAEGERS AND THE KAIJU - it was VISUALLY SPECTACULAR! And the fight scenes was AMAZING! Minus all the human garbage that was a 10/10 for me ! Gypsy danger and Saber Athena and even the the drones and kaiju was CRAZY BEAUTIFUL ! I wished the plot followed the gorgeousness of them... Even the end kaiju was overpowered and alot of the scenes was not really realistic in a sense..Like I said the original actors did a good job for what was given to them, the new actors also did a good job - but the writing and plotline and script was unfortunately awful. I am a fair a honest and kind judge - i will give Pacific Rim Uprising 5.5 out of 10Im sure Ready Player One will kick its ass- at least they have less ppl dabbling in that soup so I think its more straight forward- at least I should hope so since its a Spielberg film !Reviewing that Monday I hope if they have the green light for Pacific Rim 3 after This subpar sequel - they would do a hell of a better job staying in line with a story and script and get a director with experience with doing FILM!

I was hoping to get something of the same, but what we got was far worse than I could have hoped for. I thought the acting and writing was terrible. The overall plot was disappointing and for a movie about giant mechs fighting giant monsters, there was hardly enough of it.

You'll see this to be true with in the first five minutes of the show and wonder if it's going to get better but that's because you were optimistic!It gets worse and worse and worse like a real low grade director took over the sequel and didn't know what to do so anything that cut a laugh or looked good he merely added 10,000 of the same thing and then figuring he was going to lose his core audience he catered to the youngest audience . I actually think high school students will laugh at it and be insulted by it.If you acted in this movie it is nothing to put onto your resumeI was upset that I didn't have a chance to go to the theater to see it because I liked the first one pretty much 75% but there still was too much bravado, and character development work compared to the actual thrill and science fiction of the thing. I'm not looking to like the characters or find one that cracks me up or some brokenhearted love story I'm looking for adventure and science fiction and these movies don't deliver it.If you like RoboCop and you saw all of them then this is worse than RoboCop 3!If you saw that and you understand my comment you're not even going to start this movie .It does however have one redeeming thing.I saw it on cable so I spent zero dollars and I still feel ripped off !",Pacific Rim - Uprising

655,ignis_vigil,"Feels more like a ""B"" movie",3,9 May 2018,"I loved Pacific Rim, it was fantastic. I've watched it a dozen or two times. This, this was disappointing. There were parts that had their moments, but they were few and far between. The main characters were...eh...at best. Very predictable. As was the story line. All the cadets were just mirror images of their adult counterparts. The Jaeger's seemed under powered. Their weapons were lame. It just felt like the entire movie was playing on the nostalgia of the first. The main characters were just mini versions of the adult counterparts from the first. Make your own decision, worth the watch if you're bored. Just don't pay much to see it. This seriously hurt John Boyega's career in my opinion. I hope his next movie is something better written. Sad that Idris Elba wasn't part of it, and they killed off Rinko Kikuchi's character right out of the gate. And where was Raleigh? No mention of him what so ever.

667,mendo-1,"Ok sci-fi movie, major failure as a sequel",5,21 March 2018,"God knows I was excited. I had Kaiju-sized expectations about this movie. Guess I am Kaiju-disappointed now.I don't mind all that much about the plot-holes, the first movie was pretty silly too. Still, if only that : during the Kaiju wars, humanity didn't have the ressources to build and maintain anymore Jaegers. Now that the war is over, we're having more active Jaegers than ever. And the PPDC has become some sort of global army/police.Beyond that, I went to see the movie for the Jeager/Kaiju action. About 80% of it has neither giant robots or giant monsters. Just people, having not-that-interesting interactions. Plain Godzilla syndrome. And for all that, the characters are still less engaging and developped than in the first movie.Believe or not, there isn't a SINGLE Robot/Monster fight before the last 20 minutes. And then..it's bland. It takes place in broad delight, in plain sight, while the night atmosphere was so quintessential in the first movie. Similarly, a single Jaeger defeated multiple Kaijus in Pacific Rim. Here, four of them charge together, and they're just...bad. Can't kill a single ennemy.As for the final move that eventually kills the super-Kaiju (pretty rad, I have to say), it is both quite anti-climatic and very dumb (a smaller Kaiju survived a direct nuclear explosion, this one is killed by a falling robot, really ?).Uprising fails in everything that made Pacific Rim great. By comparison, there's almost no giant fighting, and what little there is is bad. I guess it's somewhat okay as a sci-fi movie that is marginally about giant monsters (which, again, you don't see for most of the movie) and (pretty bad) giant robots. As a sequel, it's a major letdown.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The things offs are : these teenagers has zero experience drive the jaegers yet they seem suddenly know how to perform the moves of each Jaeger. There's part which they should include previous rangers to taught them all of that. 2nd is the plot was escalated way too fast. It's like seeing Transformer in 2012 movie setting. You gotta tone down more and please remove ""the processing to advance"" scenes in the movie. This is action post apocalyptic movie, not a commercial marketing campaign trailer.

676,htjmartin,Chinese production = Chinese quality,1,1 June 2018,"It has gotten to a level where it is just ridiculous. First the story forcibly introduce all the Chinese characters, then apparently they save the day at the end. You can really tell that this is a Chinese production where they just want to insert their heroism into this pile of horrid crap. 
The acting, the directing, and the story, all deserve only 1 star. Although I won't blame much on the director. Since if you know how the film business works, you will know that the producers actually get to say what to be made or not, and in this case, Legendary Pictures, in 2016, bought by the Chinese giant conglomerate Wanda, has been producing lowest quality contents ever since, just like any other Chinese influenced Hollywood movies, specially forcing their own language and trying to make their own heroes. 
This is just sad, seeing what could have been a good movie ruined by yet another Chinese production.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
677,nickohlsson,"It's a sequel - nothing more, nothing less.",7,16 January 2019,"I'm not a critic. I usually don't wrote review for anything. Why? Because I lack the sense of analytical objectivity needed to be a critic. Well, I could if I would but I don't want to. I watch movies entirely because of the entertainment value and don't think too much of it.But for this film I decided to write a review. I decided to write a review not because it's a great movie but because it isn't. It's a good movie indeed, but not a great one. I had a blast watching it! I've rated it 7/10 because I was entertained by it. And as it is right now the movie scores a 5,6/10 on Imdb and 44% on metacritic which makes it seem mediocre at best. And this is what I wanted to address in my review.I've read alot of the 1-3 point reviews and while everyone is entitled to their opinions I sometimes feel that I can get easily misled by the negative reviews aswell as those who rate 9-10s. When a movie scores below 6/10 on imdb that usually signals for me that It's a bad, or atleast boring, movie. I nearly didn't watch this movie because of the low score. I was planning to see this movie in the theatres but held off because of the low rating (it was right above 6 after it premiered). After seeing this movie and reading those reviews I feel that much of the negativity towards this movie is because of expectations. Sometimes I don't understand the expectations people have on films. My lack of understanding does not mean their wrong in their critique. On the contrary they review their experience as they should, as I will now:This movie is a direct sequel to 2013 years Pacific Rim. The first film, directed by Guillermo Del Toro, entertained me. I've watched it several times and if it still entertained me as much the next time I see it I will rate it 9/10 here, because of the rewatchability and entertainment value. I don't give 9s too lightly and 10s are only for personal classics and/or movies that really digs into the core of my soul. I, of course, compared it to the Transformers movies (because of the giant robots and all that) but soon realised that there's more to pacific rim than the mere comparison. I liked the darker blue tone of the movie and that it felt, to me, a bit more 'adult' than the films based on hasbros collectibles, which I also like quite alot.Most noticable in this new film, Uprising, is the change of tone. Gone is the darker shades of blue and instead we have a film which seems and feels much lighter and brighter. As you can tell I'm writing this review purely based on how I subjectively percieve this film. Next up is the focus from grown ups to teenagers. So Yes, there's definitely a shift in tone and quite possibly also when it comes to target audience that might turn you off if you preferred the feel of the first film. Compared to the first movie this one might come off more as a wannabe Transformers clone, which some may like and some won't.Next up is the script and the formula. You won't really find any surprises here, nor will you be without the cliches. This film resuses the same formula often seen in other sequels, from Transformers to independence day: resurgence. If you expect anything new you won't find it here, yet it differs from the original movie because of It's changes in tone, cast and direction.Speaking of cast. Here you'll find nothing outstanding. I personally felt that there were more to the characters in the first film but the cast here do their job. This is the kind of film where I usually don't judge the actors for their acting as long as they work well in the film, which I think most of them do. Actors in movies like this usually don't have too much to work with as the focus usually lies on the visual presentation and special effects. But they do their jobs and it works for me.Here you'll find giant robots smashing Against eachother in environments that guarantees an escapade of buildings come tumbling down like if they were house of cards. Giant alien beings once again invades the world with anything but peaceful objectives in their aim. And I enjoyed every bit of it.If you're like me, someone who doesn't expect anything more from this kind of movies than pure brainless, but visually (with emphasis on CGI) delightful, entertainment you wouldn't want to pass this one up. These are two Hours that I could have spent on much worse films. I had fun while warching it and kind of regret not seeing it in the theatres. It's not as good as the first one but for someone who wants more of the same, with a well known formula, it works well as a sequel. Also, while the first film works well on It's own It's obvious that this one is building up to yet another sequel. So this will probably just be the film leading up to a 2 hour showdown between mankind, Jeagers and The Kaijuns (quite possibly in alien territory).",Pacific Rim - Uprising

680,lucazauli,Nightmarish.,1,30 March 2018,"Four talking points.Overall.
This movie belongs to a recent born herd of movies who are embedded, almost drowned in all the references and quotes that, in the writers' mind, should make the spectators squirm in uncontrolled happiness. 
That may work if the story can hold the movie together, and that's just not the case.
The number of this movies is increasing and it's a worrying thing.Pacific Rim : Uprising unceremoniously throws you in a Episode VIII-ish carousel of ill-placed, badly executed references from the previous movie. The poor writing lets boredom seep into the movie through planet-sized plot holes that quite admirably manage to furrow in disbelieving thought even the dumbest kid's brow.
A lacklustre CGI, along with a annoying cinematography, a truly forgettable soundtrack and a horrific screenplay contribute to create a completely obscene movie, which is so boring that watching the grass grow for the rest of your life would seem a far more palatable activity than give this movie a second chance.Pacific Rim : Uprising is a collage of dull scenes quite badly glued together, a movie which is tragically deprived of whatsoever emotional impact. A twelve hour straight Pac-man gameplay can create more hype and has a far stronger emotional impact than this movie.A total disappointment.CGIPacific Rim's CGI was truly something. It admirably managed to convey the power, the bulkiness and the mechanical presence of the robots, the raw power of every hit, the slightest nuances of any movement made by a giant robot that was driven by humans. It was a rare jewel.
In Uprising the CGI is disappointing. Lacklustre, cheap and badly melded with the rest of the scene. There are no more three-dimensional, giant robots made of moving, bruised iron plates, or solid, bulky steel giant mechas with a weight, or some realistic, a bit sluggish movements.They look like toys, their parts, gears and plates plain and stiff, barely moving. Robots are light, unrealistically quick and agile models. 
The design of the robots is pretty lazy and uninspired, and really reminds me of some cheap plastic robot action figures.
Their textures are also quite cheap.
This gets a little better with the Kaijus, they are honestly cool.CinematographyThe dark, ominous tones of the first movie completely disappear. While this is not an intrinsically bad thing, it contributes to create a blindingly white, overall fake, aseptic scenery, that while it's understandable given the setting of this movie, in my opinion is irritating.
The already excessive holographic colour fest of the Jaegers' HUDs of the first movie is unnecessarily amplified here, it almost gave me an headache. 
Truly bothersome.Storytelling.
Here we go.
The lack of chemistry between the characters, due to a criminally low level of writing, is the true common thread of the movie. The characters are dull, their backstories already heard in every action movie released so far.
Their development in the movie is either non-existent or plainly wrong.
The human reactions are somewhat odd, not quite believable.
Funnily enough, some of the lines unwillingly probe the screenplay and expose it's flaws, but it's a bitter laugh.
The whole screenplay features horrible, cheesy lines that would have seemed ridiculous even in an '80s action movie featuring Steven Seagal. 
The screenplay is truly awful and predictable , every subplot is either forgotten or comes to conclusion in no more than 20 minutes. 
There is a good thing in this screenplay, there's a thing I'd never expected and that truly caught me off guard, but it's not enough. I'm fairly sure I didn't see that coming cause I got distracted when the usher reprimanded a kid who'd put his feet on the seat in front of him.
An inch higher than Independence Day 2, but well, it's not really a compliment.Cringe soars to unrivalled heights with a reference to the salt bae.

Various reviews called it ""disappointing,"" and ""a waste of time"". Well, I watched it anyway, and I think those reviews played a big role in how much fun I had watching it.Pacific Rim: Uprising has some cliché plot elements, some badly delivered dialogue, and some jokes that fall flat, but none of that stopped me from having a great time the whole way through. The action is visually appealing and clear/easy to watch, the characters were relatable, and nothing was jarring enough to take me out of the movie. This film also did a great job creating actual danger for the protagonists, which kept things fresh and interesting. If anything, I thought including a teenager as one of the main characters might backfire, but her performance was actually quite good. I'm also a big fan of Charlie Day, and as expected, he was fantastic. His inability to speak Mandarin was a hilarious callback to It's Always Sunny.Overall, I went into Uprising expecting it to be absolutely awful, and it was far better than that. That allowed me to experience the fun, which this film consistently delivers.

I watched it two days ago and I dont remember anything about his son, so it was kind of stupid of them to just say ""Lets give Stacker a son!"".The fighting scenes were underwhelming, but I have to give it to them that the ice fighting scene one was pretty good in my opinion. The most underwhelming scene was the last one, I had so much hope and hype just for it to be deflated in a matter of minutes, like why did they just throw Gipsy Avenger on top of a Kaiju? Couldnt they just fight it and show how much their Drift was good? And also, Jake said that Amani did well, like what did she do? Nothing, she didnt really contribute to the last fighting scene. Also, Gipsy Avenger was LITERALLY dragged across the streets messing up the road, but the first Jaeger that went down crumbled like a piece of cookie? Like, who are you kidding, stupid.. (in my taste, the Jaegers looked too shiny and polished, I preferred the first ones looking like they could give you tetanus, they seem more powerful, heavy and stronger)But the part where Charli Days character was revealed to be the evil mastermind behind the new attacks was amazing for me, I loved that part very much. The part that was amazing for me was when the three Kaijus merged into one, that? Now that was SO COOL, I loved it!Also, Mako was a pilot in the first movie, why wasnt she a pilot in this one? Why did they push teenagers to be the main thing in this? They had a good vision for the movie, but in my opinion they just didnt show it to us very well, but of course, the films were made by two different directors and that is visible. There were scenes that put a connection between the two movies and I liked them. The acting wasnt the best in some parts of the movie, but it also wasnt that bad to the point its unwatchable.Basically, I had high expectations, I hope the 3rd movie will be better than this one, or if the 3rd movie doesnt happen that the anime will be good. It wasnt a bad movie, but it also didnt live up to the first one, sadly. Im really waiting to see how will they portray going into their dimension to destroy them once and for all.p.s. While searching for more information about the movies, I found a remake of both movies, it is something like a ""mockbuster"" I guess and its incredibly bad.Its called Atlantic Rim and it came out in the same year as Pacific Rim in 2013, and the second one was a sequel called Atlantic Rim: Resurrection that came out in the same year (2018) as Pacific Rim: Uprising so check it out if you have free time to waste.Oh and, Raleigh, man where you at?",Pacific Rim - Uprising

There was a plot twist that I didn't really see coming and I liked the idea and realisation of a batch of new, young Jaeger pilots better than I thought I would.Another good thing; The Yeagers are beautifully designed and pretty much all of the action happens in the daytime which is good.

716,wowppl,Not good as the first one. Disappointed but still love it.,7,26 March 2018,"Pacific Rim is sure my best favorites movie . Cannot count how much I watched it (30+ at least) . It has been 5 years waiting from the 1st movie . Before I watch Pacific Rim uprising , there are something I wish to see, just like other fans, based on the passion n love to the 1st film :Things that I hope for uprising before see it
Great action and more fight scene. Great music n must have the original theme song appear. Seeing old characters from the 1st movie . Even more great design of Jagers n Kaiju . Good script as the 1st movie which balance or even improve each major character 's storyline n the time of flight . Same level of artistic image that we see in 1st movie .Same as some other comment , lots of the key elements above are not seen in uprising which is disappointed to me. While I do understand as a new director to the sequel , it's hard to compare , or even surpass to the creator who is gifted n carry much amount of love to the Kaiju n the unique Universe he made .My comment n feeling about uprising : Director is trying to please the fans n expand the fans to lower age people like kids. It seems to me that they are looking after oversee boxes office performance especially to China , while try to cover up their intention by the concept of ""all counties to save all people"". There are more fight scene than the 1st one which is good . The 1st two flights with Obsidian Fury are great . Original music is found in uprising (but it is very short ) . Three old characters are back(but Mako only show up a short time), Mako 's script is not short ,compare with those new cadet who even dun have a word to say . Storyline is okay especially the villain twist is a surprise to me. Weight on Jager is still found in some scene, at least not 100% transformer style. I can understand Jager has upgraded so can accept for moving faster . Compare with Mark V Striker Eureka in the 1st movie, Mark V n VI Jager speed in uprising is understandable.Things that I like in uprising:
Amara 's drift which tell her story ,echo to the one of Mako in 1st movie.
Machine gears in the Jager's leg when moving ,align with 1st movie 's attention to physic (but not much) .
Newton, Jake n Mako's good performance .
Idea of Villain twist in uprising.
The truth of Obsiden Fury pliot
Nice CGI n metal texture found in the Jager .
Vortex gun of Bracer Phoenix n the ability of shoot from the back . Good utilization of 3 man's ride .Things that I dislike in uprising :
Less unique in the new Jager . When compare with the 1st movie . 
Too much Chinese element in the movie, even the storyline tells it is happening in China n engaged with a China tech company. If this movie is to bring message of all people to save all mankind, why we dun see someone say Japanese/ Korean/Spanish in the movie ?The drift is too easy , especially for those trainee cadet . Everyone is drift compatible ? No special for a 3 man's drift in Bracer Phoenix, even they are not triplets ?Out of focus to the Kaiju. Appearance too short . No highlight their faces n scary outlook like the one for knifehead .I can't even remember the faces of those three , Raijin is a bit better .Compare with Stacker introduction in the Shatterdome, no or only little introduction to Cadet faces n Jager. I only remember the Russian girl n the Chinese muscle boy ,Indian boy but no others.Jake's speech to the Cadet before final fight is not good as his father. May be it's too good from Idris Elba...Fighting too fast in the last battle, cannot catch up the scene. But I can catch every action in the 1st movie. Trailer aldy release more than 50% of the fight scene in the movie !Wrong timing of 1st movie 's theme song. Too short as well .I can't remember any piece of the uprising music . Means no signature sound like in the 1st movie . Del toro make this specific requirement to Ramin Djawadi by a few pitches. Apparently uprising fails on this part .Transition of Jake is too fast. Cannot fully explain why he changes his mind from the beginning.Skipping the moment of combined big kaiju died from the hit of Gpisy Avenger . I dun even see how the Kajiu died .Guardian Bravo fall out n hit the car for ringing, what is that about ? I dun fell it a kind of salute to the 1st movie. If you do that in such a way, I prefer u save the time for character 's story telling instead. Only single weapon of Guardian Bravo(electric wrip) n Saber Athena (twin blade) . I can't believe how they can be VI Jager if have only one way to attack .
Titan redeemer fall down too easy . A kind of waste of his design n appearance.Need a bit more scene to explain how the Kajiu mind control the drone. Cannot fulling understand it .Idea that I suggest or hope to see in 3rd movie , if any.
More detail fighting with Kaiju like in 1st movie , or like the one fighting with Obsidian Fury , with weight feeling of the massive weight of a Jager.Stacker ,Mako reappearance in Jake's drift with Raleigh (if he's back) .Finding some message which they don't know about before .Assign background story to the main Cadet . e.g. Russian girl something to do with Cheno Alpha's pilot . A moment like Gpisy sword 1st appearance in the 1st movie , Otachi show her wing expand n fly . Giving surprise to the audience.No spoiler trailer please. It's too much for uprising .Overall I rated 7/10 marks to uprising. This include my love to the franchise , appreciation to the effort of production crew, nice fight scene in the movie and the understanding of there may be no one can surpass Del toro 's work , except himself",Pacific Rim - Uprising
717,ntinostsatsakis,Awful,1,13 December 2019,"Terrible acting... They don't even try to take this movie seriously and it shows on screen.
The plot is very meh because even I could write something like that the first PR gave you a goldmine and you pissed in it. They even create plot holes to things the first movie set in place.

The main monster doesn't even appear until the very end, and then, of course, Gypsy Danger is the only one that can defeat it.

726,rfgod,Never left a movie theater so disappointed,2,23 March 2018,"I absolutely loved the first movie. I was interviewed by a local newspaper for an unrelated thing and was asked to provide my favorite movie and I said Pacific Rim. I have loved this movie since it was released in 2013, the best worst movie ever. 
Uprising however could not have been more disappointing. I have watched the first movie upwards of 10 times and there is not enough money in the world to make me watch even a minute of Uprising. The unbelievably terrible dialog and lack of chemistry between all characters was soul crushing. What made the first movie great was the lack of plot and awesome fighting. This monstrosity took all the things that made the first one awesome and destroyed them over almost 2 hours. 
It was an irreverent mockery of the serious and gritty tone of Pacific Rim. There were numerous points in the film where there was opportunity for a motivating speech or a selfless act of heroism but all of those were squandered with poorly written jokes or even more poorly written anticlimactic statements delivered with next to no emotion (see when Amara Namani says in the face of impending death ""at least we get to save the world"").
The end of Pacific Rim left us with a world in chaos and the Jaeger program disbanded. The beginning of Uprising puts the unfortunate viewer in a world where magically, AFTER THE WAR, the incredibly costly Jaeger program was reinstated and a CRAP ton of new Jaegers have been built, then almost immediately all but four were destroyed. I just wish I had been in the room when someone thought that this was a good idea.
Amara Namani was portrayed admirably by Cailee Spaeny but some GENIUS decided to give her an almost identical backstory to the great Mako Mori. What moron thought first of all no one would recognize this and two thought it was a good idea. 
The only redeeming part of this entire dumpster fire was the twist involving Charlie Day. Aside from that everything, including the CGI which in Pacific Rim was unbelievably amazing, the dark and rainy settings of the multiple Kaiju fights and the compelling speech by the inspiring Stacker Pentacost (played by the man who SHOULD be the next James Bond, Idris Elba) was almost unwatchable.

729,mitchrichardsondev,Yes! Saturday Morning Feelings,7,23 March 2018,"Pacific Rim 2: Uprising is not a great movie. However...
I went into this movie with low expectations as a big fan of the first movie. The trailers didn't hype me up much, and without del Toro helming the direction I just felt it wouldn't have the same feel as the previous film, and I was right. The pacing was weird in the first half of the film, with too much forced exposition detailing plot points of the first movie. The comedic points to help keep people entertained are pretty campy and cheesy, but it's at least consistent and helps get the first half of the movie over with.Once the movie hits it's second acts climax however, it's full tilt boogie from there on. The movie definitely felt less like Pacific Rim and more like what I thought Power Rangers should have been. Things move at a faster pace and the fights are pretty awesome at points. It's brought back memories of watching huge monsters and robots fight while eating cereal on a Saturday morning. Do I go to these movies for character development and a deep plot? No, I came for badass robots and kaiju fights, and I got more than I asked for in that regard with this movie.When the credits rolled, I was not only satisfied but it exceeded my expectations. If your looking to take it super seriously and want to learn more about the Pacific Rim universe you'll likely be left wanting. But if you go in for some great Saturday morning action, you'll find it for sure.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

The first movie is so cool; the effect combined with how the story goes. I felt a momentum in the epic/ending battle, in time when they successfully bring down the bridge. Of course, i am waiting to see Pacific Rim Uprising. The storyline is creative about how the bring Kaiju backs. However, somehow I do not feel momentum in the epic/ending battle with Big Kaiju in Tokyo, compare with the first one in the deep of ocean.Furthermore, I think that they can explore more in term of fighting techniques, perhaps to add unexpected moves to defeat Kaiju.

The soundtrack was not that good in my opinion, the visuals were not nearly as stunning as the first one, and the story was very simple and felt like it was written by somebody who was just writing whatever came into their minds without trying to connect it all together. Ultimate thoughts, it's a popcorn flick and nothing more. If you are looking for monsters and robots battling it out and just pure action, you will enjoy this film.

734,sportslilgg,"We Dig Giant Robots, Improves On the Original",8,24 March 2018,"Legendary does the mecha genre justice on the big screen with Pacific Rim Uprising.The film improves on the original's lack of fight scenes and slow narrative. Legendary focuses screen time on the robots and monsters which the original film hesitates to do. The audience engages more with this film because it doesn't have redundant slow sections like the original. Viewers immerse in the fights thanks to the beautiful visuals and powerful sound effects.The film gives mecha/kaiju genre fans the action, robots, and monsters they want. Casual viewers expect more from the plot, but don't understand that giant monster and robot fights are the main focus in this genre. The plot reminisce the fast pace plots from old school mecha anime. The film pays homage to the mecha style with teenagers and young adults as the main pilots.

748,platlg,An Unworthy Sequel,3,7 April 2018,"Pacific Rim 2 consisted of good fight scenes and good special effects, but the positives end there. The characters are checklist and cookie-cutter, the dialog is dull, unfunny, and predictable, and the script is weak and quite stupid. The biggest and most noticeable flaw in this movie is the complete lack of depth and chemistry between any of the characters. They are simply not 'drift compatible' (sorry, I couldn't resist).Johnny Boyega is a good actor, but he is not leading man material. Not yet anyway. Scott Eastwood adds nothing to this movie aside from a strong physical resemblance to his father. This sequel has none of the heart, raw feel, or strong emotional connection of the characters in the first film. It's too bad Guillermo Del Toro didn't return to the director's chair for this movie, as it assuredly would have made a difference. The problem with movie such as this that are heavy in CGI, is that there is often a laziness to them, in that the filmmakers don't see the need or just don't feel like making the effort to writing a coherent script combined with good acting and strong character chemistry. Why bother because who's gonna notice, right? Well, moviegoers do notice and it's really no surprise that this movie isn't doing very well at the box office. PR2 is just a jumbled mess of 'shiny red balls' hoping that no one will notice how inferior this movie is to the first one.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Tons of fun action, a nice twist in the plot, and just plain fun. No...it's not going to win an academy award and who really cares. That's not why you watch a film like this. It's pure junk...food. Fill up and enjoy!",Pacific Rim - Uprising
750,bigbadbeefareeno,Pacific Cringe: Up-chucking,4,12 April 2018,"It's bad, and I mean BAD. Different director than this first. Grabs up some elements of the first one and runs with it. Runs about 10 feet and drops the ball. Characters are one sided. You don't get any backstory and you don't really end up liking any of them. First movie was great. Stay away from this one..",Pacific Rim - Uprising
751,johnhayman-69674,Great fun as hoped!,10,12 April 2018,"First of all, I love reading reviews that slam a movie and claim anyone who liked it must be an uneducated moron. Well, 152 i.q. and masters degree or not, I must qualify as such a moron. The movie was a little lighter in tone and drama, but it was great fun with some plot twists that kept it fresh enough for my tastes. Ahhh, for the good old days when you didn't have trolls moonlighting as reviewers to sabatoge our fun. Personally, I like the lead on for a 3rd edition as much as the movie itself. Go see it, have fun, and ignore the killjoys!",Pacific Rim - Uprising
752,githugt,It wasn't terrible.... But yeah...,5,14 April 2018,"I liked the original Pacific Rim. Sure it wasn't exactly intellectual. But they actually embraced that. Went for the awesomest stupid movie / Stupidest awesome movie.This one was a lot more dumbed down and was all over the place, while actually achieving nothing. There were no awesome parts per say. The other one although had quite a bit of bad stuff, still managed to pull in some really awesome sequences as well. This one, they even ran away from the awe inspiring speech, by making jokes about it. But just like that. I call this a joke of a movie compared to the original.I'll still keep my hopes up for a good sequel to this. The premise is good, just hope that whoever picks it up can deliver. Coz Pacific Rim : Uprising did not.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
753,jandrepiconez,Disapointment...,3,14 April 2018,"I like the film, however, it was just so different from the first film... I mean, where's the Impressive look and powerfull of the Yagers? It has a bad taste of humour and really few action scenes with Kaijus. The end was to kinda fast and It wasn´t just well planned. It seems they have rushed It. The characters are too Young and they are not taken serious. The lightning was bad, very bright and the quality also worse. I loved the first Film...The second? Disapointning with to much Yager vs Yager and many Things.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

Why such crap is allowed to be done, how a group of people can produce and finance something so bad, then watch it and come to the conclusion that it's a movie worth releasing is beyond me... This is precious time you will never get back, you've been warned.

Moving slower make you fell that the machine and monster are big, its perceptions, that you can fell the greatness. This one lack's that perception with Steven. Being this his first movie, its very good, but it could have being great. I would personally would like to see more of this franchise, it has a great story and the idea and how they design the Jaeger, very nice.",Pacific Rim - Uprising
756,azamralelokay,Disappointing,3,23 April 2018,"Just the other day i saw the first movie and what a difference between them.
the first one had depth, the characters were someone to relate to. I had high hopes for the sequel but i was disappointed. The actors are young very young and it shows on the acting skills and the characters they portrays. (what no adaults agreed to play in the movie?). i'm sorry to say the eastwood jr. is just a preaty face and does'nt have to presence like his fathers. and what with all those Japanese walking around? why don't French, Germens, Israelis?
and that Shao lady, by talking english and dissolving the hair and playing 'rambo' you're not making you're performence better. 
To sum everything up the movie is a waste of time I hope the director will learm from his mistake and the third movie will be better.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

IT is mashed together, but feels like it is just dripping from a comic book.
I love old Jp monster flicks and mecha anime, it is difficult to not thrill me with the combo.
Not as good as pt1, but good enough to have me and my kids tearing up the house enacting the fights.
Yes, it is just bleeding China is god propaganda, but hey, I guess they want to milk their investment from the purchase.
It is a very scripted, by the numbers (formulated) story.JUST HAPPY I DID RENTAL AND NOT $20 AT THE CINEMA>It is a good watch.
Just wish they could equalize the sound on these darned movies though.",Pacific Rim - Uprising

777,Talia-4403,Some good ideas but very questionable execution,5,11 February 2019,"Like many I'm a fan of the first Pacific Rim, if it was put in the hands of any else besides Guillermo Del Toro it would just be another Transformers. But he gave the movie a great anime inspired look, powerful action and Idris Elba was the stand out. But since Del Toro was busy with The Shape of Water he has been relegated to a producing role and directing has be hand over TV director Steven S. DeKinght (known for Episodes of Buffy and Daredevil) and to be honest, I don't think he was the right pick.Uprising is not a terrible movie, it's just a let down. But it's does two things better than the first. John Boyega as Jake Pentecost is a far more charismatic lead than the pretty boring Raleigh and every Jaeger fight takes place at daytime which does create more colourful fights. And that's about it.Del Toro was the sole writer for the first movie while Uprising has four (Including DeKnight) and it really shows. The story does have some interesting ideas like people creating their own junkyard Jaegers from the parts of old ones and Jaeger drones being controlled by Kaiju brains. But the execution is questionable. The junkyard Jaegers are introduced in the beginning and don't play a part until the end and the Jaeger/Kaiju hybrids only serve a plot point and nothing else (also padding).But something that truly derails the movie is its unfunny sense of humour. In a scene that is supposed to be epic as the Jaegers fly to Tokyo for the final battle, a character plays the troll song meme to ""relax"" himself. But it gets worse, during the final battle one of the Jaegers pulls a double middle finger at a Kaiju. It's grown worthy.But not as grown worthy as the twist. Half way through the movie, it's revealed that Charlie Day's character from the first movie is the villain and that he wants to bring the Kaiju back to earth to have their blood react to Mount Fuji and create an extinction level event. The problem isn't the idea, as with some rewrites it could work, it's that it comes off so unintentionally funny. Day was played as the comic relief character from the first movie (all be it a little annoying) so having him try to play a villain while keeping his comic persona really messes with the tone and the directors intention. But the worst thing the twist did is how much it clashes with Day's character from the first movie, as he was presented as someone who wanted to stop the Kaiju with science. So to have this character be perfectly fine with ending the world with Kaiju kind of ruins his character.But the reason people want to see this movie is because of the action. And while the action is really cool to look at, it also has issues. While I do like that most of the action takes place at daytime, it did sacrifice something key, weight. In the first movie, the Jaegers had a great scense of weight to them, every time they punched something there was a great feeling of impact. But in Uprising the Jaegers feel lighter and there for less impactful. The Jaegers (aside for Gypsy Avenger) also lack personality outside of colour and weapon. The Jaegers are meant to be defined by their pilots, but the pilots in this movie are incrediblly forgettable and flat. In the first movie each Jaeger had something that made it stand out, whether it was the design or the why it moved. The new Jaegers this time don't have any personally aside from one being orange and wielding and another looking like Bulkhead from Transformers: Prime.Overall if you want to see giant robots fighting giant monsters, watch the first movie it has slightly more subsentce and better direction and writing. But if Uprising is on TV, Netflix or if you find it on Blu-Ray, there are some elements that could entertain you. Who knows, Uprising could be a guilty pleasure",Pacific Rim - Uprising
