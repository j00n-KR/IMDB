0,Leofwine_draca,Very well made psycho-thriller,7,3 July 2014,"THE GOOD SON is one of many psycho-thrillers that were made in the early 1990s in the wake of the success of the likes of FATAL ATTACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE. Most of these could be easily categorised by the type of person who was the villain, i.e. 'bad cop' (UNLAWFUL ENTRY), 'bad neighbour' (PACIFIC HEIGHTS), 'bad husband' (SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY). THE GOOD SON is, as you'd guess from the title, about a bad kid.Said kid is Macauley Culkin, a wonderful piece of casting against type by the producers. So long we've had to put up with Culkin in his sickly-sweet roles but here he portrays somebody very different indeed and, inevitably, this turns out to be the best performance of his career. Culkin is excellent, truly portraying a character beyond his years, and he helps to make the movie.It helps that everything else is right, too. The script focuses on realism throughout, and there's plenty of characterisation to make the viewer feel truly grounded in the experience. Aside from the ending, things don't get over the top with the style or direction. There are a handful of set-pieces which really work (like the bit with the bridge), and some incredible stunt work that left me breathless, like the whole bit with the tree house. As somebody with a fear of heights, such moments turned my legs to jelly.Elijah Wood made a point of appearing in plenty of twee kid's films during the 1990s (FREE WILLY anyone?) but this is one of his most interesting movies from that decade. David Morse is typically good as Wood's father. The script stays grounded throughout, the psychological insight is as interesting as the thriller aspects of the story, and it all finishes in a satisfying way that goes against Hollywood convention. Good stuff.",The Good Son
1,SnoopyStyle,Needs to be a straight up horror movie,5,24 May 2014,"Following his mother's death, Mark Evans (Elijah Wood) is sent to Maine to stay with his uncle (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and aunt (Wendy Crewson) by his father (David Morse). He becomes fast friends with cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin). However, Henry shows signs of manipulative violence and all the classic bad boy behavior. He is obsessed with death and may have killed his little brother.This was big news to see young Macaulay Culkin play a bad guy. He shows that he has great range as a child actor. I just think that the movie works better as a straight up horror. Director Joseph Ruben who just filmed 'Sleeping with the Enemy' is using a similar style. This has a little too much of that movie-of-the-week feel. There is a good creepiness about this but that's all Ruben achieves. Every adult is an idiot and the movie strains under that construction. Why doesn't Mark call his father again? Why doesn't the father call the psychiatrist? The movie bends over backwards to come up with that ending. I don't have a problem with evil kids in horror. It's a try and true subject, but this is not a good example.",The Good Son
2,kosmasp,"New home, new addition and certainly not alone",7,25 February 2021,"Culkin allegedly was forced upon this movie, as I read after watching the movie. This had quite the repercussions (director and other-wise). That aside, this is the movie of Elijah Wood. He really is good (no pun intended), which once again cannot be said about Culkins character. Not sure what you think of his Home Alone movies (he was in the first two), but this really is very obvious ... just not to the adults.And when I say obvious, you can see where this is heading, so quite predictable. Still the performances overall (even that of Culkin, whatever you may think of his pale delivery) really elevate the whole movie to another level. And that ending ... I have to admit, that took quite the ... well I didn't expect it to go down like that, let me put it that way - pun intended. Evil can lurk anywhere, this certainly isn't made for the easily offended amongst us ...",The Good Son
3,classicsoncall,"""Hey, accidents will happen.""",7,7 August 2019,"Macaulay Culkin was merely a mischievous, eight year old troublemaker in 1990's ""Home Alone"", but here he pulls out all the stops and goes for the gusto as a nearly possessed evil little monster who believes taking out members of his own family is the ticket to a happier life. Quite honestly, Henry Evans (Culkin) seemed way too introspective beyond his years regarding human psychology. Having come to the conclusion that ""...once you realize you can do anything, you're free"" is not something a normal eleven year old would come up with. Then again, one could say he wasn't your average, normal eleven year old. Once the story gets really moving along, Henry does a serious gaslight job on his cousin Mark (Elijah Wood), so that everyone involved becomes sincerely worried about his mental status. That's curious by the way, that everyone in the story, including the boys themselves, refer to each other as friends instead of cousins. It's curious too, that when the camera shows you a long view of the Evans home in Maine that there aren't any nearby cliffs within walking distance to set up that questionable finale.",The Good Son
4,moonspinner55,"Foolish, jaw-droppingly irresponsible variation on ""The Bad Seed""",4,24 October 2005,"Slickly-made but overwrought, brainless thriller has young Elijah Wood mourning the death of his mother, going to stay with relatives and falling victim to cousin Macaulay Culkin's twisted pranks. After suffering first-hand through a (suspicious) death in the family, Culkin's parents don't even think twice about leaving the kids home alone, nor do they seem cognizant of their child's dark side (is he that good an actor?). Culkin does well with a showy role, although his version of evil is to talk slowly in a quiet monotone; Wood is dignified and pretty believable, which is really saying something for a movie as outlandish as this. *1/2 from ****",The Good Son
5,edwagreen,A Bad Seed 2: Evil is Evil ** for The Good Son,4,3 June 2010,"Following the death of his mother, a young lad (Elijah Wood) goes to stay with his uncle, aunt and cousins while dad has to go on an important business trip.How coincidental that the Wood comes upon a situation where a very sinister Macaulay Culkin is creating mayhem, but acts as the good boy so that no one believes him.This picture is nothing more than a rip-off of ""The Bad Seed"" of 1956. Culkin is absolutely insane as he does things such as shooting a dog, nearly throwing mom over the cliff, drowning his younger brother and nearly killing his younger sister. It's just a little too much to take.The ending is where Culkin's mom had to make a ""Sophie's Choice"" like decision at the base of the cliff. You know what she will decide after Macaulay nearly threw her over the cliff.One interesting feature is how Culkin was even able to fool the psychiatrist talking to him and the Wood character. Just shows you that ""shrinks"" can be wrong as well.",The Good Son
6,BandSAboutMovies,The Bad Son Good Seed,5,16 December 2019,"Ever see Atonement? The same screenwriter, Ian McEwan, also wrote this movie, which is all about exactly how we always figured Kevin McCallister was going to turn out. It's directed by Joseph Ruben, who also was the director of Breaking Away, Dreamscape, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy.It probably wouldn't have happened without Kit Culkin, the father of Macaulay, who was a big man in Hollywood thanks to the popularity of his son. He wanted to prove that his boy could be more than a comedy star, so in order to greenlight Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Macaulay had to star in this movie first.Mark Evans (Elijah Wood) may not have even hit puberty yet, but he's already had to deal with the death of his mother and the fact that he has to stay with his uncle Wallace and aunt Susan, as well as their children Connie (Quinn Culkin, whose role in this movie was contractually obligated) and Henry (yep, Macaulay). The latter child is, of course, nuts and obsessed with the death of Mark's mom and his own little brother Richard (Rory Culkin and you have to say it for those Culkin's, they know how to get work for the whole family tree).Of course, Henry's little bits of crazy soon manifest themselves in killing small animals, causing huge pile-ups on the highway and shoving his little sister under the ice. The movie asks all manner of psychological questions about the love of a mother versus doing the right thing and whether or not any of us are prepared to kill a child.The tone of this movie is all over the place. You're used to Macaulay being funny and dangerous to the right people, so when he does the same thing to the wrong people, you kind of want to keep on his side. Perhaps if the film's original director, Michael Lehmann of Heathers and Meet the Applegates, had stayed on and hadn't battled with Macaulay's dad, things would have been different.This is the only film in which Culkin plays a villain, but not the only one where he dies. The first would be My Girl, which ruined many a pre-teen video rental. And while this movie is a 1990's spin on The Bad Seed, it is nowhere as good. Did you expect any different?",The Good Son
7,jotix100,Bad boy,6,22 June 2006,"Henry, the angelic looking boy, lives with his parents in a beautiful suburban East coast home. His cousin Mark, from Arizona, who has just lost his mother, is invited to come and spend some time with his uncle's Wallace family. What Mark doesn't know is he is leaving one difficult situation back home, but he is not coming to a happy environment. Henry's little brother has died drowned in his bathtub, and Susan, his mother is still grieving his death.When a series of little accidents begin to happen, Mark is blamed for them. After all, Henry, who looks as though he can't do any harm, will never be thought as the culprit. It's Susan, the mother, who discovers the truth after going to Henry's shed where he keeps most of his secrets.Although the film is predictable, director Joseph Ruben has given it a look that keeps the viewer interested in what's happening. The screen play is by Ian McEwan, an excellent writer.Macauley Culkin was at the height of his early film career and he makes a great Henry Evans. Elijah Wood is seen as Mark, the visiting cousin who is horrified by what he finds in his new home. Wendy Crewson plays Susan, the grieving mother. David Morse, a wonderful actor, doesn't have much to do as Mark's father.Watch the film without any expectations and it will reward you.",The Good Son
8,Hey_Sweden,"""If I let you go, do you think you could fly?""",6,17 February 2020,"Young Mark (Elijah Wood) is reeling from the recent death of his beloved mother (Ashley Crow), and although he doesn't want to do it, his dad Jack (David Morse) leaves him in the care of relatives. Marks' uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) are good people, but unfortunately they've sired a monster, Marks' sociopathic cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin). Henry spends most of the movie convincing every adult in sight that he's this perfect little angel, while in reality he's a cold-blooded creep who does nasty things for fun. As a viewer can see, Henry IS a master manipulator.This has been referred to by wits over the years as ""Kit Culkins' The Good Son"", due to the fact that Macs' father was a truly vile ""stage parent"" who demanded that his son headline this feature, otherwise no Mac in ""Home Alone 2"". While one would feel sympathy for Mac, having to live with a father like that, the fact remains that Mac is too bland as this 1990s male update of ""The Bad Seed"", failing to project any real menace. Wood is far and away the better actor, and is more appealing, to boot. The adults are fine - if playing characters who expectedly remain clueless until near the end. Macs' sister Quinn plays his sibling (in her only film role); his younger brother Rory (who's had his own decent acting career) can be seen in a key photograph. Crewson has the most interesting moment to work with in the film, as she must make a choice at the finale.The film is capably guided by Joseph Ruben, who replaced the original director after that person left the project. Ruben of course had experience with a familial-themed thriller, the memorable 1980s sleeper ""The Stepfather"". He just doesn't have a star as commanding as Terry O'Quinn here.All in all, this isn't a total waste of time. It moves QUICK, cutting right to the meat & potatoes of Ian McEwans' script, and runs a mere 87 minutes. It also has a lovely Elmer Bernstein score and excellent photography (John Lindley was the D.P., Peter Norman the camera operator). If you think you might enjoy this, don't be put off by the R rating, which seems to have been earned for one simple F-bomb uttered by Mac; violence and gore are minimal. It's filmed at breathtaking locations that are mostly in Massachusetts.A classic case of ""could have been better, could have been worse"".Six out of 10.",The Good Son
9,Doylenf,Stunning New England photography and smashing climax...,6,27 September 2006,"The biggest flaw in THE GOOD SON is that the title role is played by MACAULAY CAULKIN who is seriously miscast. He plays most of his role in an expressionless manner that is supposed to give the audience the subtle impression that he is a cold-blooded killer.This may have served adult actors like ALAN LADD well when they handled grim material with those expressionless steely-eyed glances and tight lips, but Caulkin merely looks like an angelic child going through the paces of pretending to mean every word of his dialog. He never changes that sweet choir boy look, even when he is about to pounce like a predator. It undermines any dramatic tension the scene should have.On the other hand, some genuine acting is offered by eleven year-old ELIJAH WOOD, as the visiting cousin who gradually comes to see that his cousin is not the good son he's pretending to be. The biggest rift comes when he unwittingly joins in the fun of carrying a dummy to a bridge overpass which Macaulay then dumps onto the highway below, causing a pile-up of crashing cars on the speeding lanes.After this, the theme darkens as the boy becomes aware that deep seated jealousy is causing his cousin to destroy some of the people close to him. The next victim is Macaulay's younger sister, playfully tossed onto the danger zone of an ice-skating pond, falling and getting no help from him until rescuers cut through the ice.The final section of the film concerns the mother's awareness that something is definitely wrong when she enters the boy's playhouse and finds evidence that he was hiding from her with relation to another ""accidental drowning"".But the film's big set piece is the cliffhanger of a climax, photographed with great dexterity from helicopters giving aerial shots of the steep cliff and the drop below. It's a stunning and fitting climax to a film that is paced a little too slowly despite its brief running time and must have required some skillful stunt work.This doesn't have the sting of other stories about child psychopaths, notably THE BAD SEED, partly because MACAULAY CAULKIN lacks the dramatic skill to really inhabit his role. He was better, of course, in lighter material such as HOME ALONE, but here he is out of his depth in a role that would have been more chilling in the hands of a better qualified and more serious young actor.",The Good Son
10,preppy-3,Could have been better,6,26 April 2003,"Mark (Elijah Wood), still grieving over his mothers death, goes to live with cousins in Maine while his father takes care of business. One of his cousins is a boy his age, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). Henry turns out to be a psychopath and is determined to do anything to stop Mark from telling anyone else.This movie originally had a different director attached to it who (understandably) did not want Culkin in it. Culkins' father made it clear that if Macaulay didn't get this movie he wouldn't do ""Home Alone 2"". So, the studio bowed to pressure--the original director quit--and Culkin destroys what could have been a great movie. As we now know, Macaulay was treated like dirt by his father and forced into projects, so he can't be blamed for this entirely. Still he's just lousy. He says all his lines in a monotone and has a blank look on his face all through the movie. He really weighs this movie down. Still, this isn't totally worthless.It's well-directed; contains three very good performances by Wood, Wendy Crewson and David Morse; has just beautiful locations (most filmed in Cape Ann, MA) and has a lush, sweeping music score. Also it seems to have been cut down to its bare bones--it's only 84 minutes long--and moves very quickly.Still, I can only give it a 6 because of Culkin. That's too bad.Also, it doesn't really deserve the R rating. There's no nudity, sex, very little swearing and all the violence is off screen.",The Good Son
11,view_and_review,What Evil,6,7 June 2020,"I wouldn't be spoiling anything if I said that the ""Good Son"" (meaning the boy in the movie, not the movie itself) was anything but. It's not too farfetched to say that he's probably the son of Damien from ""The Omen.""Macaulay Culkin was terrific as Henry, the sociopathic son of Susan (Wendy Crewson) and Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly). He was opposed by Mark (Elijah Wood), his cousin who was staying with him while his dad was out of town. Mark was on to Henry's tricks, still Mark was no match for Henry. Mark had a good heart and good intentions, but he could not match the raw wickedness and intelligence of Henry.The movie would've been better if Mark wasn't such a foolish little boy. It makes sense that he would attempt to alert people of Henry's evil deeds, but once he flipped the script on him a couple of times Mark should've wised up and tried different tactics. Watching Mark run around making a fool of himself was quite annoying. I know we're talking about a 10 or 11-year-old boy but come on.The movie ended with Susan having to make a critical choice of saving her son Henry's life or her nephew Mark's life. We can only assume she made the right decision, but I can only imagine that Susan is going to be a psychological basket case after the whole ordeal.",The Good Son
12,gridoon2021,Good thriller,7,6 March 2016,"It must have taken some balls to make ""The Good Son"" - a change-of-pace if there ever was one - right at the peak of Macaulay Culkin's popularity as a wholesome, family-friendly child star, but the gamble paid off: this movie has held up very well over the years. Fluidly directed by the unheralded Joseph Ruben, with sweeping camera work and a vivid sense of place that makes the location another character, with a script that builds the suspense gradually towards a memorable cliffhanger (literally) of a climax, and further aided by a rich music score by the legendary Elmer Bernstein, this is one of the most successful thrillers of its era. Culkin is surprisingly good at being bad (and amoral, and manipulative), Elijah Wood is just as solid, and Wendy Crewson is the mother any (normal!) son would like to have. *** out of 4.",The Good Son
13,FlashCallahan,Home Alone would have been a lot more violent with Henry..,6,22 June 2012,"After his mother's death, a young boy, Mark, is left with his aunt and uncle while his father makes an important trip.Cousin Henry is at first great fun, but isn't your average boy next door.Mark believes Henry is evil, but no one else can see this...Where was Culkin going to go after Home Alone? according to his dad, this weird little film. At the time, Culkin was this behemoth of a child star, but that star was fading quickly.But this is such a strange film to pick. Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest. And I really feel that this movie was marketed wrong as a horror.Secondly, Wood steals the film from everyone. He shows just how talented he is, and why he has the career he has today. Thus, showing that the casting of Culkin as the 'bad' son, is just a parlour trick by the makers to put bums on seats.Which never worked here in the UK.But the film is still watchable thanks to Wood, and some unintentionally funny moments (the scene where Culking uses bad language is supposed to chill, it doesn't), and the film does try and raise a 'what would you do' question at the end.It's a fun movie, but it ultimately shows that Culkin didn't really have range.",The Good Son
14,whpratt1,A REAL CLIFF HANGER OF A FLICK !!,10,22 April 2004,"This film kept my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end.   Macaulay Culkin,(Henry Evans),""Party Monsters"",'03, gave one of his best performances and really showed his great talents which made you hate him through out the entire picture. Henry had to share his home with a young boy who had recently lost his mother and was in deep depression, he was the son of David Morse,(Jack),""Hack"",TV Series, 02, who had to leave him with his brothers family.  All hell breaks loose after the two young boys get to know each other.  If you viewed the film the ""Bad Seed"", you will have some idea what the story is about.   It is a real nail biting film and makes you crazy trying to figure out just how the story will END!   If you love Macaulay Culkin, this is his best FILM !",The Good Son
15,MovieAddict2016,"""The Good Son"" is a ""good"" example of how not to make a ""good"" thriller.",1,9 April 2003,"""The Good Son"" is a ""good"" example of how not to make a thriller. Not only is it stupid, it's disturbing seeing filmmakers having an eleven-year-old kill people.The film starts out with Elijah Wood going to live with his Aunt and Uncle after his mother dies, because his father has a business deal in Japan (or something like that). Upon arrival at his relatives' home, he meets Macaulay Culkin, who makes a startling appearance in a mask.The boys become friends, but Wood starts to see things happening. Culkin kills a dog with a nail-gun he created. And then he tries to kill his sister (numerous times). And then we find out that years ago, Culkin's little brother drowned in the bathtub while Culkin was looking over him (we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys--a rubber duck--and he wanted it back). So then Wood has to convince everyone that Culkin is a homicidal maniac with serious problems before the sister dies.I read a review of Roger Ebert's on this film, and it's exactly what stuck out at me when I originally watched the film: What kind of filmmakers have a small child in a role where he is killing people? Especially when the film has with a kid killing off his family members. It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age.And furthermore, why cast Culkin? Macaulay Culkin is one of the worst child actors I've seen in a long time, and luckily his reign has ended. Now we have Haley Joel Osment, who actually has gained the honor of being a good child actor. Let's contrast between the two, shall we? In ""The Sixth Sense,"" Osment delivers many speeches where he cries or acts frightened. In ""The Good Son,"" Culkin delivers a speech to Wood while they are standing at the refrigerator. He mumbles every badly-written line helplessly. He stares at Wood, motionless, without facial expressions. He looks like he's reading his lines off the top of Wood's forehead.Now, you could say his part calls for no emotions, but this kid ALWAYS has that look on his face in ALL his movies. I mean, other than his role in ""Uncle Buck,"" the kid just can't act. ""Home Alone"" was a good film...but not because of him. That was due to a great script and great supporting cast. And that's it. ""The Good Son"" is not only disturbing, but very mediocre in what it is. It's just like all those eighties so-called ""thrillers"" that came out that were no more than 90 minutes of basic chills. The script is awful.But one of the worst things about this film is the fact that it seems written for/by children...yet it is in no way suitable for children. At all. It's a sick, twisted film that tries to be both a thriller/chiller, and a kids' movie. It's neither.1/5 stars -",The Good Son
16,lost-in-limbo,Very mundane thriller.,5,7 January 2006,"After a boy's mother dies his dad leaves him at his brother's place for a week or two as he has an important job aspect to achieve and hopefully it helps his son to overcome his grievances. This when he meets his cousin Henry who's about the same age. After the first day Mark seems to getting along and enjoying himself, but suddenly everything changes for the worst when he discovers that Henry is a real disturbed little boy who has a tendency for violent behaviour. When Mark tries to convince everyone what Henry really is, Henry pulls the all too sweet and innocent act and so no one we believes him.Tame yes, this thriller is really uninvolving and tame to the bone. That's not to say it wasn't remotely entertaining even with its shortcomings. Just that it looks like most of the attention went into the glossy set-up than that of the actual material, character depth and building any sort of tension. I also had a hard time believing that of Macaulay Culkin's performance. Sure he was star back in his hey-day, but those Oh look at me I'm so evil expressions was pitiful. He was far from creepy in the role! While his limited acting abilities really showed. Although, that's the opposite for Elijah Wood in his role. He was nothing outstanding, but he made the most of his character. From what I read I hear it borrows elements from the film 'The Bad Seed', but I can't go too much into as I haven't watched it myself. Although this flick I have and I can tell you that the plot starts off like a boy's own adventure. The way it begins you'll be thinking your were watching a different picture when you come to the second half. You'll be asking yourself throughout is this suppose to be a thriller because you won't be biting your finger nails at all, as the flatness of it hits you like a tonne of bricks and the shocks are too few. No real feel of pain or heartache, it's emotionally empty and when it tries hard to be disturbing, it can't hold a candle in the wind in that department. Everything is telegraphed from the twists and turns, where the supposed conflict and mayhem doesn't create any real impact. When it was coming up to the film dying minutes it got all a bit too tiring, but the film's climax is definitely the best moment, if you know what I mean.All the treatment went into the very solid production values, as you definitely will tell. The atmosphere is has a stinging coldness to it and the scenery is simply irresistible, that especially goes to scenes involving the cliffs over looking the sea. Stunning images! What made that evident was professional camera-work with its many spiralling and high crane shots. There was such control and ease throughout. Too bad it had to hit a bad spot with its distracting score, which bellows too much attention by flooding certain moments. The script plods about without any real conviction and makes way for too much chin-wag that doesn't add anything more the picture. The plot basically plays on the Good vs. Evil themes with pretty predictable consequences. There's also moments when the script examines if there's true evil(?), that when you free yourself you take sudden risks without a flinch and blah, blah, yeah there's more to it, but the film might think it's answering that query, but it's far from it. Although it tries for such more, by thinking, lets question ourselves at the end to make sure it looks like there's a deeper meaning to it all no thank-you! Not bad but not terribly good either.",The Good Son
17,Irishchatter,Not the best of Malachy Culkins and Elijah Woods teamwork,1,12 February 2016,"I honestly don't know why this film actually sucked but, i think this wasn't the best movie that Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood have ever done in their beginning careers. They looked really cute but really, they really shouldn't have been in a movie that isn't boring and messing up your head. It might be better if a lot older kids were playing this, at the time, i think Culkin and Wood were not that mature doing the film. The best mature ages would be probably 10 - 13 years to be involved with this kind of film. I was actually shocked that Culkin actually lit a cigarette, even at his age! I hope that no kids were shown this during the time it was out in cinemas! Actually i hope that todays generation wont look at it!Not really good film to enjoy or be interested in..........",The Good Son
18,vincentlynch-moonoi,Top notch thriller,8,11 June 2015,"First off, there are a few problems with this movie. Let's tackle them first. Could the directors please decide how much snow was on the ground. One minute it was fairly deep snow even in the woods. The next scene you saw mostly grass. It became so inconsistent that it actually bothered and distracted me. Would parents really allow a boy to have a tree house quite as precarious as the one shown? The third issue I had was with the ""physicality"" of the conclusion. I do not believe a normal human could have not fallen all the way down off the cliff. I do not believe an average woman could have climbed back up the cliff.Okay, so those are the problem around which you must suspend belief. But then again, how many are out there where you don't have to suspend belief? So, that's okay.I suppose there are people who wonder if any 12 year old could be as intellectually ""evil"" as Henry. As a retired principal of a junior high/middle school, let me assure that in that regard this film is not that much of a stretch.I think this film is a great thriller. It shows how helpless children can be when adults don't listen. It shows how even at a young age a mind can be terribly messed up.Elijah Wood is top notch here in his child-actor years. Too bad he hasn't remained as cute as he was back then, but then again he's done okay with an estimated net worth of $30 million. Macaulay Culkin turns in a truly creepy performance, although not as creepy as the rest of his real life turned out being.Wendy Crewson is very believable as the mom; fine performance. David Morse is one of those dependable character actors that does nicely here in a rather small (though key) role. Same for Jacqueline Brookes -- quite dependable as a character actress; I always enjoyed seeing her on screen.I'm going to give this film an ""8"", which is unusual for me, but it is so far above the recent crap that has come out as ""thrillers"". This is a winner; forget that Culkin messed up his later life and enjoy him from his brief golden years as a child actor. But you'll probably enjoy Elijah Wood's performance even more.",The Good Son
19,ironhorse_iv,"The Good Son was a good movie in my opinion. Still, it's no kid movie. .",7,2 August 2013,"This movie is one of my guilty pleasure. I just love the inner battle between two of the best child actors of the 1990's. Both, Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Woods are wonderful in the roles, they play in this film. Some critics might hate this movie because of the controversy of having the 1990's Home Alone play such an evil role. I didn't mind, because it's shows how great Macaulay Culkin can act. Who knew that the Home Alone kid could be so creepy? And the horrid part is that he looked so natural playing a scheming, serial-killing kid. Directed by Joseph Ruben, the movie starts with 12-year-old Mark Evan (Elijah Wood) having to move to Maine to stay with his Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) after one of his parents has die, and the other is on an oversea trip. While, there he meets with their son, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). They slowly become good friends, but after a series of sinister acts by Henry, Mark starts to question their friendship as he thinks that Henry might be more dangerous than what he seems. Too bad, that none of the adults believe him. Elijah Wood is just amazing actor when he was younger. He is a winner early on in his career and the proof is in this role. His eyes convey such fear and concern that you really feel his performance is for real. The two stars have great chemistry together. They work with each other so well, I thought this story could have been a real life story. Trust me, why the movie might not seem real. I heard news stories of very evil children doing awful things to each other, without the adults knowing. So it's not so far fetch like some critics panned it to be. The settling in Maine, makes it seem like the movie was written by Stephen King. Surprising it wasn't. A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. That explain more about Henry's backstory. The book also concludes differently from the movie that interesting to read. The screen writing by Ian McEwan might be a bit over the top and pretty exaggerated in the film. Even if a child is a sociopath, it still has a child's vocabulary, intelligence, etc. Just being a sociopath doesn't mean you sound like Hannibal Lecter right from the womb. Also, they tend to master the art of acting and sounding normal, which is how they make their way through life without people cluing in. Granted Henry is pretty young and may not have learned those skills yet, but this movie really stretches reality with how obviously unsettled he is and the fact that even people trained to recognize a disturbed child can't see him. The actions he did doesn't seem too far from what an evil child might have done. It's hammed up, but it's no different from any other evil bad seed film like 2009's Orphan and 1956's Bad Seed. Yes, the film was inappropriate for children, but it never was for kids. It's a thriller, and a scary movie. So for Robert Ebert to call the film a creepy, unpleasant experience. I think the movie did its purpose. It's not supposed to make you feel lovely, it's a horror movie. I don't understand why people think this movie is any different than other horror films. At less, this horror movie was smart. I love the final action scene at the end of the cliffs. In my opinion, it's one of my favorite fight scenes in the 1990s. It's get more intense, when a hard choice was given to one of the main characters. I wouldn't spoil it for you. The music by Elmer Bernstein was chilling and works for the intense moments. In my opinion, this R film isn't that bad. Yes, it has children fighting, harsh language, and smoking, but it's not as gory as 1984's Children of the Corn, and 1976's the Omen. This movie could had been rated PG-13 with a few edits. The DVD transfer is good. So it's worth finding this movie, it's has a lot of DVD extras worth checking out. Overall: This film isn't for the faint of heart conservative watchers. You have to open to anything, even if it's seems odd for a child to act this way. Once you get pass that, you will realize that this movie isn't as bad as what some critics say it is. You find yourself, cheering Elijah Wood on with this thriller as the story takes you in. You find out that the film is badly overlook and panned by critics just angry because at the time Culkin was American darling at the time and they believe that he shouldn't play a bad seed at the time. It's like watching 1930's horror movie with Shirley Temple as an evil daughter. People are just typecasting the child actor to only family friendly roles. The Good Son is a rare gem of a horror movie that needs to be check out again. It's a good movie, and it's good enough for me.",The Good Son
20,The-Sarkologist,Way to predictable for a Thriller,5,3 March 2012,"This movie is a movie about a boy with two sides. On one side he appears to be a reasonably good boy who occasionally gets into trouble, but deep down, he is wickedly evil. We explore the psyche of the good son, Henry (MacCauly Culkin), through the eyes of the child Mark (Elijah Woods). Mark recently lost his mother, but his father had to go to Tokyo to conduct a business deal. He arranged to leave Mark with his brother while he was away, and thus Mark came to know his cousin Henry.The first time you glimpse the evil of Henry is when Mark slips and Henry grabs him and says ""If I let go, do you think you could fly."" This statement is important for it shows us the nature of Henry. He says that he came to realise that there were no boundaries and thus you could do anything. He kills animals without remorse, but this is nothing compared to what he does with Mr Highway.This movie tries to question what evil is, and if it exists. Henry is definitely evil, but also incredibly intelligent. His intelligence is what makes him evil for he is able to manipulate the situation so that he is always in control. Yet he is not for there is a essence of doubt in his mother's mind, and it is this doubt the slowly reveals Henry to be what it is.The Good Son has the makings of a brilliant movie with brilliant themes, yet it is not there. I knew that Henry was responsible for his brother Richard's death, and it was not a surprise when the evidence arose. There was a rubber duck which plays an important role in the movie, but only exists for a few minutes. Henry's character is brilliant, but the ideas and the images in the movie don't exist. They speak of flying twice in the movie, yet it seems to be major aspect of Henry's evil nature. This movie was not suspenseful, nor did the plot twist. It was open and predictable and probably only good to watch once and forget. I would not even suggest this movie for die hard Macauly Culkin fans for his character is incredibly different than he is in his other movies, such as Home Alone I & II.",The Good Son
21,paulclaassen,Good suspense thriller.,6,3 May 2020,"I have such fond memories of seeing this when I was much younger. I'm so glad to see my opinion of the movie remains unchanged having seen it again after such a long time.Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin are very good in their respective roles. Culkin was an interesting choice as the psychopathic, evil child, as he was famous for portraying the 'cute kid' at the time. The film casually sets up the scene, and then slowly but surely reveals itself for what it really is. Evil presents itself in the form of a kid, making it even more sinister.Every action is justified by a counter action. It's also believable that no-one believes Mark (Wood), considering what he's been through. This is a carefully thought out, well written script that builds to a nerve-wrecking finale.",The Good Son

23,elshikh4,Bad Clint Eastwood Movie (!!),5,23 March 2009,"(Joseph Ruben) is one of my favorites. He's a real professional director who always delivers his job so attractively. Nearly all of the cinematic factors here were excellent; (John Lindley)'s classy cinematography, (Elmer Bernstein)'s grand music, but remember that I said ""nearly all"", as some, more deep, factors weren't that excellent. Just imagine a movie where everything was right except the story and the performance, aka: It's one of the ugliest ironies!It was so over the top story, therefore the performance became unbelievable itself. Sure the thrill was super, but everything seemed written for older characters, the climatic sequence was forced, and the story ends as a very cheap horror's end where the monster must be destroyed for the good of mankind. Actually the last scene is one reason to make any American fan of it appreciate the Indian cinema's exaggerations better!(Elijah Wood) was too goggle-eyed to scary extent, and so unconvincing while playing the youngest truth seeker EVER (younger than Nancy Drew!). And although he was 12 year old, but he looked even younger, which added more fuel to the fire. Some of his scenes could make you laugh if only you'd think about them!(Eastwood) was never younger, shorter, or weaker. He handed in a poor performance, where even his charisma didn't serve him right. He's acting all the time, and I mean it in a bad way, like imitating his own familiar impressions but coldly. Though, I won't blame him alone, since the whole case is blamable. This script put him in some situations that pushed us totally out of the mood to just not believe, and the beautiful directing even got the matter worse, making the ugly irony.It's interesting example for a technically very well made photo with everything absurd in it. Like good melody, bad lyrics and singing. It didn't set a new personality for itself, where the kid could be psycho killer, No, it wanted to be only the hot, and flat, Hollywood thriller but with new ""ages"" this time. To look eventually like a parody of psychological thriller, however with kids instead, or one of Problem Child's movies that filled the first half of the 1990s like (Home Alone, Problem Child, Dennis the Menace, Clifford..), but without laughs!I pity only (Ruben)'s efforts.",The Good Son
24,kevin_robbins,There's nothing I'd change about this film. This is an underrated gem,9,29 October 2021,"The Good Son (1993) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a young man who recently lost his mother. His father needs to go on a business trip and thinks it would be good for the boy to stay with his aunt and uncle and their two kids near his age. The young boy of the aunt and uncle has some curiosities that ar first seem fun to both cousins but get morbid quick. This movie is directed by Joseph Ruben (Dreamscape) and stars Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone), Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), David Morse (The Green Mile) and Wendy Crewson (Air Force One). The storyline for this is absolutely brilliant and perfectly delivered. The character development for both families is well established. The cast delivers awesome performances, especially Wood and Culkin. The script is very good and helps establish how menacing and ruthless Culkin is in the film. The action scenes are excellent and as ruthless as Culkin's dialogue. The is a film you get mesmerized by the characters and understand how the truth would be impossible to believe by the parents only making matters worse. The conclusion of this film is classic and sheer perfection. There's nothing I'd change about this film. This is an underrated gem I'd score a 9/10.",The Good Son

27,barnabyrudge,"Quite nasty in tone, and badly made to boot.",3,20 November 2003,"You can imagine the pitch: ""hey, let's get that Home Alone kid and use his mischievous persona to disguise the fact that he's a psychopathic killer"". In fact, handled better with greater attention to the build up of suspense, this could've been a disturbing and exciting thriller. As it is, it's just a rather uneven, suspense-free misfire with the added flaw that it's also in howling bad taste. Elijah Wood plays a young boy who has to spend a few weeks at his aunt's house. Here he befriends his teenaged cousin (Macauley Culkin) and the two of them are soon up to the usual pranks that young boys entertain themselves with. However, Wood gradually learns that Culkin's pranks are neither good natured nor harmless - in fact, the teenaged tearaway is a raging psychopath who gets a buzz from his acts of cruelty. Just as Wood prepares to tell his aunt the truth, Culkin realises that his sadistic secret is out, so he issues young Elijah with a stern ultimatum - tell anyone the truth and you're dead....literally! Culkin is very unconvincing as a teenaged murderer, but that's not the biggest flaw with this thriller. As mentioned earlier, it's a very uneven film and this is the main weakness with it. It starts out as a nostalgic look at mischievous youth but suddenly turns very nasty. The change of tone causes all kinds of problems: 1. It makes the film seem terribly jarring; 2. it renders the events in the film's first half pointless; 3. it transforms the film from a drama rooted in reality to an unbelievable and over-the-top melodrama; and 4. it makes the structure of the film seem clumsy and amateurish. The music by Elmer Bernstein is probably the best point in this one, but it must be said that the music is composed in a dramatic and stirring way and actually creates the impression that more is going on than is actually the case.",The Good Son
28,dwpollar,Manipulative evil child movie was too predictable...,3,14 May 2010,"1st watched 5/11/2010 -- 3 out of 10 (Dir-Joseph Ruben): Manipulative evil child movie was too predictable from the very beginning as we knew the McCauley Culkin character was going to turn evil eventually and it happened as we expected about 1/4 of the way in the movie. The excellent child actor, Elijah Wood, was thrown into this Culkin star-vehicle(with his sister and brother also having cameos) as the good kid that no-one believes and he's fine in the movie. Culkin and the story, though, are predictable -- as I said before. Sure, he can play evil, but we knew that from the Home Alone movies. The title is kind of confusing because the movie is about a child(who is not a son), played by Wood, who's mother dies and he has to live with a cousin while he's away on a business trip. The kids play like mischievous young boys initially and then the Culkin character kills a neighborhood dog with a rigged together gun and everything begins to fall apart. Woods' character then starts suspecting that the Culkin character is going to take out everyone that's left one by one(as he did his younger son) and he starts trying to do that. The Culkin character tries to pretend that the Wood character is the confused one and gets a few adults to believe him but the mother eventually figures everything out. This predictable mess is one to miss unless you just want to see the young Culkin in an ""R"" rated movie.",The Good Son

I just saw this movie on Saturday night, and in my opinion, THE GOOD SON is an excellent psychological thriller that will have you guessing and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. When I saw Connie (Quinn Culkin), I had a gut feeling it was her. This was because I asw her name in the opening credits. If you ask me, Mark (Elijah Wood) was really gutsy to stand up to that little devil, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Macaulay Culkin or Elijah Wood, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today.",The Good Son

31,drownnnsoda,"Suspenseful, Well Written, and Realistic.",8,13 January 2007,"I saw this film years ago when I was fairly young (around ten years old) and I remember enjoying it quite a bit. ""The Good Son"" is about Mark (Elijah Wood), a young child who recently lost his mother to cancer. During the winter break, Mark goes to stay with his aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson), his uncle, and cousins at their large seaside house on the chilly coastline of Maine. The oldest son, Henry (Macauly Culkin) befriends Mark and the two become fairly good pals. But Mark begins to become suspicious about Henry's true self when he begins to display murderous intentions, especially toward his younger sister. Not to mention that Henry's infant brother drowned under mysterious circumstances a year earlier. With nobody willing to believe Mark (dismissing him as a troubled boy who is suffering the loss of his mother), he finds himself responsible to stop Henry from trying to take the lives of his family and reveal the true dark side of his manipulative sociopathic personality.An intriguing thriller in the vein of the 1956 horror film ""The Bad Seed"", ""The Good Son"" is a very smart and inventive horror/thriller. The plot is really interesting and I liked the film's set up to begin with. There aren't many movies out there dealing with psychotic children, so seeing this is really interesting and refreshing. The main characters are children, so the actors who play these characters need to be believable enough to carry the film, and both Culkin and Wood achieve this very easily. The supporting cast consisted mainly of Wendy Crewson as Henry's mother (who is also very good) and Culkin's real life little sister, playing his little sister on screen. The cinematography in the film is very nice, and the cold, rocky, gray-toned Maine landscape benefits to the film's overall atmosphere and gives it a very dark and menacing feel.The suspense factor is very strong. It builds up fairly slowly until the finale, which is a real cliff-hanger, literally. There are some pretty eerie sequences in the film that will have you on the edge of your seat (especially the hide-and-go-seek game in the pitch-black house that takes place between the kids). Culkin brings the evil character to life, and does it well. After seeing him in his sweet role in the ""Home Alone"" films, this is quite a contrast, but he proves that he can play versatile characters. His character is probably the most interesting thing about this movie, and the film is really just an insight into the mind of psychotic children. We know he's evil, we don't know when he's going to strike, but we know that nobody knows about his true evil self besides Mark. The character study is very interesting and the chemistry between the two is great.Overall, ""The Good Son"" is an excellent thriller that won't disappoint you. It has plenty of suspense, some great shock moments, breathtaking cinematography, and all-around good acting. Not to mention the very good (and believable) writing also. Definitely recommended, one of the better thrillers you'll find out there. 8/10.",The Good Son

Both can be unpredictable and hard to manage. It is very hard to get good direction from a horse or a cow or even a 10 year old that doesn't want to act in front of the camera because he is tired or hungry. The Good Son is one of the best movies with the stars of the film both being younger than 13. Wood and Culkin lead this small cast in this dramatic drama of murder, lies, and coming of age youth in a beautiful, yet dead setting.Culkin gives his first real performance as an actor as Wood feeds off Culkin's presence. Both actors have you hanging off the edge of your seat as the story grows into a conflict after another conflict. A must see if you are a fan of Wood or Culkin. A true drama.",The Good Son
33,Spleen,A good sign,7,23 July 1999,"In many ways this is just a standard thriller.  How I loathe the word ""thriller"".  It suggests roller-coasters; and the genre it denotes, at its best, deals in quiet tension.  Where was I?  Yes: standard thriller.  A is really an evil person, intent on performing great harm in the future; B knows this but can't convince anyone else.  I heard that sigh.  But make A and B children, on the verge of adolescence, and not only is this tired formula invigorated, but it makes a great deal more sense.  (Especially if B is in the slightly awkward position of a cousin on an extended visit.) The creaky old scenes where B goes to the police and either he is strangely incoherent or the police are strangely obtuse, are gone.  There is now a perfectly good reason why B can't go to the police, or indeed anyone.  Nor is there anything strange about the obtuseness of A's parents.  The rotten adult seems so commonplace that we scarcely bat an eyelid; the rotten child, who is in fact far more commonplace, we like to pretend doesn't exist.So I'm glad Hollywood took this step.  I also, for the most part, like the way the step has been taken.  B has no accomplices - he must battle A alone - and his plight is keenly felt.  There's an air of plausibility about it all.  Elijah Wood is an unusually good boy, Macaulay Culkin is an unusually bad boy; both look perfectly real.  (Wood, who has the harder task, does especially well.)The climax - or what is meant to be the climax - is HIGHLY contrived.  It will probably come as a shock that the writers chose something at once so obvious and so ludicrous.  The mood of the audience I saw this with - it may just have been my mood - was one of grudging acceptance, granted only because we had been treated so well in the events leading up to it.",The Good Son
34,Sandcooler,Too lazy,6,15 November 2008,"This movie just had it all. Well, maybe not all, but at least it had that solid theme of some harmless looking person is evil and only one person knows it and he tells everybody but nobody believes him and everybody thinks he's crazy. You can build an entire movie around that, you could call it ""Arlington Road"". Only what spoils the fun here is the ending, which comes straight out of any made for TV-thriller. They followed the formula pretty well, but then when creativity had to be involved it all went to hell. It just feels really empty, like the movie just stopped. The ""good son"" has been intelligent throughout the entire movie and managed to put Mark in a position where his life sucked, then just drops the ball all of a sudden. If I was ever going to write a movie that had this theme I would never ever go for a happy ending. Just doesn't fit, the dark one has to get away with it in the end.

When his mum dies from cancer Mark's dad needs psychiatric help and sends Mark to stay with his aunt Susan and Uncle Wallace in Pittsburgh for a few weeks. They own a huge home near the ocean, with tons of places to play and old buildings everywhere. Marks befriends his cousin Henry, who is his age. They both play around like normal kids, but then some trouble starts. Henry purposely shoots a neighbor's dog with a potato gun, killing it. The next day Mark is introduced to ""Mr. Highway-Man"", a stuffed man the same size as a real human, and Henry acts out Highway-man's pretend suicide, shoving the fake man over a bridge and causing ten cars to crash. Mark becomes especially fearful for his cousin Connie, and also learns of the reason Susan likes him so much... she had a little boy of her own, Richard, who mysteriously drowned in the bathtub years ago. The Good Son appears to mimic the 1956 classic ""the Bad Seed"". Henry acts sweet and innocent at times, but alone he becomes a monster. It was rather funny seeing Miles, the little boy who hung around with Buck in ""Uncle Buck"", as a psychopath. Henry killed Richard, his own baby brother, over a rubber duck! Wow, kid, they sell those at the Dollarama! The music was a bit sappy at times, but is still a good soundtrack. The plot is pretty solid, though it never really explains Henry's disgusting behavior. Mark's last moments with his dying mom were very sad. The acting was excellent throughout the whole film. ""The Good Son"" was remade in 2009 as ""Orphan"", where a Russian adopted girl wrecks a seemingly picture-perfect family.

Problem is, no one will believe Wood. Th ending, involving a life or death struggle on a cliff with jagged rocks and cold Maine waters far below, has been done before, but is no less effective here. But the film is hurt by Culkin's one-note performance. The HOME ALONE star was clearly cast against type here, and he's not up to it. I did not believe for one minute this kid is a killer. Culkin just doesn't have the acting chops to pull it off. Wood might have been able to, but not Culkin. And you'll notice who's a big star today and who has disappeared from sight. Need I say more?

Kevin is, however, a good kid. This is what Kevin could be like if he was evil. Why do I say this? Because the diabolic kid of this film is portrayed by the same boy, Macaulay Culkin. If Kevin was like this, he would have killed his family and Harry and Marv...Ironically, the movie's title refers precisely to Culkin's character instead of Elijah Wood's character (who really is the good son). And why is that? Put it this way: because that's the image his family and people in general have of him and because they don't know his disturbing nature.Mac shows his other side as an actor - that is, his ""dark side"". And he is excellent as Henry, a child who can be described as a sociopath, a psychopath, a cold-blooded murderer and mentally ill. Henry is also a perfect actor - he manages to keep his true nature in secret because of his angelical looks and apparent love and respect for the family and others. This is a completely different role for Mac, setting it apart from the others and leaving behind his 'Home Alone' image.Mac, who we are more used to see as a comedy actor with a beautiful smile, here he does some extremely cold facial expressions of dark jealousy. His character Henry also displays aggressive and violent behavior, as we see in some scenes.Elijah Wood is great as Mark. Here we see a younger Elijah Wood (when he was a kid), years before 'becoming' Frodo Baggins. Elijah was a cute kid too. Quinn Culkin is equally good as Connie and she was cute too.This film is quite short, which is a good thing. But it shares the same problem of 'Mikey': we never really get to know how did Henry become so bad. We have an idea when he says «It was mine before it was his» (refering to the rubber duck) and that he became very jealous of his brother Richard and killed him, but is that all? I doubt that's all.It's always shocking to see a child doing the horrible things that Henry does, but this movie is considerably less violent comparing to 'Mikey'. Henry is also less dangerous than Mikey, but don't get me wrong - that doesn't mean that Henry isn't dangerous - he is. It's like they say for this movie - «Evil has many faces» - and the headline for 'Mikey' could be applied here as well - «With evil, size doesn't matter».The ending is an unexpected surprise for those who watch this for the first time. Henry pays for all his crimes by being dropped off a high cliff and then we see his dead body being swept away by the sea waves.The soundtrack is entirely instrumental and consists of beautiful and soft pieces of music. Plus, the sceneries of this movie are a must. We see many beautiful settings and landscapes full of snow (this takes place somewhere in Winter time). Not to mention that Henry's house is lovely.Overall, an okay movie, but not one with enough attributes to become a ""classic"".",The Good Son

Similar films include ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" and ""Sleeping With The Enemy"". Macaulay Culkin, fresh from doing two ""Home Alone"" films which made him famous ""Home Alone"" 1990 and ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York"" (1992), flexes his versatile acting muscles in the role of a maladjusted, duplicitous, murderous son, Henry. Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, the good son, whose lost his mother to cancer. He is sent away to live with his uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan. Their son Richard dies mysteriously in the bathtub. Initially, Mark and Henry get along and become playmates. But Henry has twisted ideas of fun, such as threatening to throw Mark from the top of a high tree house, throwing a dummy ""Mr. Highway"" from an overpass into a highway, killing the neighbor's dog with a crossbow. Eventually, Henry confesses to Mark that he killed Richard in the bathtub, jealous that the parents were spending more attention to him. When Henry's sister Connie nearly suffers the same fate, Mark tells Wallace and Susan that Henry is not the innocent, sweet boy they think he is. They don't believe Mark as they believe he's only acting out his frustrations after his mother's death. But Susan discovers the rubber duckie that was lost the night of Richard's bathtub death, proving that Henry is the possible killer. There is much to admire about this disturbing film about sibling rivalry. The cinematography is a mixture of gorgeous seaside landscapes with steep cliffs, as if to represent the precarious and wild nature of Henry. The secret tree house is a corruption of his childhood. The music by Elmer Bernstein is effectively dramatic and dissonant in the right moments. Even if at the end of the day, this film is typical of the thriller-trash prevalent of films of the early 90's, it is still highly dramatic and compelling. Look for Macaulay Culkin's own siblings- Quinn Culkin who played Connie and Rory Culkin who played Richard- make cameos. The climax comes on in the end, when Susan must decide what son to save from death, this coming after the discovery of her own biological son's evil nature. This film is rated R, and should not be viewed by young children. The film borders on sensationalism but Macaulay Culkin does a fine job at his age and the nightmarish movie does evoke a haunting ""what if"" premise. 10 stars well deserved.",The Good Son

43,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10),5,12 February 2019,"The mistake most people make with this movie is in comparing it to the ""Home Alone"" movies - they are completely different from each other. Unfortunately, that mistake is largely due to the fact that they cast Macaulay Culkin as the evil son in this rather tame thriller in the first place - meaning, had they cast anyone else as Henry, the film would have been much better.This is the story of a young boy, Mark (Elijah Wood), who just lost his mother to illness, and has to go live with his Uncle and his family out of necessity for a couple of weeks. When he arrives, he meets his cousin, Henry (Culkin) and right away things seem off with him. His Uncle's family is dealing with their own loss, having just lost their youngest son to a drowning accident. As Mark and Henry spend time together, Henry's dark side begins to emerge leading both boys down a path toward a cliffhanger ending - quite literally.This was an ""okay"" film, nothing special, and in fact, quite forgettable. As I mentioned at the outset, Culkin was completely miscast which really threw the entire movie off kilter. We were all too focused in on him rather than the story itself - and frankly, his performance was not at all convincing. I think more people were shocked with the fact that Macaulay Culkin dropped the F-Bomb in this movie rather than what a creepy kid he was playing. Take Culkin out and put in another fine child actor, and this movie works. Elijah Wood didn't do badly, but he followed the formula of an adult playing similar roles - and when I heard the little narrative he has just before the end credits, it just didn't ring true.This one is not a recommend. If you should find it available to watch on a quiet evening, it will do. It might even entertain you, but it will not scare or thrill you. I always thought it was ironic that Elijah Wood's career took off after this movie, and Macaulay Culkin's practically died.",The Good Son
44,nitzanhavoc,"Genius acting, top level characters, no use of cheats at all! One of the best ever!",9,24 November 2012,"One of the best things about being a Horror freak is discovering these little Easter egg surprises in ""old"" films. This time, I had the pleasure of finding Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood as little kids, playing in one of the most disturbing, unnerving and well made Thrillers I've ever seen.Not using any cheats at all (I mean none - no sudden loud music that would force the audience to jump, no nude shots, no cellphone without a battery or signal and no cars that won't start), The Good Son derived its Horror aspect from pure reality. There's nothing supernatural or involving esoteric theories. Just a blunt and slightly exaggerated case of Psychopathy in children. Good ol' fashion uneasy horror!The acting is wonderful and almost flawless! David Morse (Mark's father Jack) and Daniel Hugh Kelly's characters weren't given enough screen time to really have depth, and I found Morse's acting to be slightly unconvincing (he didn't really make me feel like he was a recently widowed father). Besides that - nothing but praises. Wendy Crewson was excellent as Susan Evans, little Quinn Culkin (Macaulay's sister) was quite impressive as Connie Evans (especially the pond scene, that took some talent and probably lots of practice), and Jacqueline Brookes really managed to portray the elderly kind-hearted and empathetic psychiatrist Alice Devenport. As for the two ""stars"" - Elijah Wood seemed to have been made for the role of Mark, the kid who had recently lost his mother. His big round eyes, when wearing a sad expression, are a secret weapon for any director. His laughter immediately made me think of his role as Frodo Baggins, and reminded me of his great talent of depicting the full spectrum of emotions (although for that one must also bear in mind his role as the cannibal killer in Sin City). And for the grand finale - Macaulay Culkin. Dear God, I'll never be able to view Home Alone/Richi Rich/The Pagemaster the same way! Talk about a talented kid actor with many faces... Culkin's acting as ""evil"" Sociopath non-caring Henry Evans was creepy and disturbing to the point of being truly horrific! Try to count how many time he really smiled, and in which situations. Macaulay Culkin was the single most disturbing ""evil child"" I've seen so far, more that any of the Children of the Corn or The Children cast.The story was also profound, and the events that described Mark's relationship with Henry were realistic, reasonable, clear and horrifying. None of the scenes felt redundant or forced in any way, and some of them were as sad and touching as the others were creepy and bone chilling. My only slight small problem was the with the final scene. Without giving any spoilers, it simply felt unrealistic and I didn't think it could happen that way in real life. Though you might disagree.All in all - I don't think I have anything bad to say about this film. I'd have given it a 10 had I not felt biased due to Culkin and Wood's other roles which I've seen prior to this film. However, even if you haven't seen any of them in action before - if you're a Children Horror/Thriller fan you simply cannot let yourself pass on this one. Extremely highly recommended!",The Good Son
45,Scars_Remain,Not A Bad Little Thriller,7,28 July 2008,"I've heard about this movie for years but I have never decided to check it out until this past weekend. I thought it was going to be average 90's crap with not much going for it at all. I was wrong and I'm glad I was. It was actually very creepy and atmospheric with a lot of very intense scenes and fantastic build ups.Macaulay Culkin is very good as the disturbed son. I thought that Wood was great as well and the rest of the cast was pretty good but some of the parents' roles were a little iffy. I thought the story was well done and interesting and most of all, kept me entertained.This is a movie that would go good on a rainy afternoon. It's not brilliant but it is interesting and pretty creepy.",The Good Son
46,Ddey65,"Scary,...and for the wrong reasons.",3,14 February 2004,"By the time ""The Good Son"" came out, Macaulay Culkin's overexposed shocked appearance in posters for ""Home Alone""(1990), was making a few people sick, and I wouldn't doubt for one second that he was tired of the typecasting as cute little kids. Like many I though he should've chose a better part than this, regardless of how well he pulled it off. The real thing that's scary about this movie is not the chilling performance by Culkin, but the way it reinforces the anti-youth hysteria that was plaguing the United States in the 1990's. The scene where Henry Evans(Culkin) confides in his cousin Mark (Elijah Wood) that his youth and innocent demeanor makes it easy to do anything is just one example of this message. They think that just because kids get shorter jail sentences that they have an easier time there and have a better chance of being ""rehabilitated"" than adult criminals, so we have to be outrageously harder on them than adult criminals. They also think kids who have run-ins with the law are automatically guilty, and overlook issues like self-defense or the idea of kids being driven or forced into lives of crime, and even dismissing the idea of giving them a fair trial.
This movie along with ""Wag the Dog""(1997) a few years later, proves it's not kids who believe everything they see on television and in the movies, but us adults.",The Good Son
47,cosmic_quest,Dark insight into sociopathic children,6,27 March 2006,"I think part of the reason why 'The Good Son' is barely remembered is because it deals with a side to humanity that no-one really wants to accept in that not all children are sweet little innocents, pure as the driven snow. It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths-- people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others-- are born, not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark, a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan and two cousins, twelve-year-old Henry and six-year-old Connie. At first, Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark, violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.Macaulay Culkin was excellent as the angelic-looking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood, only eleven years old when he filmed this, delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation, hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.However, one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene without giving you a feel for the other characters, which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it's all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark's budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan's growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.Overall, this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller (although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way) and it is nice to see a film that doesn't take a softly-softly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However, the ending was a bit of a cop-out as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry (what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent, loving families deal with such a child?). Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.",The Good Son
48,D_Burke,"""The Good Son"" Is Wrong On So Many Levels, and Should Have Never Been Made",3,11 April 2011,"""The Good Son"" is original to a certain extent, provided you don't compare it to ""Single White Female"" (1992), ""The Omen"" (1977), or ""Cape Fear"" (1962 or 1991). The movie has elements of all those films, but its disturbing factor, which should be the selling part of the movie, is focused upon so much that many other elements in the story are ignored entirely as the movie progresses. What results is a mess of a movie that, at the time of its release, appealed to the wrong demographic entirely.Macaulay Culkin got the headlining credit, even though Elijah Wood is really the lead actor and the moral compass of the story. For those who don't remember the early '90's, Culkin and Wood were the top child stars of cinema who were compared frequently. They were like Pepsi & Coke, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, Britney & Christina, etc. You would think the first movie they would star in together would appeal to kids.That's the bad part: ""The Good Son"", as a result of incorrect marketing, appealed highly to kids upon its release in 1993, even though it was rightfully rated R. Being a fan of the two actors, particularly Culkin, when I was a kid, I remember seeing the movie's poster with Culkin's face displayed prominently, & thinking ""Cool, another Macaulay Culkin movie! I have to see this!"" I was later bummed to find out that the movie was rated R. I have no doubt, however, that millions of kids my age felt the exact same way I did.It was just wrong to cast two well-known child actors in these dark roles. It would be one thing if the child actors were unknowns, but since Culkin made a name for himself with the hugely popular ""Home Alone"" films, kids wanted to see whatever movie he was in. It was the equivalent of casting Miley Cyrus in ""Requim for a Dream"" and putting a large poster of her face above Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's faces. Kids would want to see it regardless of the subject matter, and adults wouldn't want to necessarily see it because it has a kid's star in it.I saw it years after it came out, when I was old enough to watch R-rated movies. When I saw it the first time, I admit that I liked it. After seeing it recently as a mature adult, the movie has some major problems.Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, a child whose mother has just died. His father (David Morse), immediately following the funeral, goes on a business trip and promises his son that he'll return and spend more time with him, thereby creating a giant plot hole nearly ten minutes into the film. Why didn't his father take time off after the death of his wife? Why would he leave his grieving son alone!?!Regardless, his father takes him to his uncle's house to stay until he returns. Mark's Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) seem normal, which is why you wonder how their son Henry (Macaulay Culkin), who is Mark's age, became so messed up. You learn as the film progresses and Mark & Henry spend so much time together that Henry is one unbelievably sociopathic 10-year-old. He kills innocent animals with a crossbow he made himself, throws a mannequin off a bridge into traffic just to see the cars crash, and repeatedly tries to kill his younger sister Connie (Quinn Culkin). All the while, Henry's parents, while they are good people and not abusive or inattentive, manage to be completely oblivious to their son being a reincarnation of Ted Bundy.It's not unbelievable that a kid can act like this. I'm sure there are kids this messed up, but they probably have far less attentive parents. My problem with this film is that in a town as small as the one they live in, how could no one besides Wood's character see Henry pulling these dangerous pranks? The movie really loses its credibility in the last 20 minutes, when Henry's true intentions come to light by way of (and I am not making this up) a rubber duckie! It goes without saying that when the favorite bath toy of Ernie from ""Sesame Street"" is the primary motive for Henry's madness, there is just no room for method.After that part, the climactic show-down is just entirely contrived, not to mention hokey and completely stupid! The voice over at the end then leaves the movie on such a questionable note that it's incredibly unbelievable that the movie was made in the first place.It was one of the MPAA's smartest moves to rate this movie R, but it was absolutely wrong, not to mention immoral, of the production company to market Culkin as much as they did. It's a dark film, but that's really all it is. It could have been so much better, and if someone else beside Culkin (and maybe Wood too) had been cast in it, the intended audience of this film would not have been distracted. My guess is, however, that 20th Century Fox, who released this movie, worried less about an audience and more about money. They probably didn't care that some parents managed to succumb to their kids' demands to see this movie, and probably regretted it later.",The Good Son
49,Casey-52,"The modern revision of ""The Bad Seed"" almost delivers",8,24 May 2000,"Many people believed in the early 90s (the heyday of Macaulay Culkin) that Culkin was the spawn of the devil. So it was perfectly fitting that he play an evil boy who is obsessed with violence and death. A semi-remake of ""The Bad Seed"", Culkin does his best at being terrifying and even says his first on-screen f**k (""Don't f**k with me!""), but falls short too many times to be believable. Elijah Wood steals the show, an accomplished actor as a character who is taken from one desperate situation (his mother has just recently died) and thrown into another (trapped in a house with his psychotic cousin). He has more scenes than Culkin, steals every scene from Culkin, and is a very likable character. The same can't be said for Culkin, who if anything annoys the viewer. Word has it that he only got this role because his crazy father blackmailed FOX by saying Culkin wouldn't make ""Home Alone 2"" until he made ""The Good Son"". Culkin does seem very out-of-place and uncomfortable in some scenes, letting us know that his forte is comedy, not horror. A few good chilling scenes (the frantic skating on the lake, the cliff-hanging (literally) finale), but overall, nothing to shout about. Culkin's sister plays Culkin's sister and Culkin's brother plays Culkin's dead brother in a picture, if you care.",The Good Son
50,BadWebDiver,Good little unusual thriller for the time.,6,31 July 2003,"This is a good little escapist thriller which surprised me at the time, since Hollywood seemed a bit priggish in the late 80s/early 90s about child actors and the roles they played.Elijah Wood makes a good protagonist in this story, but his character seems to be the type that has a flashing neon sign over his head saying; ""Hey all you psychos and villains - if you're looking for an easy target there's one standing RIGHT HERE!!! I'll believe anything anyone tells me; and I've carefully arranged it so no-one will take a word I say seriously when I eventually do panic about the imminent peril I'm in. So come an' geddit boys - I'm wide open!!!""Macaulay on the other hand I thought was totally brilliant. His deadpan expression throughout this story makes the perfect psycho. I think his inherent comic ability helped him portray this character- since he knows how to give the impression of something going on without actually having to spell it out. He gives such a cold look that gives very little away -and it allows the viewer to conjure up all sort of nasty things that are going on inside.(Spoiler warning)But frankly at the end, I was thinking the Mother should have dropped both of them and saved the trouble of making a decision.",The Good Son
51,OneAnjel,Well-acted startling thriller,8,27 October 2021,"The Good Son is a classic psychological thriller. I saw it when it came out and watched it again here in 2021. It was riveting the first time and still a compelling film the second time around. Both young actors do an excellent job and, despite the rest of the characters being relative unknowns, the director gets the mood and tension just right. While Good Son probably could be said to have finally given Elijah Wood his big break, Culkin makes this film with his deadpan emotion and expert delivery.There's such shock in the actions that Henry takes but the film moves along well to the point that rarely do we stop and ask why his behavior has never been in question previously. He's obviously been abusive to his sister, for instance. But like all good sociopaths, he's adept at covering by creating the illusion that his accuser is the actual perpetrator. I've experienced this first-hand with an adult sociopath.The first time around, the ending was much more tense. Knowing the outcome, I was able to observe things to criticize in how it was set up and executed but still a wild and shocking finale. Although the line at the very end seems out of place and unnecessary. Even a bit bizarre being so out of character to what we just witnessed. It would have been more appropriate to simply pan out from the cliff and end the film.But overall, while this obviously will remind many of The Bad Seed (originally made into a film in 1956 based on a novel by William March), this is a completely different story.I've actually never seen Home Alone despite that Culkin was a good friend to someone dear to me. But people saying Culkin played a cute kid in that and this film is a big leap for him could be argued. Culkin plays a ""trouble-maker"" who terrorizes the criminals who break into his house. Sure, it had humor and appealed to kids. But you have to admit, he was no angel there.Culkin has always been older than his years, so playing these deranged characters was not outside of his ability. Yet I can't help but feel being a child actor with this script has got to do some psychological damage.My personal feelings aside with regard to how child actors are used by motion picture industries, this is a wildly shocking film. It's in my top 100 of must-see films. I hope that doesn't make me part of the problem. Hmm, something to think about.",The Good Son

What got his sister in the hospital's unrealistic because the entire herd of people wouldn't just stand back behind the barrier, letting a little boy try to pull her out on his own.

Then, a couple of professionals walk out there without a problem with sledgehammers. They give the ice several poundings until finally punching through to pull her out.

63,tallguy62,"Really a remake of ""The Bad Seed""",7,11 February 2008,"Although not quite as melodramatic, this is clearly a remake of The Bad Seed, a famous 50s movie about an evil little girl. This time, the evil child is played very convincingly by MaCauley Culkin. Elijah Wood is often the one who gets blamed for Culkin's vile behavior. It is interesting to watch Culkin play a bad kid. The casting really works.The most disturbing part of the movie -- where they drop a dummy into a freeway of crowded cars -- this scene really bothered me because I am afraid it would give evil kids an ""idea"" to do something this horrible and cause a major pileup on a freeway or even just a regular 2-lane highway. (I always wonder why terrorists never thought of targeting airplanes until AFTER the unfortunate movie Airport came out and could have given them the idea. My understanding is that the first real hi-jacking of an airplane was in 1973, about 3 years after Airport came out.) The scene in this movie raises similar fears.All in all, this very dark and disturbing movie was quite well-done.",The Good Son
64,rchrdshelt,A fairly good thriller worth watching thanks to some decent performances,7,5 September 2006,"Having heard about this movie a while back and it being a fairly under-watched and underrated suspense film with a good cast I decided to buy it for a cheap price. I have to say I was quite surprised.The film has a straightforward plot and features good performances by Eiljah Wood and Macauly Culkin. Coming off their breakout performances in ""Radio Flyer"" and ""Home Alone"" respectively these two proved to be great young actors with potential. It is furthered here, although it now seems only Wood has taken it to the next level with Culkin not acting for some time.Wood is exceptionally good in the several emotional sequences he has throughout and Culkin really does bring his evil character to life. The supporting cast, particularly Wendry Crawson is also very good and make this film better than it could have turned out.The film builds up the tension and suspense as it progresses, leading to an well-executed climax. Perhaps most importantly, at just 80 minutes the film doesn't outstay its welcome.Certainly worth a watch 7/10",The Good Son
65,sharkattack1978,"The good son, more like the evil son.",9,14 July 2007,"Until i saw this i always thought of Macauley Culkin as the sweet innocent little boy from Home Alone and My Girl. That was until i saw him in this. He was pure evil as Henry. I never knew if he could play these characters but he proved me wrong with this movie. He was vicious, sick and very twisted. The things that he did really had me watching in terror. It was like watching a version of the omen with Macauley Culkin in it. I think he wanted to do this to throw off the persona of that the Home Alone films gave him and prove that he was able to stop himself getting stereo-graphed as a good little boy from Home Alone. Well i must say that he does carry it off in this movie. All the time through this film as was a big bully to Elijah Wood's poor boy. He showed no remorse when he killed and you couldn't always trust him when he put thoughts in your head about things that he couldn't do or could he? Without being graphic, the violence is chilling. More chilling than seeing guts splattered over the screen. Culkin bring a very dark side to childhood and proves that not all kids are innocent.",The Good Son
66,Bon_Jovi_chick,Surprisingly enjoyable! A few spoilers,8,26 January 2004,"To be honest, I did not know what to think when I saw this film. Overall, its not my favourite film, its still watchable. Mark (Elijah Wood) has just lost his mum to cancer and is sent off to his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin) to help. However, Mark learns that Henry is twisted and evil, whilst his mum and dad reckon he's a good boy.
Although Henry is twisted and evil, Culkin shows another side to him which shows that he wants attention. After killing his younger brother Richard and attempting to kill his sister, I can only lead to one conclusion: that Henry was once the oldest and had all the attention and became jealous when his brother and sister were born. And then Mark comes along and Henry feels threatened with his mother comforting another boy. A very different role from the ""Home Alone"" series and surprisingly brilliantly done!Elijah Wood is brilliant as Mark who feels guilty for not being able to save his mother from cancer. At the same time as grieving, he has to protect Henry's sister from Henry and also try and convince Henry's parents that Henry is not as good as they like to think.What I did not like about the film is the ending: to have a mother given a choice on which child should fall........ its a bit sick.Also, the film was too short. It would have been interesting to actually see how Richard died and also see what made Henry become evil. That part can only be theorised- it should have been put on screen!8/10!!!",The Good Son

The two boys immediately become friends. Soon, the cousin begins acting a little odd... Wow, the first time I saw this I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, it was so freaky!

68,Dr_Death666,This movie was great,10,30 June 2009,"Before I saw this movie I had a strong feeling that I was going to like it. I was wrong. I loved it. It's about a boy that is visiting his aunt and uncle (he is played by Elijah Wood) and their son is a nut. (played by the Home Alone kid Macaulay Culkin) He drowns his brother, kills a dog, and attempts to kill his sister by throwing her onto thin ice while they are ice skating. He also attempts to kill his own mother in the end, but she survives. The boys almost fall off a cliff in the end, but the mom lets go of Macaulay Culkin's character, letting him plummet to his death, while she keeps the good kid (Elijah Wood). The sad thing is nobody believes Elijah Wood is telling the truth, and they believe the bad kid, who is Macaulay Culkin. I thought this movie was great, and forget its R rating. This movie really should've been rated PG-13, what was the MPAA thinking? Oh well. This is definitely a must-see for fans of thrillers.10/10 or: A",The Good Son

He's not some ordinary boy killing dogs and causing car crashing. He's evil in a different way. He's evil when you wouldn't expect it. He's evil when he's angry. Especially when he saw Mark (Elijah Wood) hugging his mom. Most of you don't understand how great the story is here. This movie is fascinating, and if you'd pay attention, you'd understand how great it is. It doesn't have to be gory or scary. The frightening part is the story. Understand it! This is a good movie.

An in-effective thriller with demented little Culkin on the rampage to kill off his family.  One of the major flaws is no real explanation is given as to why he wants to be so bad.

Actually, when you think of it, Macaulay was a bit of a psycho in that too!It's like one of those Hallmark films you get on the telly in the mid afternoons as it's pretty tame (aside from one f-bomb). A tiny bit cheesy, but entertaining.All in all, it's well worth your time (unless you're expecting a baby, especially a boy)",The Good Son
72,SanTropez_Couch,"(Okay, I'll bite) ""The Bad Movie"" (that was lame)",3,28 February 2003,"I re-watched this movie on TV, on one of those digital channels that doesn't have commercials and almost always has pitch-perfect picture, but it for some reason this movie looked stretched out. And thus it begins.The story is: a young boy (Elijah Wood) has just lost his mother to some sickness. His father (the incomparable David Morse, totally wasted by not being in more than the very beginning, maybe five minutes) drops him off at his brother's house, while he goes to make a business deal so the two can be financially satisfied and be together again. It starts off somewhat sentimentally, but with a kid with a face like Wood's it's kinda hard not to be. Oh yeah, his brother has a kid (Macaulay Culkin) who gives one of the 90's best performances as Satan himself. Well, he doesn't play Lucifer, but that's basically what he's asked to act like. And damned if the two boys aren't good (I love talking about child actors as if they're kids, even when, as is the case here, they're older than me). Too bad the movie isn't.(For example: Mark says to his father that his mother will come back, maybe in another form. And whaddya know, about five minutes later his beautiful, kind aunt comes into the picture. As far as subtlety is concerned, this isn't exactly winning awards.)Culkin was a part of my childhood and the childhoods of most people my age. His Henry sounds intelligent beyond his age without sounding very phony. In place of phoniness comes a creepy smarminess. Henry's an evil little freak, a precocious young boy with a penchant for blackmail. And he plays the character with an impassivity that's equally annoying as it is frightening.Henry's playful with Mark. He helps him deal with the pain of his recently lost mother by doing rough, childlike things. They engage in typically destructive childhood activities like throwing rocks through the windows of old buildings and shooting bolts at animals. You know, the usual.Along with movies like ""The Land Before Time,"" ""The NeverEnding Story,"" ""The Secret of NIMH"" and ""Flight of the Navigator,"" (though I grew up in the early nineties, I guess my mom looked for the classics of that wonderful decade -- the 80s) this film is a part of my nostalgic childhood memory vault, so I was worried that it might be hard to be objective. Ha ha. I wanted to re-watch the film and be able to prove Roger Ebert wrong, who basically called the movie sick. I wish I could argue with him.The big contrast in the movie, of course, is between the ""good"" Mark and the ""evil"" Henry. For Christ's sake, there's even a discussion with a psychiatrist about what evil really is. Mark thinks his mother dying of a sickness was somehow his fault and is ready to take full responsibility for it, while Henry, that little devil, takes pleasure in causing death.The film episodically moves from bad act to worse act (that's ""act"" as in ""deed,"" but the film does get progressively worse, so the double meaning of screenplay act is strangely appropriate). By the end, it turns into an actioner complete with sounding horns and wild African drumming to make sure your heart is a-pumping.Early in the film, before it got ludicrous and asked her to completely debase her character, I thought the mother Susan (Wendy Crewson) was interesting. I checked her out on IMDb and while she hasn't been in anything really noteworthy (although playing the wife in ""Air Force One"" is probably why I recognized her), I found out that she's from my Canadian city and went to a school I know! (I do get joy from the little things.)After about forty-five minutes I really wanted David Morse to come back. After him, the most interesting and plausible character was, at least I thought, the psychiatrist, who's in the film for maybe five minutes.It's not just that the movie doesn't work, it's that it combines not working with that conspiratorial cliché of the good guy being framed by the evil guy and the good guy trying to prove that he's being framed by the evil guy and having no one believe him -- and topping it all off with a dose of immorality. (It doesn't help when we've got cheese ball lines like ""I guess I'll always wonder, but I know I'll never ask."") This stuff happens in life, but why make a movie about it for entertainment purposes? (Cause it sure as hell isn't art.)What's really upsetting is that when the credits roll, with the theme music that suggests the promise of the opening moments, we realize that had the director scrapped everything after the first five minutes with Morse and Wood this could have been one of those great ""little"" movies, in this case about a child grappling and coming to terms with the death of his mother. Something in the vein of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""Nobody's Fool"" or even that other one Wood was in, ""The Ice Storm.""Instead we've got ten year-old Macaulay Culkin saying, ""Don't f--- with me.""*1/2",The Good Son
73,BloedEnMelk,"Scratching the surface, lacks depth and surprises",5,12 January 2012,"I watched this movie with perhaps too high expectations. It's not a bad movie, but it's like a movie I would watch on a Sunday afternoon and it never get's any further than scratching the surface of it's theme: a sociopathic child. Though one of the story lines focuses on what Henry has done to Richard, throughout the whole movie it seems like Henry's behavior was only coming out when Mark came in to the picture. No-one seemed to have noticed anything weird about him before, not even his little sister. Now, a sociopath can be very manipulative, and they are often charming people, but one would say that his sadistic strikes would not have been totally unnoticed, especially towards his sister. It's not completely unbelievable though when you see Mark as the trigger, suddenly being competition for Henry, as Richard was, so OK, the movie can get away with that.What I think was less forgiving was that the movie was all just far too predictable. Watching the mother standing where she liked to come to rest; you do not need to be psychic to understand that this is the place for the final part. To me; all the clues in the movie were far too obvious. It just never surprised me. An other thing is that it lacked in depth. All the elements are there, but it never goes deep. It's like a bow with the potential for a good shot, but the archer just doesn't pull the string back enough to give it real power. The acting was mediocre, though I was pretty impressed by a young Elijah Wood. His big eyes are gorgeous, and his acting, compared to that of Macaulay Culkin, really stood out. Elijah was the one carrying this movie and I'm glad they put him in the role of Mark, and not Macaulay. Macaulay did a reasonable job, especially at the beginning of the movie, but like many things in The Good Son, he lost his strength throughout. At the end, he really did not convince me anymore. All in all, I think more could have been done with the potentially interesting theme of this movie. You don't necessarily have to make a thriller out of it; you could also focus on it being a drama, but The Good Son tried to do both and unfortunately it failed on both sides. It wasn't scary enough, it wasn't dramatic enough. I just can not give it more than a 5 out of 10.",The Good Son

76,morticia64,"Great acting, depressing story...",5,25 October 2021,"I gave five stars. I took away five stars. Here's why:I took five stars off because this story is super depressing. The death of a mother. The death of a child. Two families are broken and grieving. And this is just the beginning. Add in a sadistic young boy who has no conscious and no soul. Conflict. And a mother who has to decide whether her son lives or dies. There is nothing uplifting or positive in this story.I gave this film five stars for the acting skills of Macauley Culkin and Elijah Wood. For young boys, their performances were outstanding. Your heart will go out to Elijah's character. You believe his despair at the loss of his mom and his dad's having to leave him at his aunt and uncle's house for two weeks. You also believe the fear in his eyes when piece by piece he uncovers the sadistic personality of his cousin. Macauley makes you believe his character is twisted and beyond saving. To go from a lovable child in ""Home Alone"" to this lying, violent boy takes great skill and he pulls it off with ease. I can't say enough about how great the acting was by these two young men.This movie got mixed reviews when it was released, and my review is mixed as well. The acting is terrific, but only watch this if you can handle a super depressing story with a depressing ending. You won't feel good when it's over.",The Good Son

78,ralo229,Good Idea Ruined by a Dumb Execution,4,26 May 2017,"A while ago, I remember seeing this movie on an episode of one of my favorite web series, The Nostalgia Critic. To sum up the video in one sentence: he hated it. Even after watching the review and listening to some of his criticisms, I didn't think the movie looked that bad. So eventually, the movie came on Netflix and I decided to watch it for myself. And I feel proud in saying....I'm with the NC on this one. This movie kinda sucks.In all fairness, the idea of delving into the psychopathic mind of a child is pretty interesting, but this movie's biggest flaw is how detached from reality it is. Macalay Culkin's character was totally unrealistic. He talks less like a 10 year old kid and more like a Machiavellian schemer. I understand that psychopathic children tend to be more isolated, emotionless, and have no sympathy for others, but when the kid starts talking like a miniature James Bond villain, I think it's fair to assume the idea of mentally ill children isn't very well represented. Every time Culkin gave one of his hammy little speeches that sounds like it would fit better in an old Marvel comic book, I found it harder and harder to take him seriously. I've heard some people talk about how ""deep"" and ""psychologically intriguing"" this film is. And I honestly don't really know whether we watched the same movie or not. There's almost nothing to Culkin's character. We know he's manipulative and he's been able to cover his tracks for lord knows how long without his stupidly naive mother noticing, but that's about it. There's no attempt to understand his character or have the audience get invested in anything he does. The film just basically throws up its arms and says, ""He's just evil."" It's that simple. Pretty insultingly simple if you ask me. Culkin could've been a really complex and interesting character that could've made this movie ten times better. Perhaps he felt some sort of sick demented reason why he does all the horrible things he does. Maybe something in his past sparked his need to kill? Maybe Elijah Woods's appearance sparked his need to kill given how his relationship with his sister was fine prior to his arrival, but then suddenly after he arrives, he wants her dead. I dunno, his character is so poorly developed, we don't know what the case is other than just being an evil little devil child. If you really wanna do a psychological thriller, making one of your characters a generic villain probably isn't the best route to go. It hurts the film a lot.This film could've been great if it was given to a more competent director like maybe, Brian De Palma or someone. I do believe that there's a good movie buried underneath, it's just blocked out by its fundamentally flawed execution. If you want a good evil child movie, Richard Donner's The Omen is your best bet. It has a much stronger and coherent story, more realistic characters, and the kid actually acts like a kid and not like the little boy version of Lady MacBeth. I guess if you wanna make fun of how laughably hammy Culkin is in this, then I guess you'll find some enjoyment out of The Good Son. If not, then stay away. There's not much for you here. 4/10",The Good Son
79,cubsckc,Bad Reviews Indicate Really Frighting Concepts and not Bad Movie,8,29 July 2014,"I was actually really surprised at the ratings of the film, so I looked at many of the reviews before putting mine down. Maybe I was missing some pretty horrible aspects to the movie. So I watched the movie again and I read the reviews. I think one of the interesting things was that people rated this movie really low because they didn't like the concept of an evil child or they added, there was no WHY concept to the reasons why the character did the things he did. I think I was mostly surprised at the ""Why"" concept. Did people really not understand that this kid felt really powerful controlling the fate of others? It was quite clear that the mean kid did not like being undermined. It was in my opinion very well introduced. At first, his enjoyment in his actions were very minor due to his first time. It seemed to me that the first time he performed his bad deeds to his brother, he might have actually been scarred or stunned. Because for a while when little Frodo enters the scene, nothing has actually happened to indicate he is a terrible child. Its not until his mother treats Frodo like her own child that Macually starts to use his will to force things the way he wants. I see similarities with how kids these days press their parents into getting what they want. I think its important to recognize the scene where little Frodo goes to the therapist and asks her about why someone could be bad for no reason, just because he likes to be bad. I think this is where people kind of go, ""yeah, this movie is flawed, there's no such thing."" But remember, little Frodo wasn't looking down the staircase at his mother hugging another son. Its all about perspective. It can be concluded that the bad son is probably the spoiled child, and acts up in extreme ways to get what he wants because it worked before. We have two polar characters. One character is completely helpless and his fate is controlled by the other characters in this movie, where there is Culkin, whom has deep control of his life and his wants. On another note, kids doing horrible things to animals or killing other kids is not a unheard of concept. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that there are certain mentalities that cannot be explained but diagnosed with mental disorders. People in our age have been brainwashed into thinking that kids are completely innocent in the world. Which is funny when you reflect how many times in your younger life you have laughed at someone and probably made them feel really bad, even though you didn't want to. As kids we actually hurt others more than we'd like to admit, we just choose not to admit it.",The Good Son
80,The_nibs,Predictable uninspired writing,3,10 April 2020,"This movie was a bomb. I thought it would be way more entertaining but my husband and I were surprised at just how bad it is. It's beyond predictable, have you ever seen a movie that tells you exactly what's going to happen before it happens? That's The Good Son for you. You can't feel suspense or be shocked at the outcomes when the dialogue gives everything away; for instance, Henry tells Mark he's going to hurt his sister so then he does, he tells Mark the sights off on his homemade gun implying he will succeed the next time he uses it and then does so shortly thereafter, he gives away the obvious possibility that he killed his kid brother within the first half hour of the movie. There's no craft to this writing, it comes off as incredibly lazy. Beyond that, there's a complete lack of believability too, like how no one intervened at the ice rink, they waited for two guys to show up with axes a little while later, or when the psychiatrist discusses Mark with Henry violating his privacy and abandoning their session for no reason? Like what professional would do any of the things she does? Why does Mark not put two and two together when dumping the dummy off the bridge? It would be more believable if he had been forced to do it against his will rather than just going along with it because he didn't know what was happening. The parents are terrible and don't even listen to Mark when he talks, they ignore him, it feels so cheap and forced. Also the bond between Mark and Henry feels unearned, there's no chemistry between them, when Henry does something evil it's not shocking or a betrayal of his character because they took no time to establish his character in the first place! And the ending is painfully lame. We kept talking about what should have happened throughout the film. The reveal that Henry killed Richard which technically never really happens, should've been way more intense than it was, and in the end she shouldn't have had to choose between her son and nephew. I imagine the ending like this: a cruel Henry admits to the murder outright, the shock would paralyze his mother, he tries to push her off the cliff but he fails and falls himself, while his mother tries to save him. She drops him in disgust Mark at best should've been looking on helplessly while being unable to reach them. So many missed opportunities with this film.",The Good Son
81,KillerRomance,Macaulay is Pure Class,10,17 May 2017,"At aged 15, I read the Movie tie-in Novel by Ian McEwan and Todd Strasser before it was disappointingly banned shortly for the unrelated Jamie Bulgar case, it was the Best Thriller I ever read and always delighted to read through again and again, with the smiling Angelic Macaulay Culkin on the cover. Read the Book first if You can because it is very Smart. To my surprise, the Movie is available but United Kingdom always has strange standards. People who claim this movie is slow are probably born after this 1993 movie, because most Thrillers in the 1990's didn't have a cliché horror ""surprises"" element, they were steady paced. The Good Son had the atmosphere and pace of the movie Unfaithful starring Diane Lane, and Richard Gere; and Birth, Nicole Kidman and Lauren Bacall as cast, like the Golden Hollywood era of Thrillers with a modern twist. I am glad the Movie didn't have cliché shocks and heart attack music or panic pulse music score all the way through, because there is too much movies like that around nowadays, so it is good to have variety of production. The chills are in the performance of the Actors, that is how it should be isn't it?.Macaulay Culkin gave a calculating, cold and analytical approach, very manipulative and secretly menacing, I never thought of Kevin McCallister at all. Totally different and chilling, he is one scary Child. Elijah Wood, his cute petrified expressions is perfect for making you see his Troubled time of his life be dealing with the recent death of his Mother, and yet, the Horror of being like a observing witness, feeling helpless and figures how to stop his Budding Serial Killer Cousin.The self discovery of feeling an euphoria high on committing heinous acts by being able to ""fly"". Animal torture, Attempting murder, carry out dark and deadly fantasies, conscience doesn't bother Henry Evans (Culkin) all signs of a Future Serial Killer, probably the worst and elusive one yet.Two Young Good-looking Actors, did carry out the movie well, it is close to the book, but the novel is more detailed and has more scary moments, the movie is more toned down with psychological aspect of the Human nature.My advice, read the book if you can get it somewhere in this Country then watch the movie. You see how accurate the characters are to the actors.As for another Evil Child, Bad Seed by Patty McCormack as Rhonda Penmark. The movie is all talk and no action, she behaves like a stuck-Up girl that didn't get a Pony for her Birthday, the mother that finds out her Daughter's secret is annoying, gets shocked all the time, the ending was stupid, I mean completely utterly dumb, that pleases the folk of 1950's. It was original to portray a Child being Evil, but Bad Seed failed because it pleased the censors.So there you have it Henry Evans Wins.",The Good Son
82,dragoneyez01,"Disturbing and Flawed, But Overall Average Thriller",4,24 November 2003,"The first thing I noticed about the plot of this film is that it's awful similar to 'The Bad Seed,' in which a young girl is the homicidal child. The subject of 'The Good Son' is kind of disturbing and also somewhat unrealistic.The plot is basically as follows. Elijah Wood plays a young boy who's mother died and his father leaves him with his uncle and his wife's house in Maine. There he befriends his cousin, played by Macaulay Culkin. Soon Wood discovers his cousin's homicidal tendencies (kills a dog, causes a pile-up, etc.). It comes to a whole new level when Wood finds out Culkin's character killed his baby brother several years ago, and plans to kill his younger sister. He threatens to tell his aunt and uncle, but Culkin makes it clear he won't allow that.Overall, 'The Good Son,' is an average thriller. Some chills here and there and a decent climax, but the film has many flaws. First, the script isn't that great, and the dialogue is unrealistic (esp. Macaulay's character, which seems more like an philosophical serial killer than a disturbed child). The plot itself is unrealistic (I doubt there have been very many homicidal children). The acting is also mediocre, neither of the leads show any real talent in their roles.My biggest problem with this film is that it's subject matter is extremely disturbing. Who really wants to see a movie where a young boy - that could be their son, nephew, grandson, etc. - kill off his siblings? I'd have to wonder what disturbed minds in Hollywood thought out this film. I could've probably forgiven this film's poorly thought-ought plot, had everything else about the film been good.Want to see a great thriller? Check out Hitchcock or something along the lines of 'The Sixth Sense.' This movie is a low-end thriller with very little thrills and overall, isn't too entertaining.Rating: 4/10",The Good Son
83,horsecrazy6791,This movie was actually pretty good!,7,7 November 2005,"I saw this movie for the first time two years ago when I was about 12. I was watching A&E and I saw an ad for it, so I decided to give it a chance. The first like, 20 minutes of the movie were somewhat boring, but I left my TV on, and the movie caught my attention again when it got to the part where Mark almost fell out of Henry's tree fort.At that point, I began watching it again, and the rest of the movie was pretty good! Strangely enough though, the first time I saw the movie, I didn't even know that Elijah Wood played Mark, even though he is an actor that I really liked from seeing him in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and stuff. But later that night, the same movie came on again, and I noticed how well he did. McCauly Culkin did a pretty good job too. I remember seeing him in the ""Home Alone' movies when I was a bit younger. It's kind of funny how his little sister played his actual sister in the movie, and his little brother was in it too.Basically this movie is about a boy named Mark (Elijah Wood) who finds out from his father that his mom is dying from cancer in the hospital. After having a few last words with her, she passes away, and Mark goes to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan, and his two cousins Henry (McCauly Culkin) and Connie (Quinn Culkin.) At first Mark and Henry have lots of fun together, but after a while, Mark notices something about his cousin. Although nobody except Mark realizes it, Henry is actually ""evil"" and does all kinds of bad things. He kills a dog by shooting it with a steel bolt, drops a dummy onto the highway causing a huge collision, tries to drown his little sister, poison his family's food, and lots more, but nobody seems to even notice. They all think Henry is the perfect child. When Mark tries to tell His Aunt and Uncle, and even his Dad, everyone thinks he's crazy. One day when Henry's mom takes him for a little walk to question him about his little brother Richard's death, he pushes her off a cliff, and is just about to drop a big boulder onto her when Mark runs up and knocks it away from him. The two begin fighting by the edge of the cliff, while Susan manages to climb back up. Then the two boys roll off the edge and Susan grabs each of them by their arm. She knew she could only save one, and let her evil son drop into the rocky bay below.I guess all in all ""The Good Son"" was a fairly good movie. I actually saw it on DVD one day in a store and picked it up. I didn't even know it *was* on video or DVD, I just thought it was a TV movie. Definitely not one of my favorites, but i liked it quite a bit. 7/10.",The Good Son

I mean come on people!But i guess that i could let it go being that it is the movies! And i also hated the fact that Culkin swares in it! (SPOILERS!!SPOILERS!!SPOILERS!!...........SPOILERS!SPOILERS!!SPOILERS) It was hard to belive that the mother would kill her son!!But i understand that why,he was a bad kid,i mean he tried to kill his sister two times he killed a dog and he injured and may have killed the people in the cars when he through the dummby off the bridge!

88,robertmfreeman,Effective Psychological Thriller,9,7 July 2009,"Without giving anything away, I felt 'The Good Son' was a very effective and subtle psychological thriller. It was very interesting to see a modern thriller that felt more like a classic Hitchcock tale than 'Die Hard'.The Good Son has very little violence directly on the screen, and is far more interested in implying danger and violence, which is ultimately far more effective. No matter how graphic a scene is, it's never quite as scary or thrilling as what 'could' be. By merely implying the violence, and hiding it away from the audience, we feel just as trapped and helpless as the main star.In the end, The Good Son was quite impressive, and although it's not always realistic, neither was Psycho, and when you consider the fact that all the main actors are children, it's downright impressive how good a performance each of them brought to this competent thriller.",The Good Son
89,Blaze-17,Awesome movie!,10,12 November 2001,"To be honest, this is one of my favourite movies! A few years ago when I was walking around a video store, I stumbled across this movie. I wasn't sure if I should get it since it was rated R and I was only fourteen at the time. But I got it and I was glad I did. The scenery was just incredible and the music was the best I've ever heard! The acting was great too! I don't see why it got an R rating, for the content inside was only around a PG-13 rating. Maybe back then, R was suitable, but now there are a lot of movies which are much worse and they don't even get an R rating. Well, anyways... this is a great movie with great aspects. Some people say that this movie isn't too great, but they have their opinion and I have mine and mine is that this is an excellent film! Go rent it! I highly recommend it.",The Good Son

I was on the edge of my seat from the car accident to the cliff drop. I think most people say they don't like it just because they hate Elijah Wood or Macaulay Culkin, and they are both EXCELLENT in this movie. Sure, there are some lines that could be said better, but every movie has its flaws, right? Elijah Wood does a great job being the kid who nobody believes and Culkin is amazing as a boy without a conscience. Definitely Culkin's best film. My favorite quote:HENRY: You like my little sister, don't you? Such a sweet little girl... It'd be too bad if something were to happen to her; if she got hurt... You'd be sad, wouldn't you, Mark?

91,iamluvd,"Disturbing film, but Wendy Crewson makes it worthwhile.",10,31 July 2003,"The subject matter of this film is inarguably disturbing, however the incredible performance by Wendy Crewson makes this a worthwhile movie.  She convincingly portrays the unbelievably impossible dilemma of facing the truth about her own child, and then making the only choice she could make. We feel the agony of her loss of her youngest son, the horror she experiences when she discovers that son was murdered by his brother, and the heartbreak she embraces at the end.  I don't think any other actress could have brought as much authenticity to this complex character as Wendy Crewson does.  See it for her performance alone.",The Good Son

I don't consider this a **spoiler** but if you like to go into a movie knowing absolutely nothing because it distracts you, stop reading. I'm sure there are already reviews here that reflect how much I like this film, so here is all I want to add. I've seen it before, but I noticed this time that when one of the characters falls over a cliff, you can plainly see a cable around their wrist for a second or two before it disappears. I found it listed in the goofs after watching it, so obviously I'm not the first to notice! It certainly doesn't take away from the film in any way.",The Good Son
93,madman31619,Macaulay is a PSYCHO!!! And I like it,7,13 March 2008,"The Good Son By Daniel Rosado Directed: Joseph Ruben Cast: Macaulay(Culkin, Elijah Wood, Wendy Crewson, David Morse, Daniel Hugh Kelly,Quinn Culkin The Good Son is a film about young boy, named Mark(Elijah Wood), whose mother dies early on in the film. Mark and his father, Jack (David Morse) are both saddened by this, but Jack has some important business in Tokyo. So he decides to leave Mark in the care of Mark's Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) and Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly). Mark quickly becomes friends with his cousins Henry (Macaulay Culkin) and Connie (Quinn Culkin).After staying in their home for a while Mark starts to notice that Henry just might be somewhat demented. Henry acts strangely, creates weapons, and almost drops Mark from, what seems to be, the world's highest tree house. Mark tries telling the adults, but (as always) they refuse to believe him. Henry even finds ways to make Mark seem like the insane child.This movie was enjoyable to see, because I think the world was tired of seeing Macaulay Culkin as just the typical child actor, who plays pranks on people. In The Good Son he tries to murder people. That's very uncommon when it comes to child actors. Elijah Wood also did a great job as Mark. He and Macaulay did a great job working with each other.This movie really made you think of Macaulay as this really creepy little kid. He goes on to do horrible things, throughout the movie. Henry went ahead and did whatever made him happy. He caused a very destructive car accident, by throwing a dummy into traffic. He also takes this weird gun thing that shoots screws or nails, which he created, and kills a dog. He even tried to drown his little sister, in a frozen lake. He didn't feel any remorse at all when he did these things; he just had this creepy little smirk (like in Home Alone).Elijah Wood was perfect for the part of Mark. He looks like the most innocent child in the world. And was the last person you would expect to see try to stop Henry. Mark seemed innocent, but when it was necessary he put up a good fight against Henry (Not as good as he did in Sin City, but pretty good).What I found disappointing about the movie is that the parents never realized something was wrong with Henry. They shouldn't have needed Mark telling them. They live with him they should've noticed that he was a sick twisted little child, who was pure evil.I also didn't like the fact that Mark's father went to Tokyo right after his wife died. He didn't even seem that sad about it. But he should've put more consideration into how his son might be feeling at a time like that.Overall it was a good movie, despite the horrible parenting. It was great to see Macaulay Culkin take on a new type of role. It was just as great to see a counterpart as good as Elijah Wood.3 out of 5 stars",The Good Son

But with the help of exceptional good acting and a non-rushed plot, this movie ended up being a satisfying picture with thrills and chills! Elijah Wood, who is a natural performer, definitely contributed to the suspense; And Mr. Culkin , had me almost peeing in my pants with his delightfully creepy performance. I give this movie two high thumbs up! I only wish that the movie last a tiny bit longer, or maybe i just got so into the flick that time seemed to pass by very quickly.

98,SweetFunChk,You Either Like it or you dont,10,5 August 2004,"I have found with this movie that you either like it, or you dont. I, for one, love the movie.**SPOILERS** Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood do awesome jobs portraying Henry and Mark Evans, respectively. After Mark's mother dies, he is sent to live with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan, and Cousins Henry and Connie (Culkin's real life sister, Quinn). Mark and Henry become instant friends, but after a period of time, Mark starts to learn of Henry's real intentions. Behind Henry's angelic smile lives a demented preteen with a love of evil games. At first, Henry, along with Mark, do more innocent crimes... Smoking and throwing rocks through a newly built building. Those small crimes roll up into death threats, killing animals, and attempted murders to family. Mark tries to convince that Henry's the bad one, but Henry has everyone fooled... including a therapist! Many critics of this movie rant about Macaulay's acting skills. While they werent up to Elijah Wood's skills, he held his own. You have to get into the character of Henry to understand why Macaulay didnt portray Henry as having a wide variety of emotions. Henry believed he was smarter than the adults... Thats why he wasnt terrified in the end scene as Mark was.
I give the movie a 9/10.",The Good Son
99,sneeal,Outstanding!,10,3 August 2003,Culkin and Wood both deliver great performances. The movie is very suspenseful. After watching the 1st 10-15 minutes of this show i thought it would be horrible. But then it turned great. The ending is exciting and very shocking.10/10,The Good Son
100,bpilgrim2002,"""The Good Son"" not a ""Good Movie"".",3,13 May 2002,"This movie exposed McCauly Culkin as a one dimensional actor.  He was alright as the cute kid in the ""Home Alone"" series, but as a demented and calculated child killer he is awful.  His lines seem so forced that the director must not have cared (Let's ride Culkin's cuteness as far as we can). Elijah Wood was somewhat better, but still in over hishead. I admit the ending was exciting, but I can't imagine too many viewers wondering which boy the mother was going to let go.",The Good Son
101,n-s-bondi,A guilty pleasure,6,24 February 2012,"Okay, whole plot in one sentence; Macaulay Culkin plays a psychopath who mentally tortures Elijah Wood. Now, if this was a recent movie it would be a much more believable film, seeing that Elijah Wood (let's face it here) mostly plays wussies and Macaulay Culkin, well... looks like a psychopath. But this movie came out in 1993, thus Elijah was about twelve and Culkin about 13 years old (even though he still looks like he's going to put his hands on his cheeks and deliver an over the top scream at any moment throughout the whole film), so you can imagine how that works. ""It doesn't"", I would say if it didn't, but it strangely does.Now, don't get me wrong, I was never really frightened by Culkin in this movie, but firstly whoever expects of someone to make Macaulay Culkin look bad ass, has a big freaking faith in mankind and secondly Joseph Ruben manages to make him at least a little intimidating throughout most of the movie (you have to give him credit for that, whoever that guy is) and by most of the movie I mean roughly the first half. But I think that's because of the human nature. Man, at some point had to realize that this guy who threatened to pull down his loincloth all the time was just a plastic puppet, made by big Hollywood corporations to make money. In other words; at some point in the movie that varies from human to human Macaulay Culkin stops looking intimidating and just starts to annoy the f**k out of you, until you just want to strangle him to death. And you know why? Because you CAN! For granted if you showed this movie to a six-year-old, he will most likely get scared, but anyone older than eleven is just too much. I mean what would you do if Macaulay Culkin just came over to your house trying to play sick games with you? That's right! You would give him a punch in his god damned face and that would most certainly shut him up for good. So, I'm sorry for talking about Culkin for so long but it just has got to be addressed what a miscast this is. Giving a boy who's one and only strength is to look cutesy in front of the camera a role in which he has to do anything BUT looking cutesy in front of the camera is something that should be reconsidered before you wake up after a long night with various contract assignments nobody can remember and you notice it's too late.So how about that Elijah Wood guy? I heard he was in this movie too! Well he is and he is our main hero. The whole story is told from his point of view (which left many people to think that in fact Macaulay Culkin was the good son and Wood just changed the story to his advantage, although the writer never confirmed it and there would be some plot holes if this was the case) and he's pretty good in his role. He's not great, but he sure as hell is not bad. He's supposed to be the innocent one, who gets drawn into the s**t Culkin produces, but oddly enough he has his psycho moments too. I won't spoil it for you, but you will definitely know which scenes I mean once you get there. He is kind of shallow, but you still care for him. Nothing more to say than a nice main character, but nothing more.Okay, now on to the story. I can imagine that writer and great novelist Ian McEwan did not have the face of Richie Rich in mind when he wrote the script, so I guess he did a great job. The ones who screwed it up in that part were the filmmakers. This could have been a real gripping and horrifying movie, but instead they just went up to the first hobo they saw on the highway who did not have a shotgun with him. I think Ian deserved better, because he couldn't have known that the cigarette would be smoked by every momma's dream Culkin and would become my wallpaper for the next five years.So anyway, the story itself had real great potential, mainly the ending is really good and it actually did translate well to film, but it has some things to it that stand in the way for a real coherent movie experience. For what it is you get a good, entertaining movie, that's neither too short nor too long and that's while not being gripping throughout the whole movie partially really intense. I'd say give it a watch!",The Good Son
102,millwardcalvin,The Good Son,4,8 January 2021,I absolutely love this horror movie. Macaulay Culkin did an excellent job of playing the villain Henry and Elijah Wood also did a great job playing the protagonist Mark. This might be slightly different but personally to me this movie reminds me of the rare Canadian TV movie Locked in Silence where a 9-year-old boy named Stephen discovers a dead body and his bad boy older brother threatens him into silence which leads the 9 year old to have no one to turn to or cry for help which was quite heartbreaking. Interesting enough during the opening and closing sequences of The Good Son where Mark is standing alone in the desert also makes me think of the ending scene in the Locked in Silence movie where Stephen is standing alone in the fields full of snow.,The Good Son

The ending of this movie is highly unlikely, but that has a better chance of happening then people liking this movie. The only reason I watched this movie was because of Macaulay Culkin.

And some also say that Macaulay acted bad and didn't have more emotion, witch is stupid because the only time Macaulay acted bad was when his character Henry was lying, witch proves thats Macaulay was meaning to do that because not him but his character Henry was a bad actor. I mean really him and his co-star Elijah wood were so talented in this movie that they over shadowed the adult acting, though the adult acting is good Macaulay and Elijah are much better. I'd give this movie a 99.9/100, its so good, but retarted websites like rotton tomato gave this movie a 8/100, witch again the only bad thing they said about it was Macaulays character I mean if it was that bad it would have gotten at least (witch it didn't) one Razzie award, witch is an award for worst things, like worst movie, worst acting, worst director, and etc. You should see this movie, its awesome!",The Good Son

110,cute_dark_chi,Not the best I have seen from Macaulay Culkin...,5,12 March 2007,"Face it, we all know Macaulay Culkin isn't really the ""psychopath,"" we have seen in his previous films. Instead, he's the opposite, such as kind, sweet, and of course, cute. The best roles I have seen him take were ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" and ""My Girl."" It was just very disturbing to see him in this kind of role, playing as an evil kid no one but his cousin suspected evil.This movie, I thought, was both good and bad. The good points about it was the plot and how both the actors, Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin acted in it as good and evil. I thought they were excellent as children. They said their lines as how their character would say it and they really got into it. However, the bad points were how Macaulay Culkin had to play an evil little killer, some of the scripts, ratings, and ending. In one part, Mark Evans (Elijah) tells Henry (Mac) that his mother's soul is in Henry's mom. I thought that was completely stupid, because it sounds like possession, not as though cute and grief-stricken. And how Henry used a cigarette and cursed ""Don't f*ck with me,"" I was shocked. Why let him say that? Now that really surprised me.The movie is rated R. Why? Because of violence and language. Well, I only counted one cursing, but that's it. The violence was off-screen, so the movie should have been rated PG-13 or at least PG.The ending made me so mad, because Susan (Henry's mom) had to let go of one child when she was holding onto them at the edge of the cliff. I know it was right of her to let go of Henry, but did they have to make that scene? After that, I cried because no matter how evil that child was, it was sad to know he died so young.

That's pretty much all that made it worth watching. It was predictable (we all KNEW nobody was going to believe Mark when he told them about Henry) and it was also too short.The ending was a bit silly, too.

This increases the immersion & effect of the movie & its characters.I've seen this movie quite a few times but macs good performance still keeps on reminding me that these kinda kids exist and this is why good psychologists are needed.Wood performs very well especially with the genuine tears & lively acting. One would argue that he outshines Macs performance but I disagree, they both complement each others good acting and work with great synergy. The Good Son is a strong movie, what elevates this fact is the landscape imagery and portrayals of the beautiful surroundings in different states on the car trip to the mansion.People should not rate this movie too harshly(IMDb scale, should be a 7-8) based on its child actors but more on its contents. Afterall, the actors could be anybody, but the movies heart would stay the same. The movie tries to show us how a psychological conduct disorder can manifest itself age -independent and how hard it is to realize the disorder before there is damage done by these individuals.This movie gets compared a lot to a movie called ''Bad Seed'' and i don't there should even exist an attempt to directly compare and judge ''The Good Son'''s quality as a movie based on the first one quoted. The truth is that these movies are certainly different.Again, I safely recommend this movie as one of the best movies for intelligent & observant people, interested in psychology.",The Good Son
117,kristiina553,hello,10,24 February 2008,"Well, I have this on DVD and I'm watching this over and over again. I love that music what is when Henry introducing a dummy to Mark. Music is just so powerful.Both boys did a great job. Mac was really scary. I didn't see the fear in his eyes. He was always glad of things what he did. It was really sad that he did die. Whyy?? I thinks that it wasn't Henry's fault that he was a psychopathic. He was just a kid, god damn! I love Elijah eyes.His look was so innocent. Best movie in DA world!Bye.",The Good Son
118,laukineuoga,One of my favourite movies ever,10,27 June 2010,"I love this movie... It's perfect. I watched it many times and I always cried during the ending.Macaulay and Elijah were amazing in this film. Macaulay played a bad boy role perfectly. After all, he was nominated as Best Wilain in MTV Movie Awards. Elijah also played his hole very well and was nominated as Best Performance by a Younger Actor and won.So the acting was excellent. The plot could be better but it is good what it is. Although I didn't like the ending very much because even if Henry was a murderer without emotions he didn't deserve to die. No one human does. But it had to be like that. The scenery was beautiful, too.In my opinion it was one of the best Culkin's movies. I like it very much. I have a few scenes that disturbs me. They are with a dummy, with a crossbow, with a tree house and, of course, with a cliff. But I love all the movie, of course.P.S. I'm sorry if I made a grammar mistakes because I haven't learnt English perfectly yet.",The Good Son
119,jnicoletti4,Nice,7,24 November 2010,"Parents do not respond to the new psychopaths in our world, many, upper middle class types that are also psychopaths---how would they know? Which is why humanity is going in the direction it is going. No way McCauley is dumb....for a young person to have the presence of doing his lines that way, that is in him. Meanwhile, as he got older, he got in trouble. So, in the end, he did not fool anyone, but, for such a young person, a great performance. I bet McCauley gets scripts and trials all the time, funny thing is, he is more believable as a youngster. Great acting. I guess he must have manipulated his real parents in real life---funny...hope he has the money!",The Good Son
120,gggggeorge,Good Son - Good Movie,7,3 September 2004,"It's interesting to see how many people HATED this movie. I have to assume they were repulsed by the ending.Mr. Caulkin has always been kind of a dry actor. It worked in Home Alone, and it's okay here, but if I were casting, I would have kept looking.The plot builds well, it's kind of fun, and it sets up for the ending perfectly.Fair action, movement, and mischief. If you fell asleep you have a medical problem.The cinematography and settings are GORGEOUS!Highly recommended, but if you don't like the ending, it doesn't mean that the whole film sucked.",The Good Son
121,yangle_sun,i guess Quinn Culkin as Macauley's sister at once!,9,11 January 2005,"Seeing Connie at first sight, i thought she might be the real sister of Macauley Culkin. And it turns out that i am right! They are so alike. I thought Macauley's portrayal of Henry has got Elijah Wood eclisped although he plays the cute boy also very well. Or maybe the bad character is always easier to be more impressive than the benign one. Only i don't like the end of the movie. I just felt the final climax came so all of a sudden but lack of some more substances. Anyway, i like the movie because both teenager actors are playing so well and some scenes of the film is unexpected, like Henry threw the scarecrow from the bridge and caused so big an accident!",The Good Son
122,lilmrs_minniemouse,An awesome movie,10,15 June 2005,"I love this movie, its outstanding, the story line is extremely original, the acting is incredible, the music is so perfect for the movie, and some of the settings are very beautiful. But one thing that bothers me beyond words is Macaulay culkin, I love him in this movie and thought he was a very promising child actor, but he really ruined it with the critics, most critics dislike this movie or gave it a bad review because Macaulay went from the sweet kid to the sico killer, because all the people that I have ever met that have seen this movie say it's a very good movie, but if you happen to find some of the things critics said/say about it, it all has to do with Macaulay. ""Culkin it's to freaky"", ""Culkin changes his image...for the bad"" and etc. And that's really stupid because this is SO Macaulay best role. I'd really give this movie a ten out of ten, and Elijah wood is so wonderful in this movie, and same with Macaulay. And this movie also had very amazing senses, like the cliff sense, and the sense (witch is my very favourite) Culkin says ""your scared mark, I know, I used to be scared, but that was before I found out"" found out what? ""once you realized you can doing anything your free you can fly nobody can touch you, no body, mark? don't be afraid to fly"" Your sick. ""I promised you something you'd never forgot, wheres the gratitude?"" Thank you for reading my message. -Jade Da Costa",The Good Son
123,joelpeterson-28489,Good idea,2,30 June 2020,"The overall theme of the movie is good but some scenes are a bit unrealistic in my opinion. First of all, the parents in this movie SUUUUCCKKK. They're totally oblivious to everything. I think you would know if your child was mentally ill? What kind of parents let their kids go to the ice pond by themselves? And when the daughter falls through the ice, NOBODY helps her, they just stand there and watch. Literally like 30 people just standing there. Idk seemed a bit off to me. And when a 12 year old kid tells you that he saw your son attempt to murder your daughter, your first reaction shouldn't be to hit the kid... No one would just make that up. And the fact that the mom climbed that giant cliff in like 10 seconds? Also there's a continuity error in that scene. If you look closely, in one shot she is barely holding onto Mark's hand, then in the next shot she's grabbing all the way down his forearm, then the next shot she's grabbing him by his hand again. Just kind of a poor movie.",The Good Son
124,doommasterjpd,An adventure into the mind of a psychopathic child,9,4 October 2005,"The Good Son is a twisted adventure into the mind of a psychopathic child. It is artistic in displaying Henry's attraction to violence, how no one had ever picked up on his mental deficiency, and how it is already to late. The movie was under appreciated, but if you look past the errors, this can definitely be a thrill.The story is about a boy named Henry (Caulkin) who's cousin (Wood) comes to live with him after his mother has passed away. After a violent hap with Caulkin's character, Elijah's character must warn his new aunt/mom about Caulkin's character's show of no emotions and violent tendencies.This movie is, in my opinion, a great movie, but not one of the best. Give it a try, buy into the drama, and you'll see what I mean.",The Good Son
125,galuhalifani,Leaving deep impression and strong mark for a long time,10,22 March 2018,"I'm quite surprised by all the other reviews which apparently contains negative comments on the movie. Definitely understood the point of view though, after I read those comments - they make sense. However, I saw this movie when I was a kid (younger than 10 I believe), and it hit my heart so deep that I couldn't forget it until 15 years later. I didn't remember the title, probably because I was too small to care about it. But I do remember the plot and the actors and all the emotions it made me feel back then when I was a kid. So lately, I've tried different ways to find out the title of the movie and now I've watched it several times back. I still liked it. I agree, Culkin's acting (and especially his sister's) was probably poor. And there were some missing elements as to the explanation of ""why"" or ""how"". But overall, I love this movie because (in an extreme way, I know), it shows you although evil can be anywhere, but it will never win. Culkin's character (Henry), although was an arrogant evil, was also as unaware as other kids. This was portrayed by him thinking that he can always manipulate his family no matter how evil he is; that his family will always defend him no matter what, of which this was proven wrong at the end of the movie. Which created a very strong moral impression to me back then: don't be a bad person, cause at the end you won't win - and nobody in their right mind will defend you or support you on being a bad person, especially your family.But, most importantly I love this movie because it left a deep impression and create a very strong mark for me as a child watching it - no negative impact (i'm not becoming a sociopath now nor have I developed any psychopathic mental disorders) - just an emotional, melancholic, and nostalgic nudge to me as an adult today.",The Good Son
126,UndercoverCelebrity,I totally Disagree,8,28 July 2007,"That's some Bull. Macaulay Culkin was perfect for this movie, even if the last comment says otherwise. Maybe he was force to audition, but his talent is extraordinary. He was obviously the Dakota Fanning of his time. He portrayed his character in a way, that made it seem real. This was the perfect role for him, and gave him a chance to explore different acting opportunities. Elijah Wood's performance was outstanding also. This is what really carved him into the actor he is today. Maybe this movie didn't get an Oscar, but it gets an 8. For pure talent, and relentless wonder.To focus more on the movie, it was more sad than scary. It was really sad at the end when his mother let him go. It made you wonder, was she right for doing that? The movie had a great climax, and a sad ending. It left you wonderin what if she let Mark(Elijah) go instead? Would it be just has sad?",The Good Son
