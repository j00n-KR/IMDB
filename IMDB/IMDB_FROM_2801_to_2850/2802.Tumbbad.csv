0,classicsoncall,"""The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed.""",8,31 October 2021,"I have to say, that old grandmother was more horrifying than just about any movie monster you can think of, and I'm including Godzilla and Freddie Kruger in that statement. That was one ugly make-up job. The demon Hastar was no slouch either, but I did have to laugh the first time it defecated gold coins out it's butt. That was just a bit too outlandish. The film appears to be a cautionary tale about what greed does to a person, and as sins of the father are passed down to the son, the avarice has the tendency to perpetuate itself through the ages. The story is told in three chapters set about fifteen years apart, beginning around 1918 in the Western India village of Tumbbad, from which the movie takes it's name. It takes a doll made out of dough to summon the creature Hastar, which also has the tendency to distract it long enough to gather up the gold coins it produces. Multiple dolls suggest the distraction will last longer thereby allowing additional time to collect more gold coins, but instead, the surplus dolls summon an equal number of surplus demons. Another outcome of unintended consequences. I've seen over a dozen films out of India but this was the first true horror picture from that country. It was quite original in execution, with spectacular if terrifying imagery that's bound to cause nightmares for the more timid.",Tumbbad
1,nairtejas,Molecule Review: Tumbbad (8 Stars),8,3 November 2018,"Tumbbad made me sit up from my chair and take notice at how a thriller can be told without resorting to cheap tricks that are prevalent in other titles coming out of the Hindi film industry in recent times. Sohum Shah produces and acts in this fantastic narration of the quality of greed in humans using a folklore about a mythological god-like creature that is itself a symbol of greed. Based on and named after a village in Western India, Tumbbad is told in a way that captures your attention from the first frame and does not let you stray. With some quality performances and an electric background score by none other than Jesper Kyd (I was in tears when I saw his name in the credits), the horror thriller depends on the folklore to carve a story that emphasizes humanity's greed for everything - from money to food to exclusivity. The amount of references it throws at you - as a period drama set in pre-independence India - is further bound to fascinate you while you get embroiled in one man's (Shah) quest for greed which he hopes to pass down to his future generations. Tumbbad is nothing like you have seen before and it should be seen on the big screen and revered for its creative art. TN.",Tumbbad
2,Fella_shibby,"The constant rain, vivid local landscapes, unique storyline n the amazeballs ending. If only the subject of true horror 'Sati' was explored more.",9,3 December 2018,"The film begins with top notch cinematography.The story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed.The story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.One family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.The mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way.The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon's idol.The house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.The house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside.There are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation.There is something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations.The constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes are characters themselves.It is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere.Kudos to the cinematographer n director, they did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.The director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.The story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.If u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details.Attention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.Also the moral subject of greed n lust are handled very well.The subject of Sati n female subjugation are sprinkled but not explored.Soham Shah and the kids gave noteworthy performances.Appreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film.Kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending.Love to see a prequel or sequel with more emphasis on the true horror Sati n the demon's backstory.",Tumbbad
3,sauravjoshi85,Milestone of Indian cinema,10,28 July 2019,"Tumbbad is a period horror movie starring Soham Shah, Anita Date, Ronjini Chakraborty and Mohammed samad with Jyoti Malshe and Deepak Damle playing supporting roles. The movie is directed by Rahil Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad.The movie is probably one of the best and beautiful horror movie of Bollywood. The director duo were so dedicated for the perfection of the movie as it took six years to make this movie but were reshot as the director duo was not satisfied with the movie and Soham shah maintained his look for the entire duration of six years.The acting is great by all the characters but highlights are Soham Shah and Mohammad Samad.Cinematography is beautiful and so as the virgin location used in major shooting. Majority of the movie is shot in natural light which gives the realistic impact also the entire movie was shot during the monsoon to give realistic cloudy feel. Background music is superb so as the screenplay. The movie doesn't looses it's plot anywhere and keeps you engaged.This movie is one of the milestones in the history of Indian cinema and a must watch for every true movie lover.",Tumbbad
4,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Visually Stunning and Interesting Commentary,9,24 December 2019,"This was a film that I caught during December when I was trying to compile my top 10 of the year. I heard a couple of people from social media speak very highly of this film as well as a podcast where one person had this make their list as well. Outside of a little of what was told, I came in pretty blind. The synopsis is a mythological story about a goddess who created the entire universe. The plot revolves around the consequences when humans build a temple for her first-born.For this, it is told in 3 chapters. The start of it, we learn about the goddess that is in the synopsis. Her first born is Hastar. He is not to be worshipped, because his mother created the heavens and all of the other gods. Hastar got greedy and went for the unlimited gold his mother produced. When he then went for the grain, the other gods and goddesses locked him in the womb of his mother.The story then begins when Vinayak (Dhundiraj Prabhakar Jogalekar) was a child back in the 1920s. He lives with his mother, Jyoti Malshe, as well as his brother. Every day she has to make food for their grandmother. There's a curse on her that she sleeps all day and we soon see there's something very wrong. Things take a turn when she attacks Vinayak and his brother has an accident.For chapter 2, it takes place where Vinayak is now Sohum Shah. He's married to Vaidehi (Anita Date) and they're living a meager life. He goes to Tumbbad, where he grew up to find that his grandmother is still alive. It is through her he is searching for the treasure that supposedly Hastar had. He is also working with Raghav (Deepak Damle) and we see what the greed of man will do.The final chapter takes place when India has obtained its freedom. Vinayak and his wife now have children. He takes his oldest to Tumbbad and we see the effects his greed has on him as well as his family. This god might actually exist like the legend states as well.Now for this review, I wanted to go a bit light on the recap as I really think that it needs to be experienced. This movie is very visually stunning in how it presents things as well as just the look overall. To get into the story, I love the legend that we're given to start out. This isn't a tale too different from other mythology, but I don't know a lot about Indian culture. I like how this is presented through images carved into stone with a bit of animation there.The different chapters are interesting as well. Early on we get introduced to the modest life that Vinayak lives in. He is really interested in the legend and trying to see if the fortune really exists. We can see that greed runs deep with him where his mother really just wants to be able to support her children and keep with the old rituals. As an adult, we see that Vinayak really wants more and what the effects of his decisions have on his children. I really enjoy not only this as an allegory, but also as a cautionary tale.I've already moved over to this a bit, but this is visually stunning. It is always raining in Tumbbad for what happened in the past which makes it look so dreary there. We also see the castle is rundown and that is what happens to Vinayak's place as he uses the gold he takes for worldly pleasures. His wife is very similar to his mother and I think they're more in line with the culture of the country overall. Vinayak seems more like an American or a capitalist with his greed. This just has some shots that are absolutely beautiful to look at.From here I want to take this to the pacing of the movie, which I thought was pretty solid. This is definitely more a slow burn I would say. That's not to say that nothing happens though or that we don't get some creepy images. The grandmother is quite terrifying and had me feeling uncomfortable. The same can be said for Hastar. This runs about 105 minutes though, so we definitely get some downtime for it build the story. I would say that I like how it ends and would be curious for the aftermath as well.As for the acting, I thought it was good across the board. Shah is great as Vinayak. He's such a jerk to be honest. We can see from an early age as Jogalekar that he's greedy. It is just part of his nature. It gets worse the more he fuels it and we get a bit of the sins of the father are realized to the son as well. Malshe was fine in her role as the one who's trying to show him the right way of doing things. I feel bad for Date. She is a good wife, but she is really neglected by her husband. He thinks that just providing for her financially is enough and no matter what she's there for him. Ronjini Chakraborty also plays his mistress. I don't like that he's cheating, but she is quite attractive if I'm going to be honest. I thought the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.I need next to cover the effects of the film, which I did have some slight issues. I thought the effects on the curse for the grandmother looked good. I'm not sure if they're CGI or practical, but I was on board there. The only issue I had was the more you can see with Hastar, the more I didn't care for it. It was creepy at first when we were just getting glimpses. There's not a lot in the way of effects aside from this. I did already say that this is shot amazingly well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. We get three spots here where it goes semi-montage and we get some Indian singing. These were made for the movie as they're giving us some exposition and deeper story, so I like them for that aspect. The other films from this country I've seen tend to use musical numbers even in films that aren't musicals, so I'll take what we got here. I do think they fit for what was needed as well.Now with that said, I really ended up digging this movie. I'm a big fan of mythology and like to learn more about other cultures. I'm also a fan with a bit of allegory or cautionary tale, which we get here with the greed aspect. It is really fitting as an American to see this play out, even if it is in a different country. I thought things played out well, it is paced more of a slow burn, but I tend to like movies like that. That is not to say we don't get some creepy things or action in general. The acting was good, the effects are hit or miss if I'm going to be honest, but it is shot beautifully. The soundtrack isn't necessarily my bag, but I do like how they use for sure. I will warn you, this is from India, so I watched it with subtitles on. If that's an issue, move along. If not, I feel this to be really good and is going to contend as one of my favorites of the year.",Tumbbad
5,Amyth47,An original premise shot beautifully.,9,1 December 2018,"My Rating : 9/10Tumbbad is a tale of greed. A story which is universal however it is presented with such elegance here, the cinematography is simply breath-taking. The dark atmospheric tone of the film is a genius touch. A unique film experience not to be missed.",Tumbbad
6,saptesh786,Not over on average,5,15 October 2018,"Even a solid story and perfect atmosphere for mysterious drama at your hand but unfortunately you are not capable to present power packed impression. Same thing is occurred with the director of ' Tumbbad'. He could not use those two things properly resulting a best mystery drama failed into a fuss.We did not understand many scenes properly due to lack of presenting styles 
One the all drama happened into dark, even faces of characters do not see clearly making us less connects to them. 
Two the dialogues are not utterly proper then we could not understand what is talking on screen 
Three some questions never be answered like why old lady chained? How Hastar turn live ? How old lady alive after 14 years?
Difference line between Vinayak's house and the treasure 'wada' is very thin. One could not understand which one is seen on screen? Way to treasure tunnel is not showed well but in various pieces made us confusing.
Such three chapter story needs to make trilogy not to mixing in one movie.Touch of mystery and horror, which is main and essential part of the stories from famous writer Narayan Dharap is missing here as I have read his many novels.Unnecessarily background music losing importance of horror. (like every bollywood horror movie)Climax should have a good one and end must have pointing out to another sequel. ( which is a must part of such horror movies ).Many reviewers gave 10 or 9 star, but movie deserve only 5. Some compare this to 'Conjuring' but there is no sense to compare with Hollywood horror. They are far away and their presentation is always good.Overall it is a average bollywood horror.",Tumbbad
7,MuviFan73,A nice (horrorsome) fictional account!,5,3 December 2018,"When a movie started, I was like whoa it's not something we already believe in. I mean like the creator the preserver and the destroyer. But then I ask what a 'movie' really is? The answer is it also could be any fictional account entertaining us, so that is what this movie is.The movie even reminded me of sone ke ande dene wali murgi (the hen which gave golden eggs), but then don't be comfortable the movie also belongs to genre 'horror'.",Tumbbad
8,Jithindurden,Visual treat for horror fans,8,10 December 2018,"A supernatural horror thriller that shows the dark side of greed which becomes itself the biggest horror. The period setting, the cinematography and the overall production design are stunning. The atmosphere created through cinematography, music and the limited use of dialogues is perfect here. There can be found a lot of inspirations but the core of it is placed in Indian mythology itself although the exact myth is can't be found anywhere which helps the way the story unravels in the film.",Tumbbad
9,Azanspy,One of the best Bollywood film of the year.,7,23 December 2018,The horror genre in Bollywood is below par till Tumbbad. Tumbbad is one of the best horror movie made in Bollywood and in India. A big round of applause for it's cinematography and VFX.,Tumbbad
10,ebeckstr-1,"Intriguing, if somewhat overrated",7,9 May 2021,"While I can't agree with all of the 9 and 10 star reviews this is nonetheless a fascinating, intriguing, and horrifying movie. The body horror aspect of the film is gruesome, and the folkloric and mythological elements create entertaining mystery and suspense.During the beginning of the climactic moments the script writer invents new rules out of nowhere, which was unnecessary and disappointing. That's one of the main reasons I can't give this film more than seven stars. The ending is not dissatisfying, it just hinges on a new set of circumstances that had no presence in the first part of the movie and break with the story and logic that had been established heretofor.Nonetheless, this movie is ambitious and made with above average inspiration and effort .",Tumbbad
11,frankblack-79961,"Good, but overrated here.",7,14 August 2020,This was definitely a neat piece of Hindu mythology horror put to film. The production was very good. The people that made this are obviously very talented. My only dislike was how it ended. I felt like the writers forced the ending they wanted with rather subpar writing compared to the rest of the film. How this gets so many 9s and 10s is beyond me. Sonething about foreign films makes people go a little overboard in their praise. It was good. A well written ending would have made it really good.,Tumbbad
12,user-651-726996,Very Engrossing & Engaging,8,9 January 2019,"Tumbbad felt like a regional Indian film because I can't digest the fact that such a film came out of that nepotism smeared Hindi film industry. The film at 1 hour 45 minutes is positively slow and every time I felt now is the climax, the film went on and I was so happy that it did.Tumbbad is not a horror film. It's basically a spooky thriller drama. But a very well and tightly written screenplay, very engaging and though at times when nothing was happening I was still engrossed in the film.Kudos to the make up artists and the art directors. Brilliant job. I applaud the director for such a film and to produce such a film, one needs guts beyond those shameless 'commercial' film makers of 'Bollywood' possess.Tumbbad's theme of human emotion is greed and what a way to show case it. The film in it's entirety was 'standing ovation' worthy.One of the top 3 films of 2018.",Tumbbad
13,beevenkat,What about greed?,7,27 October 2019,"#Tumbbad is a location that can exist anywhere in this world. Its a dark n cursed place where it rains throughout the year. Here lives a mother who protects her child in her womb. This child has plenty of wealth, but is always hungry for food. The hero tempts the child with food n tries to take away its wealth. What happens thereafter? Need can definitely be fulfilled, but what about 'greed'? Will man ever be satisfied? Very good performances, some scary scenes n competent direction r the plus points. Watch it. Rating 3.5/5.",Tumbbad
14,jetkot,Sheer Brilliance,10,12 April 2019,This was a spine chilling tale of greed and its repercussions. Sohum Shah and Mohammed Samad play father and son in this brilliant story. Sohum Shah looks the part and acts well. Mohammad Samad is the star here. He steals the show. He plays two roles in this movie. The Second one being the grand mother. He does equally well in both roles. There is an eerie feeling as soon as the movie starts. The folk tale of a legendary god who was never worshiped because of his greed sets the context. Every scene has been shot with finesse. The locations are breath taking. The scenes keep you on the edge and the story moves at an even pace. Indian Horror is finally soaring new heights. Kudos to Anand Gandhi and Sohum Shah for producing this one and a big applause for the writer Rahi Anil Barve. This is a brilliant horror story set in an Indian village called Tumbbad.,Tumbbad
15,AnonymousbutDilpreet002,Bollywood is trying,8,18 August 2020,"So much has been said about this film. I will be talking more about the process of making rather than the film itself.There's a lot of hard work went in making this epic. It took 7-8 years for it to complete. A major role was played by Mohammad Samad, the kid. In these years, his voice had changed a lot. There was a lot of difficulty in syncing the sound. All the rain scenes were shot in real rain. The director was ready to wait for months for rain to arrive again. You can find it in a video how the mother's womb was designed. Moreover, it's done on an estimated budget of 8-10 crore. It's hard to replicate even at 200 crore. The cinematography was just phenomenal.It's the only Bollywood horror I have watched that don't involve a ghost poccession story. It is very original story. They have created a fictional story of Hastar. In coming decades, it might be a part of our folklore.Whether it's a masterpiece or not is upto you. But, the amount of effort they have put in making it is unprecedented atleast in Bollywood. An extremely original story is what I admire about it the most.",Tumbbad
16,Puroo,Imagine if this film got more publicity...,10,21 May 2021,"Would you believe me if I tell you the budget of this film is just 5 crores (nearly $700k)? Before you let that fact sink in, would you believe me if I also tell you that this is the director's first ever film? Rahi Anil Barve - remember this name. You might need to speak it when someone asks you who your favourite Bollywood director is. This film was made for 6 years. Keep reading, I will tell you why it took so long.Tumbbad is set in the village of the same name in Maharashtra. The story is set during the colonial period, and also some of it just after the independence. Though the village exists in real, it is nothing like what has been described in the film. According to the film the village has been cursed for writing the name of Hastar, a demon son of a Goddess who gave birth to 160 million gods. Because of the curse it is always raining in Tumbbad. Since the budget of this film was so low, the filming was only done during monsoon season when it was actually raining in the village. That's how low the budget of the film is - they couldn't even afford fake rain so they had to wait for 6 years to complete the filming.In spite of the low budget, it does not give the feeling of being cheap at all. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd think this is a very expensive film. The actors aren't popular, but I don't see where the problem is over there. How many of us knew the names of all the actors from Baahubali? Still we watched it, right? So I'd think this is also a regional film. The acting is phenomenal. The horror scenes absolutely give me the creeps. It's perfect in every sense. Even the ending is left on an ambiguous note, enough to leave a shrill down anyone's spine. The posters of this film are also very good, and it's a shame to say that the worst one has been used over here. Look up for the other posters on Google Images.The reason why Tumbbad failed to cross a huge commercial mark is because it wasn't advertised at all. If I hadn't read an answer on Quora that said it should have been sent to the Oscars instead of Gully Boy, I'd have never even known about its existence. There was literally no talk of it. Sure it has a low budget for making the film, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't spend in the marketing at all. It was so awesome, I for one would have definitely seen it if I had heard about it before. Also the only way to watch it now is through Prime, which will show you this film only if you type the correct spelling in the search box. It's a shame that you can't watch this film unless you know specifically what you're looking for.I really admire the dedication of the director to make this film. He clearly knew this film wasn't going to be earning those big bucks, yet he continued to make it. This is what happens when you have directors who treat their work not as products but rather as works of art. I really aspire to be a filmmaker of that type. This film will be a very big lesson to me. I wish Rahi Anil Barve a very successful and prosperous career in the future.",Tumbbad
17,tushargupta-27286,Ok,4,25 October 2020,This movie is ok only one time watch fantasy story not so good but how peoples give 10 rating i give 4star,Tumbbad
18,sriramthestranger,Excellent take on Greed!!,9,20 May 2020,The movie starts with Gandhi's quote on Greed followed by a mythological story. The plot has 3 chapters around a span of 50 years. What makes you glued to the screen is the cinematography and gloom setting throughout the film. I have never seen an Indian film with such a take on greed other than gangster movies killing each other for money. The movie is wonderful to watch that doesn't leave you disappointed!!,Tumbbad
19,madhukar30,Absolute Masterclass........,10,29 June 2020,"Tumbbad is a Silky visual masterpiece Interwoven in a beautifully filled with suspense, mystery and horror. Only a very few Indian movies can match Tumbbad's Mind boggling artistic appeal, the credit should go entirely to the director and the whole crew of the film. The movie was shot over a period of multiple years and though it was completed in 2012, it was reshot again and completed in 2015 as the director was not completely happy with the first version. The script was in the making for almost a couple of decades and when it was ready many production houses walked out time and again due to the various differences. The final end product that we see today is a dedicated and sustained effort this dedicated core team. The movie is poetry in every department the standout being the Cinematography, editing, costumes design, production design, VFX, Music, shooting locations and layered acting. Though shot on a minuscule budget by today's standards, the work can be compared to the best of the best movies ever made, yes it is that good. I Normally never give ratings over 8 for any movie but this one deserves a full 10/10 for its visual pleasure and the way it works one's mind. This movie is a must for any movie lover all around the world with a disclaimer to be ready to get engulfed into the world of a Mystic Adventure which will be enthralled on your minds forever.",Tumbbad

22,papanloveu,"Definitely, One Of the Best Movie!!",9,29 July 2021,"Its an interesting mythological story with a horror presentation that Bollywood have never made till now.The story telling, the concept and the overall imagination is just terrific. The movie hooks you to the screen from the very beginning,providing answers to all the questions that sprung up in your head,as it moves calmly,letting you enjoy the overall flavour of its premise. The CGI has been done really well and the best part being that not a single shot or scene of the movie seems to be extra or unnecessarily added.The entire movie, the rains, the spooky music, great camera angles and the dark effect, the beautiful narrative that made the movie different from any other movie.I strongly recommend everyone to watch TUMBBAD by Rahi Anil Barve.Most importantly the budget is only 5crore and 6years of hard work.",Tumbbad
23,Tejas_Vinda_AITS,Dark and deep 👍,8,10 October 2018,"-----A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy. His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema.
The film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.",Tumbbad

25,yogeshevolution,Gripping story by indian origin must watch,9,7 December 2018,"Tumbbad is so far best movie in horror fantasy genre from india. The story holds you from very beginning till the end..... With a good moral to us all greed always leads to destruction by any ways. Story, direction, acting is just awesome. Really impressed never expected such a movie from indian origin.I have to say this movie is even better than many of Hollywood movie (No offense).",Tumbbad
26,AnishMisra,Tumbbad Review,9,8 December 2018,"Tumbbad is a film co-written and directed by Rahi Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad. I was impressed with the trailer for the film and reading the difficulties the film went through in the making compelled me to watch the film. Finally watching in last night, I was satisfied and happy.Plot: Follows Vinayak Rao, who goes to the village of Tumbbad to retrieve gold coins from the womb of Hastar's mother.Plot: For the first few minutes, I was kind of figuring it is to what is happening in the film. But when I started to get a hang of it, I was just shocked (in a very good way). The story spans a time of 30+ years and the makers have gone lengths to show that authenticity. The set design is dull and dark and sets the mood for the film. I liked the way the makers used natural lighting for the scenes. Given the budget of the move, the production design, VFX and creature design were on par with any Hollywood film. But in addition to these technical aspects, it's the story that was the victor. The main theme of the story is about greed and at what lengths a man can go, to satisfy his greed. He gets several warnings and messages from his near and dear ones, but he doesn't pay heed to them. The mixing of a very common theme along with fantasy/horror is what caught my attention. Never does any scene feel forced. Also, the horror was just awesome. I couldn't find any kind of jump scares which have become a tradition in any horror film. The makers just present the scene to you so you can feel scared. In addition to all these facts, the cinematography was just awesome and you are directly transported 80 years back.Performances: The casting is just impeccable and everyone justifies their role. Sohum Shah is the star of the film. From when he enters to scene till his last scene, he was just splendid. You can see that the actor has a range of emotions and he displays them to perfection. Another mention is Jyoti Malshe, who played the role of Vinayak's mother perfectly. Mohammad Samad as Pandurang played his role with utmost sincerity. Deepak Damle who plays Raghav deserves a special mention.Music: Well this is one department where I did have a small issue. The background score was great and added so much to the horror as well as the story. An applause to Jesper Kyd for the BGM. The only song in the film that was there was not necessarily needed. The duo Ajay-Atul have given some great music in the past. It felt as if this was more of a marketing gimmick and they were forced to compose a song for the movie.Favorite Scene: One scene that really caught my attention was where Vinayak and his mother decide to leave Tumbbad once and for all and Vinayak on the other hand decides to torture the grandmother to reveal the location of the gold. That scene shows us the germ of greed has already been planted inside Vinayak's head.Verdict: Tumbbad is an answer to all those people out there who think adding songs and intimate scenes to films make them great. Absolutely, not. If your story has a wonderful theme and striking visuals you are in for a treat. And Tumbbad surely is. It is one of those films that you will love or hate. I would mark myself on the former category of people. Definitely a must for horror film lovers.I am going with a 9/10.",Tumbbad
27,sudhakaranakhilan,Mythical exclamation,8,28 April 2020,"Through the context of myth, horror, and fantasy Tumbbad is going in the slot of a distressful and scary movie. This film provides so much scare not only because of the setting but also the appearance of the characters. Vinayak's grandmother's appearance is so disgusting as we feel like to vomit sometimes and also the Hastar's incarnations. When we enter deep into the core of the movie, it indirectly talks about the greediness of human being one side. People are always hungry to become rich. Here wealth and food symbolize two categories and that categorization has that mythical interpretation about Hastar. The film starts with the quote of Mahatma Gandhi, ""The world has enough for everyone's needs, but not for everyone's greed. This one is accurately what the film is about. With the element of the film, we should also talk about the technical side. For me, the production design of the film steals the show. Each section or period of the Tumbbad village's portrayal was so brilliant. That helps the creators to provide a frightening atmosphere to the audience. From the period 1918 to 1947, the place setting, the construction, and even though all other properties the production design department made a special concern. Photography is also excellent because the light source is so much little because of that atmosphere and the cinematographer nicely handled that situation. Apart from the subject and its mythical derivation, the film is worth watching because of its technical aspect.",Tumbbad
28,i_odin,Satisfyingly original,9,13 December 2018,"Tumbbad is by all means a masterpiece and a trend setter for the genre involved. It pushes the envelope for not only Indian cinema but for the world cinema in totality. Though when it comes to horror telling, Indian culture has a very rich heritage and expertise still this film by attaching one of the most basic human emotion-greed with it and made it more humane.
The film very intriguingly portrays the inner monster of man and makes you afraid of it. Ironically the monster involved itself is very naive and to be honest not so scary but what makes the film more scary is infact the length a human can go for his greed.
Cinematography and VFX were on point. Though the characters could have been more strong or multi dimensional. But still this film is a memorable one for sure for what it offers to the audience.",Tumbbad
29,samyaksambuddha,Not really Bollywood,9,19 October 2018,"This was something that may give may give 'goosebumps' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs.
I was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie .
Sohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date.
The direction was not orthodox and was original.
This is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring.
A must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3",Tumbbad

39,naveensankaran18,A visually stunning mythological tale that is haunting yet rewarding,9,15 February 2021,"With a relatively simple parable on greed, Director Rahi Anil Barve created an horror-fantasy-period film that transcends language barriers!The movie starts off with a mythological prelude on the Goddess of Prosperity and her first and most beloved offspring, Hastar, who is greedy for her gold and food. This prelude, unlike many others, makes complete sense once we start witnessing the events as they unfold.Split into three different chapters, Tumbbad follows the journey of Vinayak Rao, played brilliantly by Sohum Shah, who lives with his younger brother and mother, who serves the local lord called Sarkar. But there is something fishy going on...something hidden in the dark...inside the fort. Along with the never ending rainfall, the secrecy adds a gloomy nature to the frame and our experience alike.Dealing with the human nature of greed, Tummbad explores the psychological urge of a man towards wealth and woman, while providing us with a metaphorical representation on how deep one's thirst for wealth can plunge into, much like the Goddess Womb! It might seem like a simple story from Chanda mama or Panchathantra, but the way the parable was extrapolated with metaphors etched in its frame, Tummbad stands out!In any horror movies, the sound design plays a huge role in creating a haunting environment that instils fear within us. Being no exception, Tumbbad had some good...sorry..! amazing guys doing the sound design!! Take this scene for instance.. Vinayak prepares some food for their ""guest"" but out of fear, insists his younger brother, Sadashiv, to serve it. While he is walking towards the ""guest"" room, we just hear the ever ending thunder showers, hooting breeze and the hurricane lamp which scratches the house wall. You wish to see something out of the blue but you are left with the trembling feet of young Sadashiv, his lungs gasping for fresh air and his eyes glued towards the room; we are ""Sadashiv"" at this moment - expecting something unexpected. This particular stretch of sound design stands out, as it's just not about the haunting score, just not about the horrific faces. It is about providing what that scene needs, what that frame is envisioned for, what that story requires! And Tumbbad has some great background scores (Jesper Kyd, Ajay-Atul) that went hand-in-hand with the sound design (Kunal Sharma), in enhancing our viewing experience.Though a Hindi-language feature, the locations and the production design made it look like a Marathi one; the feature is so rooted in terms of the costume design, spanning over the pre and post-Independent India. Look at the different locks that are used throughout the film. I mean, nothing is simple! You need more than an inch of metal to open anything! Apart from depicting it as a period film, the locks themselves holds a metaphorical reference - one needs more than just a curious mind to enter any door in Tumbbad.! A great chunk of credit goes to the set-pieces in drawing us closure to the narration. Kudos to Nitin Zihani Choudhary and Rakesh Yadav.And the guys behind the camera (Pankaj Kumar) and the editing table (Sanyukta Kaza) are just absolutely terrific! The way the characters are followed up close, one can really feel the movements that they plan and enact, the action sequences as they play out! Even the horrific sequences are quite steady; there are no quirky movements to create instant adrenaline rush but just pure intention in creating a ""mood"" for the audience to dwell into. The atmosphere was maintained throughout the runtime, be it the breath-taking landscapes of Tumbbad or the busy streets of Pune. The grandeur of the feature was ensured in it's first shot, showcasing a wide view of the fort but with a tiny place for a woman to enter. These kinds of tiny bread crumbs are always interesting when we re-watch such features!I will not be telling the truth if I said I have seen something like this in Indian Cinema! A film has to be so rooted for it to be international and Tumbbad is an international film indeed. The direction team took a tole on their mind to extract every amount of information and creativity that was required in making a one-of-a-kind mythological movie that we never asked for. It is one such movie that deserves our attention, purely for its narration. I am not going to ruin your cinematic experience by listing all the references that this movie has! Grab your seats and enjoy the experience of Tumbbad!",Tumbbad

41,ups-36964,A fresh breath of air in Bollywood,9,15 February 2020,"Seriously, i've never thought before that bollywood could make such excellent and impactful film like Tumbbad. This movie delivers all your expectations.The acting, the screenplay, direction, and the especially, the cinematography, all are amazing. Tbh i never expected it to be that great. A Hollywood level feeling arises when we watch it. It also doesn't have a nonsense happy endingIt's not actually a horror movie though, because Hastar, is not the villian. Here. Greed is used as the metaphor for evil, which has possessed Vinayak's family and is spreading fast, generations after generations. That's what we like the most. It has a hidden message, not like some illogical and trash masala movies. But cutting one star coz of the cringe voice and dialogues of Vinayak's grandma (in hindi version)..",Tumbbad
42,gautam-moharil,Mature horror film,9,24 June 2019,"This film has supernatural elements, horror elements and dark undertones. The film also has a deeper meaning which is not displayed blatantly. Previously in Hindi films, I've seen all these elements but never together. So this makes it a standout film. Now a days it's nice to see Indian film makers experimenting and doing it successfully. The narrative was excellent, the acting and cinematography is great.Surely a landmark film for the Indian film industry.",Tumbbad
43,sanjubhat,Tumbbad - a must watch film 👍👍👍,9,14 October 2018,"The film is based in Tumbbad village in Maharashtra and tells the story of Vinayak's ( Sohum Shah ) life , his rise from being an illegitimate child of a rich man to becoming a greedy opportunist whose lust for a hidden treasure makes him forget life's values and finally realizing his mistakes when it is too late for him.The film is shown in three intriguing chapters :
-Chapter 1 ( Feudal India in the early 1900's ), shows the life of young Vinayak who lives with his mother in an old Vada with his illegitimate father and a mysterious old dadi who is cursed and needs to be chained. It shows the horrific circumstances in which he and his mother have to leave Tumbbad . These circumstances ignite in him , an insatiable lust for the hidden treasure supposedly lying buried under the Vada. -Chapter 2 ( Colonial India under the British) depicts the life of Vinayak fourteen years later as a young man who undertakes a journey back to Tumbbad to find the hidden treasure , succeeds in locating it despite all odds and returning back for more time and again. Greed and decadence take toll on his life as his wealth grows over time.
 
-Chapter 3( The Final chapter set after India's independence) shows an aging Vinayak still lusting after the treasure and training his son to continue with his legacy resulting in a grim end to the tale. The film impeccably shows the changes in these three era's and is perfect to a flaw. Minute details like the weathering of the old vada over time & even the locks used to hold things have been showcased very well. Hats off to the directors Rahi Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad for this.The film also mixes period and horror genres very well . The film is scary in bits and parts primarily due to the awesome special effects. But more than the horror depicted by the ancient myth , the hideous monster protecting the treasure and the curse associated with it , it is actually the protagonists greed and lust for the treasure which makes him cross the lines of morality time and again is much more scary.Sohum Shah and the rest of the cast including the young Mohammed Samad as his son have done a great job with their very well etched out roles. Sohum's character has grey shades and even though he is is an opportunist to the core , there is a caring side to his character which is shown as well.Music by Ajay Atul is haunting and works very well with the films narrative.
The casting of all characters is awesome to say the least.My Verdict :-
A film like this has seldom been attempted in Bollywood and is a treat for people who would like to see films with strong content in them. Horror is a very small part in the whole story and the film is not very scary . However , the mixing of period ,horror & fantasy genres works splendidly for the film and leaves a profound effect on your mind as you leave the cinema theatre.
I will go with 9 out of 10 for this film. An additional half a star to the makers for taking the risk with this offbeat kind of a subject & yet delivering the goods impeccably!!",Tumbbad
44,peter-laganis,"Perhaps great for Indian filmography, but otherwise an average b movie",6,29 May 2020,"Yes, the atmosphere is right.
Yes, there are some horror and fantasy elements.
Yes, there are a few interesting elements.
Yes, you won't see the main characters sing or dance.
... but ...
No, this is not a movie (internationally speaking) which deserves a rating greater than 7.
And I'm quite generous and realsitic on that.
There is nothing scary about it. The story is just a retelling of something we've heard or read during our childhood. Acting is avarage and the atmosphere doesn't excel.

49,rtoac1,Morality hidden by excellent execution,9,8 January 2019,"By the end of Tumbbad, you get the message forced upon is that greed has no end, and will lead to a bad end. But ironically, even that message is thrust upon the viewer behind an act of selfless sacrifice, by a father to save his child.
And this is the core problem behind Tumbbad. By showing the luxurious life led by the protagonist, and the excellent execution of the whole film (including the element of horror, myth and pre/post independence society), one keeps missing that the message is ""no guts, no glory"". I wish they had probed further into the angle of ""he doesn't feel happiness in anything despite having it all"". That would have been bang on to the purpose of the film!",Tumbbad

The concept of an evil, forgotten god who can really provide money but ask for some sacrifices is raw and fresh.Movie is set in British India, and the situation is depicted as realistic as it could be. There is nothing fancy here, the movie is so simple in all its fronts that it looks really true and the viewer can't help but fantasize about the money involved. This greed is a strong part of the movie and anyone can correlate with Vinayak and his thought process.This kind of cinema is important and we need to preserve it to the best of our abilities.

57,ShitizSays,Why the fetish to like an unlikable movie just to sound intellectual !!,2,3 August 2019,"I have heard that this film took nearly ten years to get made and as an audience of the film I would expect that they would do everything in those ten years to make the script as interesting and watchable as possible.Most Indian Directors make the films to satisfy their whims and fantasies.They refuse to accept that film making is an art and just like any art, it has it own rules and limitations.Tumbbad breaks all those rules and not for good.The story is told in bits and pieces.The story keeps taking long jumps in the time without any explanation or transition.We don't understand but we wait for something interesting to happen and it doesn't happen.The only interesting thing in the film are inside the cave.I understand the film is technically brilliant with great cinematography, great color grading and great sound effects but the weak story line pounds heavy over everything.The lead actor Soham Shah is also the producer of the film and in real life he is a rich loaded guy. He is an Indian Millionaire.He starred in some commercial films earlier but none worked so he moved towards independent filmmakers and came out with Ship of Thesus, which was another film with deep meanings and which was blown out of proportions.Soham Shah cannot act and that is why the director hasn't given him too many talkie scenes as his dialogue delivery is worst.The director played on his expressionless face and created the character like that.There is nothing much to see in this film.On internet everyone was praising the film but when I went to see it in the hall, everyone was just cursing it.I think few intellectuals loved it but people who seek entertainment in films, this film was not for them.No matter what one's argument be, the film that bores you cannot be good.",Tumbbad

The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I'll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed.

As an Indian horror film, this film gives people a fresh feeling, although it is inevitable that Indian characteristics of singing and dancing.Strange and mysterious legends, bloody underground palaces, rainy mansions, horrible and bloody evil gods all give people a sense of terror that precipitates the vicissitudes of history.If there is a key word in the film, it must be greed, the hero began to kill the wool of the evil God because of greed, and also lost his life because of greed.His son had a bad idea because of greed, which almost killed the father and son.In the end, although he closed the door of the underground palace and the mansion, but as long as greed again, he will come back, greed, is a kind of eternal immortality such as tarsal maggots curse.",Tumbbad

I refrain from watching Bollywood movies and it's once in a lifetime thing that a movie like this that too in a horror genre comes up.Please watch this movie, I don't want it to be underrated as it deserves more.

77,kooldddon,Redifining Hindi Cinema,10,16 October 2018,"Tumbbad is a modern cinematic masterpiece. Visually stunning, dark and gritty. Set in the 1900's it is a story of greed revolving around a legend. The first born child Hastar of Goddess, what happens when humans build a temple for him when it's forbidden forms the crux of the story.The movie is visually so strong and appealing that it captures you right from the first frame. The entire movie is shot in natural light which lends a lot of authenticity to the visuals. This has to be one of the most hauntingly brilliant camera work I have ever seen in a movie. Every shot and scene seems like a work of art. The VFX is stunning as well to create Hastar in the Goddess's belly. Simply stunning work.The screenplay is so crisp, detailed and disturbing that it will stay with you even after the movie is over. The screenplay is divided into 3 chapters according to the generation of the family involved. The music by Ajay-Atul and Jesper Kyd goes so well with the tone and theme of the movie. Sohum Shah as Vinayak is absolutely brilliant. The supporting cast act wonderfully well. Portraying the Greed, one of the seven deadly sins, of human nature and how it leads to downfall is written and captured amazingly. No wonder this movie took years to write and make and was again rewritten and re-shot. The results are amazing. Rahi Anil Barve and Anand Gandhi take a bow. You have created something amazing.Tumbbad is easily the best film of the year for me and it surely is among the best films made. It redefines horror genre with stunning visuals, amazing writing and sound. It's a must watch.",Tumbbad

79,nambivp-33248,Bollywood completely over looked this amazing film,7,24 February 2020,"I was very surprised when Tumbbad wasn't included in any major awards. This shows how bad Bollywood has become. It promotes films with famous actors and cheap stories. Tumbbad is a retelling of 'chicken that lays golden eggs' story.
The film is filled with gorgeous shots. Most of the film takes place in an area where there is incessant rain. Yet, every shot is unique. Even the low light scenes are beautiful. Some scenes are surreal and creepy.
But, even with a runtime of 100 minutes, it feels slow. A huge chunk of the second act tests the patience of the viewer. The music doesn't intrude every scene. In many scenes, silence evokes fear.
The actors have given an excellent performance. The computer graphics is really bad. If there had been enough budget, it would have turned out well. Tumbbad is a rare gem from Bollywood that should not be missed.",Tumbbad

83,ThunderQunt,Well-produced but Hollow.,6,31 August 2021,"I have to disageee with the excellent ratings for this film. I did contemplate giving it a 7 but alas, it just didn't live up to a 7. A 6.5 would be more giving.The biggest issue I had with this movie is that though I feel like I should feel something, I just didn't. That is emotionally, this film does not provide any. A scary scene does not make me tense or well, scared. A crying scene does not make me sad. A frightening or jarring sequence does not give out any energy. Maybe it's just me but throughout the movie, it just seem like a sequence of moving pictures with no real weight to it. I actually feel really bad that I didn't enjoy it as much as I think I should.Nevertheless, the film was well-produced, dialogues felt appropriate, the acting sufficed, as well as the sounds and music. Also, there is an underlying theme, issue, or social commentary, specific to the Indian culture that I find interestingly portrayed. An issue that should be brought up more.All in all, a well-produced mediocre movie with a mildly interesting story but alas, devoid of any significant emotions. Not a movie I would remember as worthwhile.",Tumbbad
84,CIDMoosa,Horror with an Indian Soul,8,11 February 2019,"For an Indian audience pretty much exasperated by routine horror clichés of jump scares, spirits in white sari and various exorcisms and occultist fares , Tumbbad is a revelation - something which can easily be termed as the best horror movie as an Indian production in recent times. That said the horror element is not a forced one but highly intertwined with the overall plot, making it one of the best story oriented horror tales with the thriller element taking the front stage for the major portion. Brilliantly directed as a period-fantasy-thriller-adventure flick, Tumbbad has 100% desi soul, blended magnificently into the dark and cursed landscape of Tumbbad. Set in Tumbbad in the 1920s and spanning from there through 3 chapters till post independent India, the plot revolves around the three generations of a family facing the consequences when they build a temple for the first-born of a goddess, named Hastar--he who must not be worshiped. Hastar is a terrible entity who can curse a person yet also can grant gold coins. And the story put emphasis on human nature and the never ending greed all the while drawing parallels to the exploitation of poor souls by the ever greedy masters. Among a bevy of not-so-famous actors, the main hero of the movie might as well be the art direction - simply brilliant at multiple levels. Pre-Independence Era sets, spooky mansions of Tumbbad and even minute details like locks and doors are done with an eerie perfection and earthen feel that it blends right in to the dark and contrasting frames throughout the movie. While majority of bollywood is losing it over overtly bright and rich visuals and glitz of Bhansali movies, here the makers have created absolute magic with a perennial rain receiving glum Tumbbad landscape. Considering the apparently small budget of the film, VFX employed is top notch compared to disasters like Thugs of Hindostan. It might be downright fitting for the bollywood mainstream audience to push aside the khan clan now and give talented makers like this a chance worth every penny they spend for a cinema!",Tumbbad

Makes me wonder what is acceptable these days. Very sad state of affairs.While the film did not show any sex acts with the child, just the dialog and the scenes relating to his sexual awakening were very disturbing and completely unnecessary to the plot.

With a little bit of dark comedy, this visual masterpiece is extremely entertaining. The mystery is unfolded ponderously and it has a profound effect.I am truly thankful to my sister for compelling me to watch this along with her in PVR.

101,anupkranal,Visuals sometimes speak louder than words,8,20 October 2018,"Can you make a movie with stunning visuals and eyeballs grabbing sequences without VFX and expensive budget, yes you can. The crew of Tumbbad has shown that creativity and craft is not a slave of technology and high budget, all you need is a passion towards the art. The movie has been made across a period of 10 years which speaks the amount of determination and hard work that has been put by the makers of this movie.Story and screenplayWe all have watched Amar Chitra Katha on Television if you are 90's kid; Tumbbad is like revisiting those olden days of tales that teach us important life morals. The morals in question here is greed. The story has nothing special to offer apart from a little suspense and twist in the climax. But the screenplay, cinematography, larger than life sets and background score transformed a simple story into a brilliant cinematic experience. The screenplay by Rahi Anil Barve and team is gripping and tense. The screenplay does get slow midway but Rahi Anil Barve and his team regained the form in the latter half of the movie.
DirectionThe first time director Rahi Anil Barve who is also one of the writers of Tumbbad did a commendable job. He knows exactly what he is trying to show and achieve. The best thing about Rahi Barve is that he showed full confidence in the concept and he was mindful of the tiniest details of the movie. His compassionate work is visible in the ancient locks, retro bus of pre independence era used in the movie. Even the smallest detail is well taken care of which makes sure that the audiences keep on believing this unbelievable tale of greed.Cinematography, Costume and SetsLet's talk about the main hero of the movie, the cinematography and the setting used in the movie. The crew of Tumbbad in order to add credibility shot the entire movie in monsoon at original locations in villages of Satara districts. According to the director, VFX is minimally used and natural light was the main source of lightening to bring in the visual effects. The product that has come out in the form of Tumbbad is nothing but a miracle in such a low budget. Such kind of Cinematography and setting is never seen in Bollywood. The movie will set a precedence of its own for years to come.
The costume and makeup also deserves a special mention here. The makeup of Haster and one who gets cursed by Haster is spooky and quite disgusting but adds a lot of credibility to the story and the characters. The prosthetics used for the makeover of the grandmother of Vinayak(Sohum Shah) played by Piyush Kaushik will make audiences turn their faces away in disgust and will keep some family audiences away from the theatre. The makers has to be lauded for taking this risk in a Bollywood movie as these kind of makeup makes the characters vivid and real. The prosthetics team has done a splendid job to create believable characters out of an unbelievable story.DialoguesIn the movie the story of Tumbbad has been told with very minimal dialogues but very effective ones. One of the dialogues ""so ja warna Haster aa jayega"" gives a feeling of those old Alif Laila dialogues.
PerformancesEvery actor has done their part well especially the child artistes used in the movie for the role of Soham Shah's younger self and Soham's son. Soham Shah carried the hard and strong look of a well built man very effortlessly. The actors in the movie have done well enough with their face expressions to keep the mystery and the suspense alive till the end of the movie.
Background score
The background score in the movie is not very loud like most other horror and mystery movies. Most of the movie is shot by using the natural sound of rain and surroundings. Some of the scenes do have those spooky sound effects to increase the horror factor but there are far in between. The movie relies heavily on silence of the natural settings to add authenticity to the proceedings.What is good?1. The cinematography
2. The original locations and setting
3. The Makeup , costume and prosthetics
4. The directionWhat is not so good?
1. Unnecessary use of scenes with sexual gestures which serves no purpose and could have been best avoidedOriginally posted at http://moviemusings.in/tumbbad-review

108,nitish-thebest-191995,A Cinematic Beauty !! Keep'em coming !,8,22 October 2018,"Was really wanting to watch this for quite some time now and finally got a chance !
An interesting mythological story draped in a horror presentation and some hard-hiting background music score really gives you the eerie -filled curiosity feeling that the director wanted to.Tumbbad is a very well-made movie and it delivers superbly on many grounds.The entire atmosphere created is just spectacular,the rains,the spooky rhythm,the nicely managed camera angles(which were out of place at times but did give that extra effect that was needed and went well with the dark feel) and the beautiful narrative that made the story all the more intriguing and the premise radically different from other movies.The acting doesn't play a big role here but nonetheless all the actors lived their chraracters to near perfection,with Soham Saha bringing an extra layer of personality to the main lead with certain expressions and laughs that really added greatly to the overall ambience.The story-telling,the concept and the overall imagination is terrific ! The movie hooks you to the screen from the very beginning,providing answers to all the questions that sprung up in your head,as it moves calmly,letting you enjoy the overall mystic flavour of its premise.The CGI has been done really well and the best part being that not a single shot or scene of the movie seems to be extra or unnecessarily added.It's a different movie and probably that's what is the best thing about it.I was thrilled by some of the scenes and it definetly used up a lot of my energy coming out through feelings of anticipation and extreme surprise at certain points,specially the climax which is truly unpredictable and quite enjoyable !Should give this one a watch for it's sheer justice and purity in what it intends to be - as Jonathan Barkan of Dread Central wrote ~ "" the film is more focused on the horror of human behavior than it is on creaking doors and the terror of what lurks in the dark.""I strongly recommemd to watch this one on the big screen cause that's where you'll actually sense it's true nature of darkness,atmospheric brilliance and the wonderfully-created monster/s !!Kudos to debutant director Rahi Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad.It feels proud to see such movies being made in India.Keep'em coming !!",Tumbbad
109,IdiotBox_Recommendations,One of the Best Hystorical Drama,8,11 July 2020,"In western Maharashtra lies Tumbbad- a village perpetually cursed with a deluge. An ancient folklore about the goddess of prosperity and her son 'Hastar' has a strong presence in the village. The village mansion or the 'wada' hides a secret treasure. Vinayak, an apparent heir to the mansion seeks the treasure.While Tumbbad may not be branded exactly as a horror movie, it has its moments with spooky, diabolical monsters and cursed mutants that will scare the living day lights of you. The set is that of 19th century British India and it reeks of authenticity. Cinematography is superb and special effects are quite impressive.Tumbbad weaves a tale where greed takes a physical, monstrous avatar. Jonathan Barkan of Dread Central wrote- the film is more focused on the horror of human behaviors than it is on creaking doors and the terror what lurks in the dark. The end has a beautiful message- a hard lesson and an unconditional sacrifice is required to break the cycle of greed and lust running through generations of Vinayak's family.Trivia: Tumbbad becomes the first ever Indian Film ever to open the prestigious Venice International Film Critic's week.The movie was shot for 6 years. The scenes shown in the village of Tumbbad which gets rain throughout the year was shot over 4 monsoons.",Tumbbad
110,emiel1234,"Beautiful cinematography, extremely disappointing VFX and never add music to a horror movie.",5,4 August 2020,"It is an overrated but decent effort for an Indian horror movie. Cheesy and funny at times which is not an emotion a horror movie should inflict. And there are reviewers questioning why this movie didn't win any oscars. Kill me now! Either paid reviews or people who have no clue what a good horror movie is. It's hard for me to use the words Indian and horror movie in the same sentence as they haven't come close to anything i would consider quality for my taste and I've seen a few. I do wish they cut out the music in this movie and they could've probably still retain the seriousness of what a horror atmosphere should feel like. Not sure why there is a constant need to add music in all their movie. At least people don't burst into a choreographed dance routine. Phew!The minute the music starts it has the every Bollywood run around the trees and dance in slow motion vibe. Let's not overlook the clever rip-off of ambient music used in some Hollywood movies. Doubt anyone who watched the movie would even notice over their high praises and positive, 10 out 10 ratings. Geez! Goes to show how easy it is to terrify certain members of the audience. I like horror and seen enough in every language out there for over 40 years. Korean, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, French, Iranian, and some from Hollywood will always rule the horror genre in my books. This movie in a few main scenes has way too much vfx for my taste, that too terrible to say the least. Let me explain something, you don't need a lot of vfx to make a good horror movie. It's the VFX that ruined this potentially decent movie. The only thing that did it for me in this movie was the cinematography. Otherwise, I would never watch it again.",Tumbbad

The VFX was surprisingly good for a movie of mere 6 crore budget. The movie depicts the sheer hard work by the entire crew. With top notch acting and great direction, this movie is a must watch for all the horrror/Fantady fans.
India has quality talent in terms of story and direction, and this movie is a perfect example. I'm sure there'll be more and more unique movies as this.",Tumbbad
119,nirzak,There's a great moral behind this story,10,6 May 2020,"Really It's a great storyline with perfect VFX. Jasper Kyd has done fantastic job on background music. Moreover the acting and the direction was also awesome. I think all Indian directors should try to make movies like this. And in the end there's a great moral behind this story and it is ""You can't earn your livelihood without any hard work and you should be happy with what you have got. If you become greedy and want to get more then you'll lose everything that you have.""",Tumbbad

122,rghvvikas,Wish I had seen it in theatre instead on Amazon prime,9,30 November 2018,"Tumbbad is an ideal for rest of Bollywood in storytelling and cinematography. What we don't understand is that it discourages the makers and those who are willing to take risks for the sake of entertainment if a brave and really nice film like Tumbbad fails to get audience. What we get as KARMA? The same cliche bollywood action drama looting pockets since last two decades.Sohum Shah is better than any Khan or Kapoor and leads the movie single handedly with brilliant acting and the supporting cast is as honest as the leader.Cinematography is on par with any Hollywood horror movie any day, not so much horror in the movie though but the storytelling keeps you always on the edge of your seat. MUST WATCH.",Tumbbad

And Soham Sah had his best performance till date...",Tumbbad
124,srirammeera,"Good Movie, great story & production values, nice touch of suspense, mystery & horror",7,6 April 2019,"Tumbadd is slightly over-rated by all the reviews here, as a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, its a great movie with high production values, solid spooky dark gloomy atmosphere and presses all the right buttons in the genre, solid story well presented etc. But a pure horror movie it is not - and does not approach the level of classic horror movies like The Omen or the Exorcist, or the Conjuring..
The story is to do with an old ancestral mansion in this place called Tumbadd that guards a deadly and chilling secret about a family treasure deep in the bowels of the mansion, that is intertwined with an ancient dark mythology. A child from that family, who grows up to the main protagonist returns with his son to search/mine/loot the treasure without heeding warnings - and then it becomes a cautionary tale about greed lust and avarice gone astray.
The Production values, the mysterious settings, the mansion that looks right out of a Lara Croft Tomb Raider setting , the gloomy darky rainy atmosphere are all excellently done. All in all a very professionally done mystery-horror movie with a solid story and clearly a great step up for Indian horror movies which tend to stick with the hoary tropes of evil spirits, ghosts etc - you will find none of the latter here.
The storyline is especially very commendable.
Not suitable for children due to sexual themes (no nudity) but could be M or 16 rating",Tumbbad

128,asifali-on-imdb,"So jaa warna Hastar aa'jaye'ga! Go to sleep, or else Hastar will visit you!",10,22 October 2021,"Probably one of the finest horror movie in the Industry. Every single aspect of it: script/story, characters/cast, direction, production level, special-effects on Hastar(evil entity), cinematography, moral, and last but not the least scare--all score pretty well on my chart.Sohum Shah proved that you don't need to bend the knees to the King of Bollywood in order to produce a gem. One can produce on their own--and this movie is a prime example of it.The story is about this World; how the children born from the same mother(Earth) were all nice until one came named 'Hastar'. His greed had no boundaries, he wanted all to himself, and himself only. He took all the GOLD from the world, and when he went for 'wheat'(food)--all gods and goddesses stroke together to stop and kill him. But, a mother's love is blind. She took him back inside her belly(which is portrayed with red sand--like, mother Earth's belly.Many eras passed... and humans are now more or less like Hastar. We all have Hastar deep within, and so this man gets gold from Hastar in return of a wheat doll he gives it to him. It's more like giving candy to a kid and snatching something in return. Hastar has a lot of gold, what he doesn't have is 'wheat(food)'. The trap is set, but it's not an easy one--every time something new/horror adds up.Find out how one man's greed can change his life from hell to heaven, and then hell again. Greed become a challenge, a survival, and more greed adds destruction. This message is beautifully portrayed/conveyed in this movie.A must watch!",Tumbbad

No regrets watching it, brilliant acting, story, sound effects, suspense, drama etc. This is my first review, I felt like I had to put this out here....Enjoy, and for all the bad ratings done by reviewers on this movie, I think they have no passion for watching movies.",Tumbbad

Based on a Story by Narayan Dharap, staying faithful to the original, directors did a top notch job setting the mood with dark ominous visuals that pair oh so well with the narrative.

152,lingamanenijaswanth,Horror masterpiece from Indian culture,8,17 April 2021,"Actually, I always hated Indian horror movies, as they were too dramatic and illogical. Indian horror were worth nothing infront of Hollywood's horror movies.But this movie is definitely on another level. This is how thrilled a movie would be if merged between horror and true Indian culture.There are no Khan's here, just some unknown actors. No mocking of any culture unlike bollywood movies.It conveys a message how horrible a person can be, if has endless greediness and desire.This movie is made completely in old Indian style. Character's names, cloth, ancestry defines it all.MORAL OF THE MOVIE: 'WORLD HAS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE'S NEED BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE'S GREED'",Tumbbad
153,atishnramdonee,An Original Desi Horror Movie!,9,6 July 2019,"I love the fact this was not an unoriginal monster, ghost or haunted house movie, because these really feel like as if Indians are copying from Occidental movies.I recently read that someone big in the Industry was about to make a Ghost Ship movie - don't we already know where we had first seen this, or how it's going to be. There's going to be an item song, probably some very good looking or famous actors, but all of these to compensate for the lack of spinal originality.However, this movie has succeeded into tapping from the giganormous pool of the ancient culture, history and mythology India has to offer. I am floored by the originality of the script and how it feels at home, like as if we have succeeded in creating our desi monster AT LAST!The physical settings: the lost cursed village in contrast to Colonial Pune.Ingenuous temporal location as this position of the plot in that particular time beautifully enhances the story. The actors were brilliant: convincing, natural, and authentic. The pace was comfortable, balanced and soft.This is not just another story where they have to defeat or kill or exorcise something. This feels like the stories, our Dadis or Nanis must have told us when we were kids, about things hidden, people disappeared, or new wealth discovered; of curses and boons, of gods, and secret shrines, stories that never really reveal their mysteries, keeping the mind alert because of the unresolved questions which pop at their ends.While this movie packed tons, I feel like it wasn't that scary for me but this is probably because I have watched way too many horror flicks, even if the eerie feeling from this movie has stayed with me - which in my opinion is a GOOD thing for a movie to make you feel.",Tumbbad

156,sinemafan,Splendid movie - chilling and gripping,10,21 October 2018,"In a strange way, this movie is a creature in itself - a day after having this seen wonderfully crafted movie, Tumbbad has stayed with me, enveloping me with its desolate and misty charm, and the truths it tried to convey. The movie is fast paced and and doesn't bother with petty details though it doesn't feel rushed and keeps the viewer engaged thoroughly as the story builds up. The movie focuses instead on building the key characters (I wish even more time was spent in defining them in greater detail given how interesting some of them were),
The performance by Sohum Shah is brilliant - he is a charismatic and talented actor and I hope we see him in more movies, and I hope we see more movies such as Tumbbad.
Do watch it in a theatre - it is important that we spend some money on such movies which would encourage more such movies.

Cons : 1. The CGI/VFX for the ""Hastar"" was poor. The creature was clearly looking like an animated figure rather than a living-being. 2. The sex scenes were not necessary. 3. There is too much darkness in the entire movie. Although the theme was dark was sufficient amount of light in normal scenes does not hurt eyes. 4. There should be more dialogues.

It's not horrifying, it's not scary, it's just a long drawn out snooze fest with a dodgy CGI monster and some dreadful zombie type things.There is no real story. It has a single conceit that's repeated over and over. The mythology is too simple to support the running time which was overly long. Maybe if they had cut half an hour out of it it may have been tighter and better?The main character is a unpleasant person. You can't root for such a poor excuse for a man. The dialogue is dull.Ignore the rave reviews.

This film does not deserve 10 stars, but, under normal circumstances, I'd give it a six or seven. The fact that it has over 200 review ten-star reviews, all saying the same thing, is about the most obvious example of rating rigging I've ever seen. It's too bad, because I know a lot of people will see these reviews and decide to skip this film---I almost did. In spite of that, it's not a bad little horror film. I'd classify it as fairy-tale horror, similar to the 2017 Basque film ERREMENTARI or the 1967 Soviet film VIY. If you're into that sort of thing, I'd say check it out. Two other things it has going for it are its length, which at 1 hour and 44 minutes is almost a short subject by Indian film standards, and the fact that it doesn't stop the action for some silly song-and-dance number. The film is also has an interesting structure, with the action taking place during three different times in a man's life.

When you take into consideration the miniscule budget one can't help feel impressed by what they have achieved.The music is not bad, it gets the job done. Some of the dialogue is unintelligible. I had to rewind to understand what was being said. I liked how they used some Hindi words that have gone out of use nowdays in our daily conversation but seem relevant given the time period.The story has enough to keep you hooked. It's not something extraordinary but good enough. I hope they extend it into a franchise. It has the potential for that.Sure given the fact that ""Tumbbad"" has come out of bollywood makes people appreciate it more ( especially Indians ) but I don't deem it fit to give the movie extra points for that reason alone.RECOMMENDED !",Tumbbad

177,Thechocolateboy,MUST NOT OVERLOOK THIS ONE,7,28 April 2020,"Film: Tumbbad(2018)
Directors:Rahi Anil Barve, Anand Gandhi
ImDB rating : 8.3/10
My rating : 7/10Here comes one of those brilliant movies which are not only worth a gigantic visual experience, but also a tonic for brain. The initial scenes will make you confuse, but not after Vinayak Rao's entry.Rao, who is a former villager of Tumbbad village, wants to become extraordinary rich in very short time. For that, he wants to explore the shrine where lies the curse of Hastar, the evil son of Goddess. Though, his mother didn't let him do it for years, after his mother's demise, he finally goes there and with some weird technique (which should best be due for watching) regularly brings golden coins. He sells those coins regularly to gain enough fortune and fame during the British Raj. Gradually, he is associated with corruption and sin.The story takes a twisted turn when Vinayak's son is found to be more immoralized than Vinayak himself. The same greed is found on his eyes also, with a temper twice than him. He wants all the gold coins at once, reminding the viewers about the anecdote of the greedy farmer and the goose. But does it also show the same consequences like the greedy farmer ? What happens to Vinayak and his son ?The director duo very skillfully develops the story under the picturesque time travel of British regime in India. The metaphorical presentation of Hastar is sure a thought provoking one. The dive of Vinayak into the chest of Hastar may be similar to that of our own brain, Bastar being the greed of human being. The last scene is a keel to the coffin of the same theory.Lastly,it's no wonder that Tumbbad received eight nominations at the 64th Filmfare Awards winning three for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Sound Design. It's one of those gems that one won't like to overlook.",Tumbbad

179,arunsrid,A rare and brilliant product of the otherwise useless hindi film industry,10,22 June 2020,"Usually films like this which are 90 to 100 minutes in duration, without any songs, and with brilliant stories, come out only in Malayalam, Bengali, Kannada and Tamil, and I've seen tons of such films in these languages.But this is definitely a first in hindi film industry. I'm glad that hindi cinema has started to mature. Its been 10 or 15 years since I watched or endorsed hindi films. However if more movies like Tumbbad come out, I'll definitely start watching hindi films again.Tumbbad is a fantasy thriller with ominous overtones, and some great screenplay. This is the type of Indian film that I would recommend to my foreign friends in other countries.All those other clowns in hindi film industry who call themselves ""Bollywood"" and dish out nonsensical crap, and think they own the industry, etc, need to learn how to make a film, by watching this.",Tumbbad
180,ravik-kant,Decent Watch,5,15 October 2018,"May be I am the only one not going ga ga about this movie here. Whatever, I found it to good and that is about it.When I saw the trailer, I dont know what gave an impression of a storyline which is of large scale. I was very disappointed to see a movie of one man trying to get treasure for a ghost/vampire. Not that the plot is bad, but just that is looked way to generic for the grandness of trailer. Down few hundred meters in an old dilapidated house, a vampire named Astar stays who has gold in his trouser. Our guy in the movie, goes to his ancestral house in Tumbbad house every week to lure that vampire with food and then steal gold coins from him. At then end, when he is getting old, he trains his teenage son to do this. Sons gives him an idea to give lot of food to Astar so that they can steal the source of gold. They go with this plan, however, end up finding that there are many Astar and the food isn't enough. In this case father sacrifices to save his son. End of Movie.It is more like a story of golden goose than spiritual, world saving situation. Well shot, but go for this movie with horror genre expectations. Not much of thriller or suspense genre. Good onetime watch but I don't know if it is going to turn the whole bollywood cinema on its head.",Tumbbad
181,souradeepsengupta4,One of its kind.,9,21 October 2018,"A kind of Bollywood's answer to Hollywood's horror/fantasy genre.
Pros:- The eerie setting, the sound effects, the visual exhibition.
Cons:- The length of the story, the direction of the story. They could've done so much more with it.I think they could've had hanging by the edge of the seat at the end with a ""To be continued"", because in the coming years these types of movies will do excellent business.NOTE:- Choose a decent theatre to watch. Otherwise you may miss some dialogues like I did .:(",Tumbbad
182,parag_nandgaonkar,A movie that deserves much more at the box office,10,23 October 2018,"Disappointed to know, such a Masterpiece Movie is struggling to cross 10 Cr. at the box office, where as many of the crap movies from bollywood are entering into 100 Cr. Club easily. This shows, this industry is run only by the big names irrespective of the content what they are showing and also the mentality of Indian audience who wants to see the typical stereotype commercial entertainers and are blind followers of ones stardom.

184,devikabsree,Highly innovative horror thriller (8.5/10),8,22 September 2019,"This is a one of a kind horror thriller. It is unique in the way it treats the perspective of Gods. Though in Puranas, there are Gods like Bhairava or Goddesses like Chamundeshwari that are presented in visually scary forms, this movie creates a feeling of horror at the mere mention of a God! And yet greed makes people stay in the vicinity if this God! Many of the scenes in this movie are extremely scary and also highly original. I still remember some scenes as an image in my head. The movie takes greed, devotion, idea of God and worship to an entirely different level. This is a must watch for someone who is interested in watching a horror thriller.",Tumbbad

When you thought that all movies seem the same with little changes, this movie makes you realize that there are completely new ways still remaining in the art of movie making. Tumbaad stays true to its fantasy thriller theme and highly intriguing thoughout its runtime. Movie took multiple years to make and 6 years to just get scenes involving rain in Tumbaad. This hard work really shows and the cinematography is just amazing.This movie will one day be regarded a Masterpiece. It's a pity it didn't get a widespread release.

188,tictack,"A dark, mesmerizing fable",10,16 December 2018,"Tumbbad is nothing like any Indian movie ever made. The tale of greed told like nothing ever told before. Its creepy, dark, raw and yet so mesmerizing. The highlights of the movie are the amazing performances, breathtaking visuals without any generated imagery and masterful cinematography, on par with some of the best seen in Hollywood. The years of hard work put behind comes out together in every frame. The plot, screenplay, background score, environment creation, characters and the dialogues are all so carefully crafted and well executed. Its original to the core and does not strictly fit in any genre. when watching the movie, I could not think of an inspiration behind the story but few reviews did compare it with some of del toro's work but it does appear succinctly different. Tumbbad has taken the Indian cinema to new highs and has set its own benchmark. Indian masses are still a way adrift to appreciate something like this hence kudos to the director and the team who have put six years of hard work to make such an amazing piece of artwork which will inspire future film makers. Its modern day equivalent of Panchatantra and aesop's fables and story to be told for many years to come.",Tumbbad

190,avinash_me_28,Definitely original a masterpiece,9,12 October 2018,"TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer.
 A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.",Tumbbad

A MUST WATCH.
That being said, I have just one ""wish they did that"" for me is a major game changer. I wish Hastar was a real person rather than CGI. It would have erupted fumes of expression with crawling creeping fear, horror & madness.
Secondly up the fear expression level by say 20% for Vinayak Rao, he's facing a paranormal beast afterall.

Then saw it on AMAZON PRIME and thought will try it later and ending up forgetting about it until finally my girlfriend watched it and told me to watch it (FYI BOTH OF US ARE HORROR BUFFS) This is a must watch, absolutely a masterpiece from Sohum Shah. I have seen so many movies some of them are rated really high, but they are not able to capture the attention of the viewer. This is definitely not one of them. The movie takes the viewer on a journey and one can easily identify themselves with the lead. The way every screen is presented just puts the viewer on a rollercoaster ride.

224,saurabh-gothoskar,An original mythological thriller which could have unfolded a little faster,8,26 October 2018,"Through the 100 mins of the running time of this movie, there is not a second of relief for the viewers. The tension, which looms over the movie, stretches like a rubber band from the first scene till the end titles.The plot which revolves around three generations of a family and the demon-god Hastar is simple to understand. What really stands out is the cinematography and the characterization.
Apparently, the director took 6 years to shoot this movie since he wanted a dark rainy backdrop to the scenes and could shoot only from Jun-Aug. This is commendable in today's age when CGI provides a more practical and even logical option. However, the efforts seem to have materialized as each and every shot is stunning.
Also thanks to the astute direction, every actor plays his/her part brilliantly conveying his/her dark side through the personality and mannerisms.The movie however has its weaknesses, in the directors' indulgence in painting an immoral picture of the men of the family and the second chapter which has some flab. However, these are worth digesting for a stellar movie that gives you an experience that has no parallel in Indian cinema.",Tumbbad

236,Sumeet_Pradhan,An ambitious movie that worth a watch,6,14 October 2018,"Horror/supernatural genre in Hindi cinema is mostly full of horrible stupidity. Apart from a rare 'Raat' or '13B', the only other thing worth mentioning is the B-ness of Ramsay movies. But this year (2018), we have 3 different movies in this genre worth mentioning. I haven't yet watched Stree but have heard nice things about it. Ghoul was a bit of disappointment but still miles ahead of horrible stupidity. The third one is Tumbbad.Tumbbad is more of a parable genre (if such a genre exists) with some horror element thrown in. The story is like the ones we used to hear from our grandparents or read in Chandamama. It is about a family, their greed and their association with Hastar, a demon-god and his cursed treasure. A period story, it starts in 1918 and ends sometimes after 1947, mostly following the life of Vinayak (Sohum Shah), a son of the mentioned family.Tumbbad is an ambitious film, beautiful to watch and engaging enough that keep lingering in your mind for days. But somewhere you would also feel underwhelmed. There are few rough and unpolished edges to it and you would feel that the makers were not able to translate all their tall ambitions into the screen. The middle part of the movie can leave you slightly unsatisfied.
The first chapter is probably the best part of the movies. The eeriness, suspense and the looming uncertainty is almost perfectly done. One scene is worth mentioning here where two kids try to feed their other worldly grandmother: the camera work, the music, the acting of the kids; almost everything is in sync. Special mention for the camerawork. Most of the scenes are like a painting on the screen. If 'Ship of Theseus' reminded you of Tarkovsky's movies, the same feeling will continue here. Especially the first chapter where few scenes will remind you of 'The Mirror' and 'Andrei Rublev'.As mentioned earlier, the middle two chapters are a bit of a let-down. The script goes a little astray. How much I wished that the life of Vinayak would become a reflection of Hastar's cursed life but instead the decadence and debauchery was passed over mostly in a single song. The British officer side story was unnecessary. Instead the focus could had been more on the family. The direction and camerawork too become inconsistent. The loud devilish laugh of Vinayak when he goes back to his grandmother is overdone. The shaky camera, strange camera angles and excessive use of out-of-focus shots becomes tiresome.Luckily, the movie comes back to track in the final chapter once the character of Vinayak's son is introduced. The ending is somewhat predictable. But then the best about a story is not about the story itself but how it is told. And Tumbbad overall does a good job.",Tumbbad

238,samfox-956-519711,TUMBBAD - When greed takes over....,9,14 October 2018,"TUMBBAD
(When greed takes over.....)A movie that doesn't follow a beaten track and is a rich visual delight which transports you to a totally unexpected (yet engrossing) world is extremely rare to come by. If in recent Bollywood memory, there has been such a film, then......THIS IS IT !!The story is about a mythical narrative concerning a small village called TUMBBAD in the interiors of Konkan in Maharashtra. When humans build a temple of a greedy god who has been cursed 'never to be worshipped'......the consequences are severe.SOHUM SHAH has previously excelled in the critically acclaimed gems - Ship Of Theseus and Talvar. The soft spoken actor comes into his own in this masterful saga of deceit and greed. He grabs all the eyeballs for his impeccable portrayal of a Konkani Brahmin consumed by his insatiable (and ever increasing) hunger for gold. His facial expressions and mannerisms precisely capture the changes in his personality over a (rather) long period of 30 years. Although this offbeat role is unlikely to launch him into the 'happening league of stars', it will definitely give him the much needed visibility and well deserved acclaim.MOHAMMAD SAMAD never misses a beat as SOHUM's young son who is eager to prove himself. The boy has enough spark to excel in future roles. ANITA DATE and RONJINI CHAKRABORTY deliver convincing performances as SOHUM's wife and mistress, respectively. Movies which bank on visuals to enhance the storyline and to take it forward, obviously have to excel in the cinematography and creative designing departments. The same holds true for TUMBBAD. The perplexing yet visually exciting world created by the sets and the camera work has never been seen before (in Bollywood). The green and muddy landscape awash in the incessant rain, the dark and crumbling ruins of ancient buildings, the costumes and vehicles of pre-independence era (including a most authentic looking rickety bus) and the small details like huge locks and gates (of a bygone era) deserve the highest level of appreciation. A pre-independence set of Pune city has been tastefully recreated and the rest of the shooting has been done in natural lighting at real locations. Music by AJAY-ATUL (of Dhadak fame) and JESPER KYD (a Danish composer) is haunting and helps in keeping the viewer engaged. There dialogues attain the desired effect and are never superfluous. The script is alluring and is almost a living character of the film.Debutant directors RAHI ANIL BARVE and ADESH PRASAD do a splendid job. Together, they spin a macabre tale with a surreal mix of fact and fantasy; topped with dollops of horror. Having said this, there are no creaking doors, howling winds or any of the staple horror stuff. In fact, even the demons (when shown) are slightly underwhelming. The director duo shows that the real horror is of the unknown and the unexpected. The stunning VFX never becomes overbearing. Without being preachy, the debilitating effects of human vices are used to drive home an oft repeated moral - Greed never pays.....To feel the true essence of TUMBBAD, you can't remain on the fringes; you will have to surrender yourself totally to it. But the movie isn't without flaws. Despite being delightfully short at 104 minutes, there are portions where it drags a bit but the innovativeness and courage/clarity of vision easily outweighs the shortcomings. As the movie draws you in, the fear (faced by the protagonist) will feel eerily personal because the film cleverly mirrors the fears and faults we hide within ourselves.One can gauge the literal anonymity of this film by the fact that a majority of people don't know that it has been released and even those who do are asking - What Tumbbad? Why Tumbbad? Who Sohum?....The answers to all these questions can be best answered by watching this flick on Big Screen only! And if you don't, you might repent having missed it (in theatres)......The movie will remain with you long after you have come out of the hall and (like SOHUM who keeps returning to Tumbbad) will make your thoughts return.....return to TUMBBAD!Sameer Singh Thapa",Tumbbad

261,singhankitrajput,8.4 !! Overrated!!!,7,11 January 2019,"It's a good attempt in making a psychological thriller film in India and somehow it has suceeded. But 8.4 rating on Imdb is quite overrated. Given that this film took 5 years in the making is evident in the film as it is technically very good. The cinematography of this film is excellent. The biggest takeaway is the performances. Sohum Shah, who is both the producer and lead in this film is very believable as a greedy man Vinayak. Mohammad Samad who plays both the grand mother and Vinayak's greedy son is outstanding. The weakest point of this film is that it is slow which makes the viewer lose interest. But otherwise the audience will get fascinated by the sets and will appreciate the creativity of the makers of this film. Rahi Anil Bharwe needs to work as a director more frequently as director as he has got a lot of potential. Special mention to Aanand L Rai for producing this film.",Tumbbad

This is the movie you can say, stands at par with Hollywood and rest of the world, not movies like Bahubali n Krish.
This movies grasps you and doesn't let you go to the end.
The background score is awesome as the title track, which is currently now in my gym playlist.

But have no doubt, with this year coming to close,Tumbbad is definitely the best movie of this year. Backed by a strong script, directors did an amazing job by keeping the suspense of the movie alive for first half of movie, even once you understand some aspect of the plot it was still understood that we had more stuff to know. Cinematography was perhaps hero of this movie. While quality wise there could have been better scenes, theme and essence of the movie was brilliantly captured and displayed mostly. Shooting it in village Tumbbad and showcasing a pre independence era, they did almost everything right. The actor Sohum Shah who seems to have produced the movie as well did an immaculate job in this movie. I hope we see more of him in 2019. All in all, one to not miss.

274,nkknishant7,Never seen before in bollywood,10,11 March 2019,Bollywood has never been known for its horror stuff and neither is there much of a horror fan base per se in India. But still horror movies are made in India and almost all are like a B-grade version of a good horror movie with a lot of soft porn. But 'Tumbbad' isn't one of them and is perhaps the only bollywood movie that should be considered in horror category. This movie had my undivided attention from the get go.The opening frame itself sets the tone of the film and just never lets go and ultimately gives you an experience that will haunt you for days to come. The music is one of the best background music in Indian cinema history and blends perfectly with the tone of the film;in fact the music in part is responsible in setting that tense and haunting tone that encapsulates you for the entire run. If that doesn't make you interested in this then the story sure won't. If you love Indian cinema then please promote this feature because we need more of this.,Tumbbad

It took 6 years to complete the Project and it is definitely a Passion Project for the entire team. Reaction from Cannes screening itself tells how powerful the movie is. Bollywood doesn't have anything like this and it's trying to evolve day by day from masala movies, item number, nepotism etc with new age stars like Rajkumar Rao, Nawaz etc with excellent movies but it has long way to go or may be its the USP of Bollywood and it will maintain that decorum.Talking about Tumbbad, cinematography is excellent, CGI is also good as per the Low Budget of the movie and it has managed it exceptionally.

From the first scene to last scene movie is phenomenal in every way . background score is awesome. songs are very good. acting is also great.pacing could have been better but still it is very consistent in most parts.
coming on visual they are very good. This is the example of how well shot movie looks like. Color choices are also very inviting. VFX in some parts is very average but I do know for that the budget was the concern for it. it was not the lack of imagination.Overall it is pretty good package. MUST WATCH.

322,gourabhaldar,Excellent,9,13 May 2020,"Loved it. And it hurts to see how such a good movie like this is being so under rated, just because it don't have big names in star cast!
It is easily one of the best movies of this year and should be among the top 10 horror flicks of bollywood. If any big name actor had done it then this would have grossed 500Cr.. It's that good. it keeps u biting ur nails till the very end, yes it has gore and some of the scenes are difficult to watch and yes there are some plot holes but none of them will make this movie less intersting.
Excellent screenplay, excellent acting, excellent thriller.. Must watch if you are someone who really respects content over style.
Should be modern day horror classic with a good message in the end.. Is greed good ? what has greed done to man kind ? where will it lead us ? would we have got here without greed ?
It provokes you to think about these kinda questions even weeks after watching this flick.. Absolutely loved it.",Tumbbad

Just because the movie has elements of horror, and is rated highly, a lot of people may think that this is a really scary movie, which it is not. The film has a mythical fable as its central theme, which has been blended nicely into the pre-independent era of the first half of the 20th century. Excellent cinematography, art direction and good performances from the lead actors make this movie a treat to watch. There is also a pervasive grim environment about the film, which gives you the feeling that something bad is going to happen eventually. Overall, a refreshingly different film...a must watch..!!",Tumbbad

336,sunnydgod,Indian Masterpiece,10,4 November 2018,"""Tumbbad""When was the last time you came out out of a movie theatre and felt the urge to write something about it, to tell people how good was the FILM. I'm in the exact situation this very moment and i'll tell you why. ""Tumbbad"" is a great movie and the fact that its an horror flick makes it more exciting. The genre (horror) is untapped in bollywood and then we have something like this. Six years in making, Tumbbad is 1hr 45minutes long, a breath of fresh air, an oasis in the desert, a cinematic beauty, a visual brilliance, all crafted in one and on top of everything it has a ""STORY"". The shaky camera angels, direction looks amazing. What makes a horror movie more beautiful is the background score and jasper kyd has done tremendous job on that. The movie has already created history by being the first film to open at Venice International Film Critic's Week and has been getting rave reviews all over.Every now and then we talk about hollywood movies, to the likes of conjuring, I.T., Ring, Insidious and what not, but we miss out on our own good movies. This is one such movie which will make you feel good about bollywood. There are no jump scares, no banging doors, no cliche songs, whereas it offers less of dialogues and more of cinema. The movie has a good message too, it talks about greed and its consequences. Its very intense, dark and has zero yawning moments.Thank You",Tumbbad
337,rishiinpune,Depicting Fear,9,17 January 2019,"Spoiler alert. The Hindi movie, Tumbbad, is an engaging, offbeat, horror movie. It's a delight to see Hindi cinema evolving and experimenting with new concepts. The story of Tumbbad is about a demon, Hastar, who lives underground and carries gold coin in his loincloth. One can collect the gold coins if they can distract the demon with an offering of food. However, its easier said than done. There is a SOP for doing this, which only the protagonist of the movie, Vinayak, knows. Whatever gold Vinayak gets, he sells it to a merchant, both become partners. Despite making more money than he ever had, the merchant still has his own troubles, he needs more gold. In a depiction of greed, he follows Vinayak and without learning the SOPs he enters the den of Hastar, the gold carrying, ever hungry demon.This is where one gets to see one of the best depictions of FEAR. The fear we see in this scene is the fear of being in a life and death situation. Anyone who has been in a life and death situation knows that in such situations our Reptilian brain takes over, it's the classic choice of fight or flight. In such situations our logical thinking shuts down, we are in panic, the breathing becomes laboured, the chest focuses on pumping oxygenated blood to the muscles, pupils dilate, one may start shivering, the hand-eye coordination gets affected, its complete chaos. The merchant, portrayed by actor Deepak Damle, has just got the scene right. You can see fear personified in Deepak's acting. If you enjoy watching great content you will enjoy Tumbbad.",Tumbbad

343,mohitvdya,Original and Honest,8,21 October 2018,"Tumbbad is horror (or type mix genre) movie that breaks bollywood horror genre. It has its orginal concept story which sticks you the very end of movie. You just cannot predict the next probable happenings. I am a horror fan .. i hardly find 2-3 movies that are really good horror if i say worldwide. i 've seen every watchable horror movie you can get but hardly find any of them promising as their trailers.
Coming back to tumbbad as i said movie has promising story..a really good vfx ..something we have not seen in bollywood or you can say that the way tumbbad beautifully visualise you. when we talk about vfx there are not plenty of them to run throughout movie..actually movie has backbone itself and does not depend on vfx entirely. all the characters are played very well. locations are good and do justice to the era of story. camera work is good and got couple of punchy irregular rotation and angled shots used on very selective scenes. which adds good perspective with environment.What makes the horror movie good is how you unfold it and how you keep engaging without revealing too much frequently. Tumbbad starts with a story that leads you throughout the movie with unflodings of its own not too much complicated but still keeps knot. movie proceeds with some good cinematography with rainy backgrounds as story demands it. Some adult scenes are here but they too are important part of the story itself that you can ignore if you want to... movie has its hotspot that is the tumbbad vada which perfectly reveals its secrets as story allows it on right time. i must say prosthetics or makeup whatever it is called is really good and you just cant say a joker type of gore entity like every bollywood movie we have seen. if you are still confused whether to watch or not ..give it a try ..it is a unique horror (or whatever you call it) which also has a message.
Summing up in short ...for regular masala watchers give it a trial on ur 60%
for horror lovers...go blindly or if you are sceptical give 85%.",Tumbbad

352,thegamingarcher,Quickly became one of my favorite movies,9,22 December 2020,"I think the crux of what makes this one so good is the way it handles the mythology. It adds not only a layer of the unknown, but simultaneously becames a foundation for a familiar theme: greed. It has its traditional moments of horror, full of shocking gore, but it also works as a thriller since it is very character-driven. The result is an experience immersive enough to leave you breathless by the end. It lures the audience gradually with a perverse desire to see the characters give in to their greed, since this sheds more light on the mysteries of the realm of gods. During these moments of revelation are outstanding plot twists that actually feel very natural and are seamlessly integrated into the plot. There are no moments where the movie tries to turn the tables on the audience and make them feel stupid for not understanding previous scenes. These moments work instead as character development and world building, only that it feels like a twist because of the danger that comes with this knowledge. It really is amazing how they were able to provide what feels like a plot suited for an epic, in a tight hour and forty five minutes. What a fulfilling production. This is an experience I'll remember for a long time.",Tumbbad

Not often do we come across Indian movies that show courage to skip the cheap thrills and focus on the real horrors. Not often do we come across movies that just want to tell a story. Not often do we across movies like Tumbbad.Having missed it at the theatres, I happened to watch this on a streaming service. It is a story of how greed can overpower goodness and innocence, and spread the poison across generations. From a mother eking out a living as a mistress in the feudalistic era, to a son in the pre-independence colonial era etching a portrait of greed with his life, and finally ending with a corrupted grandson in the post-independence era who loses his innocence to his father and his virginity to his fathers' mistress, the frames capture the rot artistically. Towards the end of the movie, you're left wondering what purpose did Hastars' punishment serve if the humanity never learned the moral of the story? Many of the reviewers have mentioned in their reviews that the story is set over 30 years, give or take. In that case, they didn't focus on the grandmothers' story of how she came to be the way she is.Brilliantly shot, wonderful story-telling, slow churn of greed and horror in a perfect blend of the real and unreal worlds, this is movie worth every penny.PS: Had a disappointing experience recommending this to colleagues, who reportedly found it unappealing.

The film kicks off with a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Incessant rain becomes the wrath of gods, and you can't really tell what's more grey, the characters or the locales. The film is set during the latter part of the British Raj and the period setting adds an air of authenticity to the story. Vinayak Rao, a young Maharashtrian Brahmin boy, loses his innocence when he faces adversity and tragedy. He's introduced to the legend of Hastar, a mythical creature born out of a goddess, but one who's selfish urge for gold and food got the better of him. But Hastar's treasure full of gold medallions is buried somewhere underneath the estate of the local zamindar in Tumbbad. Vinayak's mother is the caretaker for the zamindar's wretched wife, referred to as Dadi (grandmom), who is also believed to be cursed by Hastar. Her appearance is so vile that you'll feel Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is beautiful.
All the charecter played by actor are really good.their performance are outstanding in this movie .In perfect sync are the film's technical departments.cinematography captures the wide landscapes of Tumbbad to great effect. soundtrack also adds to the proverbial terror in debut director Rahi Anil Barve's movie.
Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and Eraserhead (1977). This one is genuinely scary.",Tumbbad
377,muditsinghnp,I can't belive this!,10,19 February 2021,"First of all if you're reading this congrats! you are a true movie lover.
This movie surpasses even big budget hollywood horror stories!
The film is dark and involves supernatural themes, yet is so believable and grounded. I can't believe this was made on a budget of Rs. 5 Cr.
The VFX for it's budget is nothing but mindblowing, just imagine what they could have done with even a Rs. 50 Cr. budget, despite this the soundtrack doesn't suffer from budget issues one bit, it is unique, catchy and does what it had to do. Props to Ajay&Atul for that.If you're reading this this film is a must watch but it is not an average family horror flick, it also explores the lust side of humans so maybe not watch with your parents. It is rated A",Tumbbad

One of the best Indian films I have seen in quite a while. Though it does have a very limited amount of gore, it is very different from the usual horror format in that rather than an external monster or ghost, it focuses on the greed and darkness inside each of us. Sohum Shah is simply brilliant! He's exceedingly handsome and yet you end up disliking him and rooting for him at the same time. The atmosphere, the visuals, the dialogue, the story, everything is engrossing and transports you to a different era. Truly a masterpiece!",Tumbbad

But some directors in India have raised the level of Indian movies and Anil Rahi Barve takes it a step higher. I watched it on Amazon prime and will recommend this to anyone who can watch a bit of horror.The storyline is superb, with a constant melancholic tone, the performances top notch and the production values and special effects extremely effective. Underlying the movie is the theme of greed, which shows up time and again, whether is is between great grandmother and great grandson, father and son or husband and mistress. Movie loses bit of pace towards the end, but the climax covers the momentary weakness.
Kudos to the director, because he waited almost 10 years to make this movie.",Tumbbad

This movie will get your attention from very opening shot and keep your eye still on screen until the end credit roll up. Each frame of the movie speaks despite having limited dialogues. Cinematography by Pankaj Kumar is just brilliant and mesmerizing his confidence of using Shadows and wide angle shots is fabulous. Production design here is something that will draw you in the film, the cities, doors, locks and the womb of the goddess developed shows the hard work by the team. Background score by Jesper Kyd is very powerful and will remain with you even after leaving the theatre , his knowledge of instruments and use of choir is amazing. Acting by Sohum Shah is fantastic his dialogue delivery and expressions are very organic. Mohammad Samad is excellent. All the actors are tremendous. Writers had done a terrific job and their portrayal of all characters are just bounded by one thing i.e. greed and lust. Both Directors of the film are genius.

I happy that now bollywood also has a movie like this. This a original movie & other directors should learn something from it, rather than making rubbish in the name of horror. I'm a big fan of maxican director Guillermo del Toro who directed movie like Pen's Labyrinth, which is totally original and let me tell this movie is exactly of same kind, like dark fantasy with a good message. If I would have been in the film selection committee of India for Oscar entry, I would given approval to this one. A true film lover can't effort to miss a movie like this. Sadly the theatre was 70% empty, because mostly indian watch bollywood- Khan's based mindless action movies.",Tumbbad

But most of them direct movies with songs and dance make actual movie lovers want to puke.
This is a movie that will linger on our minds for years to come. I would rate this movie among the best of Oscar winning movies like Titanic, Braveheart, Passion of The Christ, etc.

This movie is a step ahead for bollywood from the typical horror movies. The movie, being low budget gives you so much to awe upon! Direction is beautiful, locations are beautiful, set designing is beautiful, production is great like the doors and locks and lamps to every object used is beautiful, writers have done a appreciable job. Mythology being a part of horror films is rare or rather negligible. But here mythology is well attached to the message it imparts. Being low budget, none of the scenes look fake or childish like we saw in Robot 2.0 and Thugs of hindostan. Every frame is real and lively.

The best part being that not a single shot or scene of the movie seems to be extra or unnecessarily added.
It's a different movie and probably that's what is the best thing about it.

It's one of those movies that lingers in your head days after you have watched it. And, that's the hallmark of a truly good movie.Lastly, if you love horror and you haven't seen this one wherever you are in the world, you are missing out on something.(This is my first review on IMDB :-))",Tumbbad

468,rahulsherkhan,One of the Finest gems of Indian Cinema,10,21 December 2019,This movie had what lacks in current Bollywood Cinema i.e. content. Nicely written and executed. I wonder why was this not India's official entry to Oscars.,Tumbbad
469,abhinitaakumar,Beautiful.,10,4 November 2018,"A horror film with substance. The acting was on point, the story was great, the cinematography was beautiful.

I would have given it a 10 just for the visuals. A lot can be learned in Bollywood on how to make a movie from this one. Each and every shot is a masterpiece. The sets plain amazing. Keeping CGI only when needed was an amazing thing to do. Unlike 'the nun', this one has original desi atmospheric horror.

Its a rare gem in fantasy and horror pseudo-genre, making its mark without indulging in jump-scares, cheap amplification of sound (read noise), or expensive special affects.Tumbbad is deeply rooted in unique take on Indian myth as background, which only enhances its beauty through period setting. The ambience it sets from the opening shot persists the captivating tone for entire length of the movie. While there is certainly a moral value to be driven, its not something that Tumbbad gets preachy about.Watch this flick for intelligent take on film making in the crowd of nonsense that gets thrown at masses.",Tumbbad

They didn't spend 100 cr to make cars fly? Why would we even watch it right?This movie is a favor to those who seek for some good content in Indian cinema. Salman bhai fans should stay away. It would wake a logic inside you and that's bad for him.It's sad that this movie didn't run well. But I wish the makers make such movies.

515,Ritam_Podder,Unique and Wonderful,9,10 May 2020,"From the go, it quickly becomes apparent that Tumbbad is on course to serve as a parable for the corrupting nature of greed. Narration tells us, as we sweep over the bleak, rain-sodden countryside of Tumbadd in the far reaches of western India, the legend of Hastar, a God undone by his own his avarice.Rahi Anil Barve and co-director Adesh Prasad have crafted a film with the ambitions of an epic. Spanning thirty odd years we follow Vinayak (Sohum Shah), the son of a wealthy lord cast off to live with his mother and brother in abject poverty.Housed with them is their grandmother, a cursed witch, who holds the secret to a hidden treasure that promises eternal wealth. The idea seduces the young Vinayak and fifteen years after the death of his younger brother forced him and his mother to leave Tumbbad, he returns home and uncovers it.As the film progresses and Vinayak, now married, accumulates his wealth, we learn that the source of the gold coins he sells for currency are pilfered from a replenishing purse strapped to Hastar, the fallen God, who lives buried beneath the mansion of his long deceased father.Tumbbad throws to Guillermo del Toro's brand of film-making, launching into the world of magical realism. And, the directing duo make a fair go of it. Whilst the film lacks the same level of imaginative energy and visual fluency, Barve and Prasad manage to satisfyingly marry together the worlds of the real and the unreal.The second act hangs a little fat, with a subplot involving Vinayak's business partner bringing little to the overall narrative. There is a half-hearted attempt at grounding the film within a historical context with brief references to India's colonial status. These seem to want to offer up answers as to the origins of Vinayak's greed, and suggest, fleetingly, that perhaps it stem from the 200 years India was plundered under British colonial rule.Although the morality of the film is telegraphed and with the introduction of Vinayak's son, who too is trained to steal the gold coins, the climax a foregone conclusion, Tumbbad holds its own. It may not leave much of a lasting impression, but it is sure to charm regular cinema-goers and genre fans alike.",Tumbbad

The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema..",Tumbbad

568,sudiptasarkar-88065,Suspense thriller with a cape of horror,8,22 April 2020,"Tumbbad is a rare Indian cinematic beauty that a hardcore thriller fan always craves for and never gets tired of. This movie keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout its runtime.A series of fictitious mythological events occuring to a family in a place known as tumbbad from the year 1920 to 1947 over their three generations. This film is revolving around a story about a goddess creating the whole universe and providing it food and wealth while her firstborn son Hastar takes the money but could not take food and got cursed.The actors executed their job to the perfection. The acting and the story of the plot were cemented together with well created background musics that makes you keep biting your nail. The CGI is also good,but keeping the story, acting, cinematography in mind the CGI could have been better. But this is not a deal breaker at all.The direction and the cinematography is also well planned. The composition of the frame is classic that always draws our eyes to the subjects. Throughout the film the colour pellet was maintained at a great level and it was eye pleasing. The locations of this film are also amazing that makes you feel to be there at least once in your lifetime.The production design and the costume of the characters are such that it does the justice to the looks of the characters and the time period or the generation they are dealing with.The movie hooks you to the screen from the very beginning,providing answers to all the questions that sprung up in your head,as it moves calmly,letting you enjoy the overall mystic flavour of its premise.Overall this is a very different kind of movie other than the stereotypical Hindi Movies, which will definitely thrill you with its interesting mythological thrilling story masked in a horror presentation. Everyone should give it a try at least once. This kind of cinema should be appreciated by all.",Tumbbad

From the opening scenes till the end it delivers. My only complains is that It's not a great horror film. I mean you get some really good scenes but otherwise it's faint.

Don't understand why it's being described as a horror genre movie. It's an unusual story for Bollywood; for South Indian audience especially Tamil/ Malayalam audiences who are quite used to watching variety of genres in their respective languages, Tumbbad in no way would be a surprising story or screenplay.

Trust me, I love watching horror films and I have watched a lot of them specially the ones recommended by good critics but none of them gave me chills like this one. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.Hollywood should learn from the filmmakers of Tumbbad and I know that they will learn but bollywood won't because they are busy with their south remakes and latke-jhatke.Take my word, this film will be considered as a cinematic landmark after 20 years because it gave birth to a new genre i.e. Greed.We Indians love to appreciate good cinema but don't go to theatres to spend our money on movies like Tumbbad. Instead we spend our money on senseless melodramatic idiotic movies starring talentless star kids. If we won't show our support to such great works then no one will dare to take such big leaps in cinema.",Tumbbad

610,darkcarlito,Visually good...but story is simplistic and doesn't engage,3,26 October 2021,"There are too many reviews here overrating this move. Now, don't get me wrong, the production of this film is very good and the cinematography is really well done for a budget of this calibre...or even if it had cost more. Also I must say that the narrative of the first half of the film choosing when to reveal info to you, is enjoyable. However that's as far as the praise goes with me. Watching the protagonist and the characters around him from the very beginning just leaves you with such distaste. You end up totally disengaging yourself from these characters of the story due to their choices and behaviour. Of course they are meant to be like this, however there is no real contrast to this so that the viewer can find themselves drawn to another character. The characters themselves are very selfish and simplistic, that don't evolve over the script and and just leave you empty. This is the same for the story itself, where it comes across like a children's tale that is filled with adult like horror visuals. This is a shame as the premise behind the story feels like an original story, but it lets you down in what it chooses to do with this film.",Tumbbad

It nevers leaves that dreaded and thrilling feeling through out the run of this entire film. 
What an amazing cinematography, I would say. Even hollywood can take inspiration out of this which is making all the same type of horror movies these days with cheap thrills and jumpy scenes with out of the loud soundtrack to scare. 
The story is spellbounding and most importantly fresh. It's one of the most important fact of the movie which makes it all the more watchable and intriguing.
Thumbs up to the director, actor and the cinematographer. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece of Indian cinema.",Tumbbad

628,sakshi_rn,A change we needed,9,12 November 2018,"I don't write alot of reviews. But I think tumbbad deserves a review. It's not your average bollywood movie. You may not like it but you won't forget it because it leaves an impact on you. The story is so unique it makes you think and its like a breath of fresh air for bollywood.
I urge people to watch it and give it a chance. The actors are superb, the way the use props, lights and weather it fits perfectly. There are scenes where people will say they feel uncomfortable. But it's time for us to stop feeling awkward with such scenes and treat it as an art and see how it fits the story.
Please keep an open mind and watch the movie",Tumbbad

631,amitabhdas29,Judging Bollywood's current standard such a movie might never come again,10,12 December 2018,"This is not a movie, this is an experience. I dont remember a bollywood movie that is so gripping, well portrayed and shot like a piece of art.
This movie proves that to be good the very first and most important thing you need is a good plot and then comes the direction,the performances and the cinematography. This movie excels in all the above fields.
All the characters have a very strong character curve which portrays that a lot of genuine thought was put into the script.
All characters deliver stellar performances speacially the lead Sohum Shan. This is yet another example to stress on Sohum's ""greed"" for content.
In an industry that has been solely relying on the ""so bored that will watch anything"" public to just manufacture meaningless star studded garbage, Tumbaad is the blue lotus in the dirt.

No Khans, No Kapoors, No funny ( supposed to be scary ) sound effects with shadows swinging behind. Just a masterpiece by the duo - Rahi Anil Barve, Anand Gandhi.
Very creative movie, with no commercial aspects, and redefining the genre 'Horror' in Indian cinemas which can easily place its self high when compared to 'not-scary-actually-funny' Hollywood flicks. Yes, you got it right.
Cinematography is a delight to eyes, and makes you happy looking at Indian cinemas getting revived and evolving. The cast could've been better, and the only thing I could point out against the movie.
Watch this movie legally, or else 'Hastar' will come.

Mythology being a part of horror films is rare or rather negligible. But here mythology is well attached to the message it imparts. Being low budget, none of the scenes look fake or childish like we saw in Robot 2.0 and Thugs of hindostan. Every frame is real and lively.

Greed is like air which we breathe one can breathe what his lungs can hold and not more than that. According to Bhagavad Gita ""Hell has three gates lust, anger, and Greed"". The movie is centered only on a single character called Vinayak Rao who from childhood wants to get the treasure which is hidden in the place called Tumbbad. The start of the story is with a legend which describes how it all started that a Devi who is the mother of all enormous Gold and Grain, once gave birth to a demonic child called Hastar who took all the gold from her mother then wanted to gulp the grain, the Gods kept quiet till then when Hastar was trying to get hold of the grain they stopped him then Devi took Hastar again into her Womb. The film starts with a wild start where the mother of small Vinayak physically satisfies Sarkar, the owner of Wada where the treasure is hidden. Her only intention was to get her hands on the treasure. After few days Sarkar dies, he promised Vinayak's mother that he would give the treasure if she serves him well. There lived an ugly old granny at Vinayak's place, she was tied in cuffs to say more precise. Vinayak's mother had a duty of feeding her and taking care of her time to time or else she would get angry. Only Vinayak's mother had seen her and none of them not Vinayak or his brother. They feared to go in there and dare to see her. While talking about the treasure Vinayak's brother dies in a suspicious manner. Then Vinayak's mother decides to leave Tumbbad and go to Pune. She orders Vinayak never ever come to Tumbbad again thereafter. Years passes by Vinayak visit Tumbbad again in search of treasure.

704,sameek-84414,Most Overrated movie since Baahubali,1,28 October 2018,"This is the most Overrated movie I have ever seen after Baahubali. After watching two great Hindi movies this year, Stree and Andhadhun, both of which kept true to their respective genre throughout, I again trusted the user reviews on Tumbbad and was happy to believe that great movies are indeed being made in India which is taking the bollywood film industry to next level. But unfortunately, this time I was so wrong.Tumbbad is classified as mythological fantasy horror film, however it is a spat on all three genres. This movie, first of all, is not a horror movie. There are no moments which are scary, but the director did his best to create tensions in moments which could have been turned into scary moments but no, he didn't do that, the only thing he managed to do is to make us laugh about the ridiculous combination of bad vfx and prosthetics that just look ugly, not scary.The story itself is pretty funny, uninteresting and doesn't make any sense. Haster, a greedy child of the goddess of prosperity, was forbidden from being worshipped, yet the humans built his temple in Tumbbad to receive access to unlimited gold coins, which are carried by the demonic being, in his belt. The story talks about the greed that led a person to his doom.The dialogues and the acting both look pretty flat and lack of creative effort is clearly visible here. It is said that Sohum Shah, the actor and the producer, spent 6 years for the execution of his vision. It feels like the only part where he put his effort in was how to raise hype and cheap publicity for a film to make it a successful one, without actually putting an effort in good script and storyline.I feel bad for the people who praised this movie and felt like only fans of the likes of films like Happy New year will hate this movie, well let me tell them that those films, even though are bad, have at least some good acting to watch. This movie got nothing.Being someone who couldn't stand 15 minutes of Padmaavat because of its unrealistic moments, slow and uninteresting dialogues and cheap and ridiculous Vfx, I feel like Indian directors and producers are far better off creating stories out of normal lifestyles, like Stree, Andhadhun, Secret Superstar and Padman, instead of attempting to create epic or mythological plots which require pure experience and creative ingenuity",Tumbbad
705,monty-46322,One of its kind,10,29 March 2020,"This movie is based on mythology where a goddess created a universe. Bringing mythology/horror demon where demon is located with gold and deprived of food. And moral & attraction is subject of human greed. I am referring this movie to you all as a classical masterpiece in bollywood. After watching this i would say Indian cinema has gained a level of hollywood; hollywood should learn from this. Cinematography, brilliant direction, story telling, acting, script, VFX (better than Sahoo), etc everything is next level wow. Many of you don't even know the name of this movie ""tumbbad"" because there is no khans, no big stars, no item songs. I am sure that if this movie had been encouraged by our Indian media and cinema influencers the movie would have reached the Oscars. If we start to encourage such cinema, then the corrupt award show of India (poor indian cinema) will understand its status. Btw this movie took 6 years in shooting and making. I have more to say about this movie.One of its kind.#tumbbad

Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today's bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it's dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work.

754,jaitleycelina,Tumbbad is an experience,10,13 October 2018,"Finally its here!!! An Indian horror movie with an Indian story and an Indian soul. It has the smell of wet soil..it has the dampness of old house covered with moulds. There are no castles and occulists performing exorcism on white eyed monstrous girl.
Instead there is a corrupt feudal lord who exploits a widow, bribing her with gold coins. But when its time to reward her, all he says is""swarn mudra kamaani padti hai."" You realise the truth of this statement later in the movie.
Instead of righteous protagonist, we have Vinayak who is greedy for wealth which he feels belongs to him. But then he is told, ""Virasat mein mili har cheez par dawa nahi karte."" He craves for the treasure and fights his fears and finally reaches to it. And boy!!! Once you see how he earns it..you will feel he definitely deserves it. 
Now for the acting part...Sohum Shah absolutely nailed the role of Vinayak. He has very few dialogues but his eyes do the talking. From lecherous to vengeful in a flash.
And now coming to the main hero of the movie...the sets!!! It was hypnotic and beyond words!! The pre independence era has been captured beautifully and to the tee. The walls..the grey canvas...and my favorite part..the locks!! Oh..they just take you back in time.
Finally..in one line...Go and watch this movie.It is an experience you will take back home with you. A story that will stay will you to tease you and taunt you.",Tumbbad

761,gautam-99166,"When regionalized, horror is amplified a thousand times",9,15 October 2018,"All the Hollywood horror movies (horror, zombie, etc) always give you the feel that this is what will never happen to you and the effects become equivalent to watching a fantasy like the Avengers. Just turning the same integrity of story-telling and high production values into a very earthy indian landscape and the horror gets you goosebumps even after the movie. That is what Tumbbad is about!
Extremely grey , its entire cinematography takes on a challenge that no bollywood movie dares to - shooting every major sequence in low or no light. I am from the city that the protagonist makes his home and its potrayal is downright authentic. Not to mention the landscape around Pune which is astoundingly captured for the effect of being in the rain (and uncomfortably wet) all the time. 
The finesse and the vision of Tumbbad- the movie, makes SRK , Sallu and KJo movie houses look like a bunch of jokers who seem to have taken for granted that there no such thing as an intelligent audience in India.",Tumbbad

Every scene is well thought out and directed. The efforts and passion of the film makers pays off. Hats off to Rahi Barve and Sohum Shah and the entire team. Skip indian film masala. Instead watch this one, twice if you feel like. The film keeps hanging in your head for days. One of the best horror-thrillers I've seen till now.
Some people complained it shows marathi brahmins in a bad light but I differ. The story is weaved about a mystery in a typical marathi 'Waada' (mansion) and waadas of that time were owned but a lot of brahmin families. Also an old waada feels spooky if its uninhabited. I've spent my childhood in a waada myself (actually next to the purandare waada where the film was shot in Saswad). The lead characters just happen to be from a brahmin family and thats it.
Scenes are surreal but realistic with beautiful textures. Production design has been done with a lot of effort which is visible. Actors did an amazing job! I'm going to watch it again, anybody wants to join in? ;)",Tumbbad

792,bheshajsonwani,"a movie, indian cinema does not deserve.",10,13 December 2018,"Actually i dont have enough words to describe this movie. Story-telling at its best, top-notch cinematography, memorable performances, atmospheric with one of the best background score done by one and only jesper kyd (if you're familiar with hitman & assasin creed games). With such a small budget tumbbad team has created some magic on the screen...after watching the film you're soul would be locked inside the place tummbad for days not just me many has experienced the same thing. It's really dissappointing, that our country people are fighting over bollywood vs south cinema, in the midst of this non-sense, tumbbad has been overshadowed and this make me angry. Neither it got people attention nor big screens. But, just by word of mouth it has already completed 50 days in theatres, thats something commendable because when i watched it in theatres, there were only 14-20 people, i thought it wont survive.
For the love of movie making art, please its a request, watch and experience the world of tumbbad.
Movie is now streaming on Amazon Prime.
Thankyou.",Tumbbad

795,cmaorbit,Fake Hype Fake Rating,1,13 February 2019,"If you are a connoisseur of horror movies then this movie comes across as a bad grape. There is no horror, no gripping script, only tense moments you feel are when after few minutes into movie you realize you wasted your money.",Tumbbad
796,bhattrahul,Simply the best horror flick bollywood can offer,10,2 December 2018,"When was the last time you saw a horror movie and got disappointed. Leave bollywood, even the recent Hollywood movies lacked a proper plot. Something or the other was haunted and people near by the haunted thing/person were on the receiving end of the terror.
Tumbbad is different. The storyline, cinematography, the demon, everything is new.
The movie is refreshing. No stupid angles, no hide and seek, no deviating character. Each character justifies their role well.
It is a must watch for horror genre lovers.",Tumbbad
797,chopadepratik,One of the best and different horror storyline and unexpected but awesome work by marathi star cast,10,2 December 2018,All 10 stars deserves to this movie. Unexpectedly we underestimate the work of marathi star cast or their productions. But proud of you guys. You come up with complete different story line which was horror thriller and amazing. There is no single minute where you distracts from movie. The vfx and horrorness is at next level which we usually don't see in Bollywood movies atleast till now. We expect such a different stories other than typical horror plots. And this movie completes this expectations. Big thumps up to the movie. If you ever watched any horror movie. This will be much different than other. Due to the promotion we missed such movie in theater. Production should work on this where here they failed to promote. Though a good movie to watch. Highly recommended....!,Tumbbad

800,prashantjpatil,A Life time experience - Tumbbad,10,6 December 2018,"One of the best movies I have watched in my life. I have never reviewed any movie on IMDb but this one is special and well deserved. Visuals are stunning, equally supported by brilliant acting and story. Excellent cinematography, direction and execution. Take a bow Soham Shah and team. This kind of movies should be promoted well so that people can also know even in India world class movies are made. This will definitely remain my favorite till a long time. I also feel we should have watched this movie in theaters to encourage this kind of movie making. All the bollywood biggies should learn something from this movie. A masterpiece to remember.",Tumbbad

812,asstyles,One of the original best since long,9,30 June 2020,"TUMBAAD is a highly engrossing movie and a Visual treat.Original Story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes Tumbbad a delight. Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I'll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot.It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it "" as an art film"" not for everybody and some even mentioning "" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it "" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it.",Tumbbad
813,nppsan,Should go for Oscar awards this year.,10,4 February 2019,"The Tumbbad had to be the best, and it is. Because as it is written in ending titles ""INSPIRED BY THE WORKS OF NARAYAN DHARAP"". DHARAP is very famous and visionary writer in genres such as horror, thriller, science fiction. All of his books got a special touch of his genius. All of them went beyond imagination. I got collection of every book. Thanks again to him for becoming the inspiration of Tumbbad movie too. Unfortunately DHARAP died in 2008. RIP. Tumbbad should go for an Oscar.",Tumbbad
