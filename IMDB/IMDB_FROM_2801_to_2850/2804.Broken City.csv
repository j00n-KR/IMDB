0,bkoganbing,An Admirer,6,20 January 2013,"Ex-Detective Mark Wahlberg has an admirer, someone no less than the Mayor of New York Russell Crowe. Wahlberg was indicted and the charges dismissed for lack of evidence that he killed Luis Tolentino, a rapist who skipped on a technicality. It may have been justice, but it was hardly legal and it cost Wahlberg his badge.Seven years later Wahlberg is now scratching out a living as a private detective doing the kind of work that Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe did in between the novels that Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler wrote about them. Wahlberg even has an Effie like secretary in Alona Tal. Who should call but the mayor himself who wants him for a disagreeable job. He suspects his wife of infidelity and it's now election time and he has a tough race against Councilman Barry Pepper. Crowe wants to know exactly the who and where and when of his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones's rendezvous. This apparently is what Wahlberg is specializing in now.He finds whom she's meeting with and its Kyle Chandler the campaign manager for Pepper. But believe me it's not all that it seems and soon there's murder and municipal corruption involved. And Wahlberg's own past comes back to haunt him.Although this is a Wahlberg produced film as well, Crowe really dominates this film as one evil man who is running the Big Apple. He's the one you're thinking about throughout the film. He's your typical free enterprise capitalist who has no shame at all in ripping off the city and pocketing whatever he can. His campaign revolves around the fact that he's reduced the city deficit and turned it into a surplus. It's how he's done it that will revolt you if you have decent instincts. In fact it's revolted his wife which is why Zeta-Jones is behaving as she does.I would also like to single out Alona Tal who must have watched The Maltese Falcon and took her cues from what Lee Patrick did as Humphrey Bogart's secretary. Both those women liked their bosses and you hope the two would realize that.Broken City is a good action story and Wahlberg producer gave Wahlberg actor a great vehicle. I think Mark's fans will enjoy this and others will as well.",Broken City
1,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly mature and compelling thriller,7,10 February 2015,"I'm not sure why this was a bomb at the box office, because I thought it was pretty decent. It's a New York-set conspiracy thriller starring the underrated Mark Wahlberg as a private detective who soon becomes embroiled in a new case involving the city's Mayor (played with sleazy relish by Russell Crowe) and his cheating wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones.BROKEN CITY avoids the usual clichés of the genre for the most part, and it's almost entirely action-free; there are no fight scenes here and only a couple of shots are fired throughout. It's far from boring, though; the political shenanigans are completely engaging, and the scriptwriter does a fine job of showing how events from the past can come back to haunt us.I've really been enjoying Wahlberg's performances as of late (after this and CONTRABAND) and he does another good job here of playing a rather unpredictable and unlikeable character. Crowe is excellent, cast against type, and the underrated Jeffrey Wright bags a strong supporting role. BROKEN CITY is a story-focused thriller that remains tight and compelling throughout, which is why I give it a thumbs-up.",Broken City
2,SnoopyStyle,There's nothing new under the sun,7,24 August 2013,"In New York City, police detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of suspected rapist Mikey Tavarez. He is cleared but is rejected by the force. Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) had hidden evidence about the case. Seven years later, Billy is struggling as a private investigator. The mayor hires him to investigate his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Corruption in the big city. This theme is nothing new. It's been done before and done better. The story is a little weak especially the ultimate corruption. If they were going for noir, they really needed a sad ending instead of a sappy ending. The ending is too weak. I like Russell Crowe and Mark Wahlberg playing corrupt characters. In general, I like the tone. I wish they do more of a re-write and embrace the corruption/noir even more.",Broken City
3,claudio_carvalho,Unfortunately only in Fiction Mayors Are Investigated and Arrested,7,2 June 2013,"In New York City, detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) goes to court for the murder of the rapist Mikey Tavarez (Luis Tolentino), but the Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) and the Chief of Police Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) vanish with an important evidence and Billy is declared non-guilty by the judge but he leaves the police department. Seven years later, Billy is a private detective that lives his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez), who is an aspirant actress and the sister of Mikey's victim. His secretary Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal) is trying to collect part of the debts to save their business. In the week of the elections, Hostetler summons Billy and offers US$ 50,000 to investigate his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that he believes is having a love affair. Billy discovers that Cathleen is meeting Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), who is the coordinator of the campaign of Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), the opponent of Hostetler and favorite in the election. When Paul is found dead on the street, Billy finds that he had been double-crossed by Hostetler and he decides to investigate the truth behind Paul's murder. ""Broken City"" is a great political thriller about a situation that certainly happens in big cities. Mayor Hostetler is evicting people from a residence building and selling the real estate for an underrated value. In Rio, there are mysterious interests from the Powers That Be that change the construction code allowing tall buildings at the seaside streets; or destroy a velodrome and a car racing track in a valuable real estate and intending to construct another in a mined area that belongs to the Brazilian army; or valorize the harbor area with questionable constructions. Unfortunately only in fiction majors are investigated and arrested. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Linha de Ação"" (""Action Line"")",Broken City
4,nogodnomasters,I'M JUST THE HAND CUFFS GUY,6,16 April 2019,"Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a policeman who murders a killer/rapist who has escaped the criminal justice system. He gets off using a self defense plea, however the mayor (Russell Crowe) has evidence to the contrary.We jump to seven years later. Billy, now a private detective, is living with the sister (Natalie Martinez as Natalie) of the victim of the man he killed. Natalie is an actress who is excited about her up and coming indie movie debut. Note to self: If you get naked in a film and make love to a man, tell your boyfriend before he sees it.Meanwhile Billy is asked by the crooked mayor to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who he believes is having an affair. It is an election year and he is running against young Connecticut carpetbagger Jack Valiant (Barry Pepper). Billy takes photos of the mayor's wife and Jack's campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) together. BTW the police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) doesn't like the mayor either.This early twist sets things up for later twists as Billy finds himself in over his head with feuding factions while trying to cope with his newly broken relationship.This film left me unfulfilled. Russell Crowe didn't sing, which is a plus. The characters were stiff and the dialogue stale. This is just another ""me too"" crime drama. Wait for the rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Quick on screen sex scene, which may of had some even quicker nudity.",Broken City
5,kosmasp,Broken Pieces,7,16 September 2013,"Is it the city that is broken or is it the people that live in it? Is that even a difference? But the characters do have issues. Though some are only a minor plot detail and are not further explained, there is a reason for the things that do pop up in the movie. Could they have been connected in a better way? Surely they could, but even so, all does make sense in the end.Mark Wahlberg and the relationship he has with other characters in the movie is a complicated one. There are deleted scenes which do put some other light to one of those relationships, though I do like how it plays out in the shorter version in the movie. There is an alternate ending though, that would've made sense in the movie. Actually it's an extended ending to the one we get. And while it doesn't really involve our ""hero"" it would've proved a point.Are there clichés and is it predictable though? Yes that is definitely one of the things you can say about the movie. It's still worthwhile (for the performances alone) though",Broken City
6,classicsoncall,"""There are some wars you fight and some wars you walk away from.""",6,5 March 2019,"Here you've got a fairly standard by the numbers story of crime and corruption in the big city, with Marl Wahlberg doing his bit after learning he's been double crossed by the mayor who helped get him off a murder charge some seven years earlier. The secret evidence that never got a chance to be introduced by the prosecution suddenly rears it's head, with Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) holding a huge hammer against Billy Taggart (Wahlberg), forced to resign his job as a detective lest the cover up ever be blown. As the villain of the piece, Crowe affects a strict law and order stance in public, but on the side he's got this four billion dollar deal going to eliminate a housing project and make way for a pricey business development. What's cool about Crowe's portrayal is that he speaks in a really low key tone of voice most of the time, almost at a whisper so you have to strain to hear him. It's a different kind of role for him.As a private detective, Billy has an unusual skill and when I saw it, the story kind of went off the rails a bit for me in terms of credibility. In accepting the Mayor's private offer to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Taggart observes her on a busy city sidewalk and manages to pick her pocket to get her cell phone! It was a way to learn who she'd been calling to set up meetings, suggestive of an affair. I'd never encountered that as part of the skill set for a private detective and had to wonder how Taggart might have acquired the ability to do it so effectively.The frustrating part of the movie is all the loose ends it leaves regarding characters and situations. There's Billy's suddenly broken relationship with aspiring actress Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez) and nothing heard from her again once the split occurs, the mysterious consequence of Hostetler campaign manager Paul Andrews' (Kyle Chandler) murder, and the often teased romantic connection between Billy's office assistant (Alona Tal) and himself, more so from her end than his, but still. And if one is following the story with any sort of attention, the arrest of the mayor for his complicity in the murder of Andrews doesn't negate the fact that he's got the seven year old tape of Billy murdering a guy in cold blood. Seems to me they'd both be spending time in one of the city's finer houses of detention as cellmates if you carry things out to their logical conclusion.",Broken City
7,blanche-2,derivative script,6,27 August 2014,"""Broken City"" from 2013 has some big names: Russell Crowe, Mark Wahlberg, and Catherine Zeta-Jones doing a predictable script that is beneath them.The story concerns an on-the-wagon alcoholic ex-cop, Billy Taggert. Up on charges for a nighttime shooting, the Mayor (Russell Crowe) is aware of new evidence and has him fired. Seven years later, Taggert is working as a detective, getting evidence for divorce cases when the Mayor summons him. He wants Taggert to find out who is sleeping with his wife (Jones) and bring him photos. He tells Taggert that he's afraid his opponent in the upcoming mayoral election, Jack Valiant (Barry Pepper) would use this against him if it's found out. With a lot of clients owing him money, Taggert accepts a $25,000 down payment from him.He tails the Mayor's wife and discovers that she's seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler) the opponent's campaign manager. After reporting this to the Mayor, Andrews winds up dead.First of all, you know who the murder victim is immediately because of the casting (I think). And a good part of the plot is given away when Taggert and Andrews meet on the subway (again, that's what I think, though evidently Taggert didn't figure it out).A subplot concerns Taggert's relationship with his girlfriend (Natalie Barrow), an actress who is making her debut in an independent film. Once the audience becomes aware of what's going on in the movie, we can pretty much see what will happen with this couple.All in all, ""Broken City"" has some good performances, particularly from Russell Crowe and Alona Tai, who plays Taggert's assistant, but it has no punch. It's a dark movie with an old plot that the screenwriter has attempted to make more modern. Done right, it would have packed a wallop. It doesn't, but if you're looking for something from Netflix, for instance, you might like it.",Broken City
8,edwagreen,Broken City No Smash **,5,21 December 2013,"...And Russell Crowe has developed a paunch.This was not a good film as the twists further twisted an already confusing plot.Crowe represents the big-time mayor-filled with corruption and deceit. He will go all lengths to keep it that way as he faces a tough reelection bid against a Harvard educated Jack Valiant- Barry Pepper.Donnie Wahlberg is the cop who got away with murder, but our mayor keeps things such as film on file as he never knows when he is going to need it.Kyle Chandler comes in and quickly exits with a bullet in his head. Our mayor hired Wahlberg to dig up dirt on an alleged affair between the mayor's wife and the Chandler character. The latter being the opposition's campaign manager.Then there is an upcoming Spanish actress, girlfriend to Wahlberg, whose sister was killed 7 years before and Wahlberg consoled the family.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Crowe's wife. She was friends with the manager and that was it.After a while, you need a score card just to figure things out.Naturally, the mayor is involved in crooked real estate developing.

Several years after leaving the force and becoming a private detective, the mayor is the last person Taggart would be expecting a call from.

When in short order the lover turns up dead; Taggart learns that the mayor is in the middle of some very lucrative and shady real estate dealings. And consequently, is also no a model husband. Cathlene is not apposed of bringing her husband down.Wahlberg, as he usually is, doing his rough and tougher than nails thing. Crowe is commanding, demanding and down right mean.

10,LeonLouisRicci,Muddled and Sloppy Professionalism,6,16 January 2014,"A rather Lackluster Attempt at a Neo-Noir that never seems to find its Edge. With Two, count-em, Mega-Stars and a Director with some Excellent Films to His Credit, this can be nothing but a Let-Down.All the Ingredients are there but it doesn't seem to Amount too Much. It is a bit Sloppy at Times and Scenes don't always Link Together in what they call Effective Montage. Kind of Zig-Zaggy. There are a lot of Characters whose Motivations are Muddled as is the Movie.There is Enough Professionalism in the Making that Makes it Watchable. Some Good Cinematography, but the Script is hardly the Stuff of a Norish Underbelly. Speaking of Bellies, Russell Crowe is a bit Paunchy but that Fits His Raunchy Politico Character, a Greed is Good Fat-Cat. Mark Wahlberg gives a better than Average Outing, which is to say that He Mumbles Less than Usual.Overall, not quite a Misfire but does miss out on being a whole lot Less than it could have been with a Tighter, Grittier, and Wittier Script that this Type of Movie Demands.",Broken City
11,CinemaSerf,Mediocre effort with a decent soundtrack.,6,28 April 2020,"Unfortunately, the whole does not equal the sum of the parts here in this rather formulaic crime thriller. Mark Wahlberg is ""Billy""; a cop with a bit of a dodgy past but one who is rated by the Mayor - a strangely coiffured Russell Crowe. When the mayor is amidst a heated re-election battle, he hires ""Billy"" to try and find out who is having an affair with his glamorous wife Catherine Zeta-Jones. At this point, and despite decent performances from CZ-J and Jeffery Wright, the film falls clearly into a well worn trammel line of betrayal, duplicity and corruption before a pretty predictable conclusion. To it's credit, it moves along well with plenty of action but the two principals don't really gel particularly well and there are so many subplots and pointless twists that it is in real danger of tripping over it's own cloak in search for the dagger. Worth a watch, but nothing special.",Broken City
12,grantss,Nothing new here,4,20 January 2014,"Nothing new here. Pretty much your standard corruption-and-crime-at- the-top crime-thriller. Plot is initially mildly interesting but quickly degenerates into a predictable storyline. Not just predictable, but contrived and full of holes. Characters are pretty stereotypical: crooked politician, our hero is a down-on-his-luck ex-cop turned private investigator, standard minor characters (police chief, wife who doesn't understand our hero, dutiful assistant). Nothing new under the sun.Mark Wahlberg could be excused for doing the best he can with the dud script. However, he a producer of the movie, so bears some of the responsibility for the film. Russell Crowe is quite irritating as the politician, or maybe he managed to capture politicians perfectly! Catherine Zeta-Jones has surprisingly little screen time. Barry Pepper is badly cast as the do-good politician - he really doesn't look the part.",Broken City

Lumetian NYC corruption tale at full tilt with Wahlberg as as disgraced cop turned shamus who finds himself under the dubious employment of charismatic mayor Crowe who wants his wife Zeta-Jones under surveillance for infidelity. But as is the case there is always more than meets the eye in this potboiler with a game cast and fine direction from Allen Hughes (his first solo helmsmanship sans bro Albert) with a lean, tight screenplay by newbie scribe Brian Tucker that while familiar is none-the-less engaging largely thanks to the Cagneyesque Wahlberg's anti-hero.",Broken City

Seven years later he is asked by the Mayor to investigate his wife, but when her apparent lover is found dead, Taggart investigates further, at which point the suppressed evidence becomes relevant.Wahlberg gives a stolid performance as Taggart, Russell Crowe as the Mayor seems to think he's in a comedy, and everyone else is OK. The relatively straightforward story is told in a less than straightforward way, and is difficult to follow at times.I have seen worse thrillers, but I have also seen many more which were better.",Broken City
15,Uriah43,Confusing at Times but a Good Neo-Noir,6,6 August 2020,"This film begins with a New York City police officer by the name of ""Billy Taggart"" (Mark Wahlberg) shooting and killing a man recently acquitted on a technicality of the rape and murder of a young woman. Not long afterward, while his case is being decided in court, the mayor of New York ""Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) is informed of a video that clearly shows Taggart killing the victim in cold blood--yet for reasons unknown the mayor decides not to present it as evidence. As a result, Taggart is cleared of the charges but because of the negative publicity he is asked to leave the NYPD. The film then picks up seven years later with Taggart now operating as a private detective and being called in to work for the mayor who suspects his wife, ""Cathleen Hostetler"" (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair with another man. Desperately in need of money, Taggart accepts the job only to discover later that the man Cathleen is seeing just happens to be the campaign manager of the mayor's political opponent. But what he doesn't know is that there is much more to this story than he suspects. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a solid crime-drama which featured several fine actors who played their roles quite well. That said, however, there were some parts of the movie that became a bit confusing at times due to some of the twists and turns along the way. In any case, while certainly not an exceptional neo-noir, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.",Broken City
16,ferguson-6,We Broke this city on Mark and Crowe,5,20 January 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. The best Political crime dramas are complex films with multiple intersecting sub-plots, filled with stylish mis-direction and intense wordplay and back-stabbing between good guys and bad. What doesn't work is obvious. Especially obvious to the point where the audience is way ahead of the earnest, but clumsy protagonist. Luckily for director Allen Hughes (working solo without his brother Albert for the first time), he has stacked the film with a wonderful cast which makes it somewhat entertaining despite its major flaws.Mark Wahlberg plays (what else?) a streetwise guy/cop/detective who tries to do the right thing but always seems to end up with the short straw. Russell Crowe is in fine form as the megalomaniac NYC mayor who plays dirty, but knows how to sell his stuff to the people ... even as he schemes to do great wrong. Their paths cross twice and neither time turns out so great for Wahlberg.As for the rest of the cast, Barry Pepper is miscast as Crowe's mayoral opponent; Jeffrey Wright is intriguing as the Police Commissioner seemingly playing both sides against the middle; Catherine Zeta-Jones is Crowe's most unhappy and disloyal wife; Kyle Chandler plays Pepper's campaign manager (and evidently more); and Griffin Dunne is a rich Crowe supporter and knee deep in the evil scheme. Also interesting is Alona Tai as Wahlberg's wise-cracking assistant.While no details will be spilled here, there is a fun exchange during the debate between Crowe and Pepper, and well, the movie is just at its best when Crowe is on screen. Wahlberg's character is pretty much the same he has played a dozen times prior, but it seems the real issue is with first time screenwriter Brian Tucker. He is just overrun with ideas and because of that, most go undeveloped. A script clean-up from a screen veteran could have turned this one around. Still, if you have seen all the Oscar nominated films and are looking for a watchable January release, you could do worse. Just try not to think too much!",Broken City
17,HotToastyRag,"If you suffer from vertigo, stay away from this movie",3,14 December 2017,"There's really only one reason you'll sit through Broken City: to watch three good-looking people up on the big screen. It's always a more enjoyable movie when the stars are pretty to look at, isn't it? In this one, Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, and Catherine Zeta-Jones headline, but it's really only Catherine who looks particularly pretty. Russell has a strange hairdo and Mark just looks tired.Ex-cop Mark is a private detective, and Russell, the mayor of New York City calls in a favor. He's up for re-election, and he thinks his wife Catherine is cheating on him. To pre-empt the tabloids and opposition team, he asks Mark to spy on her and find evidence. But there's much more than meets the eye. . .To be honest, there's a lot more than meets the eye, and it's called a handheld camera. I went to see this movie with my mom, who suffers from vertigo, and the film was so devastating to her health, it took her over two years to fully recover. The camera is nearly constantly moving, turning, and swerving, and there are several scenes with strobing police lights, so if you suffer from the same ailment, stay very far away from this movie.As far as ""dirty politician double-crosses the average Joe"" movies go, Broken City isn't above average. It's pretty predictable and will only really appeal to fans of the cast. Young, impressionable girls who want to drool over Mark Wahlberg and young, impressionable boys who want to drool over Catherine Zeta-Jones will probably be the happiest audience members. Rent it, you youngsters, for a fun date night!DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie is not your friend. It's exclusively filmed with a handheld, active camera, and there are several scenes with strobing police lights. It will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Broken City

If they had just made it a little simpler, like Crowe going nuts and murdering his wife, rather than cover up after cover up, it would have been predictable, but simple and enjoyable.But no, we get Wahlberg, falling off the wagon, Crowe being sinister, Wright being quiet yet threatening, Pepper crying, and Zeta Jone playing femme fatale.It doesn't work, and even though the leas put in good performance, you could see the outcome of this coming a mile off, as it was done so much better, and so many times in the nineties.Yes it looks good, but for a film that is supposed to be an intelligent thriller, its just not enough.",Broken City
19,gradyharp,Chicago BOSS political shenanigans become New York's BROKEN CITY,7,1 May 2013,"For those who remember how tightly written and brilliantly acted television's BOSS pushed the covers back on Chicago's gamy political tales the perhaps BROKEN CITY will be a disappointment. As written by Brian Tucker and directed by Allen Hughes this film comes off as a bit disjointed with some very confusing story developments that are so mumbled by the cast that subtitles might be necessary to stay involved. But do we want to be involved in a story where every character is crooked? Usually there is at least one redeeming force that makes the light shining on all the evil around seem justified, but not here: everyone involved is essentially a bad guy.NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who raped and murdered the sixteen-year-old sister of Taggart's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). His friend, Captain Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) asks Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for help, and Hostetler eliminates the evidence against Taggart. Tavarez's death is ruled as self-defense, and Taggart is forced to leave the police. Seven years later, Taggart is a private detective on the verge of bankruptcy when he's hired by Hostetler to find out who his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair with. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Ta, the one bright light in the film), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). But even that is a sham and a mistake that drives everyone into even deeper depths of evil. Even our given hero Billy Taggart returns of his alcohol abuse and despite his efforts to make things right meets all manner of surprise changes that simply don't hang together.The cast of fine actors do the best they can with this creaky story and in addition to the stars mentioned, the smaller roles are well filled by Michael Beach, James Ransome and Griffin Dunne. The film is dark, tosses in the usual car chases, and in general entertains but leaves a bitter aftertaste about American politics. Grady Harp",Broken City
20,mm-39,A detective story!,7,2 February 2013,"Broken story is a detective story! A strong movie. I give Broken city a seven out of ten because: Broken City is well acted and directed. Russel Crowe gives his usually strong performance. I believe Crowe is this era's Pacino. Broken city is a Mike Hammer style story, where an ex-cop turned P I is hired by the mayor. Broken City's theme of everyone being dirty: girlfriend, police chief, the ex-cop, mayor etc is predominate. What makes the story/themes strong is that everyone is dirty theme is woven into the thesis that corruption and leverage runs politics. Broken city story dwells deeper into the corruption game. The movie's political debate shows how both sides (Dem or Rep) have no ideas on dealing with corruption. A committee meeting is going to do nothing, except give an appearance corruptions will be fixed. Broken city ends on a strong note when of the characters sacrifices themselves to expose corruption. Regrettably, Broken City's ending gives the indication the mayor may snake his way out of the mess. Not bad for a under two hour movie.",Broken City
21,StevePulaski,"Aesthetics of metropolitan Brooklyn, the interworkings and plot of modern-day Detroit",4,1 May 2013,"Broken City features first-rate actors in second-rate production values in a third-rate story that would be lucky to make a fourth-rate time-slot on basic cable. At an overlong hundred and nine minutes, it feels like a lengthy, almost insufferable pilot for one of those cookie-cutter crime dramas found on primetime. Only this primetime pilot features a mediocre line of guttural characters and a gross inertness to its material and focus.The plot: Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a Brooklyn cop who committed murder on a young man in what he claims is self-defense, and is released when Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) erases all remaining evidence of Taggart's guilt. Now, he has a new agenda when the Mayor asks him to spy on his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), when he believes she is cheating with another man. Being the competent and bright moviegoer I know you are, you could probably figure out that Nicholas' wife isn't quite having an affair,but doing something cunning and completely tricky.Wahlberg gives about the umpteenth rendition of the cop-means-business roll we've seen done many times before. It's funny to see him portray so thinly and blandly a role he humorously parodied in The Other Guys not long ago. There are few other films likely to be released this year where the motivation for an actor to ""collect the check"" has been so clear and evident. Crowe gives, at best, an average performance here, with little charisma or excitement coming from his persona. After giving at least an ambitious performance in Les Misérables, seeing him resort back to January-fare is sort of dispiriting. Supporting performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jeffrey Wright as the police captain also have little to offer in the face of disappointment.The single saving grace for Broken City is its use of music and vague hint of identifiable style. Throw in a few more shadows and a couple more wet sidewalks and this could be on its way to reaching the visual quality of a picture in the vein of film noir. The music, as well, throws in a nice sort of vibe, even though it's a vibe that corresponds with indifferent acting and unremarkable writing from Brian Tucker. The film was directed by Allen Hughes, who is commonly seen alongside his twin brother Albert directing violent pictures such as The Book of Eli or From Hell. With a track record like the brothers, I was astonished one of them could make such a flat, dry picture with no interesting setup and thin characters.Little in Broken City is memorable. It functions in such a contrived state that it neglects to even offer credible twists that one could find in the most obscure, low-budget thriller. It possess as much originality and willingness to subvert clichés as Alex Cross did, another film that relied way too much on formula and the elements of predictability to get its crime story across. Sometimes I wonder what is more disappointing in the field of cinema; the presence and very existence of a bad movie or the presence of a movie that discards potential in favor of ""getting by."" It's the equivalent of a teenager writing a three-page essay for English class, when the bare-minimum is four, and then enlarging the font accordingly.Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Jeffrey Wright.

The cast includes Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zetta-Jones, Jeffrey Wright, Barry Pepper, Alona Tal and Kyle Chandler. Wahlberg plays a cop haunted by a crime he committed (killing a rapist in cold blood) but escaped prosecution for. Crowe plays a Mayor who has the one piece of evidence that can put the cop away. He tricks the cop into doing his dirty work. The story isn't all that impressive, it's mildly interesting but not enough to attract a cast like this. I think Hughes must have been the drawing point for most of the movie's stars. The directing is good and the acting is decent but that's about all this movie has to really offer.Wahlberg plays New York City police officer Billy Taggart. Crowe plays Mayor Hostetler. Hostetler comes across a tape that catches Billy in the act of shooting and murdering a rapist as Billy's actions are under review by the court. He holds on to it and due to lack of evidence Taggart is released and freed from going to trial. Billy then loses his job and goes into business for himself as a private investigator. Years later as Taggart is struggling to pay his bills Hostetler offers him $50,000 to find out who his wife is having an affair with. Taggart does the job but his actions lead to severe complications and his conscience gets the better of him. His past of course comes back to haunt him as well.The movie is mildly amusing but nothing spectacular and I expected a lot more from Hughes and this cast. It's definitely not a bad film and it's not boring or cringe worthy in any way. Wahlberg and Crowe are fine but it's Alona Tal that steals the show in my opinion. She's cute and likable and has the biggest heart of any character in the movie. Pepper is pretty good as well but the material doesn't really give the actors too much to work with. All the ingredients are there for a better film except the one that's probably most key to that possibility.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kj-9_Atk6A",Broken City

The city ain't the only thing that's broken here.",Broken City
24,Robert_duder,A drama thriller that is made exponentially better by a talented cast,8,21 April 2013,"I suspected from what I heard that even though the trailers made Broken City look like an action movie that it was going to be a drama. I figured this is why the film didn't do well. Mainstream audiences expected Mark Wahlberg vengeance action when in fact it was a political drama/thriller. It is definitely the latter. The pacing for the film feels a little slow at times, and you're wondering if its going to really take off and its not to say that it does because to me there was never really a ""climactic"" moment but the film still chugs along solidly with really great characters, some good performances, and a decent mystery that keeps you wanting to watch. The film is definitely a character study. Mostly it focuses on two men, a former cop turned Private Eye with a myriad of personal demons and a brutally powerful Mayor looking to be re-elected in the wake of a potential scandal. I think despite its shortcomings that the film worked and mostly because of its talented cast which is virtual ensemble of various familiar faces. While the film doesn't have any HUGE twists, the story is complex enough that it keeps you watching right up until the final moments.Mark Wahlberg carries the film very, very well. There is no doubt that he is a talented actor with incredible star charisma and this type of film shows it. This is a more subtle performance for him and his character is very flawed as most of the characters are but he really makes it his own and makes you root for him as an anti-hero of sorts. Russell Crowe had had some ups and downs in his career and seems to have hit a bit of a slump in the last few years but I still enjoy the guy. He always has this dark brooding edge to him and it works very well in the role of the sleazy but popular mayor. Its a good example of politics at work and some of the best scenes are the banter between him and Wahlberg. There is no doubt of his villainy very early but its still good to watch his character arc. These two really do carry the film. It is truly a starring vehicle for them and that works. Still the supporting cast are very familiar faces and all do decently. Catherine Zeta Jones barely has a pulse in the film. I mean her character is vital enough but she gets nothing to really sink her teeth into and is barely more than a cameo. Barry Pepper, Jeffrey Wright, Alona Tal and Natalie Martinez are all particularly good in small supporting roles. Pepper really stands out in his small part of Crowe's political nemesis.Allen Hughes (of the Hughes Brothers) is a talented film maker and director. He has done some great thrillers and uses his characters to the utmost. I think the problem with this film is in the way that it was marketed. The audience went in expecting mainstream action and this is a political drama/thriller through and through. It has ups and downs and can be a little complex following everyone's story and back story but ultimately it is extremely entertaining. Wahlberg fans should not be disappointed for even a moment because he proves that he is more than just an action star. Political thrillers can come across as tired and overdone and often very cookie cutter and this one has a few of those moments but overall it actually comes in being unique and interesting. Complex characters, a solid story, good direction and very good performances make this a definite must see for a good night at the movies!! 8/10",Broken City
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Plenty of neat twists and turns, but not driven in the most thrill effective way",7,17 July 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBilly Taggart (Mark Whalberg) was a New York cop who shot down a suspect in what he claims was self defense, and though acquitted, he was forced to leave the force in a hail of bad publicity. Seven years later, he runs his own private detective agency, only to find his services requested again by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) who pulled some strings to get him off in the first place. Hostetler wants him to spy on his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who he thinks is having an affair. But as he digs deeper in to the case, he finds the truth may not be as clear cut as he thinks. The Big Apple once again provides the back drop for a gritty detective thriller, that didn't receive glistening reviews upon release and many probably avoided in theatres. It probably is better suited to the small screen, more of a film to settle down to more than go out to see, and what you're in store for is an impressively intricate offering that is dragged down by a dull pace and dreary execution.The big name cast list inevitably raises it a notch above your average TV movie offering, and thankfully everyone's on top form, Whalberg in the lead intense and brooding as ever, while Crowe abandons tough guy duties to portray a cynical, calculating villain. Both the main players have ample support in the shape of Zeta-Jones, Jeffrey Wright and Barry Pepper. The plot, while full of hackneyed characters and set up, is still clever and you have to pay attention or you'll lose the thread of it. Sadly, while it's well written, it fails to really guide itself in a truly thrilling narrative structure and bring everything together for a truly effective pay off at the end. The dull lighting and cinematography only add to this feeling of dreariness, and mean the film fails to do itself justice.This is not quite as bad or even average as everyone's been making out it is. It's just all the ingredients aren't properly put together and as a result it isn't quite the 'thriller' it truly should be. ***",Broken City
26,MOscarbradley,Enjoyable if overly complicated.,6,7 February 2020,"An entertaining, if overly complicated, thriller about murder and corruption involving City Hall. It aims for the same kind of labyrinth, noirish feel that distinguished ""Chinatown"" but falls far short. Mark Wahlberg is the ex-cop who is being set up, Russell Crowe, (very good), is the corrupt mayor and Catherine Zeta-Jones is the mayor's wife and others in a good supporting cast include Kyle Chandler, Jeffrey Wright, Barry Pepper and Griffin Dunne. The problem is there's just too much plot, most of it shrouded in mystery, with what I percieved to be a gay subplot getting lost in the mix. On the plus side, director Allen Hughes never pauses for breath and it looks great, (Ben Seresin was the DP), but it wasn't much of a success and has largely been forgotten.",Broken City
27,bowmanblue,"A slow burner, but worth it",7,3 January 2015,"Broken City has attracted more than its fair share of negative criticism. Perhaps people were expecting more of an 'action movie' out of it? Mark Wahlberg keeps his shirt on throughout the whole film and plays a disgraced cop who is forced to get by as a private eye. Then his old friend - Russell Crowe - the mayor of New York, hires him to look into his - apparently - cheating wife.Naturally, nothing is what it seems. However, we don't find much out in the first half of the movie, where Marky Mark spends his time aimlessly wandering from one meeting to another. I can see a lot of people tuning out because of this, but, if you can put up with Russell Crowe's bizarre tan and hairpiece, then you may enjoy the second half a lot more - where character after character drops bombshell after bombshell.It's basically a political thriller about how corrupt those are with power are and it has enough original twists and turns in it to make it stand out over the rest - just don't expect wall to wall shoot outs (and don't expect many juicy revelations in the first half!).",Broken City
28,dromasca,"broken city, messy movie",5,21 January 2018,"Sometimes telling the idea or describing the synopsis of the film is much clearer than the feeling that we had while viewing it. This is exactly my feeling about Broken City, a political thriller taking place in the days between the New York City mayoral elections (with a prologue and some flashbacks added). The story (a corruption case at the level of the candidates involved in the campaign including the incumbent mayor) and the cast should have provided the premises of a - at least - a good thriller. And yet, the outcome, in my opinion, disappoints.The name of the lead hero in the film is Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg). He is an ex-cop and the film starts with the episode which cut short his career in the police, a moment when apparently he was easy on the trigger on what seems to be a vigilante killing of a guy everybody hated. Turned into a private investigator he is involved in working for the New York mayor (Russell Crowe) in the final days of the election campaign. He seems to be a honest type, but involvement with politics is not made for honest people, especially as they have a dept to pay to the politician who supported him in his dark hours. All the story however becomes more complicated as the film develops, and the details (mostly related to real estate fraud) are never clear enough or interesting enough. The final is also far from convincing, with a final twist that was hard to believe, belonging to the psychology of self sacrifice.There are certainly reasons to watch this film I admired the quality of the actors - Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones. I wrote actors and not acting, because I do not believe that their roles here are any peak of their acting careers. The principal problem of this film is the story telling, too many threads, none of them too clear, some interrupted suddenly as the relation between the hero and his girlfriend, a character that simply disappears from the story with no much explanation. Broken City ends by being much less that it could have been.",Broken City
29,g-bodyl,Good For What It Is!,8,31 May 2014,"Is Broken City going to blow your mind away with something new and unexpected? Is Broken City the most original thriller you'll ever see? The answer to both of these questions is no, but don't worry because not all hope is lost. This film manages to be an interesting, half-entertaining thriller that pays thoughtful tribute to the period from the 1930's to 1950's when noir films were the most prevalent. This isn't the best thriller out there, but it certainly gets it's job done.Allen Hughes directs a film about how corruption and injustice is prevalent in politics. After ex-cop now turned private detective Billy Taggert is set up and framed by none other than the mayor himself, Billy goes out for some tasteful revenge.This film has a very good cast, better than one would expect for a January thriller. They won't blow you away, but they manage to be respectable. Mark Wahlberg brings some life to the role of Taggert. Russell Crowe does a good job as the mayor. Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job and I could have used some more scenes with her.Overall, Broken City is a solid thriller that has some tricks up it's sleeves. This film definitely reminds me of noir films of old because of the way it was filmed. Most of the film is in darkness and shadows and I can appreciate that. The script is average at best, but good acting tries to make up for that. There's nothing new here, but at least it makes for an interesting film experience. I rate this film 8/10.",Broken City

31,secondtake,"Unconvincing stuff, but well made it seemed to me",7,31 December 2013,"Broken City (2013)A familiar zone that gets freshened up with a fast plot, some great acting, and a series of twists that never ends.At first this seems to be a cop story, then a cop story involving the mayor as he runs for office. The mayor is played with such conviction and charm by Russell Crowe you end up rooting for him even as the plot clearly turns against him. But more important is the cop, vilified and with dubious ethics, played by Mark . He's tough, easily duped, and eventually principled—depending on what your principles are.Beyond the plot (which I'll get to) and the clashing of big personalities (which works), what makes this movie tick is how well it's made. Those prosaic things like editing and photography really meld and take on a force that sucks you in without exaggeration or affectation. It's a straight ahead film in many ways, but invested with intensity and solidity enough to make it really commanding, despite some holes in the plot.Why the unfavorable response by so many? This might be helpful before diving in. The key is some kind of believability. Wahlberg plays a troubled cop in a troubled relationship (which is a cliché of these kinds of movies), and then becomes a low level detective taking sneaky pictures of adulterous situations. And as a photography myself I have to say this part of the movie is rotten stupid—the way he hides is one thing (bad) but the way he uses his camera is just silly. And getting results (which we are told about later) that are impossible given what we were shown earlier.Then there is the motivation behind it al, which I can't reveal (and which won't be clear until the end, if even quite then). Since the movie has no real tricks up its sleeve, it depends on a convincing series of events, which it doesn't quite have. The events taken one by one are bold and well done, sometimes very well done, but they don't quite accelerate into a coherent, gripping plot. For those who watch movies for what happens (the action, the plot), this will be a struggle. But if you also get into the ambiance, the acting, and the visuals, you might give it a shot. I watched it straight through and was interested all along. Maybe I kept holding out hope that it would gel by the end (it does not), but if that's what it takes to watch it, give that a try!",Broken City

38,leonblackwood,Disappointing! 4/10,4,30 June 2013,"Review: This movie was quite disappointing. I was expecting a little bit of everything, but the whole movie is based around politics and Mark Wahlberg walking around trying to solve an investigation. With such a big cast, you would think that this movie should tick all the boxes, but it was quite dull and pretty boring. The main problem is the storyline which over complexed, which didn't suit Mark Wahlberg's acting style. He just isn't believable enough and Russell Crowe's character could have been played by anyone. After a while the film just drags and you don't really care about what happens with the whole investigation. Just another waste of a great cast. Disappointing!Round-Up: I think that Mark Wahlberg is allowed a couple of duff movies because Hollywood hasn't taken quite a shine to him. Russell Crowe and Carherine Zeta-Jones seems to be popping up in quite a few movies lately and I think that they will always be classed as A list actors because its rare that they take on leading roles. Judging by the money that the movie made, it looks like a lot of people were disappointed with this movie and its rare to see a film of this class, actually lose money. The budget must have been the wages that the actors required, so you can't help to think that it might have been a better movie if they would have spent less money on the actors and more on a decent script writer or director.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $20millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there political thrillers, but don't expect much. 4/10",Broken City
39,TheMovieDiorama,Broken City feels more like a broken film.,4,16 March 2019,"Crime thrillers involving the corruption of policing forces and powerful politicians tend to imitate the aesthetics of a noir classic. Sometimes it works, like with the case of 'LA Confidential', and other times it misfires completely. Broken City crumbles into the latter. A private investigator is hired by the mayor of New York City to spy on his wife who he believes to be cheating on him. It soon spirals into a game of revenge, justice and deceit.Director Hughes harnesses the gritty streets of its famous city in order to convey societal issues that plague the economy. Tax increase, residential crashes and the solidification of a safer neighbourhood. Unfortunately what takes precedent in this story is a dull, predictable and clichéd investigation that is weighed down by a monotonous script that lacks any personality. When the most exciting moment is a five minute mayoral debate about taxation, something is clearly incorrect. Don't get me wrong, it's a functional plot that blurs the line between revenge and justice. However Hughes' mediocre execution resulted in an almost instantly forgettable crime thriller that is absent of any thrills.Given the talented cast, I was expecting more. Wahlberg and Crowe were fine, but when Chandler, Zeta-Jones, Wright and Pepper are all underused, it becomes a bland investigation. Wahlberg's central character has no bite and has a questionable amount of intelligence. When hired by a powerful man who instantly comes across as sinister to spy on his wife (who in fact coincidentally warned him beforehand), you'd think that maybe handing him evidence would be a bad idea? Apparently not. It concludes in good old-fashioned blackmail and whatever the decision, it doesn't matter. You're already bored out of your mind. Were this set in the 40s, then maybe this could've been more effective. Alas, the inherent commentary on today's society made this flick seem absurdly self-important. And that's the least of this film's problems, all of which cannot be mended.",Broken City
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Top talents only take 'Broken City' so far,4,19 January 2013,"The quality of a corruption-themed political thriller with a star-studded cast always comes down to one thing — the script. Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Barry Pepper, Kyle Chandler and Jeffrey Wright definitely qualify ""Broken City"" for that category of film, and so all eyes are on rookie screenwriter Brian Tucker.Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) is a New York City police detective acquitted of killing a man who got off on a rape and murder charge. The mayor (Crowe) and commissioner (Wright) know a bit more, however, and require Taggart to step down. Seven years later, Taggart is a private investigator owed a lot of money that he hasn't seen, so when the mayor comes calling weeks before election day and asks him to find out who his wife is sleeping with, he quickly agrees. But when he completes the job he finds he's been double-crossed and set up as an accomplice to murder.The plot is most definitely neo-noir, but the direction of Allen Hughes (one half of the Hughes brothers, the duo behind ""The Book of Eli"" and ""From Hell"") provides it with none of that style or class. But visual flare becomes irrelevant when your audience is too preoccupied with making sense of a convoluted plot. Tucker weaves an intriguing network of deception that keeps you from trusting any character in the movie, including even Taggart, but there are too many pieces, including barely introduced characters, that comprise the hidden truth in the story. Consequently, the film relies on heavy- handed dialogue and formula way more often that it should. Tucker tries to make it so every component of the film connects in some way, yet to do so he falls back on clichés. A lot of the dialogue is also steered toward set-ups for sharp one-liners. These veteran actors know how to work lines of this contrived nature, but because the rest of this film doesn't do its job, these quotes elicit chuckles more than satisfied smirks.Of all the talents, Crowe gives the film's best performance as the shadowy Nick Hostetler, who despite preferring to keep his own hands clean, comes off as though at any moment he might roll his sleeves up and punish someone. Considering the trailer casts him as the bad guy, it's impressive that you'll like him for as much of the run time as you do. The script attempts to paint Taggart as a complex main character of moral ambiguity, but he just sort of drifts in and out of likability instead. Few actors do the ""man on a mission"" better than Wahlberg does, but Taggart is saddled with a penchant for violence that crops up sporadically and he's also a recovering alcoholic. And that's in addition to his past transgressions.The conflict plays over a mayoral race between Hostetler and Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), which gets a lot of play despite factoring minimally into the main narrative. It's part of the many cogs necessary to make the plot function, but it mostly results in the spouting of political rhetoric that just makes the story all the murkier. ""Broken City"" works reasonably well in individual pieces and scenes, but as part of the master plan, they're drawn together almost haphazardly, with some crucial details cutting across the screen in the blink of an eye. Even so, the resolution all comes down to some really simple and even cliché plot devices. There are no late twists or revelations that really turn the tide; the biggest one gets nullified almost instantly.Any film can flash some big names and load up on reputable faces, but in this genre, script is king. Hughes is practically invisible as a director, so Tucker's work is exposed all the more. Some strong acting really bolsters the film's strengths, but it only goes as high as the structure it's built upon, and that structure has enough kinks that ""Broken City"" only delivers marginal satisfaction.~Steven CThanks for reading!

What did the writer and the director see in this story that simply screamed: ""Tell me! Tell me!"" Or was this simply an attempt to cash in on the star power of the main leads and make some money? I mean, that's Hollywood in a nutshell, according to some, but you can usually see that at least someone cared about the final product.Broken City is simply put boring. Its story has no purpose. It has one of the most cookie cutter plots I've ever seen, its characters are achingly stereotypical, the final end twist can be seen coming kilometers away and as a whole I was never invested in what was happening.But yes, the main leads, Wahlberg and Crowe, are both very talented actors. And it is always nice to see Catherine Zeta-Jones, never let it be said I've claimed anything else. But even good actors need good scripts to allow them to shine, and in this case that simply isn't the case. And as a result you can see that even they are not really trying. They're not interested in the movie, so why should the audience be.Broken City is far from the worst movie I've ever seen. I have nothing bad to say about the production values, the natural charisma of the leads shines through, though barely, and the story, while soulless and clichéd, at least tries to be good. Making the whole movie somewhat below average, but watchable if you have to see it for one reason or another.",Broken City
43,BeneCumb,"Decent, with too many exploited elements though",7,4 July 2013,"More than ""ordinary"" thrillers, political-economical thrillers tend to slide into clichés, improbable scenes and hollow phrases. Broken City includes them all as well, and now the length, selection of actors and the number of twists determine how watchable a movie is. The plot has its predictable moments, the twists and turns are in place, and there are not too many dull scenes (well, the chase followed by a finding in a garbage can was odd); on the other hand, Billy Taggart could enter all places too easily - this is still contemporary USA with ultra-high security measures and tapping paranoia! The ending could have also been less trivial.Additional value to the movie is provided by a fine (Russell Crowe) and good (the rest) performances. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor, but Crowe outperforms him in every scene (hmm, Academy Award winner vs. nominee). Catherine Zeta-Jones could have spent much more time on screen, her character could have had bigger role in the main exposure.All in all, Broken City is an okay thrilling entertainment, but no distinctive masterpiece.",Broken City
44,thinker1691,""" A Debt is owed when one is serious about paying it back """,7,10 June 2013,"Brian Tucker wrote this gritty, provocative story about a tough yet flawed New York City Dectective who chases down a vicious rapist and kills him. Although the media and the public believe Billy Taggart and the NYCP police are wrong, the cop (Mark Wahlberg) is found innocent. Despite the court's decision, Taggart is forced to resign and finds employment as a Private Investagator. Years later, facing financial troubles and trying to hold onto a shaky marriage to a movie actress, Taggart accepts a clandestine job to shadow the Mayor's wife on suspicious of having an affair. Accepting a $50,000 retainer, Taggart begins his job only to learn that what he's been told, does not hold true and in doing so, he acquires a great deal of addition information which is potentially lethal and injurious not only to the mayor but more importantly to himself. The movie is a triller and murder mystery, yet for the most part lacks proper cohesion. Because of that, audiences struggle to follow the dark confusing story. The only saving grace is the great cast which stars Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Barry Pepper and Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mayor's wife. One watches the role of Russel Crowe with anticipation, expecting him to somehow emerge from playing the heavy and doing something to save the movie. Indeed, we all expect him or Wahlberg to switch roles. Still it is an interesting film for fans of the cast. ****",Broken City

46,estebangonzalez10,The Broken Hughes,4,1 October 2013,"""There are some wars you fight and some wars you walk away from. This isn't the fighting kind.""I guess Allen Hughes's brother, Albert (with whom he has always worked with in the past directing such films as The Book of Eli and From Hell), decided this was a movie he was going to walk away from. Albert was the smarter brother here because Broken City really missed the mark with a rather predictable plot involving corrupt government officials, silly twists, and irrelevant character motivations. I felt the story was rather ambiguous and some characters were presented only to introduce a certain plot element and then were completely forgotten (as with Natalie and Cathleen). In this day and age where you can find great TV series why would someone want to go see a political thriller so formulaic as this? Hughes has to offer something much more groundbreaking if he wants to attract audiences. It's not enough just to have big stars and a predictable script. It's a shame that the film is actually more broken than the city, and one of the main issues I had was with the weak script written by Brian Tucker which leaves way too many loose ends. Broken City isn't a terrible movie, but it isn't any good either. Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a New York detective on trial for having killed an alleged rapist and murderer. The court finds Billy innocent despite the fact that Police Commissioner Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) presented some evidence to the city's Mayor, Hostetler (Russell Crowe), which he decided to withhold. The Mayor congratulates Billy for doing the right thing but he is asked to resign. The film jumps seven years forward where we see Billy working as a private detective (mostly hired for adultery cases). He is married to Natalie (Natalie Martinez), an aspiring actress who happened to be the sister of the murderer's victim. Mayor Hostetler hires Billy to follow his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta Jones), whom he suspects is cheating on him. He wants him to do it quietly because he's a few weeks away from reelection and the opposing candidate, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) is closing in on the race. Billy is surprised to discover that the person Cathleen has been meeting with is actually Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), Valliant's lead campaign coordinator. A few days after he makes this discovery, Paul is found murdered in the streets and Billy realizes that there is much more going on here than a simple adultery case. There is no doubt that the strongest thing about Broken City is its cast. Mark Wahlberg is comfortable here playing the tough guy and I thought he gave a strong performance. I did expect more from Russell Crowe who didn't really add much to the movie. The few scenes with Barry Pepper were probably the strongest ones. Catherine Zeta Jones was underused here and her character is simply in this film to move the plot along. The same can be said for Natalie Martinez. So many of these characters were simply part of this film to introduce certain plot elements but then were completely forgotten. There is no character development and pretty much everyone plays stereotypical roles here. If you've seen political thrillers in the past than you'd be very familiar with these one dimensional characters. Despite trying to pay close attention to the plot I still had a hard time understanding how certain elements were connected with one another. Everything felt contrived and the story was too ambitious. By the end I thought the story was just too unbelievable for a film that tried to appear real and authentic.",Broken City

Along the way 'Billy' unravels a mystery that could bring about the end of more than just a marriage.Ultimately this was just entertaining. Russell Crowe gives a good performance as does Zeta-Jones as his cold wife. I also enjoyed Barry Pepper. Mark Wahlberg is sorta average, we've seen this role from him before and nothing stands out.The plot does become a bit muddled at times and the pacing felt off.

But that moment the chief of police informs the mayor that they've found an eye witness. The cop is let go from the force and becomes a private detective.One day he gets a call from the mayor. He wants him to trail his wife because he thinks she's cheating on him. On top of that, it's election season and a recent billion dollar land deal has the mayor on the defensive against the moral leftist candidate.Taggart, the detective, follows the mayor's wife and discovers she's seeing the campaign manager of her husband's opponent no less. We learn more about Taggart. He's married to a lovely actress. Of course he used to be an alcoholic (are there any non-alcoholic cops in NY according to Hollywood?) but for her sake has recovered. He doesn't fit into her group of indie artists. On the day of the premiere of her indie flick, he starts drinking again after seeing the rough sex scene she performed. Turns out her sister was killed in her neighborhood, that Taggart used to patrol. In fact, the dead guy from the intro was the sister's killer who avoided jail due to a technicality. Convenient coincidences.In the meantime there are some surprises about the relationship between the wife and the campaign manager and about the land deal. Taggart gets paid by the mayor and could have let the whole thing go. But when the campaign manager ends up shot dead and Taggart could be implicated, he decides that he's going to take the mayor down. While the mayor and the whole land deal appear dirty, the still does well in the final debate. There just is no smoking guy. Taggart will attempt to procure the smoking gun but the mayor has some cards up his sleeve as well.The script of Broken City had a lot of potential, which the producers (Wahlberg among them) recognized and threw a lot of money at the production by hiring a strong cast. Unfortunately, what was needed was another writer to polish the script. There are some excesses in the form of downright absurd lines. Direction is alright, except when the camera apes those dumb hospital shows and starts rotating in circles.What both the writer and director failed to do though is focus on the story. Instead they focused on the Wahlberg character and his assistant for some reason. What should be a thrilling investigation and discovery of corruption (as the misleading title would indicate) and of a corrupt man is rather a letdown. In fact this story doesn't even bother in presenting the villain as much of a villain, certainly nothing that would raise eyebrows in NY and even less after the Supreme Court's eminent domain decision.",Broken City
51,aharmas,Diamond in the rough,7,24 February 2013,"This one had the makings of a classic, with a very interesting cast: Whalberg, Crowe, and Zeta-Jones, all of whom have done great work before and are more than engaging and capable of giving us multi layered performances. The result is satisfying, but it feels rushed, and there were moments when there are gaps in the narrative. The supporting roles needed a little fleshing out because as I mentioned before the seeds were planted, yet something stunts the full development of a golden promise.Crowe shines in the role of the apparently corrupt mayor of a city getting ready for an electoral race. Unfortunately, one keeps waiting for more. Whalberg provides a good balance as a good man with a flawed past, and there are the supporting characters, somehow essential to the development of the plot twists, and there are at best, outlines, sketches, without much depth, and we like them because the performers are so charismatic. Barry Pepper especially has a couple of memorable moments, and in a much smaller, but no less interesting is Kyle Chandler a guy with a mysterious past.What begins as a detective story, soon turns into a thriller, where our hero must confront the consequence of his misjudgement and impetuous nature. Whalberg is very sympathetic and very likable, even in the moments where his character shows his dark side. There is always someone who is just well, worse than him.""Broken City"" gives new meaning to ""I hope there's a director's cut somewhere""...",Broken City
52,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Broken City,7,11 June 2014,"Mark Wahlberg is gonna be a real busy guy this year. He's got four movies coming out and so far I've seen two of them. Although, I wasn't a fan of his April misfire entitled Pain & Gain (I just couldn't allow myself to be), I did enjoy his earlier release which was probably the first feature length film to come out in 2013. Yes I'm writing about Broken City and yes it entertained me. It's not a great movie but it is a pretty good one. I feel bad though, I mean I knew right away that it was gonna be in and out of the multiplexes faster than a speeding bullet. What you have here is a crime drama that came out in January (strike one), carries an extremely generic title (strike two), and recycles elements from so many other similar films in its respected genre (strike three). Broken City kinda reminded me of a movie that surfaced about 5 years ago (2008's Pride and Glory). Together these two pictures emulate a sort of greatest hits compilation of cinema's version of police corruption and crime. By now, I think we've pretty much seen it all before as moviegoers. But hey, there are a lot worse things you could be doing with two hours to kill than viewing a flick with one past Oscar nominee (Mark Wahlberg) and one past Oscar winner (Russell Crowe). The story goes like this: Wahlberg plays N.Y.P.D. detective Billy Taggert. He crosses the line by playing the dirty cop role (he commits a crime which I can't reveal, that would be a spoiler) and loses his job. Fast forward 7 years later and he is now moonlighting as a photographer/private eye who takes photos of people in I guess, small positions of power. He then catches them in the act of committing for example, adultery and gives this information to the related subjects who are paying for his services. On the verge of going bankrupt (business is slow), Taggert gets a sudden call from the mayor of New York City (Russell Crowe, with perfectly combed hair). Crowe's character (Nicholas Hostetler) proposition's Taggert, the opportunity to make some nice coin. Taggert has to find out if Hostetler's wife (Catherine Zeta- Jones) is cheating on him. Better yet, he has to find out who the actual dude is that's involved (this is a juicy plot point I tell you). So there it is, the gist of Broken City. Like every other three star movie it has a few flaws here and there. One flaw is that it feels overly familiar. Originality is not its strong suit. In its defense though, it's not easy to make this type of film with original ideas, better yet cut it from original cloth. Every darn police TV show or film beat Broken City to the punch. The second flaw is what this movie tries to be. While I found it entertaining and anything but boring, I felt like I was watching an episode of N.Y.P.D. Blue mixed with a dreary daytime soap. It's an interesting combo that could easily make a lot of other critics pick their jaw up off the floor. I didn't mind it though. What drew me in eventually, was the crackling scenes of dialogue between Wahlberg and Crowe's characters. They have some great chemistry between them and I hope someday they'll team up again (I won't tell you whether they become adversaries or not in this movie. That's up to you, the viewer, to find out). Along with Wahlberg and Crowe, (not to mention strong supporting work from Barry Pepper as Crowe's future re-election opponent) everyone else in the cast also does a pretty substantial job (sans Alona Tal who tries hard but looks out of place amongst the other Hollywood heavyweights).In retrospect, this isn't the type of trashy potboiler that's gonna set the world on fire. It does have solid performances, it moves at a brisk pace, and it offers a couple of nifty twists and turns. Granted, it won't have a chance come awards season but I'm sure the people who worked on it know that. On the bright side, they can feel confident that the film was edited nice and tight. This is one of the main aspects that kept me involved throughout its entire running time. Whether you view it or not (and I hope you do), Broken City gets more than enough things right. I'm certain that when the movie ends it will beg you to keep this one notion in mind: if it ain't ""broken,"" don't fix it.",Broken City
53,bob-rutzel-1,"Watchable, but..........",4,10 May 2013,"Ex-Cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is framed by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) and seeks revenge. Sometimes one wonders why big stars go into a movie that really doesn't help them or entertain us. This is what we have here. It seems that any time a political story is presented to us, the underlying purpose is that the powers that be want to reshape a part of their city by blowing it up, or executing eviction orders and putting up expensive high-rises. This is now becoming a popular theme. So if you cannot figure out what is going on, think of this and chances are you will be correct. There were sub-plots to help things along . More could have been done with the Mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and with Jack Valiant (Barry Pepper) the Mayor's opponent in the upcoming election, but they fizzled and we didn't care. Now that we know what is going on, what we needed to experience was a good telling of the story that makes us sit up and say, ""hey, this is pretty good."" Did the big stars accomplish this in here? Sadly, no. The big stars mentioned above brought nothing to the table and this is very sad. We can only hope that the next movie these stars are in do better and we can - without hesitation- say, ""hey, this was pretty good.""Did we care if Billy Taggart got redemption from being set-up by the Mayor? Sadly, no. Did we care that Taggart's girlfriend Natalie (Natalie Barrow) leaves him because he couldn't handle her role in a new movie she was in? Sadly, no. Did we care that all of this caused Billy Taggart to resume his drinking habits? Sadly, no. We didn't care about anything except to have this movie over with. The acting all around was good, but not so good that we cared about anything. This was just watchable. Bummer. Hey, we like these stars, but it just didn't work out.this time. (4/10)Violence: Yes.

54,tomsview,City fix-up,7,3 February 2014,"""Broken City"" is a smartly made thriller that crackles from start to finish.A tough New York cop, Billy Taggart, played by Mark Wahlberg, leaves the force under a cloud and becomes a private eye. When the mayor of New York, Nicholas Hostetler, played by Russell Crowe, asks him to follow his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to get evidence of her meetings with another man, Taggart finds himself drawn into a far more complex plot, eventually forcing him to confront past misdeeds. Faced with corruption at the highest level, he has to make a decision that could mean sacrificing himself for the sake of the city.The film has a similar vibe to ""State of Play""; Russell Crowe is in both movies. In ""State of Play"" he was the crusading reporter exposing corruption in high places. In ""Broken City"", he is the corruption in high places. In this case Wahlberg does the exposing and is aided by a perky female assistant (Alona Tal) – Crowe had a similar perky assistant in ""State of Play"" (Rachel McAdams).Although he is approaching 50, Crowe looks young to play the mayor, but he has some good lines in the movie, including this observation to Taggart, ""Here's the thing,"" he says, ""some uncomfortable evidence has come to light, if it should come out we will be f#*ked, and it is a necessity that we remain unf#*ked"".As with the most effective screen villains, Hostetler is urbane and witty, which contrasts with Taggart's gritty, rather humourless private eye – a man whose anger simmers just below the surface – they play off each other well, but Crowe definitely is a scene-stealer.Production values are high and there is only one minor car chase. Car chases in movies often rip through the plot holes in a story as much as they rip through the streets, but not here. ""Broken City"" has a strong story with an interesting subplot involving Taggart and his actor girlfriend, Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez).The politics in the film are pretty standard fare for this kind of film – corruption all round – but to describe the film as a political thriller seems to elevate it to something it isn't. I don't feel that ""Broken City"" pretends to deliver more than it does; it holds your attention while it is on, and is particularly well-made with performances to match.",Broken City
55,Troy_Campbell,The cast deserved better.,5,15 March 2013,"Three things become quickly apparent whilst viewing this run of the mill thriller: Mark Whalberg is in his comfort zone playing the reluctant and damaged hero, Russell Crowe obviously had a blast taking time off from 'serious' acting to play the Machiavellian politician here, and Barry Pepper unfortunately remains one of our generation's most underrated and underused actors. With a predictable and clichéd plot - Whalberg's emotionally wounded ex-cop is hired, then framed for murder, by Crowe's scheming New York Mayor - and Allen Hughes' uninspired direction from behind the camera, Broken City never reaches the heights it could, or should, have. In his first solo directorial effort (he's made 4 feature films with brother Albert), Hughes musters neither the style (From Hell, Book of Eli) or the grit (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents) of his previous work, instead his camera feels flat and his tone plodding. There are sporadic moments of excitement, but these are owed to the top notch cast doing their best despite the one-dimensionality of their characters. Crowe is a pure joy to watch as the gleefully despicable villain and Pepper imbues his opposition leader with intrigue, whilst in other roles there's Jeffrey Wright who keeps his police commissioner morally ambiguous to the very end and Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays the Mayor's seductive wife with aplomb. Alas, throw in the terminally dull climax and this is ultimately a disappointing movie with unfulfilled potential and broken promises, of which the cast deserved better.",Broken City
56,leftbanker-1,Intelligence-Insulting Piffle,1,5 May 2020,"And I don't really have that much intelligence to insult. Yet another film that was obviously written by someone who does nothing but watch movies, probably only really bad movies like this one. A powerful mayor with a hot wife hires a really lousy actor to investigate his wife's infidelity. The lousy actor, played by Mark Wahlberg, almost immediately takes photos that are very close to compromising, bit not really compromising. Why this was so easy to pull off isn't explained because lousy screen writers don't need tp explain anything.Had the lousy actor/private investigator not been able to produce the not-quite-compromising-but-oh-so-close-to-compromising photos (he had very little time to do this) the story would come apart, not that it holds together even with this incredible suspension of belief.I turned the movie off at a pivotal scene in which the lousy actor/private detective investigates and blows the whole thing open simply by looking in the trash and peeping in an open window.

The result is not that satisfying, with Russel Crowe being surprisingly not as convincing as the other lead actor Walberg (Billy's girlfriend, Natalie, is more beautiful than good at acting). There's a sense of bitterness throughout the movie, maybe due to the abuse of violence, but the rest lacks.

58,rupie,a liberal bedtime story,2,16 February 2014,"This movie is nothing more than a scaffolding on which to hand a tiresome collection of clichéd liberal nostrums. The characters, as well, are cardboard stereotypes. We know right from the first scene in the office of the mayor that he's going to be the bad guy. Why? Look how much he drinks, and see how tough-on-crime he is. We have the standard liberal line of ""developer as villain."" And then when the gay issue is injected it's clear the ""good guys"" will be gay. And how stunningly obvious, to the point of silliness, that the ""good"" mayoral candidate's name is ""Jack Valliant."" Puh-leeeez. The clincher to this view of the movie is the extended excerpt from the mayoral debate, which does absolutely zero to advance the plot. The whole point is to show us how the bad guy wants lower taxes, and the good guy wants to - wait for it - ""tax the rich."" I guess the viewer is not supposed to be paying attention because Valliant claims to want do this to close the budget deficit, when 30 seconds earlier it's been made clear the budget is in surplus. Details, details. Wahlberg and Crowe do their usual good jobs, and the suspense is fairly well maintained, but it's not enough to counter the liberal sermonizing and some pretty clumsy plot devices. I'm waiting for Hollywood to be really radical, and come up with a movie where the villain is gay, or a prochoice activist, or an environmentalist, and the hero is a Republican or a developer.

That's the already well known message here with zero of anything else to make this well-cast flop anything more than a limp, quite dull miss-hit. This has three actors who are more than capable to lead a film by themselves, yet this feels oddly directionless, uninteresting, and tepid. What also doesn't help is the fact that this isn't meaty enough to pass as a decent political crime drama, and its way too slow to be an action flick or a thriller. Mark Wahlberg looks a bit lost, Russell Crowe is in second gear, and Zeta-Jones's character could have been played by any actress.

61,bryank-04844,"Usually, the films that are released in January are sub-par, but 'Broken City' breaks that tradition. Highly recommended.",7,2 September 2015,"I was majorly impressed with Allen Hughes of the Hughes brothers 'Broken City'. I've seen a lot of political crime dramas before, but none like this. This particular story dives into the deep dark corners of politics and the police force in New York City at the end of a big mayoral election. I'm calling it now. Brian Tucker's debut screenplay deserves at least an Oscar nomination for next year. This multi layered drama and its intense characters made this film shine above the rest in its genre.We focus on the trail end of a mayoral election campaign between the incumbent Mayor Hostetler (Russel Crowe) and the new young and rich opponent Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), who both are trying to win the people of New York over housing and tax issues. However there are a lies, betrayals, murders, and other atrocious acts of violence and crime that riddle this complex story.We see the film through the eyes of Detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), who was forced to quit the police force by Mayor Hostetler several years ago due to a crime scene gone wrong. Now present day during the tail end of the new mayoral race, Taggart has opened a Private Investigative practice and works with his assistant Katy (Alona Tal). Business is very good for Taggart, though his clients haven't been paying him on time, and he is owed over $40k in completed work, or else he might have to shut down his practice. Much to his fortune, Mayor Hostetler calls Taggart and hires him to take pictures of his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta- Jones) and find out who she is having an affair with. Taggart accepts the job in that the Mayor has just given him more than what he is owed from all of his clients.From here on out, we are led into a dark territory that seems to fall under the noir category as we find clue after clue that adds another twist to the story and we find out it wasn't just an affair the mayor's wife was having. I've never seen a film where every character hates one another. Sure, Taggart and his assistant work well together, but there is not a scene that goes by with them together where she doesn't call him an ""asshole."" And we don't only get the relationships between politicians here, but each character has a family too, which all seem to have a high level of hatred and violence for one another.The script is very well done, with quick, smart dialogue that is fresh and new. Plus we get a glimpse of each characters strengths and weaknesses, which showcase just how well each character was thought out. Wahlberg did an amazing job, which I think might be his best work since 'Boogie Nights'. He shows what a tortured soul he is and how he wants to do good, even if it's his downfall. Truly remarkable. And Crowe's performance is perfectly played out as a charming and witty politician with a very sinister undertone. Plus his New York accent is very good and believable. Zeta-Jones' character probably has the most depth and mystery surrounding her. She plays it perfectly, never knowing what side she is on. Unfortunately, she receives little screen time, but when she's on, she's golden.If you're looking for an action crime movie, this probably isn't it, although it has a few very rough scenes with violence and a small car chase, but this film mostly relies on smart dialogue, two-faced characters, and surprises at every turn to keep you on the edge of your seat, which it does from start to finish. Usually, the films that are released in January are sub-par, but 'Broken City' breaks that tradition. Highly recommended.",Broken City

I like them both and found the storyline familiar enough; that also may be a point that irritates some of the negative ink. There are so few corruption, politics and former cops stories that haven't been told, played and written that to look for originality is a bit naïve.There really are few, none really, sympathetic characters in this story and this goes against many audiences' expectations. Viewers who watch more Euro productions are use to a lack of sympathetic characters in a movie; however that does not give this movie any such continental flavor.

A standard, run-of- the-mill political thriller about corrupt politicians and the private eye caught in the middle of it all, is elevated by the turns of Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe, but the script itself is bland and a little too on the nose for it to ever be believable or emotionally involving. When a character is flat-out telling you everything about their backstory, rather than letting you piece it together through visuals and subtext, that's when you know the script doesn't always work. Even still, there are good moments to be found here and there, but there's nothing about this movie that's any different than any similar movie ever released, and most of those do everything a lot better. Want my advice, watch Serpico or All the President's Men instead.I give Broken City a 6 out of 10!",Broken City

So many big names that were let down by a meandering script.I never felt bored watching this. I thought it would be one of those films on Netflix I'd watch for 10 minutes and then ditch in favour of something else. It wasn't. It somehow sucked me in. Wahlberg did enough to keep me engaged, while Crow did enough to keep me infuriated.Was nice to see Catherine Zeta Jones in something, though she was probably the weakest link out of the all-star cast. The film was entertaining and the twists kept things interesting. It just never felt very substantial somehow. As if it was just by-the-numbers, going through the motions until the end.I have seen far worse though and the big names should keep most viewers engaged until to the end.

65,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Not bad Wahlberg fare, a movie like a city, a little in ruin",7,26 March 2013,"Don't expect too much from this. The second half is better than the first, where the real story comes into play. Thank god we got strong leads for back up, though Crowe is the stronger acting heavyweight. Wahlberg, a cop who at the start, who looks more like a hobo, bushy hair and thick beard, fu..s up. shooting down a drug dealer/rapist, in the projects. He's put on trial, gets off, creating a lot on anger in the black folk, who protest his guilt outside. We cut seven years later, with Wahlberg, now a PI, chasing up a lot of clients, with overdue payments. He's called upon by the Mayor, Crowe, again blessed with his presence, as being commended by him, seven years ago, on that trial day. We know straight away, Wahlberg, is being played for the sucker as in a lot of other of his flicks. He's hired to trail Crowe's wife, (Catherine Zeta Jones) wasted here but always a pretty sight, who's believed to be bedding this campaign guy, but there's more to it. Wahlberg again, has a hottie for a girlfriend here, who's character is that of a poor hispanic girl, he saved, the night he shot that rapist. And now, get this, she has become a successful actress. Wahlberg attends a premiere of her first film, where her character in that is just the same as the one she plays in the film. What could that mean? He also gets the privilege of seeing her, half naked, get done from behind by the leading man, where after Wahlberg goes on an angry drinking binge, then takes it out there onto the streets. You don't see much screen time shared by Crowe and Wahlberg, my main reason, for seeing this. The first half of the movie, some scenes so ordinary had me at a bit of a worry. I did know all through it though, and even weeks before the movie, Crowe had a more elaborate plan, and Wahlberg, was gonna be played for the fool. But in films such as Shooter, etc, as Far as Wahlberg's concerned, we know what the eventful outcome's gonna be, where I wished Crowe's had a more dramatic or original one, other than the one that was in such predictable view, where this ending really sucked. But there's even another establishing scene after with Wahlberg in a bar, bracing himself, as about to go to court, once again, putting it all on the line, as going head to head with Crowe, which of course we don't have the pleasure of seeing the end result. Crowe's ulterior motive for the tail of this so called boyfriend, who's not who we first thought, I liked. When the real boyfriend ends up dead, we know of course, Crowe's had his boys do the dirty work, and now comes the real juicy bit of the movie. If you're a Wahlberg fan, Broken City isn't bad cinema, but he has done better. The film is smart in some parts, regards of the big holes in others, but it's not one of Wahlberg's best. Adequately entertaining political drama.",Broken City
66,Laakbaar,Political intrigue in the Big Apple,7,14 March 2013,"The IMDb score is a tad too low; the reviews too scathing. This is a pretty good movie about political intrigue in the Big Apple. I think the problem is that people have high expectations when the line-up includes Crowe, Wahlberg and Zeta-Jones.Crowe excels as Mayor Hostetler, the veteran sleaze ball politician. Crowe nails down the glibness, the breezy charm, the underlying prejudice and ruthlessness, even the hair. Crowe's range is astonishing, and it bothers me somewhat that Wahlberg gets higher billing. (But then Wahlberg is the producer.) Wahlberg is also good in this movie as ex-cop Billy Taggart. He delivers the combination of tough physicality, volatility and vulnerability we've come to expect from him. He carries this movie. Much of the time the camera is focused on him, and he pulls it off. This, not John Bennett, is the kind of role that suits Wahlberg.I thought Kyle Chandler also did a great job playing his role. I find he has a certain presence on screen. Unfortunately he always gets cast as the same kind of clean-cut guy. I hope he really gets to do a few juicy roles that might showcase his talent properly.The movie begins too slowly. Once it got going though, things got more interesting.Where this film disappoints is in its unclever and unsubtle plot. All this great acting talent, but nowhere to go. I couldn't buy into some of the premises. For example, could NYC have a mayor or police commissioner like this? Who says and does things like this? Surely media scrutiny would be too intense. The people behind this movie apparently believe that behind closed doors in this ""broken city"", politicians and senior civil servants are thugs, whereas the reality is that thugs never make it this far. I think some of the criticism directed at Crowe should perhaps be directed at the character he had to play. Is New York a ""broken city""? Also, for a while I couldn't quite see what was wrong exactly with the mayor's involvement in the Bolton Village, although clearly it was an issue. Yes, it became clear at one point (near the end), but by then I had lost interest in trying to figure it out.Still, it was an interesting enough film. You'll particularly enjoy this if you enjoy movies with a New York setting. You'll definitely enjoy it if you are a Mark Wahlberg fan.",Broken City

Even though he is acquitted, he is forced to leave the police force by the Mayor (Russell Crowe) due to some incriminating evidence provided to him by the Police Chief (Jeffrey Wright). They bury the evidence, and we cut to 7 years later. It is election time, and the Mayor calls upon Billy, now a private investigator, to follow his wife on suspicion of adultery. Billy takes the good paying job and finds out there is much, much more going on that he was led to believe. Corruption, dirty politics, and murder.This wasn't a great film, but it was well made and I found it to be entertaining. The actors each held their own well and kept the tension and intrigue levels high. This is a complicated script, so unless you pay close attention, it is easy to get lost along the way. There are a lot of names, subplots and secrets unveiled set against an election race - but in the end, it all makes sense and is satisfying in it's conclusion.I did enjoy this movie.

Seriously, who could be a better decadent mayor than Russel Crowe, street policeman than Mark Wahlberg and mischievous wife than Catherine-Zeta Jones? Yet, despite all that it has going for it falls short of any serious expectation as either police thriller or action movie.For starters, the key moments in the development of the story were far too easy. Nicking Zeta-Jones' mobile phone as if she were a naive youngster that led Wahlberg to discover who her connection were was too simplistic to be believable and towards the end, the unearthing of a document that sealed the corrupt mayor's fate again was obtained in a relatively effortless manner and thus the above instances spoiled the film for me.Furthermore, the bad guys though ruthless enough to kill a viable opponent did not make any provisions to try and silence Wahlberg and his assistant who were snooping around.A mission half accomplished.",Broken City

The movie also fails on the essential elements of a successful thriller that are the atmosphere, not enough marked, the tension, often missing, and the rhythm, too jerky.As for the cast, it seems interesting on paper but it is not enough exploited and turns out to be quite insipid, particularly Wahlberg, always so linear in his acting.",Broken City

Dull, contrived & 40 years late to the party.",2,14 March 2013,"To paraphrase Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe), there are some films you watch and some films you walk away from. This ain't the watching kind.Broken City is a forgettable film worth celebrating only because Russell Crowe, 'fresh' from Les Miserables, doesn't sing in it. It's not dreadful in a Movie 43 kind of way but don't confuse it with Broken, a vastly different and infinitely superior film.What's wrong with Broken City? It's dull. It plods along, reluctant to arrive and, when it does it, it looks and feels as though it should have done so thirty-odd years ago. Everything feels second hand and outdated. Russell Crowe sports a mullet only the cruelest of mothers would have inflicted on their child in the 70s, much of the incidental music could have been lifted and diluted from Stewart Copeland's score for The Equalizer and Catherine Zeta-Jones rehashes the same character she's played throughout her career.Unfortunately, we've come to expect ham from Crowe in recent years, but we expect more from Mark Wahlberg, the star power here. But he, too, has pulled an old character out of the wardrobe to dress himself in and it looks distinctly worn out since we saw it in Contraband.The dialogue is predictable, the plot even more so. Cop-turned private eye, Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) variously works for and crosses swords with the mayor, who just happens to be in an election campaign against Jack Valliant (Billy Pepper playing the supporting man with pained expression again) and is up to his neck in a dodgy deal worth millions to sell half the city. Taggart may not be whiter than snow (what cop is?), Mrs. Hosteleter (Zeta-Jones) is the bitch-vamp with attitude who despises her husband and Taggart's old boss, Fairbanks (Jeffery Wright), is probably up to at least his waist in something unpleasant.It started poorly but I hoped it might pick up. Unfortunately, screenwriter Brian Tucker (who, incidentally, has absolutely nothing else to his credit on IMDb! What does that say?) is unable to save it from drowning in its own juices. He shovels on information to helps us understand as though educating monkeys, but appears to have forgotten what he wrote on the previous pages. In one scene we watch an aide dump a rubbish bag filled with hush-hush city plans only for Taggart to find them; in the next we watch the same team hastily shredding evidence.There's probably some action and the odd smart quip, but to be honest I had more fun trying to plait my arm hair.I'd like to say my evening improved but I attempted to wash my brain out with a screening of Fire With Fire.Oh dear For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Broken City
71,RevRonster,The movie just coasts with no real momentum behind it.,4,25 April 2013,"""Broken City"" is about an ex-cop; Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), who gets off on a murder charge but is forced into the private, non-""bad boys"" themed sector of life. After several years pass, the man who was instrumental in his murder trial; Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe), calls on him to find out if his wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) is doing the nasty with another man. Soon, Taggart finds himself being framed for the murder of the campaign manager of Hostetler's political rival; Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) and is out to clear his name.﻿ To make this review simple and short, ""Broken City"" just couldn't keep my attention. While the story does have the makings for something that could be interesting (despite that the concept of a man in power framing and manipulating a man in desperation has been done in many ways over and over again) the film's execution of this archetype was flat. The story tended to drag with no real indication it was going anywhere and when it seemed like there was some sort of tension or thrilling aspects around the corner, the end was immediately behind it.﻿The cast seems uninspired by the film as all the performances are either given with a ""whatever, let's just get it over with"" mentality or just done with mediocrity in sight despite having a great cast that, beyond the inclusion of Crowe and Zeta Jones, also had Jeffrey Wright and Barry Pepper. However, I have to say the best performance in the film was Pepper and what his character of the rival political figure goes through was performed incredibly well. Even Wahlberg, an actor I usually only enjoy in comedies and nothing else the rest of the time, was fairly decent as Taggart. Overall, though, all the performances were ""by-the-numbers"" and didn't really showcase the talents of all the players within it. ﻿""Broken City"" could have been an interesting political/crime thriller that, even at its weakest, would have been worth at least a rental but the film feels like it's coasting at its every level for the entire running length of the film. The movie never does anything outright terrible but it really doesn't feel like it's trying at all either. This movie is the equivalent of my first job making sandwiches at a popular sandwich restaurant when I was in high school (for the sake of anonymity, I won't reveal its name but tell you that, while employed there, I was somewhat of a sandwich artist). I basically went through the motions, did the bare minimum that was required of me and never went beyond.

It's when a pivotal murder occurs that the film goes downhill, catapulting so many dull political maneuvers you'll forget why Taggart's there at all.Russell Crowe's crooked politician isn't seedy enough to despise, nor is he the type of louse you love to hate.

Streetwise New York police detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is brought up on charges for the killing of Mikey Tavarez (Luis Tolentino), rapist-murderer of 16-year old Yesenia Barea. As protesters picket the courthouse, oily Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) discusses the case with haughty police commissioner Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright). The two men are civil but are not really friendly. Hostetler defends Taggart against the police chief. As evidence incriminating Taggart has supposedly disappeared, the judge dismisses the case against him. The major praises but then fires Taggart because, as he says, there is a need to preclude the possibility of lost evidence being dug up and embarrassing the police department. Hostetler knows more than he lets on. Seven years later Taggart is a window-peeping private eye who lives with aspiring actress girlfriend Natalie (Natalia) Barrow (Natalie Martinez), the older sister of the dead Yesenia. Their relationship seems cool. Taggart's spunky office assistant is Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal), who obviously is in love with him. She seems to be a better match than Natalie. Hostetler, still mayor, summons Taggart for a meeting. Seems like the mayor's wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has been unfaithful, and Hostetler wants to hire Taggart for $50,000 to find out information of the lover. As the mayor is involved in a tight race with reform challenger councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), he cannot afford any negative publicity that finds its way into radio, TV, and newspapers. Taggart accepts, and receives the first $25,000. Helped by Katy, Taggart soon has the evidence: It appears that Mrs. Hostetler has been seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), Valliant's campaign manager!At a fundraiser for the mayor's campaign at the Roosevelt Hotel, Cathleen confronts Taggart and tells him that she knows he has been tailing her. She adds that Taggart is in much deeper than he realizes. The mayor then pays Taggart the balance of the money and says that the case is finished. Not long after, Andrews is found shot to death, and Valliant is despondent. When Taggart makes him talk in front of Commissioner Fairbanks, Valliant doesn't say much except that he was attracted to Andrews. Valliant is homosexual. After checking out the Bolton Village Housing Project (BVHP), Taggart meets with Cathleen who says that Andrews was really just a good friend who was going to provide her with incriminating information about the development; in turn Cathleen wanted the evidence to get a good divorce settlement from the mayor. What Hostetler originally wanted from Taggart was to discover Andrew's source of information. Taggart visits Sam Lancaster's business; Lancaster (Griffin Dunne) is a big financial supporter of the mayor. While he is snooping the premises and gathering some info about the BVHP, a shot is fired at him; this action is followed by the mandatory car chase, complete with wrecked vehicles. Taggart survives. It is soon revealed that the Rockaway Group (Lancaster's company) will evict the residents and demolish the Bolton Village, setting up a $4 billion building project. Todd later roughs up Todd Lancaster (James Ransone), Sam's son. Todd, who opposes his father, freely gives Taggart the signed contract that he had hidden. He was Andrews' friend and source. When Taggart confronts Mayor Hostetler in his office, he shows him the BVHP contract and demands his resignation. If not, he will reveal the corrupt city real estate deal with the mayor's $2 billion kickback for a new complex. But Hostetler has his own ammo: he produces a tape that incriminates Taggart for gunning down Tavarez. Who wins the standoff? Or will both share the same cell in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary?The director does have good actors in key roles, and even supporting ones, like Alona Tal. Crowe, cast against type, is good as usual. But most of the actors are not generally likable; and yet they are much better than the movie. The feature is sunk by plot holes, undeveloped story-line, and a worn script by Brian Tucker. So the kickback and tape were the big secrets? Aren't there mayoral term limits in NY? How come only Andrews was caught with the wife under surveillance but not Fairbanks? Anyway, the Mrs. Hostetler-Fairbanks affair just does not ring true. Would Taggart really team up with the smug Fairbanks who was against him in the first scene and who was involved with his removal from the police force? Would a man like Taggart really tear up $50,000 in checks, especially since his clients were not paying their bills? What was the undertone between the construction owner and his son (the Lancasters)? It is difficult to accept Mayor Hostetler having just one strongman enforcer do his dirty work and not an entire ring to shield him from incrimination.

It is fairly simple and straight forward (but, aren't most Film Noir movies made about 65 years ago like that?

The acting, direction, and writing were all done well. Even Katherine Zeta Jones, who I don't normally care for that much, was very good in her role. Mark Wahlberg doesn't necessarily set me on fire, but he did his usual solid, competent job. And Russell Crowe, who coincidentally I also am not too wild about, probably did the best job out of all of them in gleefully portraying his character.This film isn't exactly Oscar material, and it doesn't set any new standards for the Genre, nor is it's style particularly striking or stylish.

76,pfgpowell-1,"If you haven't seen this before in many other guises, you've been asleep for years",5,20 July 2017,"The puzzle is why Broken City was made at all. I understand that the script had been knocking around for years until someone had the quite possibly no-so-bright idea of filming it. But why exactly? The plot is one with which anyone who has watched films for the past 75 years will be fully familiar, and apart from the kind of fancy-schmanzy camera shots with recent technology allows, the film might well have been made from 1940 on. Was some kind of favour called in? Because I can't otherwise think why this was made.It's certainly not bad in any particular way, simply a tad redundant in an era when HBO, Amazon, Netflix and all the rest are producing 12/13-programme series whose length allows for more nuance, slower (and thus often more convincing) plot development and everything else more space and time allows.Broken City has all the names – Russell Crowe, Mark Wahlberg (who I always enjoy watching irrespective of how good or bad a film is), Jeffrey Wright (a highly versatile actor) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a part which is woefully underwritten – but little for them to do. The storyline is more than a tad confused and the 'crime' at the centre of it all – well, worse happens in my household pretty much every weekend, let alone New York.So there you have it: not bad, but not in any way distinguishable from many other films made over the past 75 years covering the same ground. It gets a 5, for that reason.",Broken City
77,LloydBayer,Mediocre,5,29 August 2013,"With the on-going awards season, it's not surprising to see last minute hopefuls vying for a lasting impression. Amongst the hordes, BROKEN CITY sticks out like a sore thumb, or in this case, a broken limb resulting from haphazard neglect. On the outside, first timer Brian Tucker's screenplay is a complex case of convoluted civic corruption carved into concentric circles. Like the excessive use of Cs in that last sentence, once you break it down, and you easily will, the inside is nothing but a paint-by-numbers picture that starts and ends at the same point. In other words, you don't go anywhere and neither does the plot. The only person running around is Mark Wahlberg's Billy Taggart, a former NYPD cop who just happens to be the apple in the mayor's eye; or so it seems. Seven years after a fatal mishap, Billy is a struggling private investigator who lands his first major case thanks to Mayor Nicholas Hostetler's (Russell Crowe) growing suspicion that his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) could be having an extramarital affair. Hostetler's lifestyle is enviable for a city Mayor but chances of a re-election are slipping through his own fingers. Standing in his way is his wife's suspected infidelity (which could be seen as a sign of weakness) and competition from ivy-league opponent Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). This is the cue for Taggart but what he finds makes him a target instead. Taggart must now choose between blowing the whistle on high level corruption or coming clean by airing out his own dirty laundry first. Last seen in the lukewarm crime thriller CONTRABAND, Mark Wahlberg returns to a role he has played over and over again. No problem there and it is always interesting to see Wahlberg play a blue-collared average Joe who finds himself knee-deep in a quick sinking predicament. You can also expect that his average Joe is an angry average Joe with that familiar 5 O'clock shadow. Even if you have seen Wahlberg play this role before, his Billy Taggart is the only character that has a relatable story to tell. On the other hand, Crowe's New York Mayor is way over the top with a high profile security detail and a stratospherically lavish lifestyle. There is a glimmer of that sly antagonism we last saw in BODY OF LIES, but his New Yorker swagger is as believable as a tsunami in the Australian Outback. Zeta-Jones plays her part, opulent as the mayor's wife but brooding with the sort of reluctant incumbency that never gets a proper explanation. Don't worry too much, if like me, you fail to find the story entertaining or meaningful. At its most redeeming level, BROKEN CITY attempts a social message to say that at some point, everyone falls off the wagon; that getting back up and realising where you fell is the measure of an individual walking the straight and the narrow. The problem with this message is in its weak and bland delivery. As such, don't be surprised if you find yourself wondering why you wasted your time watching this movie in the first place. Director Allen Hughes is not new to potboilers that talk of urban corrosion within the fabric of society. His past films, most notably MENACE II SOCIETY and BOOK OF ELI were strong narratives on preserving and professing society's most fragile values of truth and compassion. Sadly, BROKEN CITY suffers from multiple irreparable fractures that not even its award winning star cast can mend.",Broken City
78,in1984,Probably not intended for broken attention spans,7,24 March 2013,"I always find Wahlberg and Crowe to be overdone, but at least Crowe has a talent for picking out films with solid stories, so the film ends up overcoming the potential excess self-importance of the 2 of them.And how could you not like a film produced in part by ""1984 Private Defense Contractors""? Clearly inspired by Occupy Wall Street protests, the excessive police force used there and other broken cities like Oakland, and Trayvon Martin's murder, it's difficult to see at the start whether it's defending cops and Wall Street, taking a sympathetic approach, or playing Hollywood politics and avoiding commitment on anything for fear of lost ticket/disc sales. Fortunately, the film begins hinting which side of the luxury train tracks it's on about half way through where the film also picks up speed and continues to accelerate to the end.The only real problem, outside of a little too accelerated plot development in the opening 5 minutes, comes when it decides it wants to add speed through a car chase. As films like 12 Angry Men and Michael Clayton show, it's better not to force action and the films are classics for it.Had the writer and director worked in a subplot involving a movie maker filming it all to save all the good guys, it probably would have gotten an Oscar. As it is, filming and recording works against everyone involved and even the good guys aren't safe. That's one of the many complexities to enjoy.",Broken City

There's cringe inducing drunk acting from Wahlberg and his character dealing with a plot thread from some other movie about an actress in an indie film getting her break. But when the film focuses back on the story it's supposed to focus on, it's just a mess of broad characters and idiot plotting about corrupt city officials. After very little that happens, we are given a car chase that looks like it was the tacked on by another director at the behest of the studio after poor test screenings. It's an ineptly produced sequence that ends without a modicum of logic. Allen Hughes is capable of so much more than this. I hope this is just a hiccup in his career. This is not a fiasco by any means, but the script is D grade material and I have no idea why such talented people got involved with something that was probably written in crayon on a napkin in a bar.http://www.boxofficeflops.com/yearly-breakdowns/2013-2/broken-city/",Broken City

In 2012, he turned out films like The fun and thrilling Contraband and the hilarious Ted, but with Broken City, it seems like he's playing the typical tough, pretty boy with some of the most clichéd back-story I have ever heard. But it somehow fits in a movie like this. It seems very odd pairing him up with a big time, Oscar-winning actor like Russel Crowe. But they actually work together. If you couldn't tell from the trailer, you would know that Mark Whaleberg is the good guy and Russel Crowe is the bad guy.Billy Taggart(Mark Whaleberg) is stripped of his duties from the FBI Due to an incident whether he murdered someone due to self-defense or just straight-up murder. He is then appointed as a Private Investigator and is hired by the Mayor Nicholas Hostetler(Russel Crowe) who wants to find out if his wife(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair or not, all the while, Hostetler is trying to get re-elected.The plot is something we have seen before with all of the generic and predictable plot twists, but this film has the right actors playing the part of these characters. Mark Whaleberg is good as the tough, pretty guy, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is decent as the rich girl who can get anything she wants. But the standout performer is Russel Crowe as the two-faced Mayor. He gives out a tremendous performance however the only downfall is that this film runs 109 minutes and Crowe is only in the film for about 25 minutes. He disappears many times throughout the film and leaves you feeling a little cheated.Is Broken City worth your time and money. Yes and No. Yes because you will see great performances by the two lead actors and No because it just feels like all of the political thrillers out there. Even though I said this film was good I would just say either rent or buy this film when it comes out on DVD or Blu-Ray. It's Good Popcorn entertainment.",Broken City
81,trublu215,A flawed yet entertaining political thriller,3,30 April 2013,"Broken City is a political thriller that doesn't take itself as seriously as we hoped. While the plot is heavy handed but thoroughly enjoyable in it's first two acts. However, the film suffers from twist after twist that ultimately makes it harder to enjoy by the third act. The first act introduces us to Billy Taggart, a tough NYC cop with a dark and violent secret and New York City's charismatic yet corrupt mayor Nicholas Hullowitz. As the film continues on, Billy turns to be an ex-cop/ex-alcoholic living with his actress girlfriend in Brooklyn. Billy's new profession as a private detective finds himself embroiled in a web of political corruption and murder. While the film was marketed as the typical Mark Wahlberg action film, the film is anything but. There are only three scenes of violence, all of which are quite tame which allows the film to grow on a story front. But unfortunately, by the third act you'll be wishing for some kind of action but, instead, we're given a lackluster ending to a relatively entertaining political thriller. The film does remind us all of 2009's State of Play, which features Russell Crowe as well, it does not have the same energy let alone the stamina that that film offered.With that being said, the film isn't nearly as bad as the critics claimed it was and considering that this is a Janurary release, it's pretty damn good. Mark Wahlberg is his usual brooding smart ass character and will most likely be compared to his performance in The Departed. But, with that being said, he pulls off the character very well and makes the film very watchable as he is in virtually every scene. Russell Crowe relishes the hell out of his role and it becomes somewhat of an annoyance by the time his last scene rolls around. The real standout performances in this film exist in Jeffrey Wright and Barry Pepper, two brilliant character actors. Wright plays the NYC Police Chief, which is a character that you'll love to hate and Pepper plays a candidate for mayor, both of which make the film that much more enjoyable.Overall, the film does have it's flaws and it is nowhere near perfect but it will satisfy for a rental. With a lackluster third act, however, I don't know how well some people will respond to it. However, like I said, for a Janurary release, it's damn good.",Broken City
82,herbqedi,Slick but unsatisfying,5,22 October 2013,"I love a good film noir. Unfortunately, this wasn't it, but not for want of effort by the actors. Russel Crowe gives a richly textured performance as the Mayor and Catherine Zeta-Jones is electric in what she has - which is far too little. Jeffrey Wright quietly conveys a sense of strength and omniscience beyond anything obvious on the surface - a terrific performance> Barry Pepper is also quite interesting as Jack Valliant, the newcomer looking to unseat Crowe. Kyle Chandler is solid as usual as Valliant's Campaign Manager. All of these characters deserved more screen time. Unfortunately, we spend most of the film through Mark Wahlberg's character's eyes - the quintessential film noir antihero - the ex-cop, turned private eye. I like Wahlberg in most films, but here his character is too uneven, alternating behaviors between the viscerally stupid, the emotionally blind, but then turning clever enough to outwit Crowe out of nowhere. Direction is slick and visually impactful but not in synch with its plot. I found the Girl Friday unconvincing and found myself angry that we wasted so much time on a subplot with a girlfriend that went nowhere. On the other hand, Crowe has some brilliant scenes - especially with Pepper, with Zeta-Jones, with Wright, and with Wahlberg. There are some very witty comebacks and textured dialog that pulls no punches - so you could do worse than watch this if you have time on your hands. But, you could also do better.",Broken City
83,nesfilmreviews,"It's never outright boring, but it lacks an accumulative impact.",5,9 August 2013,"""Broken City"" quickly descends into a quicksand of clichés, and the results are meager and completely insubstantial. This is a story about power and its abuse in the city, and there are a countless amount of films that have covered this storyline already.Though it's runtime clocks in at a compact 109 minutes, it feels much longer than that. It's never outright boring, but it lacks an accumulative impact. Mark Wahlberg stars a Billy Taggart, a New York cop is forced to resign after a controversial shooting. But no worries, Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) has his back. He hires Billy, now a private investigator, to catch Mrs. Mayor (Catherine Zeta-Jones) screwing around. What seems like a simple adultery case opens a rat's nest of political corruption.The plot quite simply is little confusing. Several subplots wander off into oblivion never to return. It's occasionally hard to tell whether the Hughes brothers are winking at clichés, or merely adhering to the genre handbook. The script written by newcomer Brian Tucker is a bloody mess that has no sense of direction. Throughout the film, we're led to believe there will be some big ""reveal"" - a twist or secret that will cause us to gasp in shock. When it comes, it's so muted and unsurprising that it diminishes the film's climax.The characters are poorly drawn, but the performances are generally fine. In the right role, Mark Wahlberg can be a tremendous asset to any movie. Unfortunately, Billy is not the right role. Wahlberg is stiff and unconvincing and it quickly becomes apparent that the film would have benefited from someone with a more volcanic temperament in the lead. As his adversary, Russell Crowe brings a little more to the part, but this isn't the New Zealand-born actor's finest hour. Catherine Zeta-Jones, continuing her comeback from obscurity, does a fine job. Although well-made, altogether the end result is an unremarkable thriller. ""Broken City"" fails to impress, largely in part because there is nothing here we haven't seen before. That being said, ""Broken City"" isn't a terrible film, it's just not particularly memorable at all.",Broken City

I really went into the theatre today knowing nothing about it beyond the trailer, and yikes! I actually liked it.Now, in looking over the prior IMDb reviews, I see that I should be ashamed of myself for liking it. How dare I? I must be an idiot.The film is not art and there are numerous head-scratchers in it. (I still don't know what was going on in The Big Sleep, but that doesn't make it a bad film.) In these times, I think that any film that can keep a viewer involved if for no other reason than to find out what is going on--that's got something to be said for it. (I can give you a list of recent films where I didn't know what was going on and didn't care to know.) Gosh, there could have been more CGI car-chase scenes with crashes. Or there might have been more bullets-through-shattered-glass scenes. But I don't fault a mystery film for not being an action film.Catherine Z-J was terrific, as always, in a very underdeveloped role. Maybe there were scenes which were cut, and I guess we will have to wait for the DVD.Russell Crowe furnished the perfect antidote for his singing in Les Miserables. I thought he was great.Barry Pepper did a good job in a role so unlike the redneck psychos he usually plays. Jeffrey Wright was superb (as always) and one day he may get the recognition he deserves.If you approach this film as a mystery film, and not as an action thriller, I think you will like it. It's not a major must-see, but I think that if you are looking for something to rent from Redbox, your dollar twenty would be well-spent.",Broken City
85,loco_73,Menace II The City,6,9 February 2013,"When the Hughes brothers released their controversial but brilliant ode to 'hood life ""Menace II Society"", following the critical and commercial acclaim and success of John Singleton's ""Boyz In Tha 'Hood"", another American movie classic was born and a new generation of American movie makers made their way to the public's consciousness. Albert and Allen Hughes never really matched the promise they seemed to represent at the beginning of their career (as was the case with Singleton himself). They proved to be quite adept and able movie makers nonetheless, with various efforts such as ""Dead Presidents"", ""From Hell"" and ""The Book Of Eli"". Though they've produced and directed a few other projects, their movie output is sporadic at best and puts them into the category of movie makers like Terrence Malik, not in so far as content, but the frequency with which they direct movies.""Broken City"" is the first-time outing of Allen Hughes as a director on his own, without the collaboration of his brother Albert. Albert Hughes himself has his own forthcoming movie project titled ""Motor City"".As a first solo project ""Broken City"" is a non-too-shabby start for Allen Hughes. It is indeed a by-the-numbers thriller which mixes politics, intrigue, corruption and some action in a quite neat little package. Still, the movie was better than I expected. Aided by good direction, a simple yet substantial script and some notable performances, from the leads Russel Crowe and Mark Whalberg, as well as a seemingly refreshed Catherine Zeta-Jones (good to see her back at work), this was a good solid, although not mind-blowingly original, film.Though a bit too formulaic and predictable, ""Broken City"" has a few twists and turns which keep garnering the interest and attention of its audiences. All in all not a bad viewing at all!The only other movie that comes to mind when I was watching ""Broken City"", was ""City Hall"", with Al Pacino and John Cusack, though between them, ""City Hall"" comes out on top.",Broken City

One needs to pay very close attention to understand exactly what is happening, but it is always enthralling and fast-moving. There is a great car chase that is in keeping with all the other action this movie provides, with the last 15 minutes extremely suspenseful. Go see it, as it really needs the big screen to do it justice.",Broken City

88,Bob_the_Hobo,"Smarter than You Think, Not as Clever as You Hope",7,18 January 2013,"Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a New York city cop who got off on a technicality following his execution of a supposed rapist/murder. Discharged from the force by his Captain (Jeffrey Wright), Taggart is viewed highly by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for taking out the trash with a common thug. Seven years later, Hostetler, amidst a re- election battle against golden boy city councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), hires Taggart to find out who is sleeping with his gorgeous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As Taggart follows, he uncovers a much larger conspiracy. In his first solo outing, Allen Hughes (one half of the Hughes brothers that brought us ""The Book of Eli"") now offers a stylish, dark vision of corruption in New York. The ladies are beautiful and all have something to hide, the men are violent and vicious and the story is ripped out of countless true-to-life headlines. ""Broken City"" lives up to its name and fires a slug packed with intrigue and intelligence. That doesn't necessarily translate to mean ""clever"". The story sold in the trailer is a bit misleading, but perhaps that's the point. Mayor Hostetler's hiring of the true-blue cop Taggart is only a minor segment of a much larger puzzle. It involves cops, businessmen, and politicians in bribery and exploitation with a prize that all but Billy seem to seek: power. Overall that is the film's theme and it more than adequately conveys it. If you understand that and aren't looking for much else, ""Broken City"" is your ticket. As I was watching the film I kept thinking that there must have been some significant cutting and re-editing. Perhaps the original cut was too dry so they added in some scenes and cut some to make the film seem more edgy. But it doesn't seem as edgy as it could have been. A number of subplots (for instance Billy's actress girlfriend, or the undeveloped father-son relationship between two of the villains) go nowhere and remain unresolved when the screen goes black. I felt much the same way.Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job playing Mark Wahlberg, a role he was born to play. Catherine Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and commanding as ever in a role that is too short for the movie. But it is Russell Crowe who devours his scenes with the political intensity I would suppose is necessary for any real Mayor of New York. Even as the script built around Billy lags, Crowe tears apart his role. He shows why he is truly one of the best actors in the business. The supporting cast of this film are as much a draw as the leads. Jeffrey Wright, the usual supporting character with more power than he lets on, plays the secretive Police Commissioner. His character is introduced as a stock role but ends up being much more. Kyle Chandler has a small role that deserved to be expanded. Barry Pepper, who wasn't even featured in the trailer, is the only actor in the film with the same bravado as Crowe. His scenes, particularly one with Wright and Wahlberg, are indicative of why he should be the one on the poster, now buried in the bottom credits. Overall ""Broken City"" kept my attention but left me hungry for more. I suppose that is all you can ask for at the movies. I would take this ride again.",Broken City

90,albrechtcm,Another Broken City,5,29 May 2013,"They say The Glass Key was Mr. Hammett's favorite novel. Personally I've never particularly enjoyed stories about corrupt politicians who run cities, etc. Perhaps that's because there are already too many...and they're real. Broken City, to me, is like watching reruns of The Glass Key, Miller's Crossing, and a number of other films of this genre. Still, it was quite watchable. The cast was right on and Barry Pepper had a chance to show he can be more than just another Hollywood heavy. One of the most interesting and best directed parts of this film is the mayoral debate between Mr. Crowe and Mr. Pepper. Very well done indeed, and I'm sure it wasn't an easy task for either artist. If you like this genre, Broken City should be quite satisfying. But like a detective story, you pretty much know going in what is going to happen and how it's going to turn out — except in a detective story, you may not know for sure who the bad guy is until the end. Here, the bad guys make no pretense of being good guys. But nobody's perfect, not in real life and not in Broken City.",Broken City
91,Exiled_Universe,An OK film but mostly boring,6,13 May 2019,When i was going to watch this film i expected it to be an action film like jason bourne or john wick but sadly it wasn't but it still had some pretty cool fighting and chase scenes. i mean its not the TONE of the movie to be heavy in action but i felt like if it was to be an action film it could succeed at doing so but unfortunatly not. This film was still good and i dont not like it. I dont really have any problems with it other than what i have already described. I recommend watching it if your into investigation movies. The movie has somewhat of a light hearted comedic tone where characters dont really take things seriously but thats only in some parts. The first half of the film is based on affairs and sex with a brief graphic sex scene in the middle of the movie. However the second half completely ignores the first half and instead focuses on the mayor and who will be elected and the main character being double crossed by him.,Broken City

Give Me a Break!,2,5 January 2014,"Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a police officer in New York City, who resigns after being exonerated for shooting the man who raped his wife Natalie's (Natalie Martinez) sister. Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) admires the disgraced cop, and hires him to tail his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zita Jones) who the mayor suspects is having an affair. Billy follows Cathleen, gets some incriminating photos of Cathleen with a man named Paul Andrews, (Kyle Chandler) and gives them to Mayor Hostetler. Suddenly, Paul Andrews is dead, and the police commissioner, Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) is asking questions. Who is Paul Andrews, does his death affect Hostetler's re-election campaign against newcomer Jack Valliant? (Barry Pepper) I did not like Broken City at all. It's a run-of-the-mill drama, trying to be a crime drama, and a movie about political corruption, it fails on both counts. First of all, the story flashes forward 7 years and the mayor is running for re-election? What? Michael Bloomberg, the real mayor of New York ran for a third term, but only after getting the term limit law rescinded by the city council, and people hated Bloomberg for that. If the writer doesn't know about term limits, he should not be writing a movie about politics. There are too many subplots. Billy and the shooting, avenginghis sister-in-law's rape, Billy's drinking problem, Natalie's acting career, Natalie's nude scene and affair with the lead actor, all detract from the main plot. There is a plot twist, but the plot twist doesn't make the plot any more interesting.The acting is just so-so. Russell Crowe's monumental struggles with a New York accent eliminate any dramatic edge the role may have had. This is the second disappointing role I've seen him in after strong performances in Man of Steel and Les Miserables. His other woeful performance was in The Man With The Golden Fists. Wahlberg does a very workmanlike and boring reading of his role. Catherine Zita Jones showed some verve in her role, but it's far too small a role. Kyle Chandler, who's also very good in The Wolf Of Wall Street, has a few intense scenes in this movie, but again, it's a small role.The writing is atrocious, the term limits error is just sloppy and shows not even a basic understanding of politics, a cop accused of killing a kid in cold blood would never be tried by a judge, that strains credulity, and what kind of character name is Jack Valliant? That sounds like the alter-ego for a superhero, not a politician.For reviews that help you avoid broken movies, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Broken City

Sure the script is a little slow in parts and there are some holes in the plot. But you can't worry too much about plot holes in this kind of movie anyway. The fun is finding out ""whodunit"" and seeing the bad guys get their due. The ending is a nice touch, by the way. If you like old-fashioned crime dramas, Broken City is good escapism.

But when forced to pick sides I go with conservatives, anyways this stupid film had the audacity of making the Crowe character into a total republican thus heres the subliminal message for you moron movie goers, republicans are greedy and liberals are always pure and noble socialists who just want to abuse those very rich snobs. Of course we all know how that really goes, they say they'll tax just the super rich and me a guy who makes 1600 a month working at a grocery store gets hammered with that 2 percent payroll tax, thanks liberals, jerks.So anyways I went to see this at my discount theater today, and it was discount day at the discount theater which means I paid $1.50 to see this turd of a movie. I thought hey even if its bad its got Russell Crowe and he usually doesn't star in garbage, well so much for that. This was just bad all around.It was a plot you could see coming a mile away, Wahlberg at the start of the movie guns down a black kid for raping his girlfriends sister. It was murder but he got off because he's a cop. Anyways so later Crowe the corrupt and of course very republican Mayor needs a favor and calls in the dependable Wahlberg to use his super rare skills of taking pictures of people having affairs.Heres where it gets stupid, Crowe with all his mayor connections has to call in two bit hood Wahlberg to track his wife. Sure makes sense.So Wahlberg does his job but then the guy he was spying on ends up dead, turns out it wasn't an affair but Crowe's wife leaking information to an aide to the opponent.Wahlberg feels bad, and yea you can figure out how the rest of this movie goes. I mean its bad enough the plot sucked but they gotta throw in their little high and mighty we are Hollywood and thus we understand politics better than you so be sure to notice how Crowe is a republican and his adversary is a liberal.From a purely cinematic view point, all political frustrations aside this film fails because you never for a minute care for any of the characters. Whats so great or interesting about Wahlberg's guy, seems to be an emotionless jerk. As for Crowe he's not a good enough villain because you never think for a moment he could outsmart anyone so you know how the film will conclude. And Catherine Zeta Jones, why was she even in this movie? Can she just not get good parts now, it was a nothing role and she did nothing with it. I might have to remember to miss the next couple of generic Wahlberg films that come out. They are usually bad but you can still watch em, this one was a new low of dullness.",Broken City

He is the Mayor of New York, a wheeler dealer, media savvy, into bed with big business and real estate (sounds like one of our politicians, doesn't he) and is not afraid to using a bit of brawn or blackmail when he gets a chance.Mark Wahlberg is tough as nails cop turned private detective. The kind of guy though, who'll quit alcohol for seven years to please his wife (Natalie Martinez). Or the kind who'll let his clients run up a tab of $42,000 almost making him broke, kept afloat only by the diligent efforts of his devoted secretary (Alona Tal). He'd left the force under a bit of a cloud, the full story behind that being revealed later. But now, seven years after he'd left the police, he gets a call from the Mayor's office.The mayor, right in the thick of a neck & neck re-election campaign, wants Wahlberg to check on his wife, Zeta-Jones, whom he suspects of adultery. And is willing to pay extra.The film is a slow, gripping portrayal of politics, love, betrayal and the lust for power. Of murder, shady real-estate deals, adultery and blackmail. The calm, collected Wahlberg is a fine balance to Crowe's physicality and restless energy. Add Catherine Zeta-Jones' smouldering presence and barely concealed antipathy for her husband. A rival, Barry Pepper, who is determined to be mayor. A police commissioner, Jeffrey Wright, who doesn't get along at all with the Crowe. And you have a film that unravels slowly but surely, the whole picture never revealed till right at the end. What I like about this film is that everyone here has shades of grey, no one is black or white. Probably, the world today is such a place it wouldn't allow anyone pure to truly exist.

In development hell for years, it should at the very least have undergone a major rewrite to simplify the story (which wanders all over the place and becomes dumber by the minute) and raised the tone up out of the gutter. Whichever studio execs placed this on the Black List need to stop sniggering over the dirty words and earn their money by figuring out just what constitutes a good script. Wahlberg is always a pleasure to spend time with but the phoniness of so many of the scenes and the clunkiest car chase ever defeat even his efforts to entertain. So much of this movie is predictable and so many scenes are actors simply going through their paces with inferior material. The gorgeous, gorgeous Catherine Zeta Jones is totally wasted in this piece of dreck. Somewhere in this movie there may originally have been a good idea about corruption in the city.

101,MacTheMovieguy,"Competent, but bland.",5,23 July 2014,"Mark Wahlberg has been making some really good choices recently in terms of films. The Fighter, for example, stands out as a great choice for him. Russell Crowe, well, he was in Les Miserables which did well despite his singing. Somehow, these two read the script for the painfully boring Broken City and decided this was the film they wanted to make.In what would normally be wrapped up in an hour on Law and Order, Wahlberg plays Billy Taggart, an ex-cop turned Private Eye who is hired by the mayor (Russell Crowe) to spy on his cheating wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Only, Wahlberg isn't any ex-cop, he has a sketchy background where he may-or-may-not have executed someone in cold blood. And the wife? Well, she may-or-may-not be cheating on the mayor with someone (Kyle Chandler) from his opponent's (Barry Pepper) campaign. Of course, this is on of those films where nothing is as it seems, but everything is exactly as it seems, and you see everything coming a mile away. This is a redemption story for Billy, above all else.Again, this plot could have been wrapped up in one episode with Law and Order. The almost two hour runtime feels needlessly unnecessary, as you find Wahlberg over investigating a plot that was obvious to you thirty minutes ago. He comes across as the least competent detective in New York, and Crowe seems to be sleepwalking through his role as the mayor, mainly because he has very little to do except play the obvious villain. Zeta Jones doesn't offer much as the wife, and she honestly seems a little 'big' for her part, considering how little she's on screen. The direction from Allen Hughes, who has offered us more in the past (Menace II Society) just seems like an average TV director on an episode of NCIS. Competent, but bland.This isn't anything new, it doesn't bring anything exciting to the table or the genre. This 'Broken City' seems like every other city you've seen before, except this detective could benefit from knowing he was in a movie.

I saw some negative reviews saying they didn't get it, etc. Well, maybe they should watch again or maybe they just need movies with more fillers. To me it was just right and all held together in the end. What I don't get is how this great movie got no play at all. Guess the only part of the movie that let down was the PR department big time. If you like movies involving detective, urban issues, who-dune-it, corruption revealed, plus great acting -- make sure and check this movie out. ((I only gave it an 8 rather than a 9 or 10 because, somehow, well, it was a detective, urban issue, who-dune-it movie, but one of the best done in recent times.)",Broken City

It's a solid film in the crime thriller genre some say it sucked and was all over the place not me I thought it was acted well for what the script was. Crowe did great so did wahlberg. Definitely worth a watch the Hughes brothers make some great films just bcuz of this it's worth the time. Not their best movie but not bad at all.

I never get the vibe of believing any of these characters are real like I did in the movie The Departed.I can tell you the storyline but then again, do I really want to waste my time? Watch one of the hundreds of cop/detective shows on TV and you've seen this one before.The script is simultaneously too complicated and clearly defined, and none of it is really that interesting or unique.Wahlberg always seems sort of startled and one step behind and his acting seems like acting. Crowe is crude behind his lame attempt at a NY accent (Casting Directors can't find acting talent in New York City for these roles? Aussie go home!)Zeta-Jones, although being married to Michael Douglas, is again underused as a supporting actress.Every actor/actress in this movie has made and will make better movies.I give 5 stars for the money and effort to make this a good one.

107,manusanchez90,Excellent intriguing movie!,8,11 April 2013,"I do not understand why ""Broken city"" was not more successful at the box-office. I guess it was due to marketing and other types of reasons. I did not know or read the book on which it is based. It is clear that one of this movie's strength is the cast composed by Catherine Z-Jones, Russel Crowe, Mark Wahlberg (he plays the leading role and character) among others. The movie takes place in New York, like many many others. In my opinion, Russell Crowe's performance is the best in the movie and one of his best in his own career. He plays the part of a mysterious and sly mayor of N. Y. Catherine Z-Jones delivers a solid performance as the mayor's allegedly unfaithful wive. Mark Walhberg is in the movie an ex-cop working as a private detective for a living. He really struggles because many clients refuse to pay him. As an ex-cop, he has a dark past. The plot is full of surprise and twists that, thanks to the cast and solid performances and right lenght, keeps us amused. I must not forget Jeffrey Wright, who has done a very good job, as well as in the two Bond movies in which he has worked. The director Allen Hughes, who directer ""The book of Eli"" and ""From Hell"" years ago, was very lucky to receive these three screenplays, however he has got talent and knows how to handle thrillers and mystery. The movie has some good and realistic action scenes in which Mark lets us know that he is ready for almost every kind movies: pure action, mystery, comedy, drama, etc. The problem with this movie is that its script is not totally solid: there are some small plot holes, but do not worry, anyone who likes mystery thrillers will surely enjoy this one. Obviously, the cast, Russel Crowe's acting, the twists and the action are the best in this movie. 8",Broken City

While the main plot holds it's own, the various sub plots were to me the most memorable. I am a bit of a Mark Walhberg fan, finding his performances to be very believable. He doesn't disappoint here either, his reactions to seeing his girlfriend's movie premiere are so perfectly delivered, and the writing for this sub plot has all the natural course of events spot on. From initial uncomfortableness , to eventual uncontrollable outbursts, it's all so natural and believable. Russel Crowe also delivers as usual, well cast as the mayor. Catherine Zeta Jones and a bunch of relatively unknowns, all put on great performances, nobody felt out of place.Another thing I found refreshing was how when the plot twist came, I didn't feel attached to the original mission, and was able to get on board with the new direction the movie took. Good likable heroes, making tough choices for the right reasons. The movie finished with a good message about morality and making the right choices in the face of self sacrifice.",Broken City

It did though! The script was dreadful, the storyline was completely confusing and the audience was left wondering what was really going on. You cannot fault Crowe and Wahlberg as they did the best with what they were given, but with weak direction, little character development and a total lack of clarity this train never left the station.If you skip this motion picture, you are not missing much.",Broken City
111,mynameisibrahim,Broken City Review,4,16 March 2013,"Allen Hughes began film making at the tender age of twelve. However, based on his latest offering, Broken City, he may still have to grow older and wiser to make a telling contribution in earnest.Hughes has an embarrassment of riches at his disposal in the form of Oscar winners Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the formidable Mark Wahlberg, also an Oscar nominee. Therefore, it is contrition that such refined acting talent goes to waste owing to his erratic direction.Broken City recounts a tale of politics and deception. Wahlberg essays the role of Billy Taggart, a disgraced former New York police officer given a new lease of life as a private investigator by Mayor Hostetler, played by Russell Crowe. The narrative follows Wahlberg's latest assignment: the precarious task of following the Mayor's wife, played by Zeta-Jones, who is suspected of having an extramarital affair. Subsequently, Wahlberg's character is embroiled in a contentious web of manipulation.Despite the aforementioned abundance of adept actors, Hughes is undone primarily by a convoluted and insipid plot. At first glance, Broken City has all the elements of a refined political thriller. Unfortunately, any such outcome fails to materialise. Zeta-Jones in particular is relegated to the sideline of the script. Furthermore, Hughes' treatment of the female characters delineates a certain misogynistic perspective as well. While Zeta-Jones' character is subject to a potential scandal, another scene involving Wahlberg's love interest is enough to make the viewer writhe in agony.The director fails miserably to capitalise on a riveting foundation provided by a solid plot and stellar cast. Instead of presenting sensational twists and turns, Broken City treads a predictable path, lacking any captivating moments in the process. The film also bears a striking resemblance to State of Play, an investigative drama also starring Russell Crowe.Moreover, the film does not represent the gritty and hard hitting political thriller it was set out to be. It may be a thriller by definition but it does not ensure any such stimulating experience for the audience. For example, a specific scene where the final Mayoral debate is held, we are bereft of any palpable pressure which one could associate with such high profile events.Blame must be apportioned to Hughes for such a debilitated attempt. The lead actors are also guilty of delivering sub-par performances. For instance, Crowe plays the epitome of an archetypal politician: machiavellian and shrewd. However, he does not invoke any aversion or contempt from the spectator.Additionally, Broken City is devoid of an adequate pacing, thus lacking any flair or flourish. The only saving grace is Alona Tal, Wahlberg's enthusiastic assistant. Regrettably, her scenes are transient. The cinematographer is worthy of acclaim as well since the film's aesthetic is one of the few aspects working in its favour. He deftly highlights the prominent skyscrapers of Manhattan.It is difficult to comprehend that Broken City was lauded by many as one of the best delayed projects in the aftermath of the 2007/2008 Writers' Strike. Such an assessment is incomprehensible, since the writing is considerably lacklustre and the direction is limp. Above all else, it embodies a missed opportunity to construct a superior film.",Broken City
112,ganeshsubramanian,A corrupt and divisive city that is indeed broken!,6,18 January 2013,"Wahlberg, Crowe and Zeta-Jones star in this murky political drama that gives us more than a fair glimpse on a corrupt and divisive city that is broken and far beyond repair. Wahlberg presents a subdued portrayal of Billy Taggert who has moved out of the police force (owing to the presence of an incriminating evidence against him in a controversial shooting incident) and is out living as a Private Investigator. New York Mayor Nick hires him for a private job that Billy is willing to lap up for the need of money. That's where all the criss-cross starts and Billy gets entangled in more than one quirky place &/ person from there on.Wahlberg has portrayed his character well although nothing much could be done in terms of his character development owing to the presence of a lot of key players in the story. His side-show romance with the PuertoRican girl is a totally wasted time of the plot line. Crowe, as the corrupt and mean New York Mayor has given a fine performance (minus the typical NY accent, which was missing!). Zeta-Jones stars as his rather shady wife who has her own motives. She has done well with the limited scope of her character in the story. Wright gives a fine performance as the NY Police Commissioner whose ambitions run deep than the NY Subway trains.Overall, Director Hughes has presented a story with key players having done well. It seems to me that the Director chose a very limited plot with such a varied skill-set of actors to begin with. That is a big drawback. Cinematography is good and so is Editing. I would say that if you have nothing else useful to do on a fine Saturday morning, please watch this one. It would definitely keep you engrossed, at least for a while, before you might lose interest. However, I did not.My rating would be a 6 out of 10. Regards, Ganesh.",Broken City
113,tj0331,A shockingly good film!,9,19 June 2013,"Time to square the debt-Billy Taggart. That line is sticking with me. I went in watching this movie expecting something solid and it went well beyond. Anything done by a Hughes brother is usually amazing. I was not sure how well they would work apart, but this was a knock out of the park for Allen! The level of expertise and professionalism was 10 out of 10. Acting is superb which is needed for drama and usually not carried out properly, but I never felt pulled out of the film by any acting or plot turns. Without giving anything away I do want to say I thought I had the film figured out and realized it was only half way through which let me know I had barely figured anything out. The tailspin of events that wrap up the story were borderline perfect. It has the grit of the action movies my father watched with me as a kid but it also has this layer of a complex drama. It is a strange mix that works in wondrous ways. This might be on my shelf of favorites for a while if not for good.",Broken City

Perhaps the original screenplay had more promise. Perhaps they had a intriguing mood board. Perhaps they never showed the script.Either way, this movie is a complete mess. It lacks a plot. A sense of direction. Like a rowboat without oars, it drifts without any sense of course or plan.

One issue I always have with him is that Wahlberg mumbles his lines. He is frequently unintelligible. Another problem with the movie is C-bonics. The ""writers"" of a number of his movies, though not unique to him, are obviously not familiar with the rules of English. Anyone can call himself a writer or an author these days. You will frequently hear - ""between you and I"" - in the dialogue. Why no editor or even a minimally educated person picks this up is beyond me.

For the most part it was an entertaining movie that had predictable portions, but Wahlberg does these type of predictable movies, but it is still entertaining. A night out with a loved one, popcorn and a soda watching a movie that at least keeps you entertained, what more do you need? The car chase was done in the new Hollywood style like your in the car and the camera is getting bounced around like it was you in the car, I am not a fan of this style that is showing up more and more. It is hard to get focused when the picture is jumping around so much. This was not done in a style to receive possible Oscar nominations, but it was certainly an entertaining movie that keeps you involved and not falling asleep, and that is what movies are supposed to be, right?

One of my favorite scenes typifies the film's sensibility. It the has the Mayor's wife- complete with bodyguard and limo- conducting a secret rendezvous on a riverfront promenade... disguised by a scarf and BIG sunglasses on a gray overcast day.The worse news is that some really competent, if not gifted, actors waste their time here. Whatever money they were paid was not worth the waits.And the worst news is that according to IMDb, Tucker has another script in pre-production.

119,damh_frikinlater,What a flaw in the narrative can make to a thriller,7,31 January 2013,"An interesting story, with excellent cast but, with a small and significant flaw in the narrative.Detective Billy Taggart (Marc Wahlberg), is accused of killing a man but, it is set free when the judge can't find enough evidence to put on the trial. The evidence however, is in the hands of the Mayor Nick Hostetler (Russell Crowe), who decide to keep it to himself because the victim was after all, a criminal who deserve to die. The case does cost Tagger his badge so seven years later he's working as a private detective when the Mayor calls him for a job. During his own investigation Billy learns that in politics nothing is what it's seems.The best of the film is its characters, both in the script and on screen. They are 100% humans with flaws and good qualities. The protagonist isn't good or bad; he is a man who has done bad things and has to live with it. So he is not a hero and the only reason why is he on such a big trouble is because at some point the thing became personal to him. But that's how we all are, we decide not the get into the mud except when is our own. Wahlberg does a good job by portraying this man, he have this ""not so bad"" look that makes him perfect for the job. It is not his most acclaimed job, but isn't worse than The Happening.The one with the great character is Russell Crowe. For some reason the bad guy is always attractive to the audience (in terms of acting). He is a real politician. This is a guy that can say his crime to the press and even so people go and vote for him. Crowe best moment in this film is during the final debate for the mayoralty, he got everything a politician would dream about. He dominates the art of change things to make you look like a hero or the victim.The story on its own is below the acting, but doesn't mean that is bad. Brian Tucker is a first timer as a screenwriter and he had some good ideas for this thriller. Its big, complicated, and it get worse when we consider that the movie takes place during election time, and of course, is not boring. The elements of surprise and good twist are there, but the problem is that he never uses it. I'll have to say that the one who makes that mistake is not the writer but the director.Allen Hughes is not a first timer. He directed movies like The Book of Eli, so he is no amateur. The way that Hughes decided to narrate this story makes it lose its surprise elements and twist. The film doesn't have suspense or big twist on the story. The reason is because we, as an audience, know everything is happening all the time. Some people believe that a writer shouldn't keep secrets to the audience. If the main character knows, the audiences have to know. The problem with that is that sometimes the big twist is what the protagonist is hiding.But for this movie in particularly the real problem was that the protagonist (Billy), know from the beginning that he is a free man because the Mayor wants to. So, why is he surprise of what happened in the end? Doesn't make sense in the story and destroys the final big twist of the movie. The greatest flaw in this film is that reveals everything too soon and the suspense is not there. And a Thriller without suspense is not so interesting anymore.I have to say it is not that bad. Is entertaining, has good acting, and is a good story. Not a perfect movie or the top of the careers of Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe, but is enjoyable.",Broken City

They were all jerks.And then there was the disappearing Natalie, who we all thought would be a central character in the movie. Why was she even there? Russell Crow gave a performance which was for the birds. Has Mark Wahlberg ever thought of starting a music career? He certainly is not a convincing tough guy. The only dramatic question in this movie was who would fall asleep first, me in the theater or the actors on the screen.And then there was the mayoral debate between the drunkard and the jackass. This debate was worthy of a contest for grade school class president. Who wrote that scene, anyway? On second thought, I don't want to know.Save your $, fans.

122,jakburton76,Broken Movie,6,10 May 2013,"5.5 is my actual score for this movie.It was a bit of a mess from start to finish, in fact if it hadn't have been for the main actors and director of whom I am a fan it would probably have been given it a lot lower score. It tries its best to be something its not, a lot of different plots from various other movies rolled into one and coming out the other end as a farce and jumbled mess. Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe try their best with what they have but its not enough unfortunately, and if your waiting for a grand finale forget it. I would probably say rent this and give it a watch but don't buy it.The plot is basically a corrupt Mayor Hostetler(Crowe) manages to have a hold over Billy Taggart(Wahlberg) after a shooting incident which forces him to leave the police force, years later after Billy Taggart has became a private eye the Mayor asks for his help to spy on his with whom he assumes is having an affair. Anyway Billy finds out she has been meeting up with Kyle Chandler(Andrews) who is Jack Valliant's(Pepper) right hand man who is also running for Mayor. Hostetler finds this out after Billy reluctantly hands over photographs and has Kyle shot and killed. Billy fears he has been setup and confronts Hostetler and threatens to spill the beans on the Mayors whole corrupt operation after getting his hands on an important incriminating piece of evidence from Valliant. And there the movie is setup for the grand finale so I wont spoil the movie completely for you, I'll let you watch and decide for yourself.",Broken City

This movie has some terrific actors: Jeffrey Wright (Wow!), Crowe, Zeta-Jones and Barry Pepper. They all give good performances here. The only problem is that the story-line unfolds too slowly and is a bit predictable.But, what's up with Russell Crowe's grammar? Did Brian Tucker actually write the script with poor English usage or did Crowe ad lib the bad grammar? If the latter, why does Crowe think that a NYC mayor would talk that way? His use of pronouns made me cringe.",Broken City

But if you haven't watched it yet, don't do it, you are not missing anything.The script is beyond predictable and simple, as well as the plot. One of the primary themes of this movie is deception. The detective is fooled once by the mayor. Then the detective tries to get his vengeance, but he looses again. In the end, the smartest is in fact the mayor, Crowe. The detective has to sacrifice himself to bring him down.He doesn't bring down the bad guy out of cleverness and cunning as he should, he fails. Whalberg plays the anti-detective and the movie attempts to portray him as a hero.All in all, there's wasted talent in light of this low-quality script. I give the movie four stars because the acting was not bad, Crowe's and Whalberg's appeal is one of the only elements of the movie that stops you from walking out of the cinema.",Broken City

New York City Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) hires Taggart to tail his wife, Cathleen Hostetler (the Beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. Needless to say, the Mayor believes his wife is bedding another man - aka cheating. Or is there a bit more to the quest? Along the way, Taggart uncovers a big-money, web of conspiracy involving corruption.I liked Broken City movie because we don't know who did what and how many people did what to whom. In other words, while we're on edge waiting for the resolution, more perpetrators enter the game and as they say, ""the plot thickens."" An excellent performance by Russell Crowe; and a good showing from Wahlberg too. Zeta-Jones always shines through. I'm a fan of Alona Tal.The unanswered questions expanded until the very end when resolution arrived. All in, Much More Suspenseful than I expected.I did Not like the several times Carl Fairbanks, Police Commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) said ""It's complicated"" when asked who's involved by Taggert. Aren't most things complicated? Surely the writers could do better than that. A few times, the dialog was muffled, but then maybe it was the theater's sound system or my hearing.I also liked Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal) who plays Taggert's officemate and close friend and confidante. It wasn't clear to me the nature of their relationship - lovers, family members, friends or merely coworkers. Maybe I missed the connection. I wish the writers would have developed her character more. I first met Tal in the hit TV series ""Leverage"" (Timothy Hutton, Gina Bellman) where she played Kaye Lynn Gold, country music singer, in The Studio Job (2010). I hope we see more of Tal. Wish Leverage didn't end at the end of Season 5.See Broken City; You'll enjoy it! Arthur VanDam, film critic and author",Broken City

127,phil1945,"Bright stars, bleak result.",6,18 August 2013,"Sometimes, the stars of the movie initially blind the viewers to the overall quality of the film. Broken City is that movie. The star-studded cast is what will draw in the viewers originally, but without much substance, this movie is just that, a forgettable film with grade A Hollywood personnel.The plot of the movie is all too familiar and uninteresting. A down-on-his-luck police officer turned private eye, finds himself among corrupt politicians, conspiracies, betrayal, and pursuit of power and money at any cost. The twists of this movie are too little and too late. They are not interesting or surprising enough to mention, and are introduced at the very end, long after any sensible person has lost any interest in the movie.This movie is like an expensive, luxurious car, that handles poorly, eats too much gas, and has constant electronic problems. It's impressive on paper, yet disappointing on the road.It is quite obvious that the movie relied heavily on its cast, but failed on too many fronts to be considered interesting or memorable. The stars of the movie; Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Mark Wahlberg, along with numerous supporting actors and actresses, do a fine job portraying their characters. However, their characters are uncomfortably generic and one dimensional, and there is only so much a good actor can do with a flat character.For my taste, the movie had a few too many; ""what was the point of that scene?"" and ""is this going anywhere?"" moments.This movie is not without its positives though. The thespian ensemble, along with high quality production value, makes this movie watchable. The dialog through most of the movie is pretty good. The spirit of New York and New Yorkers is portrayed well in my opinion, and makes one wish to be a part of it. In conclusion, this movie fails to impress, surprise, or stand on its own, becoming one of many anticipated, yet, disappointing productions. Having said all that, this movie is an alright DVD watch, as long as your expectations are grounded.",Broken City

Oscars are (or should be) should be reserved for story lines that haven't been done a million times before, but all in all, Broken City was entertaining enough.The cast, including all the supporting roles, was solid. Wahlberg's had cliché back story he had to try to recreate, and did a good job at making me feel like I haven't seen this exact same story before. Russell Crowe was predictably a BAMF. What I was impressed with was the music, scenery, and dialogue. The director did a fine job at keeping the movie on track, and forward. The lighting keeps the viewer in suspense, and frequent throughout the movies are scenes in classy and low lit bars, dreary alleys, and dangerous overlooks. Broken City was a movie that understood its direction, and intention. It did not try to be anything more or anything less. For what the movie was going for, which was a story as old as Hollywood, it did a fine job at having a classic feel with a modern ambiance. Don't watch this if you're looking to be blown away by something new...or do, and be disappointed.

As always, he performs excellently, as do all the rest of the cast. However, the storyline of the film isn't great and it can be hard to comprehend at times throughout. The reason for this is because it can be a bit jumpy going from one thing to another and not really making an awful lot of sense to the audience as well. There were no moments in the film that had me on the edge of my seat or shouting at the TV, which instantly tell me it was in no way thrilling or exciting.

It is a solid noir with plenty of atmosphere, good acting and a plot that keeps you hooked.As always with IMDb.com, if a film shows even a morsel of intelligence it gets hammered in the user reviews.Sure, we can all love a dumb movie, but even a junk addict needs something to get the mind engaged from time to time.It is not as if this is way out left-field, it is a traditional thriller which the average person can enjoy.I really worry they will stop making films like this if no one appreciates them.",Broken City
132,cay_t,Script could be better,5,14 January 2016,"This is a movie that is much less than the sum of its parts. Good cast, good director, both completely undermined by a Godawful script. I sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better, even though it revealed its awfulness within the first ten or fifteen minutes, but no such luck ... it just descended into further levels of horrible until it finally fizzled out with a whimper.Seven years later, Billy is a private detective that lives his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez), who is an aspirant actress and the sister of Mikey's victim. His secretary Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal) is trying to collect part of the debts to save their business. In the week of the elections, Hostetler summons Billy and offers US$ 50,000 to investigate his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that he believes is having a love affair. Billy discovers that Cathleen is meeting Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), who is the coordinator of the campaign of Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), the opponent of Hostetler and favorite in the election. When Paul is found dead on the street, Billy finds that he had been double-crossed by Hostetler and he decides to investigate the truth behind Paul's murder. ""Broken City"" is a great political thriller about a situation that certainly happens in big cities. Mayor Hostetler is evicting people from a residence building and selling the real estate for an underrated value. In Rio, there are mysterious interests from the Powers That Be that change the construction code allowing tall buildings at the seaside streets; or destroy a velodrome and a car racing track in a valuable real estate and intending to construct another in a mined area that belongs to the Brazilian army; or valorize the harbor area with questionable constructions. Unfortunately only in fiction majors are investigated and arrested. My vote is seven.",Broken City
133,Nokitron,It just peels itself and throw it away,6,14 March 2013,"It's a story about ""bad cop, good cop"" (or should I say ""bad pupil, good pupil""). Started by the act Billy Taggart(Marky Mark) and someone who raped-till-death Yesenia Barea, head-shot by the police bare hands(JK, pistol). Fortunately, it was considered as self-defense by the court.7 years has passed, Billy starting to forget what happened, not until the New York City currently Mayor, Nicholas Hostetler(Russell Crowe) called him for another private detective job that he could avoid, and this movie will just end well.As far as I can say, this film has no special point at all. Yeah, we all know Marky Mark hardly miss the police role, neither do Crowe and Caroline Zeta-Jones. But the story, it has no special point at all. All you want to do is just waiting this story to peel its truth one-by-one. From the Mayor's wife, to Mayor's rival campaign manager, to Mayor himself and back to dearly Billy Taggart. It's just like watching CSI, minus murder focus, yet a mystery. And the sub-plot, they are never find their their solution, I kinda hate that. And if you expect the car battle will help, no, that makes it worse. Such a nonsense that a car with 40 mph speed that leaves nothing but a bruise for its driver. Come to think of it, crime movie uses logic all the time.tl;dr This movie is not worth it for cinema. Wait it to come in front of your couch will be good. Or else, you'll find it very plain, no twist, an exciting debate(but hey, once again, it's crime movie, not a debate movie we want to watch here), good acting, funny drunk act, little fist-fighting, and the ending, the ending soundtrack is pretty good. I wonder where I can find it...",Broken City

Russell Crowe was the highlight of the movie, not a surprise, as he's one of the best actors of his generation. Mark Wahlberg was pretty good too, although he wasn't very likable. An election's happening, Crowe is the dirt bag of a mayor, and an election's coming up. Although it seems Crowe was supposed to be the bad guy, his opponent wasn't likable at all, and I was rooting for the corrupt mayor the entire time. The supporting cast in general wasn't spectacular, although Kyle Chandler plays his part well. The film was written averagely, the story wasn't that great, and the direction was simple, yet as I stated earlier, I had a good time.",Broken City

The Mayor would like Taggart to investigate his wife but there seems to be a hidden agenda behind the Mayors intentions! BC has a lot of similarities to Mark Wahlberg's other productions like Contraband. There's a fairly interesting story, a familiar role for Mark Wahlberg, some good acting and some good - but over the top action. BC is entertaining enough but the story is a bit predictable and gives away any real suspense a little to early. Overall its entertaining and fairly well produced but its no classic and not a true Political Thriller like State of Play.",Broken City

How does one swap a dummy cellphone for someone else's, without knowing what make or model it is? It's like Tucker wrote this screenplay in 2000 when all phones were Nokia. You begin to see how implausible this plot is. Then there's ""they shot him in the head"", but the prior scene clearly showed the victim with a bullet wound to the chest. Then the climatic line ""Where did you get your seat covers?"" when the following scene reveals there are NO seat overs on the car seats. It's as if the director's shooting script was independent of the writers script.

The writing is formulaic, the acting indifferent (though Alona Tal did a good job, even if she didn't have much of a role), and the plot twists quite predictable. The ending is totally implausible. The movie at some level is supposed to be about doing the right thing even if it costs you, but there aren't really any good guys being helped, just a choice of one bad guy against another bad guy.Whoever wrote this doesn't seem to understand the role of a police commissioner or the fact that the mayor can fire him.

143,SRBi922,A campaign commercial embedded in an unimaginative political corruption story,4,25 January 2013,"This movie lacked originality; it lacked anything memorable - except the cast. I wasn't drawn in by the good guy; I didn't feel the kind of connection I might feel in a good movie, like Absolute Power. There wasn't much action either; just a few fights and a short car chase. All that it delivered was a strong cast in an over-used, formulaic plot. We get it. There are corrupt, politicians out there, and they want to use their offices and influence to make themselves rich at the expense of the little guy. We've seen the story too many times - on the news and in movies - but this one didn't add anything creative. In fact, it doesn't even pass a basic credibility test, suggesting that a company with a $4 billion contract with the city of New York would keep the identitys of the major shareholders from becoming public knowledge. Newspapers would find out about such things.Also, in a shameless display of political activism, they gave the corrupt politician a message meant to sound like that of one of our major political partys (which shall remain nameless); and his honest, well-meaning opponent, a message straight out of the talking points of our other major political party (which also shall remain nameless) - as if political corruption were only found in one party. If I wanted to watch a campaign ad, I could have watched the NBC Nightly News!I was disappointed with this movie. I felt cheated.",Broken City
144,bradleyhartzler,Something missing,6,12 February 2014,"Performances by all actors were exceptional. Alona Tal, Wahlberg's assistant in the movie, plays an exceptional sidekick role, and put simply, is adorable.I like to find redeeming quality to movies, however, this movie has a twisted way of showing it. First, a loose end for me is Wahlburg's characters' drinking, which inexplicably is taken up again without any change in his behavior. If he were an alcoholic, all indications in the movie are that he is, he would be falling down drunk the entire last quarter of the film, and to the viewer, that's not the case. He's just as steady. Loose ends, loose ends. This movie is missing something, and I can only look to the poor adaptation of the character's behavior.",Broken City

If the trailer was a more accurate preview of the story i suspect it would have had higher box office revenues. Broken City is a quality film with a solid cast. The film has dark cinematography and elements to its story but the plot is coherent has a clear purpose. If you are a fan of Mark Walhberg you are likely to enjoy the film and his character. He plays a no bs investigator who is involved in a chess game of sorts between a few different characters. Russell Crowe gives a good performance as the corrupt mayor and Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the first wife, and is still quite a beautiful woman. Good supporting acting as well.To say what i would say if not required to write a ten line review... It exceeded my expectation and is worth watching.",Broken City

The script is full of expository dialog (most irritating rookie-screenwriter habit ever), improbable twists, clunky edits and plot holes you could park a semi truck in.

He wouldn't have been able to win one for ""Gladiator"" hadn't he been so good. Having kept all that in mind, I set about watching ""Broken City"" eagerly, only to find myself dozing off in front of the telly and to be even woken up once by my wife. That's how meaningless and preposterous this movie is. The theme is totally tacky. Betrayal, adultery, and using that to take the viewer by surprise somewhere in the middle of all the napping you can't seem to get rid of. The story has countless holes in it, no event is explained explicitly and things are just left up in the air leaving the flabbergasted viewer to do the math and fill in the blanks. The acting is not so good either, my expectations were much higher from a star-studded movie such as this.

Natalie the girlfriend role has no meaning or an effect, vanished without a logical cause so why at the beginning this character has been added to the script, really has no meaning.

No one says anything about it , he handles the alcohol fine , and we never see the wife again and she doesn't seem to entire Walhberg's mind.

I am a big fan of Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright and Marky Mark. Unfortunately, this was the most unoriginal and cliché movies of all time...so much wasted potential with the lineup of actors. Wahlberg's acting could only be described as god awful and laughable (especially the scene by the water w/ Zeta Jones). The only good thing about this movie is the potential drinking games you could create while watching this movie. The most obvious would be to have a drink every time one of the lead characters has a drink of whiskey. The director must have had a lot of script pages to fill or Jameson sponsored this movie, because every five minutes someone was drinking whiskey (in the mayor's office, at the bar, at home, in the mayors office again, at the hotel bar, at the mayor's fund raiser, etc.).The only redeeming part was watching Marky Mark's disgust while watching his girlfriend's ""indie film"".
