0,MartinHafer,"If you gotta see one 1980s ""teen flick"", this is THE one to see!",8,4 September 2006,"It seems obvious that those responsible for this movie were schizophrenics. This alone can account for why the movie seems like two different films melded together AND why the humor is so bizarre and gut-bustingly funny! The biggest downside of the film is that it has so many of the dumb 80s clichés from teen films--without the main plot, the film actually would have scored a 9 or 10! The whole business about ""having to ski the K-12"" was just lame and got in the way of all the wonderful weirdness! My advice is to watch the film and then try to ignore all the plot--you're better off,...really.So what was so weird about the film?! Well, apart from John Cusack, his ex-girlfriend and the ""evil rival"", all the other characters are almost like a combination of a normal 80s teen movie and a Salvador Dali creation! I really don't want to ruin all the many, many, many surprises, but you've got to see such things as the family's Christmas presents, the ""interesting"" things Lane's brother does throughout the film, the paperboy from Hell, the scene where Mrs. Smith blows up, and so many more strange bits here and there. And, most of the strange little vignettes that are irrelevant to the plot are GREAT--except for the claymation part that just seemed dull (for better claymation, see HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS).This is inspired lunacy that unfortunately barely missed being a grand-slam because of some dull plot elements and a stupid claymation dancing hamburger. BUT, because of all the weirdness and fun, this is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by kids or those who lived through the 80s and want to relive old times and laugh at the clothes and music!",Better Off Dead...
1,SnoopyStyle,crazy wacky 80s teen movie,7,25 February 2015,"Cartoonist Lane Meyer (John Cusack) has a strange family in Northern California. His father Al (David Ogden Stiers) struggles against the psycho newspaper boy Johnny. His mother Jenny (Kim Darby) is a crazy cook. His little brother Badger is a genius mute. His best friend Charles de Mar (Curtis Armstrong) is a weirdo who keeps trying to get high. His girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss) dumps him for the douche ski team captain Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). Roy also keeps Lane from getting on the ski team. Lane continuously get challenged to race by two Japanese brothers, one who speaks no English and the other who speaks like Howard Cosell. Lane keeps trying to kill himself and then he is befriended by French foreign-exchange student Monique (Diane Franklin). He also saves her from her host's weird creepy son.This is a crazy weird addition to the 80s teen movie. It oscillates from silly stupidity to hilariously funny. It's surreal weirdness. And they throw in some fun lines like, ""That's a real shame when folks be throwing away a perfectly good white boy like that."" The only drawback is that Lane doesn't talk to Monique until the second half of the movie. They need to get together sooner. There is so much wackiness. Some works really well but others do fall a bit flat. Cusack is a terrific teen star who can roll with all the craziness.",Better Off Dead...
2,claudio_carvalho,Language Lessons,7,4 September 2016,"The teenager Lane Meyer (John Cusack) has a crush on his girlfriend Beth Truss (Amanda Wyss). When Beth dumps him to stay with the successful skier Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier), Lane is depressed and decides to commit suicide. However he gives up and tries to improve his skill of skier to ski the dangerous K12 slope to impress Beth. Meanwhile his neighbor Mrs. Smith (Laura Waterbury) receives the exchange French student Monique Junot (Diane Franklin) and her fat son Ricky Smith (Daniel Schneider) considers Monique his girlfriend; however, Monique has an unrequited crush on Lane that does not note her. When Lane stumbles upon Monique in a high-school party, he befriends her. The upset Lane challenges Roy in a competition on the K12 slope but then he regrets. However Monique is a great mechanic and skier, and fix Lane's Camaro and teaches him how to ski the K12 slope. What will happen to Lane?""Better off Dead"" is a cute romantic comedy even thirty-one years later. The story is funny and there are hilarious situations. Further this film has not aged and entertains. Maybe the greatest difference is that in the viewer that enjoyed this cult-movie in 1985 now is able to understand much more Lane's father attitudes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Minha Vida é um Desastre"" (""My Life Is a Disaster"")",Better Off Dead...
3,classicsoncall,"""This is as bad as it will ever get.""",7,20 July 2018,"Well it never gets that ominous for John Cusack's character. After getting dumped by his girlfriend (Amanda Wyss) for hot shot skier Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier), Lane Meyer suffers the expected angst that goes with getting dumped territory. He survives a faux suicide attempt when his Mom (Kim Darby) inadvertently helps Lane hang himself, but that single attempt is outdone several times by Bud Cort's character in the 1971 flick ""Harold and Maude"". That film is even more hilarious than this one, though you have to pick your spots.The picture thrives on an unrelenting volume of sight gags throughout. Can you imagine a high school class as rapt at attention as the teens in Kerber's (Vincent Schiavelli) math room? I got a kick out of Badger's (Scooter Stevens) ""How to Pick Up Trashy Women"" which he managed to follow through on, and the picture's nod to the original ""Frankenstein"" was more than evident with Lane working at Pig Burgers. And say, anyone else notice that Stalin hit his stopwatch a couple of clicks after his required fifty eight second time trial when Lane crossed the finish line? I don't know what Beth (Wyss) ever saw in the guy.Well this is a fun movie if you're up for a teen comedy. The title actually seems to have more to do with the night club singer's song than it does with Lane Meyer's quest to kill himself. The chemistry between his character and Diane Franklin's Monique works well and Curtis Armstrong does what he can to channel Gilbert Gottfried as Lane's pal Charles De Mar. Aside from the vengeful two dollar paper boy and the rest of the principal players, my favorite was the Japanese Howard Cosell imitator. For anyone too young to remember Cosell, you'll have to look him up on Youtube to see what a great job Brian Imada did mimicking the famed sportscaster.",Better Off Dead...
4,gavin6942,"Very Odd, Sometimes Unnecessary",6,16 May 2015,"A teenager (John Cusack) has to deal with his girlfriend (Amanda Wyss) dumping him among family crises, homicidal paper boys, and a rival skier.Apparently John Cusack hated this film after it came out. Maybe he still does. Most likely he has moved on, focusing more on the dozens of other great films he has made since 1985. Anyway, not sure what the hate was about. The film is definitely weird and unlike most of the teen comedies of the 1980s, but it is by no means a bad movie.The cast alone makes it appealing, with Cusack alongside the amazing Diane Franklin, Kim Darby and Amanda Wyss. Sure, some scenes could have been trimmed or cut to improve the pace, but overall it is a solid entry into the world of 80s comedies.",Better Off Dead...
5,Woodyanders,A gloriously wacky and off-the-wall one-of-a-kind 80's teen comedy riot,9,29 January 2009,"Sadsack Lane Meyer (John Cusack at his most endearingly goofy) sinks into a deep depression and becomes suicidal after he gets dumped by his luscious girlfriend Beth (dishy blonde honey Amanda Wyss). Unbeknownst to Lane, true love exists right next door in the fetching form of sweet and adorable French foreign exchange student Monique Junot (the delightful Diane Franklin). Writer/director Savage Steve Holland brings a highly inspired, distinctive and idiosyncratic off-kilter comic sensibility to the standard concept of adolescent angst and those uniquely traumatic years spent in that special brand of hell called high school. Holland crams the film with a wonderfully oddball wealth of hilariously surreal gags: Lane's mom makes ghastly food that's as inedible as it is unidentifiable, two Japanese guys in a souped-up car constantly challenge Lane to a race, the persistent psychotic paperboy who really wants his two dollars, Lane's precocious younger brother orders a book through the mail so he can pick up trashy women, the hot babe who dates the entire basketball team, a claymation hamburger rocking out to a cool thrashin' song, and everyone asking Lane if it's okay to take Beth out on a date. Cusack's affable screen presence and considerable charm hold the picture together; he receives excellent support from Franklin, David Ogden Stiers as his hapless, long-suffering dad Al, Kim Darby as Lane's blithely clueless mother Jenny, Curtis Armstrong as Lane's zany stoner pal Charles De Mar, Chuck Mitchell as mean, slobby restaurant owner Rocko, Daniel Schneider as grotesque fat toad Ricky Smith, Aaron Dozier as arrogant ski champion Roy Stalin, Demian Slade as the deranged Johnny Gasparini, and Vincent Schiavelli as beloved geometry teacher Mr. Kerber. Elizabeth Daily makes an electrifying appearance singing at a high school dance. Rupert Hines' quirky score hits the groovy spot. Isidore Mankofsky's sparkling cinematography likewise does the trick. The bouncy 80's rock soundtrack totally smokes. An absolute gut-busting offbeat hoot.",Better Off Dead...
6,blanche-2,laughing out loud,8,12 May 2015,"Better Off Dead is a film from 1985 starring John Cusack - and he was a baby in this one.Cusack plays Lane Myer, the son of an insane mother (Kim Darby) who makes horrific recipes and gives out TV dinners as gifts; and a long- suffering David Ogden Stiers. His little brother is a weird genius who is making a satellite using household appliances that will take him to the moon.High-schooler Cusack is madly in love with Beth (Amanda Wyss). He has her likeness on all of his hangers. When she dumps him for the more popular, blond, good-looking, obnoxious Badger (Scooter Stevens), Lane decides to kill himself. I won't describe what happens as a result of each attempt, but he tries hanging, jumping onto a highway, and carbon monoxide poisoning (one of the funniest scenes ever).Lane believes, along with his friend (Curtis Armstrong) that if he can just ski the treacherous K-12, he can win back Beth. When he meets a French exchange student Monique (Diane Franklin), she picks up on his lack of confidence and wants to help.I was laughing at loud at so much of this - it's absolutely hilarious. Cusack is fantastic as a clumsy kid who feels inept. The always quirky Curtis Armstrong is a great sidekick, and Dan Schneider, now a huge TV writer and creator of shows, is fabulous as the social misfit Ricky, who has appropriated Monique as his girlfriend.Sadly, the woman who played Ricky's overbearing mother, Laura Waterbury, developed Alzheimer's and died at age 66, in 2013.There are so many little touches in this film that help make it so funny - Lane trying to find a radio station is one, the foreign guys who keep trying to race with him (one speaks English using a Howard Cosell voice and narratives), Ricky's mother's injury, Lane's date with the girl ""who wears an antenna on her face"" and last but not least - his brother's creations - it's priceless.There are too few laughs in films today - comedies have been dumbed down considerably since the '80s. For real laughs, see this one.",Better Off Dead...
7,edwagreen,Better Off Dead Best Describes this Film *,2,15 July 2010,"Outlandish film where John Cusack, at age 18, is despondent over the loss of his girlfriend and even tries to end it all.To say that the family is dysfunctional is to put it mildly. David Ogden Stiers provides some funny moments but Kim Darby, who was 38, at the time of the movie, is totally miscast as the mother. Her being so naive doesn't help her cause.We have a French exchange student living across the street from Cusack. She is staying with a boy who reminded me of Josh Mostel and a mother similar to Lainie Kazan.Naturally, we have the bully who took Cusack's original gal pal away. There will be an ultimate challenge by the two in the skiing finale.The oriental man doing an impression of the late Howard Cosell is hilarious.The picture lacks credibility and is most inane at times.",Better Off Dead...
8,wes-connors,Holland puts John Cusack on the Map,6,16 July 2010,"Northern California teenager John Cusack (as Lane Meyer) gets dumped by his hot blonde girlfriend (Amanda Wyss). This could be because Mr. Cusack takes a shower with his dirty socks on, and blow dries them to wear another day. Cusack decides to commit suicide, believing he'd be ""Better Off Dead"" than without Wyss. But, he never seems able to get the deed done. Parents David Ogden Stiers and Kim Darby are clueless. Aspiring drug addict pal Curtis Armstrong (as Charles de Mar) is unable to help.Luckily for Cusack, cute French foreign exchange student Diane Franklin (as Monique Junot) moves into the neighborhood. And, you know what that means. ""A delightful girl with a firm grip,"" Ms. Franklin can also fix cars and ski. The reason ""Savage"" Steve Holland's hapless comedy flopped upon release is because nobody bothered to tell audiences you were supposed to drop acid about six hours before the movie. Fortunately for the film, people have become innately trippy over time. No bad flashbacks here.****** Better Off Dead...

9,BandSAboutMovies,A movie that I always come back to,10,7 April 2019,"When I was a teenager watching these movies, I could never understand the lives of the kids in John Hughes movies. I couldn't put myself into the headspace of the jocks or rich kids or the good looking ones. But Lane Myer? I get Lane Myer. When he finally finds that French foreign exchange student who knows all and gives him a new lease on life? That's what I thought would get me through high school and give my life meaning.
""Savage"" Steve Holland knows how to make a movie. I've seen this probably 4,000 times and every single viewing improves it for me.Lane only has two interests: skiing and his girlfriend, Beth (Amanda Wyss, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, A Nightmare on Elm Street). But when she leaves him for the captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin, his life is over. So over that he decides to kill himself at every juncture, which believe it or not, ends up being hilarious.This is a movie that knows how to cast its roles: David Ogden Stiers from TV's M*A*S*H* as Lane's dad, Kim Darby (Don't Be Afraid of the Dark) as his mom, Curtis ""Booger"" Armstrong as his best friend, Yuji Okumoto (who is the best bad guy EVER in The Karate Kid Part 2)s one of the two Howard Cosell speaking race driving immigrant brothers, Dan Schneider as the evil Ricky and his testicles err...tentacles, Chuck ""Porky"" Mitchell as the owner of a fast food place with claymation dancing food, amazing character actors like Vincent Schiavelli and Taylor Negron is small roles, E.G. Daily as herself rocking out, a little brother who is a bigger hit with the ladies (and a brighter scientist) than Lane, a paperboy obsessed with his two dollars and Diane Franklin (who starred in that scummy American horror movie that wishes it was Italian, Amityville II: The Possession) as the aforementioned French foreign exchange student.This is a movie where, as I always say, hijinks ensue. There's a dancing hamburger blasting Van Halen's ""Everybody Wants Some!!,"" there's Lane's buddy trying to do lines of snow off the K12, there's a one ski having ski race, there's mothers getting blown up and there's even the most ridiculous montage ever set to Rupert Hine's ""Arrested by You."" Truly, I could act this entire movie out for you if you'd like. Just ask me in person.According to the director, Cusack did not like the film and walked out of a screening, later saying it ""was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don't speak to me."" This moment made Holland no longer care about movies. When asked years later if he hated making the movie, Cusack said, ""No, I just thought it could have been better, but I think that about almost all my films. I have nothing against the film. Glad people love it still.""",Better Off Dead...
10,Hey_Sweden,"Well, honk my hooter!",8,18 November 2013,"This is a fresh and hilarious teen comedy, one of the more original ones from the 1980s. This viewer is now wishing he'd watched it long ago when it was new. Its off-the-wall sensibility keeps it unpredictable; it's also dark in places but not overly dark, and it populates its story with memorable characters. Gags range from a demented paperboy hassling our hero over a measly $2, a sleazy yet ambitious younger brother who longs to score with trashy women and build his own spacecraft, a mother constantly cooking up WEIRD things in the kitchen (Boiling bacon? That's a crime!), a portly neighbour trying to hook up with a lovely French exchange student, and our main character, Lane Myer (an engaging John Cusack), despondent over his girlfriend (Amanda Wyss) dumping him for an incredibly obnoxious athlete (is there any other kind?), prompting him to contemplate various means of suicide.The cast is great fun to watch. Cusack is a great lead; too bad he's supposedly disowned this movie. 80s babe Diane Franklin is adorable as the French gal with hidden talents. David Ogden Stiers and Kim Darby are fun as Cusacks' parents. Curtis Armstrong does more ""Booger""-esque shtick as Lanes' buddy. There's a couple of familiar faces in the supporting cast, too: Dan Schneider, Yuji Okumoto (whose character learned to speak English by watching Howard Cosell), Chuck ""Porky"" Mitchell, Vincent Schiavelli, Steven Williams, Taylor Negron, and ever appealing Elizabeth Daily in a musical appearance. Sometimes the movie gets a little tiresome, but overall it has enough spirit and imagination to make it consistently enjoyable. It even has a cute ""hamburger video"" (set to the tune of ""Everybody Wants You"" by Van Halen) created by clay animation specialist Jimmy Picker. There are also some amazing stunts on the ski slopes.Marking the filmmaking debut for ""Savage"" Steve Holland (whose story here is supposed to be somewhat autobiographical), this has fine energy and begins and ends in style. Highly recommended.Eight out of 10.",Better Off Dead...
11,grantss,Entertaining,6,11 June 2020,"When Lane's girlfriend Beth dumps him life does not seem worth living. Adding to his misery is her new boyfriend, the cocky, meat-headed captain of the ski team, who uses every opportunity to put Lane down. However, there is Monique, the beautiful French foreign exchange student living next door.Funny and silly, in almost equal measure. Starts very well, with some zany characters and scenes and seemed set to be a laugh-a-minute rollercoaster of a movie. However, it soon becomes apparent that writer-director Savage Steve Holland used up most of his best ideas and jokes in Act 1 and the movie becomes less compelling.What follows is a mixed bag with some characters, scenes and sub-plots that go nowhere. Some are counter-productive: the ""$2"" kid was incredibly annoying. There's still the odd hilarious moment but those moments are fewer and further between.Furthermore, the plot becomes very predictable. Yes, it is a comedy, so the plot is less relevant, but at least don't make it 100% predictable.Overall, entertaining and funny enough to be watchable. At least it never attempts to be serious: it's quite kooky from start to finish.",Better Off Dead...

14,anaconda-40658,Better Off Forgotten.,4,24 February 2016,"Better Off Dead (1985): Dir: Savage Steve Holland / Cast: John Cusack, David Ogden Stiers, Kim Darby, Diane Franklin, Curtis Armstrong: Pitiful comedic waste about hope, which is difficult to take seriously given that every character in this film is a full blown moron. John Cusack plays Lane Myer whose girlfriend breaks up with him in favor of the bullying ski champion. In answer to this he makes several attempts to commit suicide but one wonders if that was just Cusack trying to distance himself from this crap. Suicide is not a funny topic so when the film plays this theme up for laughs, it is disturbing. David Ogden Stiers plays the one character worth watching here. He plays Lane's frustrated father whose battle with the paper boy has him making failed attempts to protect his garage windows. Kim Darby plays mother who cannot cook and this becomes an over the top joke that drags on like overcooked food. Curtis Armstrong was so good in Risky Business so it is a shame to see him reduced to Lane's jello snorting best friend. Diane Franklin plays a foreign exchange student who is living with a mother / son combo that is another poorly executed array of warped personalities. With all this hassle one would think that Beth, Lane's ex-girlfriend would have a personality but she is as lame as the rest. Theme regards moving ahead of emotional tragedy but unfortunately this film is better off not seen. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Better Off Dead...
15,AaronCapenBanner,Original But Bizarre.,4,3 September 2013,"John Cusack plays Lane Myer, an unhappy high school student who has just been dumped by his beloved girlfriend, and becomes confused and despondent.

He then decides to commit suicide, but can't quite decide how to do it...Strange comedy(to say the least!) is undeniably funny at times, and Cusak is appealing, but film is so far off-the-wall, that it leaves the house altogether!

16,Aaron1375,At times it seems like the typical teen comedy...then it takes bizarre twists.,8,5 December 2008,"Yes, this movie follows the typical teen romantic comedy type formula, but it adds a lot of weird stuff in it to make it more original and a bit demented. Kind of like the mother added this and that to the one meal she cooked, granted the one ingredient she mentioned was normal enough...raisins. The story, guy who seems likable enough has just been dumped by his girlfriend. Sounds normal enough, till you realize the girlfriend seems to date just about anyone and everyone. Well guy wants to win her back so he is going to try to ski this deadly run that the one guy his ex seems to be dating a bit more than others is an expert at. There you go, sounds simple...throw in a cute foreign exchange student and you have your typical teen romantic comedy. Though it is not as cut and dry as that as our hero must overcome an obsessed paper delivery boy, a strange introverted guy and his loud mouth mother, a fairly normal dad but odd mother, a brother who gets the ladies and builds super science fiction stuff, a friend who snorts everything but drugs because their town apparently does not sell them, a part time job at a burger joint, a drawing that takes a life of its own, and many other strange happenings.

17,The_Void,Top quality 80's comedy,8,6 April 2005,"The 80's were a great time for films. Though much of what came out of the decade is now considered stupid kitsch and not worth much, some of the films remain a really good time and it's refreshing to see a movie that never takes itself seriously in this day and age; when there seems to be an unwelcome feeling that only A-grade material can truly be accepted. Better off Dead is a surreal and inventive comedy from a man calling himself 'Savage Steve Holland', that depicts teen life. Better Off Dead can be summed up as a series of genius ideas strung together around one young man's ordeal after splitting up with his girlfriend. Of course, some of the jokes are extremely lame (don't forget, it was made in the 80's), but the ones that work tend to work brilliantly and there's many funny moments in this movie. As mentioned, the plot follows Lane Meyer; a young man that is obsessed with his girlfriend. Well...until she breaks up with him because he's not popular enough, not good looking enough and doesn't drive a very nice car. And not only that, but she's left him for the captain of ski team; and he's a guy that isn't going to let Lane get away without being ribbed about it...If I were to sum up Better Off Dead in a word, I would use the word 'odd'. How many films can you think of that includes dinner walking off the plate, someone's mother being blown up and a living hamburger that has it's own girlfriend? I wager not many. While at times the film does become a little too weird, it's absurdity helps the plot as it helps to enforce the bewilderment that being a teenager can come with; and this helps to get the film's point across. Naturally, the film features an assortment of odd and wacky characters and this is always a good thing in a film of this kind. John Cusack takes the lead role in a time before he rose to superstardom, and it's roles like these early ones that shows why he did make that transition. Cusack leads the film with great charisma and always keeps you entranced with his character. This especially helps when it comes to the more touching scenes of the movie as it enables you to feel for his character and therefore get the full benefit of the scene. While Better Off Dead wont be winning any awards, it's still a wickedly entertaining movie and if you're a fan of kitschy fun movies, you cant go wrong here.",Better Off Dead...
18,zetes,80s quirkfest that never really works,4,20 February 2011,"I've seen bits of this before, and it always seemed amusing. Watching it in whole, though, I was very unimpressed. It has a very unique and quirky sense of humor, but, in my opinion, it hardly ever works. John Cusack plays a teen whose super cute and popular girlfriend dumps him for a jock. He spends the rest of the movie moping while cute French exchange student Diane Franklin starts to fall for him. The movie tries to set itself apart from the John Hughes comedies with its oddness, but in reality it reinforces the same stereotypes that every other 80s teen comedy does. Some of the cast is amusing, especially fat dork neighbor Dan Schneider, whose mother hosts Franklin almost as if she's ordering a male order bride for her social outcast son, and Kim Darby as Cusack's spaced-out mom. Curtis Armstrong pretty much reprises his role as Booger from Revenge of the Nerds as Cusack's best friend. I barely laughed at all during the flick. Even stuff that seemed amusing wasn't doing anything for me. I've seen Holland and Cusack's followup film, One Crazy Summer, and I remember liking that one better.",Better Off Dead...
19,Sylviastel,I've watched this film about 7 times and I'm no dummy!,10,17 July 2002,"Better Off Dead is a spoof takeoff of the John Hughes' eighties films about teen angst. John Cusack plays wonderfully as Lane Myer who had an obsessive relationship with his ex girlfriend, Beth, who breaks up the relationship for somebody better. Miserable, he tries to kill himself several times without failure. As his friend played brilliantly by Curtis Armstrong tells him ""Suicide is not the answer"" and lines like ""I've been going to high school for 7 years, I'm no dummy."" While Lane depresses over his adolescence existence in a small northern California town, the laughs just keep getting better. His mother is obsessed with cooking. The father sets him up with a date when he worries his son is going insane. On top of all that, Lane is being hunted down by an unpaid paper boy who will stop at nothing to get his $2.00 and surprisingly, he finds love under his nose.

20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Better Off Dead (1985),7,1 January 2006,"This movie is so typical of the 1980s teenage comedy classics, like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, or Fast Times from Ridgemonth High. It has your typical teenage protagonist, who can be either a complete loser geek, or on the flip side, the coolest dude in school. The plot would typically be about him getting his girl, or trying to win back his girl, against simple odds, in ridiculous madcap situations.A very young John Cusack plays Lane Meyer, a boy who loses his girl Beth to the school's ski jock Roy, who is the only person alive to ski the K-12. Frustrated by Beth's throwing of their 6 months relationship, Lane tries to commit suicide, only that he becomes unsuccessful in his attempts.Of course, you cannot keep our good man down, and he slowly rediscovers his self belief and confidence, courtesy of a new romance with French exchange student Monique Junot.The cast is relatively huge, starting with the Meyer family - a father who can't get proper respect, a kid brother who is the family genius, and a mother who's cooking is of strange colours and can walk around on its own. You also have the loud mouthed neighbour with her overweight son, a nasty diner employer, a wicked and persistent newspaper delivery boy, two Asian brothers who like to race Lane, and of course, Beth and Roy.The jokes come in hard and fast, and varies from slapstick, to wit. I particularly like the scene where Lane and Beth first met, with the totally insane touching of the nose and ears stemming from reading too much of the opposite sex's body language. You'll probably be able to identify with some of the situations too, the pains of growing up.In all, Better Off Dead is one of Cusack's early movies, which seem to suggest that he's a master at playing non-conventional characters, as seen from his filmography. Definite must watch for his fans.Really barebones version of a Code 1 DVD.",Better Off Dead...
21,Mr-Fusion,Everybody wants some,7,20 August 2015,"Does Cusack still have a beef with this movie? Whatever the reason is, it's beyond me; the guy fits the teen side of this thing to a T. ""Better Off Dead"" has all the tropes of the '80s teen comedy, but jazzes it up with the surreal sense of humor of Savage Steve Holland (best director name ever). The sight gags in this movie are a trip, and his animation bring all sorts of charm to the table.It's a fun movie. The one-liners are good, it's got the requisite pop soundtrack, as well as Curtis Armstrong at his funniest. The whole package is an endearing brand of wacky.7/10",Better Off Dead...

Only this was my first viewing ever of this John Cusack ""classic."" All 1985 films.Just a coincidence, but I'm glad I finally decided to fail at suicide and see Better Off DeadNow, admittedly, not every joke worked. In fact, some made me wish I was high to enjoy. But the grand majority had me rolling. Especially the running $2 gag. Lane missed his exit and lost his 6-month obsession to the ski captain and he considers the Groundhog Day way of destruction until he sees hope from the French. That's the basic plot hidden in a somewhat slapstick comedy.I'm a huge old-school slapstick fan from (the best) Airplane! to The Naked Gun! to Scary Movie (the last good one.) This seemed like it wanted to be one, but it kept holding back some to remind us this was a real movie. No bother; the jokes and delivery worked. And this is saying something from someone watching a 31-year-old movie for the first time. It's just so odd that it works. John Cusack, as usual, is perfect in his deadpan seriousness with all the weird around him. And the enormous amount of weirdos around him also really worked. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Especially the paper boy. He'll be a great credit card, call-center collector later in life.***Final thoughts: As I began with, this was a weird coincidence. On Saturday, I purchased the DVD: Just One of the Guys and BluRay: The Legend of Billie Jean from Amazon, not knowing they both came out in 1985. I watched those both this week and then my friend at work mentioned this 1985 movie in passing today. I said: ""what the hell?"" on the way home from work and borrowed this film from a friend. Glad I did. Thanks, Carol! I agree with you. Hilarious movie.",Better Off Dead...
24,cherold,"Half 80s teen comedy, half insane",8,6 January 2016,"Savage Steve Holland, who went on to create the insanely wonderful Saturday morning cartoon series Eek! the Cat, combined two 80s genres - John Hughes romantic comedies and gag-a-second movies like Airplane! to create one of the more unusual teen comedies of the 80s. The movie stars John Cusack as a jilted teen pining for his ex while oblivious to the absurdly perfect girl across the street, the two girls falling into the classic 80s stereotypes of the cold blonde and the magical, quirky brunette. Cusack is more emotionally unstable than a Hughes protagonist, spending much of the movie in inept attempts to kill himself. He also has to deal with living in an insane world. His mom makes weird gloppy dishes that crawl away on their own power, a newspaper boy seems to be the beta version of the Terminator, Cusack's best friend snorts all his food. The movie is frequently hilarious, resulting in a minor classic.",Better Off Dead...
25,lost-in-limbo,A teenager with a death wish.,9,22 September 2008,"Eighties teen films, I love 'em. I never tire of this brand of entertainment that's a true product of it pop-culture times. There's something about this wonderful era. Everything about the humour had a natural build up, and even during the hits or misses it stayed consistently amusing without resorting to gross-outs. 'Better off Dead' fits that buck. Here's another cherished coming of age story through the eyes of a troubled teenager dealing with a dumped relationship and the embarrassments that seem to follow through the painful years of high school and everyday life. Wallowing in self-pity, eventually it comes to identifying self-confidence over what isn't the impossible. What am I going to type that someone hasn't already. Nothing. The plot is secondary to the oddball episodic set-pieces and comic characters, where the flow is unpredictable and original like out of some daydreaming teenager's imagination. John Cusack (a pin-up boy for these roles) has that likable, down-to-earth awe which fits. Surrounding him is a fantastically hearty support cast in David Ogden Stiers, Kim Darby, Diane Franklin, Demian Slade, Amanda Wyss, Curtis Armstrong, Dan Schneider and Laura Waterbury. Director Savage Steve Holland throws caution to the wind with his animatedly interesting style, but manages to make sure everything still comes together without really trying. Well it looks so. Visual gags also have a powerful note like the night-time chase sequence involving a persistent paperboy after his 2 dollars and the drag racing scenes with a pair of Asians. Even the ski scenes are well shot. An upbeat soundtrack pounds out the catchy, nostalgic tunes and cements an provocatively charming sincereness. It's hard to pass up this self-knowing, off-kilter teenage comedy/romance winner.",Better Off Dead...
26,The-Sarkologist,"For an 80s Teen Comedy, this is not a bad movie at all",8,14 October 2011,"I remember seeing this movie back when I was a teenager and it is one of those movies that I remember watching just because. My friend purchased a copy of it and I watched it and realised that it is actually a very good movie. It is quite funny and pretty way out with a number of the characters (especially the main character and his family) being larger than life. Some will claim that this is quite excessive and makes for a bad comedy, but I think rather it appeals to people with a certain twisted sense of humor (like me).The movie opens with the main character getting up and we quickly learn that he is obsessed with his girlfriend. We know that he is obsessed because his room is plastered with her picture, and he sleeps with one, and her face is on all of his clothes hangers. Unfortunately, she would rather date the stuck up snob of a ski captain. When he finds this out he becomes suicidal, but he knows that life really isn't all that bad and changes his mind at the last minute, only to have something happen that triggers it anyway (such as his mother bursting into the room, knocking the stool over and thus mostly completing his attempt to hang himself).There are a lot of weird things in the movie, such as the two Japanese who race everybody, one not speaking a word of English and the other having learnt English off of the wide world of sports. His mother is just simply strange (she cannot cook, even though she claims that she can, and she has an obsession with wearing bizarre costumes) and his brother his a technological genius who is able to pick up more women than he can. His father seems sane and boring, but he is obsessed with his garage, and freaks out because it keeps on blowing up. There is the girl that dates the entire basketball team, and the team communicates only in grunts. Finally there is the paper boy who is obsessed with getting his $2 that he rides his bike down the most dangerous mountain in the town and goes flying over at cliff (and still survives).This movie is basically about obsession and pushes them too such an extreme that it is basically laughable. There is the main character's obsession with Beth, the ski-captains' obsession with himself (which is destroyed when he is beaten by the main character), the main character's friend, who is obsessed with drugs, and because there are less illegal drugs in the town than in the Pope's bathroom, he tries everything else (such as snorting snow from the mountain). The movie really doesn't outright say ""obsessions are bad"" but rather it portrays it in a light in which we simply see them as an absolute absurdity. Still, it is a great movie.Favourite quote: tis a damn shame when folks go and throw away a perfectly good white boy like that.",Better Off Dead...

The only character that doesn't really work is the mother. She's more strange than actually funny. But that's all right, she's balanced off by a wildly funny villain mother.

29,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Creative and silly, but overwrought with '80s cliché",5,18 July 2010,"They don't get more typical '80s teen comedy than ""Better Off Dead."" Savage Steve Holland's debut feature even goes so far as to have the main character challenge the jerk jock to a ski race in front of the entire school down a supposedly untamable mountain. Basically, that either makes you want to throw on a pair of leg warmers and freak to some synth pop or it doesn't. Those who hold '80s comedy in high regards will likely consider ""Better Off Dead"" a treasure, everyone else will be amused and eternally grateful that era is gone and never coming back.Everyone can at least be grateful to this film for launching the career of would-be teen icon John Cusack. Though he wouldn't cement his legacy in that decade until Cameron Crowe's 1989 film ""Say Anything,"" he's an instantly likable softie with a tough exterior as Lane Meyer, a teenager whose girlfriend with which he was unhealthily obsessed has left him for the high school's ski team captain to better serve her reputation. Life seems to do nothing but suck after that for Lane, who half-heartedly attempts suicide to comical results.Filling Lane's universe is a kooky family along with a space case mother (Kim Darby) and peculiar science wiz little brother, a demon child paper boy who has come to collect, a best friend (Curtis Armstrong of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fame) who will snort just about anything and a big-boned dorky neighbor who's turned a French exchange student (Diane Franklin) with an eye for Lane into his personal pet.Some of these characters and gags are just off-kilter enough to work, particularly the clueless mother and her terrible cooking and Lane's little brother Badger who's constructing a space ship from homemade parts, but others like the recurring paper boy gag are terribly forced and unfunny. Such is '80s humor.Holland also uses a few out-of-place techniques that would work better as integral parts of the story. Instead, they come off as odd side ventures. One is when Lane animates his ex on his sketchpad in the lunchroom and it starts talking to him, the other is when Lane takes up a fast food job and imagines a Frankenstein creation sequence that results in an anthropomorphic talking pork burger. Such is '80s humor.With a 50-50 joke success rate, the impetus moves to the story to win out with heart, but down the stretch it clings to the overused '80s mold of boy discovering a new girl and then triumphing over the jerk, etc. And please don't call me out on spoilers; you know what's going to happen in this movie 20 minutes in, that's how obvious the pieces are. You simply have to be the type person who loves to eat the '80s up like comfort food to see ""Better Off Dead"" as more than just an amusing film.~Steven C",Better Off Dead...

31,videorama-759-859391,Better off renting this instead of suiciding,8,1 August 2014,"I must give points for the awesome script, and inventive ideas that add to the sharp humor, this enthusiastic comedy brings. It retains a comedy style of it's own, that sits between normal comedy and slapstick, as well as some great performances, one from Kim Darby like you've seen her before. David Ogden Stiers is very good, while an unrecognizable Schneider as the virgin dork neighbor guy and nasal sniffer is great too. Curtis Armstrong as suicidal Cusack's dorky and jello sniffing friend (he's not the only one) is another asset of humor to this very funny, and well meaning comedy, with some underlying messages. Lane (Cusack) has suffered a bad blow, where smaller other ones follow. Lets face it, nothing hurts more when your sweetheart dumps you. Cusack's beautiful girlfriend has left him, for a better looker and skier. This really brings him down, as this extra hot cutie, is virtually his lifeline. There were so many smart funny touches in this flick, e.g, moving jello, green bacon, live lobster cooking, odd Christmas gifts, and one pi..ed off paper boy, well played. His bike even comes equipped with skiers. I even liked the opening credits, over a short cartoon sequence. Also, it has one classic unforgettable line from two tree loppers, regarding human waste, with mopish Cusack, bummed down in the back of a garbage disposal truck. It almost deserves Oscar status. Cusack is just adequate in this role, really I've never thought much of him as actor, while Diane Franklin adds some spice as a foreign exchange student who becomes Cusack's new love. I really liked this movie for it's comedy smarts and it's inventiveness. Sit in for a night of intermittent laughs throughout (not everyone will find it funny) as Cusack will show you, there are reasons for living, even if at times, that light at the end of the tunnel, can seem pretty bleak. Great ending score, and the pacey title song sung by an unforgettable 'Valley Girl' face, I liked too. Holland's follow up, 'One Crazy Summer', came three and a half months later.

32,GOWBTW,There's more to life...,9,29 April 2020,"Being dumped stinks, but there is no need to mope around. Lane Myer(John Cusack) get dumped by his girlfriend for a skier. He drives a old Ford LTD station wagon, plays a saxophone which helps out later. He has a Camaro which is sitting on the front lawn wasting away. All he wanted to do is ending it all. But every attempt he does always backfired. His parents are odd. His baby brother doesn't speak, but he is highly intelligent. He's got a friend who is trying to get high because the town he is living at doesn't have much of anything at all.
He thinks that he's all alone. Wake up, Lane! The girl next door is from France, her name is Monique(Diane Franklin). She's living with a family that she can't stand. The mother is overbearing. Her son is socially awkward. And when she sees Lane, she was never happier. She happens to be a grease-monkey, meaning that she can bring back a car from the dead. Lane uses the opportunity for him to get back his confidence. The Camaro is fixed, and he took care of the Korean street drivers. Then comes the skiing course. What a scene.
There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. This movie is fine. Teaching a lesson about what is out there, and not let heartaches be a crutch. They have the actor from ""Porky's"".
The actor who played ""Booger"" on ""Revenge of the Nerds"" The father who was fresh off from ""M*A*S*H"". I don't why it didn't do well in the box office at that time, I think that it's fine.

33,hellraiser7,Better Off Living,10,22 April 2021,"This is another one of my favorite films of all time, this is a very interesting kind of teen/young adult film that you don't see everyday and that's what makes it all the more special as they can be the best kind. This is another film that's in the quirky subgenre of comedy, I always love that subgenre because it's comedy that's non-conventional that actually thinks outside the box; pretty much consisted of TV shows like ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"", ""Community"", etc. Another reason why I love those kinds of comedies are they underneath the crazy and quirkiness really have a lot of rich substance and a beating heart.I really like the storyline which feels like one big episode of ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" and this film sort of predates that show. In a way you can say this is the closest for that show to be on the silver screen. The plotline seems like the kind you heard from so many After School Specials (for the record not a fan of them) but that's part of the point as it takes a common dilemma, takes the conventions you would see from those kinds of stories, breaks them and puts its own twists and turns them around, but also becomes a story on it's own.I really like this fantasy world the film takes place in in which is this alternate America, it's a place where it's one step in reality but one step away. Most of what happens in the film is not normal along with some of the people, which makes the world they inhabit their sandbox.Psycho Paperboys that ask for a lousy two dollars from people that don't subscribe, a Dad constantly at war with the psycho paperboys targeting his extremely fragile garage windows for no particular reason, a mom who's made what looks like some leftover fast food bacon grease with raisins that's alive, and all other kinds of weirdness you have to see to believe.Music is also great this film has some memorable tracks, my favorite one is that which is when he is working at a burger joint and there is this stop motion animated music video sequence that looks like it could be another short from ""MTV's Liquid Television"".Characters are all solid, really like his friend Charles De Mar, who is played by Curtis Armstrong whom you know as Bugger from ""Revenge of the Nerds"". He's a bit that same character as he has his slobish ways only here he's in high school. It's funny and really sad as we see he's still a student in high school as he states he's been one for seven years which yeah isn't good. But I like that he truly is a buddy to Lane as he is constantly providing support.Even like the Dad played by the late David Ogden Stiers whom of course is known for the TV series ""M. A. S. H."" He kind of reminds me and even looks like Don from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete""; he's funny as he's sort of the straight man of the film. It's funny how he reacts toward certain things which feels like how any normal person would react.Even thought it was funny, when he tries to help his son out as he is reading some of those psychology books, but unfortunate fails as one book he reads is out of date and another where he's way off on his analysis; psychology is obviously not his strong suit. This is funny because it's slightly true on parents whom try hard to help their kids in some way but fail because they simply don't get it or are trying to act a role which is clearly not their field of expertise; still I'll give the Dad props for caring and trying.But there are two characters that are favorites, John Cusack is just great here as Lane; this is probably my favorite film with him and is one of my favorite roles from the guy. Here he's pretty much your sad sack of a guy, kind of your sad clown which is what makes his character all the funnier as they have a broader range of emotions. You both laugh but at the same time really do feel a broad sense of sympathy for the guy as you do understand his troubles which are relatable as yeah most to all of us have been there.This guy is an underdog that is a cool guy who has a lot of offer the world. From being an artist as he draws some cartoons, a good skier, and other things; but the problem is his self esteem is shot to crap as the breakup has made him feel a void in his life as she is gone he doesn't know what to fill that void with, even though he should look at everything he really has. However, his biggest problem is that throughout the film he's been looking at the wrong person.Throughout the film despite attempts to bite into the sandwich of death and each which are botched though you could say it was a string of luck or even God or fate sparing him, telling him his ex isn't worth dying for. From the void he feels it puts Lane in a state of not just depression but desperation as he's trying to find a way to win her back and the way to do it is by skiing the K-12 but this we know is a useless pursuit and, in the training, as he is constantly rolling and falling down sort of reflects this dilemma.His ex-girlfriend really isn't worth it as we see she has a very unhealthy so-called love life. From not just dumping him for a ski jock that is a grade A blowhole but also supposedly going out with guys that are clearly not of legal age, yeah that's not good. Though the interesting thing is thought the film he never states why he even loves her, he probably doesn't know why either.Thoughout most of the film there is this other girl a French girl named Monique who is cute, played well by Diane Franklin. I really love her character as she is just awesome as she is just full of surprises. In a way she's sort of an angel character for Lane much as Ellen is for Old Pete and an angel is someone Lane very much needs more than ever. The chemistry between both is solid as they both really help each other which is what any good couple should do but also play off each other well which justifies why both are a better match for one another. Let along both characters have been through a lot of crap from beginning to near the end which even more makes us want both to win.It of course comes down to a payoff which in a way is one big action movie sequence as it has one of my favorite chase/races ever, seeing Lane race against the doushebag skier along with one of my favorite one on one fights of all time against another doushebag thorough the film, will he win both the race and fight you'll have to wait and see.True love is worth living for.Rating: 4 stars.",Better Off Dead...
34,drqshadow-reviews,"Silly, Sweet and Shrewd, It's the Moviegoer's Eighties in a Nutshell",8,26 June 2013,"Starring an in-his-element John Cusack, there's no question why this one's still remembered so fondly today: it's a great embodiment of everything one could expect to see from a zany '80s teen-geared comedy. Although Cusack plays his role with a typically dark slant (and many of the jokes are similarly themed), the film's general outlook is upbeat and silly, which makes for a tasty pairing. Occasionally it ventures too far into the realm of the absurd, such as the scene where Cusack's character daydreams a romancing pair of claymation cheeseburgers (which, naturally, pantomime to Van Halen), but it's also those dalliances into surrealism that provide many of its best moments. Funny as both a dated glimpse at life in the mid-eighties and a timeless relation to teenaged heartbreak, it's enriched by a sweet romantic subplot and a vast array of colorful supporting characters.",Better Off Dead...
35,slokes,For Two Dollars More,7,3 April 2009,"Most of me watches ""Better Off Dead..."" and thinks about how cool and funny it is. But there's a piece of me that wishes it was something more, a launching pad for the genial gonzo of director ""Savage"" Steve Holland, for whom this was both a hello and something of a goodbye.""Dead..."" was Holland's baby all the way, a playful recounting of growing up in privileged Greenwich, Connecticut, here renamed Greendale, California, and being rejected by his dream girl because, as she so delicately puts it in this movie, ""I really think it's in my best interests if I go out with someone more popular, better-looking, and drives a better car.""Holland's male lead, John Cusack, gets an early chance to flash and narrow those expressive eyes of his at every twist and turn. And what twists and turns! His character, Lane Meyer, must contend not only with his old girlfriend and her new impossibly-dashing beau, the only person ever to ski the legendary K-12 run and live, but a mother who cooks green bacon, a father who tries to talk hip to him by reading from a 1970s handbook, a paperboy who stalks Lane for two dollars like Freddie Krueger, a job at a burger joint where washing your hands is considered wasting company time, and two Asian brothers in mustard sports jackets who challenge Lane to a series of drag races at various odd moments.""One speaks no English, the other learned English from watching 'The Wide World of Sports.'"" Lane explains. ""So you tell me... Which is worse: speaking no English at all or speaking Howard Cosell?""What makes ""Better Off Dead"" special, first of all, is how surreally funny it is, playing very loosely but working most of the time by following one impossible twist with another. Coming out amid a rash of '80s teen movies that suffered from excessive navel-gazing and pretenses at being taken seriously, ""Better Off Dead"" works more in the ""Airplane!"" vein than like, say, ""The Breakfast Club"". Holland keeps things light even as his film knowingly dials into teen angst.I love the scene where Lane finds himself sitting terrified in a math class where all the other students laugh and applaud as teacher explains ""the three cardinal trapezoidal formations"". Haven't you ever felt so alone and lost in school like that? Holland was just coming into his own as a movie director, and pulling out everything he could think of.Not all of it works. There's a claymation sequence involving a hamburger coming to life Frankenstein-style that stops the movie cold for five critical minutes, and Holland leans too much on the obnoxiousness of a mother-son duo who bother a French exchange student Lane takes a shine to. Sometimes you think of a line from another 1985 movie, ""This Is Spinal Tap"", about that ""fine line between stupid and clever.""But the overwhelming impression I come away with is that Holland was a real talent of his time who deserved more of a chance to turn his youthful angst into comedy. He got a couple more movies to direct, including one with Cusack, but they were not successes and he was limited to TV work after that.Is life fair? No. Is life funny? Yes, especially when presented the way it is here. ""Better Off Dead"" makes you glad to be alive.",Better Off Dead...

37,vertigo_14,Booger Hath I Loved. (spoilers),7,19 August 2004,"I picked up this movie to see my favorite 80s comedy actor, Curtis Armstrong who is probably best known for his role as Booger in 'Revenge of the Nerds' or Miles in 'Risky Business.' He's just as good here as the 6-year high school senior and Lane Meyer's friend Charels.Better Off Dead, sister movie of One Crazy Summer, is one hell of an oddball film for the 80s teen category. It is a mix of strange humor, animated sequences (drawn by writer/director Savage Steve Holland), and a loveable star, to pull off quite an entertaining, and hopefully not too obscure, 80s teen comedy.John Cusak is his typical outrageous teenager character in his role as Lane Meyer, the same type of character we saw in One Crazy Summer, Hot Pursuit, and others; the one where he is always a regular nice guy who somehow gets caught up in unforseen crazy situations. But Better Off Dead offers the most off-the-wall atmosphere for such a seemingly level-headed kid.Lane Meyer is a young guy who's long time girlfriend, Beth (Amanda Wyss), breaks up with him. Lane is crushed and isn't quite sure whether he can deal with the problem (even contemplating suicide until he realizes he has not yet even visited New York). Beth has taken up with Lane's blonde macho nemesis, Roy (Aaron Dozier) (who's character is quite similar to Cusak's nemesis character in One Crazy Summer). As guys typically do in these movies to compete for a girl's heart, Lane is going to race Roy in the dangerous K-12 run (there is a joke in the measurement of the slope because 9 is actually the highest and hardest slope rating). But, Lane is in over his head and seems nowhere near ready for such a dangerous slope. But, since things have gone pretty lousy for Lane since breaking up with Beth, what's he got to lose? The tag line 'Sometimes...you're Better Off Dead' is quite right for Lane. It seems like for a while, everything is disastorous for Lane such as always losing the race to the two Japanese brothers who mimic Howard Cossell; the date with the girl who just suggests that Lane give her the money that a date would've cost and spare them both the agony of pretending to enjoy each other's company; or when everybody in the school, including Lane's geometry teacher, keeps asking Lane if it's alright if they ask Beth for her number).But things get better when a French exchange student, Monique, moves in next door with a fat mama's boy (Dan Schneider as Ricky) and his obnoxious mom who make her stay in America literally a living hell. So, she and Lane Meyer soon enough become friends and maybe life without Beth just isn't so bad for Lane Meyer after all. The movie is great (""Valley Girl's"" E.G. Daily plays at the school dance!), and a completely different kind of 80s teen movies, one that should be in a category by itself, because the things that go on around Lane are so weird. For example, Lane's little brother Badger (Scooter Stevens), who has no speaking lines in this movie, spends the entire film cutting off those little sweepstakes mailers from various household food boxes and mailing them in to get stuff, particularly supplies needed to build himself a rocket (really). In another example, you'll notice that the filming locations used for the slope sequences in which the entire city appears to be covered in a blanket of snow is much different from the sunny, dry climate of the locations where Lane is at school or at home or anywhere but the slope. The Nine Lives song, Paperboy, makes the reference to the running gag of the paperboy in the movie who keeps hassling Lane for his two dollars. ""Where's my two dollars?"" repeats the kid with a paperboy posse. It subtle and unsubtle humor.If you like this movie, try Holland's One Crazy Summer, which came out a few years later, starring Cusak (again) and Demi Moore and Bobcat Goldwaith, among others. It is just as bizarre and funny.",Better Off Dead...
38,Spleen,"Fresh, funny, gloriously self-indulgent wish fulfilment",8,7 August 2000,"The story of Lane's life is almost a compendium of a male high school student's fantasies: every wishful daydream, every fear, every self-pitying reverie.  -A certain kind of male high school student, anyway.  -Oh, very well, if you must know: me.  In so much as I (ahem) remember.  It helps that Lane is not the most dazzlingly decent human being in the world.  Sure, he's likeable.  Sixteen-year-old boys (and very likely, although here I'm in less of a position to know, girls as well) are all pretty dismal people, and Lane has his good points.This was Savage Steve Holland's first feature, and it matters not a whit that he's a little uncertain on his feet as a director.  You might think, for the first fifteen minutes or so, that the comic timing is not quite right.  But you'll soon get the pace.  I'm amazed at how many times I find the gags funny; they're all so good that Holland can afford to over-milk them on occasion without us caring.  The jokes are at once daringly original and somehow true to life.  For instance: Mr. Kirber's class.  In your typical high school movie classes are so anarchic it's a wonder most of the students can read; at least half, and at most all, of the students don't want to be there.  But ALL of Mr. Kirber's students (with the exception of Lane) LOVE his class.  They hang on his every word, they laugh at his every joke, they're fascinated by every aspect of his subject (geometry ... I think)... but this isn't just a reversal joke, for the torment Lane endures in this class of people all more motivated than he is not at all uncommon.Kirber is played by that weird-looking guy who was ubiquitous in the late 1980s, yet whose name no-one seems to know.  I've just looked it up, and it's Vincent Schiavelli.  Take a look at his filmography.  Already you remember having seen him half a dozen times; you'll be surprised how many more times you've seen him without realising it.",Better Off Dead...

It doesn't remind me of high school (the kids in Lane's math class are _way_ too smart, even the jock-types!).  This isn't even remotely realistic, but it's hilarious through sheer exaggeration.  Don't forget Lane's mother and her weird Christmas presents.

40,baumer,"Truly, a sight to behold!",10,26 July 1999,"Better Off Dead is the zaniest movie that I think I have ever seen.  Let's just recap what this movie has in it.  We have a guy that attempts suicide but he can't even succeed at that.  There is his best friend that declares that a mountain they are on in the dead of winter is pure snow, saying "" Do you know what the street value of this is?""  We have a father that is trying to speak the lingo of his kids and fails miserably and a mom that cooks food that literally slides off it's plate.  We have a math class full of genius' that get upset when they don't have homework to do.  Lane has a younger brother who orders books on how to pick up trashy women and learns how to build rockets.  We have the entire male population ( and Barney Rubble ) that wants to go out with Lane's ex-girlfriend now that they are broken up. There is two Oriental guys that want to constantly race Lane and then broadcast it over the loud speaker on their car.  There is Porky from the Porky's movies basically playing the same role here, dancing hamburgers, a basketball team that grunts and of course the most relentless paper boy in the history of paper delivery.  Whoooooooo!  I'm out of breath.  So why do I mention all of these things about the movie?  Because all of these little issues combine to somehow make one of the funniest and zaniest movies you will ever see.  Better Off Dead is so full of energy that there is enough material in here for ten movies. But Savage Steve Holland makes it work.  Don't ask me how, but he does.  I think I'm going to stop here because if you haven't seen this movie you have to see it now.  This is a completely original film and it also one that no one will ever have the guts to make again.  This is one hell of a film.",Better Off Dead...
41,baumer,The smartest comedy I've ever seen!,10,26 January 2001,"My childhood friends and I have a term for a film like this.  They are called Old Time Sake movies.  That is... a movie that reminds us of what it was like to be a kid again.  Movies that encompass that realm range from comedies like Fasttimes At Ridegemont High, Breakfast Club, Secret Admirer, to action films like First Blood, Raiders and Commando to other comedies like Stripes, Back to The Future and Ghostbusters.  Better Off Dead fell into that category because it was a film that we used to watch a great deal when we were fifteen years old.  John Cusack was iconoclastic in our adolescent books because he was in Sixteen Candles, The Sure Thing and a few other films that we admired when we were young.  We admired and laughed at Better Off Dead because it was funny.  I can still remember seeing the commercials for Better Off Dead when I was thirteen. The one scene that they always showed in the trailer was when the black city worker says "" Now that's a shame, white folks be throwing away a perfectly good white boy,"" or something to that effect, as Cusack was being whisked away in the back of a garbage truck.  I mean, make no mistake about it. This was a funny movie when you are a teenager.  But now that I am an adult, this film is not only funny, it is probably the smartest teen/funny/reality film I have ever seen.  From what I know, Savage Steve Holland only had a shelf life of two films in Hollywood and that is because even though his two films probably did alright, no one could truly understand the true genius behind his work and his vision.Better Off Dead is about a guy ( Lane Myer )that has been dating a pretty girl named Beth for six months, which in highschool is like the Silver Anniversary of dating.  On the day of ski tryouts she dumps him for Roy Stalin, the captain of ski team and the only guy who has skiied the K-12. He also plays guitar, sings and is a pretty good looking guy.  After she dumps Lane, he tries first to commit suicide, then get her back.  To make matters worse, he has a mother that improvises when she cooks so that his meals look more like jello, whether they are bacon or steak or toast and jam.  His father dislikes him at the moment because he has purchased a car that sits dormant on the front lawn.  His father is also reading teen psychology books and is trying desperately to communicate with him using the latest colloquial terms.  His dad of course screws them up by saying things like "" Right Off"" instead of Right On.  His little brother never says a word but buys books on how to pick up trashy women and how to build a rocket using household items.  This works for him, Lane can't even seem to get his homework done.  Lane also has a friend named Charles DeMar, played by Booger, from Revenge of The Nerds.  He can't take anything seriously and his life revolves around drugs.  At one point, while at the top of the K-12, he remarks, ""This mountain is pure snow!  Do you have any idea what the street value is of this mountain?""  There is a paper boy that wants his two dollars for papers that have been owed to him and to make matters even worse, everyone wants to date Beth now that they have broke up.  Then there is his science class that loves homework more than any highschool class should be allowed to and his next door neighbour is a geek that has a foreign exchange student living there and he is constantly being challenged to a race by two Oriental motorists that always seem to find him at stop lights.  Also, Porky, from Porky's hates him because he has been in two accidents with him yet he is now his boss at his hamburger chain.  There are enough ideas in this film for ten movies.  There really are.  What is so unique about Better Off Dead is that it coyly makes fun of everything that we knew about when we were growing up.  There is not one situation in this film that you can take seriously but at the same time, every situation rings true in so many ways.  We may not have experienced all that Lane does growing up, but in a strange way, many of what the film says is true.  It just has a completely twisted way of looking at it.I don't think you can appreciate this film until you are much into your twenty's.  You can enjoy it and laugh at as a kid, but you will not fully appreciate it until you can understand it's brilliance.  I watched this film for the first time in about five years just last weekend and I could see more this time.  I could appreciate what it was saying and how it went about saying it.  This film makes fun of every single institution that we held sacred as teens.  And it does so in such a smart way that I can honestly say that this is probably the best teen comedy I have ever seen.  John Hughes is a genius, but for different reasons.  Holland is a genius because he can take a Hughes film and turn it upside down and parody it to the point of insanity.  This is that film.Old Time Sake films are films that bring you back to a time when you were young and somewhat carefree.  These films are fifteen years old and they make us laugh because they are funny but also because they remind us of sleep-overs on a Friday night.  When watching a film like this, only have chips and pop, never beer and peanuts, because that's what we did when we were kids.  Nostalgia can be found in abundance with films like this. 
What a trip!10 out of 10- if you have not seen this film in sometime, believe me, it will hit in ways you never knew existed.  You will laugh until it hurts.  I did!",Better Off Dead...
42,Karl Self,"I'm living in the Eighties -- I have to push, I have to struggle",6,24 September 2009,"Steve Holland first wrote a pretty much run-of-the-mill film script for an 1980ies teenage audience, about an average small-town high school kid getting dumped by his superficial girlfriend for a jock, getting into all sorts of capers with his family and peers, until finally finding true love in the ever-lovin' arms of a foxy French exchange student.Then, as a director, he whacked the plot up eleven notches with as many absurd elements as possible -- such as the hero being pursued by a paper boy who's collecting his ""two dollars"", animated sequences where hamburgers break out in song and dance, or his mother preparing space aliens for dinner. This took this movie out of the ordinary and makes it amusing and watchable after all those years, and put it at least into the same ballpark as other classic teen comedies from the same era. A very young John Cusack is remarkable as the lead character, and I also liked the actor who plays his stoner friend.On the other hand, the movie is often gimmicky and somewhat lacking in the plot department -- as I said, the underlying story is somewhat unimaginative and stolid. Overall, not as good as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but still.",Better Off Dead...
43,CitizenCaine,Cusack Actually Plays A Teenager,6,4 October 2009,"John Cusack played so many teenage/young adult roles that sometimes we forget he actually was a teenager in some of his movies. Better Off Dead...was one of them. The film is a quirky combination of Cusack's usual put upon everyman character, several good supporting actors, and nicely written scenarios that eschew formula until the denouement. Cusack stars as a teenager who has to deal with weird families (his own and the neighbors', who are harboring an attractive French foreign exchange student), the loss of his super-hot girlfriend to the dumb school jock/jerk, the inadvertent drag races initiated by two Asian classmates, and the abuse of his employer while working at Pig Burger! Whew! First time writer/director Savage Steve Holland keeps things hopping unconventionally with funny dialog, gags, and even a bit of some animation. Cusack is enjoyable as always, and the large supporting cast is just fantastic. David Ogden Stiers is good as a father battling a sadistic paperboy, Kim Darby is hilarious as a mother who can't cook, and Scooter Stevens is funny as the proverbial genius little brother who shows up Cusack. Laura Waterbury is screamingly funny as the mother of Ricky (played by Dan Schneider), a portly would-be Romeo rebuffed by the live-in French foreign exchange student played by Diane Franklin, who later takes a shine to Cusack. Even the usually sinister Vincent Schiavelli, as a high school teacher, is funny cast against type. The only faults are the much too old Curtis Armstrong as a classmate and the ultimately conventional wrap-up. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Better Off Dead...
44,khanbaliq2,I want my two dollars!,6,24 March 2016,"I wanted to write a review about Better Off Dead months ago, but, after I watched it for the first time, I immediately became busy doing other things. So, I forgot about the film for a while. But now I'm ready to offer my opinion about this memorable little gem. I've actually known about Better Off Dead for years, but I had no urge to watch it. That's because the DVD cover for the film does not look interesting to me. I also had no interest in John Cusack's work before I watched Better Off Dead. But later, when I decided to watch a number of 1980s teen movies, I saw the original poster for Better Off Dead (which looks much better than the DVD cover) and decided to watch the film. There are teen movies that the entertainment industry keeps telling us about, like The Breakfast Club (1985), and it's these films that people are familiar with. But I discovered that the more memorable films are the ones that don't get advertised and that don't appear on lists of the top films. So, if you're curious about a film that isn't praised by critics, you should still see it. You'll probably discover that it's a good film, regardless of what critics say. My recommendation is to never listen to film critics. I also recommend staying away from those official lists of the top films. Anyway, I had no expectations for Better Off Dead when I began watching it, and I didn't even know what it's about. Needless to say, I was immediately surprised because the film is very funny from the very beginning to the very end. There isn't really a dull moment. The film is so entertaining that I watched it in one sitting (something that I rarely do). The animator Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed Better Off Dead, so he's the one who deserves most of the praise. But there's also a good cast. John Cusack is likable as the normal, depressed, somewhat lazy high school student Lane Myer. Cusack wears an expression of hangdog gloom for most of the film, and this makes the ridiculous situations that Myer get into that much funnier. Myer has problems at home and at school. On top of all that, his girlfriend of six months, Beth (Amanda Wyss), dumps him for the handsome and popular Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier). Quirky performances by Curtis Armstrong, Daniel Schneider and Diane Franklin also help the momentum of this teen fantasy. Franklin is especially memorable as Monique Junet, a French foreign-exchange student. Much like Lea Thompson, Franklin is nice and eager to talk about her 1980s film roles in real life. I can say that Better Off Dead isn't really about anything. It's only an unusual, very funny coming-of-age story filled with jokes and outlandish incidents. But people (including me) don't seem to care because it's still funny and charming. I definitely recommend it.",Better Off Dead...
45,tbills2,I'd be Better Off Dead...,7,17 August 2015,"Better Off Dead is the most underrated great comedy of all-time, just about. It's definitely a top 100 great comedy. Better Off Dead is the most epic and under-appreciated and forgotten great John Cusack film that this first movie and early starring role for Cusack might be his best movie to his name, and nobody knows that, except for me, and now you! John's best movies all star John Malkovich, Con Air, Being John Malkovich and Better Off Dead. Better Off Dead doesn't star John Malkovich, but 2 outta 3 ain't bad! I must mention Better Off Dead is from the '80s, as it is a requirement for any '80s movie that you may be talking about, because the '80s is the best decade of all-time, 2nd only to the '90s. The street racing Asians are sure fire classic and the paperboy who wants his 2 dollars is just as hilarious. John Cusack is hilarious in this and the man is perfect for the part. What a gift to us movie lovers. John Cusack, yeah. John Cusack is a cute boy. He's not a boy that's cute he's, yeah. Diane Franklin is very attractive as the foreign French student Monique, and it's unclear why she did not become more of a famous star. I found her very appealing and much nicer to look at than the girlfriend. Kim Darby is good as the family mom. Booger, from Revenge of the Nerds is funny as hell as the friend. What's his name?

Many of them were B-grade movies with next-to-nothing budget, directed by unknown directors whose careers depended upon the Box Office successes of these films.Some would later go on to have cult status. Predator 1987, Highlander 1986, The Fly 1986, Conan The Barbarian 1982, Home Alone 1990, Robocop 1987, Die Hard 1988, Re-Animator 1985 and many more movies. Note that some of these films have bigger budgets.Moving on to the film, Lane Myer(a very young John Cusack at 19 years), is your average teen hooked onto the girl of his dreams, Beth (Amanda Wyss, 6 years older than Cusack). However in life, things do not go as planned - he is dumped by his girlfriend who hooks up with the guy Lane hates the most: the arrogant and bullying captain of the high school ski team, Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier).Soon he looses interest in life and plans to end it once and for all. However every time he tries, he is unsuccessful. Lane's family is concerned for his welfare, so his father arranges a date for him. This also proves a dead-end for lane, as his date is not at all interested in him.A sequence of events ensues which puts Lane face to face with a foreign exchange student Monique Junot (Diane Franklin, 23 years).

This film is about a teenager, Lane Myer (Cusack), who is dumped by his girlfriend he is obsessed with and has to cope with it. The film is written and directed decently by Savage Steve Holland. The cast gets it done, Cusack was good but still not his best here I think, probably because the script was a bit lacking, i liked Cusack's acting more in more recent films such as High Fidelity, but he was good here. The rest of the cast was nothing special except for Diane Franklin who gave a good performance as a french exchange student that lives across the street from Lane.

50,policy134,Half bizarre and half straight teen comedy but one you remember,6,4 October 2005,"The 80's was full of rather bland teen comedies such as Pretty in Pink and the dreadful Revenge of the Nerds series. Here we get one of the nerds, Curtis Armstrong but i suspect that he was merely in this movie to give it some clout, as the lead John Cusack wasn't really a household name yet. When you look at the movie Curtis Armstrong's screen time doesn't even amount to 5 minutes.The rest of the movie is sort of interesting because of the style of the first half which is kind of offbeat considering that Cusack's character, Lane is ten times more realistic than the rest of the characters. His mother, who cooks rather disgusting meals belongs in some kind of 50's sitcom and almost all her lines are written like she is talking to herself and not interacting with anybody else. And who could forget that pesky little paperboy who keeps showing up and demanding 2 dollars. That scene has almost been parodied to death on various spoofs through the 90's and 00's.The director, Savage Steve Holland, did not have a prolific career but you certainly can't deny that he made some movies out of the ordinary and I am glad that I can remember this as being one of the more satisfying experiences at the movies because usually 80's movies were extremely formulated. John Cusack may not have been a official member of what was known as the Brat Pack and this film certainly is a notch below the Breakfast Club.

It's a sophomoric attempt, at best, to display high school heartache, that fails miserably.There is not a single solitary likable character (with the possible exception of Monique); and I use the term character rather loosely when it comes to this disaster. The so-called characters are less dimensional than cartoon characters. In fact, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons that are better than this. (Hint: Beep-Beep) As such, there is no empathy evoked for any of them. Just the opposite -- I felt nothing but contempt and disdain for the characters, the writers, and the director.Coupled with the fact that the humor is Neanderthal-like (i.e. slipping on a banana peel), this apparent spoof is nothing but a colossal flop.

It does the two things that all John Hughes movies do really well. Have the quirky comedy that is really funny, and have the teenage kids actually act like teenage kids.It's interesting to see Dan Schnieder back in the 80s when he was just acting instead of working on shows like All That, Amanda Show, Drake and Josh, Zoey 101, and iCarly. He also makes me feel better about my weight, because at least I'm not as fat as him. The film is just funny, it gets all the quirky elements of being a teenager down that you can't help but laugh. And like I said earlier, it does a good job of showing how hard it is to be a teenager. Teens have to worry about their future, friends, love life, school work, peer pressure, and most have part time jobs.

We see Holland seeing Cusack seeing the situations somewhere in between Holland's imagination and the platform of the movie (high school role playing - already a confused reality). At key points, Holland literally invents characters on paper or in stop motion animation to further warp that perception.

It's just the way Savage Steve Holland makes a semi-deep, semi-comical study of loser stereotypes, and merges them all into John Cusack, who, in appearance, really does look as a loser (at least in these films). Curtis Armstrong delivers a good performance as Cusack's sidekick (pretty much like Bobcat did on the second one), but lets be realistic about this: both movies define Cusack *perfectly*.

Now, I like John Cusack (he was great in Grosse Pointe Blank and Eight Men Out) and I enjoy teen comedies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but this flick is about as bad as a movie can get. A dark comedy with very little edge and even less laughter, this was one of the biggest disappointments I have seen in recent memory. Now I know why it was listed for one cent on Amazon.com.The story concerns high schooler Cusack whose girlfriend, played by Amanda Wyss (Shakma) leaves him for a boorish jock. The film's title come from Cusack believing himself to be better off dead than minus Amanda Wyss. So, he tries to commit suicide (he really doesn't, his foolish attempts only give credence to the fact that he can't score at anything) a couple times during the film. Savage Steve Holland tries to coax laughs out of an eccentric family, Cusack's best pal that snorts snow and a deranged newspaper boy demanding his money. It's films like this that give teen comedies a bad name.STORY: $$$ (There was plenty room here for Holland to give his viewers the goods but his writing skills are wanting to say the least. He fails to build any sort darkness out of John Cusack's character making his suicidal sojourns pointless and flat. Holland was dealt a hanging curveball and popped the darn thing up).ACTING: $$ (Rather weak here as well. Genre favorites Curtis Armstrong, Vincent Schiavelli and Amanda Wyss do their thing and try to give this some substance but fail.

60,azanti0029,Brilliantly quirky and ballsy 80s comedy,8,5 April 2020,"I was a huge John Cusack fan when I was younger and would watch anything he was in and this 1980s offering was one of many films of the height of the video store boom that I devoured on my movie marathon Saturday's at my friend Paul Wilkins house. Paul was about the only person in my school year who actually owned a VHS player back then, so naturally, I immediately befriended him and with the benefits of my movie knowledge he subsequently had little choice but to watch a whole raft of straight to video releases over the next decades, some of which were very questionable choices. BOD, was, fortunately, one of the better ones. Directed by Steve Savage Holland (A man with a cool name for a film director if ever one was given out) you know from the cool unique animated title sequence that this high school teen comedy is going to be a little different. The plot revolves around high school skiing and car enthusiast Lane Meyer (John Cusack) who is pining over the loss of his recent break up to girlfriend Beth, who now dates the captain of the high school ski team which Lane has failed to qualify for. Supported by his best friend Charles De Mar (Curtis Armstrong - Booger from Revenge of the Nerds) Lane schemes to get her back while keeping the unwanted support of his trying to be cool Dad (Wayne Ogden Stiers, absolutely brilliant in this role) at bay. Meanwhile his younger brother Badger, is having better success at picking up women than he is, and his Mother (Kim Darby) keep her life exciting by trying different cooking techniques including boiling rashers of bacon and inventing deserts that have a life of their own and crawl across the table. Over the road his nosy, overweight, shy neighbor Rikki is trying his luck with Monique, a French foreign exchange student. Will Lane win back Beth's affection in the ultimate downhill ski race or will true love conqueror all? On paper, BOD sounds like another teen angst comedy-drama but Holland's skill is to combine a number of unique comedy elements to the story that he makes every character, including all the supporting cast completely memorable. The film is packed with quirky moments and odd members of the town's population including a psychotic paperboy who continually stalks Lane for his unpaid delivery charges, while two local Japanese boy racers are obsessed with racing him at every set of traffic lights. Everyone in the town also appears to want to date Lane's ex-girlfriend, including even his maths teacher. Holland uses his background in animation to good effect here. Not just with the titles but with a couple of amusing dream sequences including a dancing hamburger. Combined with a thumping soundtrack and a whitty, truly unique script, the film only falters during the skiing elements which it's easy to become quickly disinterested in. This is still truly a unique comedy and its a huge shame that Mr Holland did not direct more than two films, because he was a superb writer / director who wasn't afraid to take silly risks. A shame that Cusack is said to have been the cause of him quitting directing because he was truly talented and just had the guts to try comical moments that others would not have dared. If you haven't seen it, you'd have to be the most cynical person in the room not to laugh at the moving pudding",Better Off Dead...
61,Carrigon,One of my favorite films ever!,10,22 August 1999,"This movie just has some of the funniest scenes ever.  It's also kind of cheesy in certain parts and can look alittle dumb, but that's part of it's cult charm.  Some quick not-really-spoiler highlights, one of the side stories is about a foreign exchange student who gets stuck living with the biggest nerd ever created.  The nerd, Ricky, is just so classically gross, you'll be in stitches with this one.  There are just so many funny things in this movie.  And John Cusak is great.  In fact, I'd say the whole cast on this one is great.  I still have it on tape and love to re-watch it.  This is a cult keeper.",Better Off Dead...

63,jmworacle-99025,One of my top ten under-rated movies.,10,17 March 2020,"When I saw the trailer I just knew I had to see this movie. Here we have our hero played by John Cusack who after being informed by the love his life she's dumping him. To say he is obsessed is an understatement. He becomes so melancholy that he tries to end his life which fails in some of the most creatively and hilarious ways. Cusack's parents played wonderfully by David Ogden Stiers and Kim Darby (who thought she could play comedy so well) who mean well but are clueless on how to help. Amanda Wyss the object of Cusack's obsession is an under rated actress who can play the hot chick or more recently a parent suffering a lost of a child. Cusack's character Lane Meyer gives all hope until Monique a pretty French foreign exchange student moves in across the street. She sees Lane and she develops an attraction and is determined to get Lane to see the qualities that she sees in him. With Yuki Okumoto as the Asian student who learned how to speak English by listening to tapes of Howard Cosell, the paperboy demanding two dollars for the paper services to where there is no extreme he'll go to in order to collect his money.

65,jacklmauro,Halfway There,5,15 July 2010,"I remembered this movie with great affection. Just saw it again. Sadly, memory editing had elevated it enormously. What's really all wrong in this film, and it's wrong from start to finish, is that the bizarre, utterly surreal moments never quite work, or fit in. John Cusack is fine as the boy but he's also a very natural presence (and you never for a moment believe that he cares for the idiot girl who dumped him, but that's another story). So you'd think his youthful deadpan would highlight the insanity, but it only adds to the flatness. It's like the insane scenes - the mother cooking a moving sea monster, the claymation hamburgers, the psychotic paperboy or the math class in ecstasy over their teacher and the impossible work, among many - are coming from a different movie. And they infuse no manic energy, which such scenes must do in an otherwise light, ordinary tale. You just stare and wait for the normalcy to begin again. Kim Darby, Ogden Stiers and other actors seem very much like they themselves were not directed in how to react. Only the neighbor's annoying mother conveys the necessary, other-worldly presence so badly needed. Nor is the film helped by the blatant and irritating use of classic Hughes teen angst props, like the drug-crazy, nerdy friend or the obligatory comic Asians. All that said, BOD is watchable. All it needed to be very good was less ambition and much tighter pacing. And a script without 'funny', Twilight Zone asides that die on the screen.",Better Off Dead...
66,reverendtom,classic teen comedy,9,11 December 2006,"This is a wildly inventive teen comedy that is completely absurd and yet very realistic at the same time. The emotions it conveys, the little details about teen life in the 80s are very, very legitimate, while the gags and humor are completely over the top and bizarre. I remember the first time I saw this, I was probably about 8 and it was on TV and I was completely in awe. I had never seen anything like it. From the bizarre animated opening credits to the hilarious claymation Van Halen music video, its obvious that Savage Steve Holland was a very individualistic and extremely creative filmmaker. This film still holds up not only as a fun 80s movie but as a great comedy, period. The humor hasn't aged like the hair and clothes have. An excellent comedy, recommended to all!",Better Off Dead...
67,gothicgoblin1334,It's Silly...,7,24 April 2006,"Definitely NOT an overrated film, a little underrated, actually. The film stars John Cusack and if I am not mistaken this was his debut? It looked like it for he was only a teenager (or playing a teenager) when they were making this film. I rented it and watched it in the period of a short time. It's very funny and surreal (dancing hamburgers, how original!). I think what I liked best is that they very much mocked Dan Schnieder (Nickelodeon producer who created crap like ZOEY 101 in the US) they made him a fat, jerky kid with glasses, nasel spray and an overprotective mother. It's silly, really but kind of cute, okay, not THAT cute.

71,lauraeileen894,John Cusack at his put-upon best!!,8,13 December 2006,"No one can play put-upon better than John Cusack. With his puppy dog eyes set in his long face, he evokes sympathy even when the situation doesn't call for it. He put this quality to good use in ""Better Off Dead"", when his character, Lane Meyer, is dumped by his shallow girlfriend and suddenly life seems very overrated. ""Better Off Dead"" is a hilarious and surreal look at the emotional roller-coaster of teenage life. Lane's life sucks: His freakishly oblivious mother (Kim Darby) is the worst cook who ever lived (everything she makes is green, or moving, or both). His weird, mute little brother Badger (Scooter Stevens) is smarter than he is, as evidenced by his brilliantly executed do-it-yourself kits. Throughout the movie, Lane is pursued by a psychotic paper boy desperate for his two dollar tip (boy, two dollars actually meant something in 1985), and Japanese foreign exchange students who learned English from Howard Cosell. Lane's only real friend is Charles, a cheerful drug addict and seven-year veteran of the tenth grade. Being dumped by his beloved girlfriend Beth (Amanda Wyss) sends Lane over the edge to attempt suicide, yet there is hope for our hapless hero. He'd find it if only he'd notice Monique (Diane Franklin), that cute French girl who just moved across the street A cult favorite for several years, ""Better Off Dead"" both captures and parodies teenage angst. One scene depicts every student's nightmare: the realization you didn't do an important homework assignment while everyone else has not only completed his or hers, but has it perfectly organized in accordion folders as well. Not to mention the iconic scene where Lane takes a humiliating job at a grease spoon diner, complete with rubber pig snout and ears. The entire cast play their parts with tongue-in-cheek aplomb, but Cusack owns the movie. For John Cusack at his sad-sack best, check out ""Better Off Dead"".",Better Off Dead...

It's very eighties, very bizarre, very free-form and great fun. To give you some idea of what to expect from this film - green bacon, dancing hamburgers, sex-crazed obese geeks, funny animated sequences, random stupidity, botched suicide attempts, exploding Divine lookalikes, snow-snorting, aardvark coats, Howard Cosell impressionists and the subway weirdo from 'Ghost' as a math teacher. If that doesn't whet your appetite, consider this - it's probably the only film in history where people fence with ski-sticks. Go and rent it now.

73,pleiades10,Bizarre. But disarmingly so.,7,18 December 2000,"John Cusack's girlfriend has just dumped him for the biggest jerk in school, and John deals with the depression, anger, and frustration in humorous ways. Slowly, he finds himself bonding with French exchange student Diane Franklin, a beautiful and clever young woman, that helps to build up Cusack's self-image so he can win his girlfriend back.Better Off Dead follows a familiar basic storyline. Main likeable character is dealt a bad hand in life, pulls themselves up by their bootstraps, and ends up triumphing over the people who pushed them down. This formula led to such films as ""Animal House"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"", and ""Porky's"". Not that these films are bad, they are just similar in basic plot.
Better Off Dead however, adds a bizarre surreal quality unaccomplished by these other films. Perhaps this is due to the claymation hamburger sequence, or the unlikely skiing competition at the end of the film.Or perhaps it's due to the parade of familiar faces from other 80's films. John Cusack's best friend is none other than Curtis Armstrong, best known as ""Booger"" in the Revenge of the Nerds movies. Next door neighbor and consummate slob Dan Schneider is recognizable as ""Dennis"" from the TV show ""Head of the Class"". Cusack's boss at the fast food joint is played by Chuck Wallace, the title character from ""Porky's"". And with a bit part, yet one the funniest in the whole film, Yano Anaya reprises his ""Grover Dill"" persona from ""A Christmas Story"" in the form of a vengeful paperboy. I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS!!!!Also has some of the funniest lines in 80's teen comedy, such as Franklin's accidental misuse of the word ""testicles"", and the comment made by an onlooker when Cusack tumbles into a trash truck. Definitely better than the majority of 1980's teen comedies.",Better Off Dead...
74,aquascape,Unconventional teen movie with surreal elements,8,29 March 2018,"I've seen ""Better Off Dead..."" in late 2017. I have a tendency to avoid teen comedies or coming-of-age films once I passed into adulthood. To my defense, most teen films done lately are atrocities, to say the least, with dumb down characters, playing on stereotypes and modern social issues in the wrong way.
Not ten minutes in and I instantly regretted not seeing this movie earlier. It has such a wacky take on teenage days in the 80's, with a hint of surreal and supernatural.""Better Off Dead..."" is about a high school student, played by boy-wonder John Cusack, who gets dumped by his girlfriend, leaving him with suicidal inclinations while trying to win her back by extreme measures. The characters are simply excellent, just mildly stereotyping the teen genre, with a memorable newspaper boy and his eternal yell ""I want my two dollars!""Savage Steve Holland's debut film would assure him as a cult director, but sadly once the 90's emerged, he would fall into an abyss of mediocraty.""Better Off Dead..."" is a unique teen movie that captures the vibe of the 80's and is an essential watch in a period where the ""brat-pack"" ruled.",Better Off Dead...

But if you know & have seen some of the movies I mentioned above & some how 'Better Off Dead' avoided you, or you can't remember if you've seen it, it's def worth a watch.I love John Cusack & his dry sense of humor in most of his movies. I also love 80's movies period. This film is 1 of my favorites although, I honestly have just bout seen all teen comedies from that era(all the horror too for that matter). It's sad to me that many people who grew up the same time as i did in the late 80's into the 90's don't understand what I'm talking bout if I quote the paperboy; or I quote the Chinese guys. It's funny I went almost 30yrs without seeing this movie yet scenes from this movie were engrained in my head. I don't really wanna spoil the movie and so i can only say if you love 80's movies then you have to check this out. If you hate those movies then don't bother watching. I can't imagine anyone out there hates 80's movies but I'm sure some of you are out there. Always some1 who is miserable & likes to complain bout everything.

What he did with Better Off Dead was take the whole John Hughes 80s teen angst comedy and put it in full TILT mode. Everything about this movie is off center, from Layne Meyer's (played by John Cusack) total obsession with a heartless biotch of a g/f who dumps him (he has a picture of her on all of his shirt hangers), to the Chinese guy who taunts Layne while doing a perfect Howard Cosell imitation, to the insane paper boy obsessed with his two dollars, to Layne's younger brother who becomes a ladies man after reading a book on how to pick up trashy women (he also manages to build a space shuttle out of household items..again, after reading a book on it). There's even some trick skiing thrown in (it's set at a ski resort town). Yes, the end of the story is predictable (he gets the girl..the RIGHT girl); it's the way the movie gets there that's so warped. If you're the type of person that takes everything around them seriously including themselves, skip this movie.

You she if Lane had been cast as a female lead it would have been her, but she also fit Monique as she was in foster care and her ""brother"" wanted to date her, so she played dumb.

85,golem3,The hyper exaggerated world of Lane,8,5 May 2006,"The hyper-exaggerated world of the high school drama is obviously the crucial element to its half-hearted success, its bitter comedy and cynicism. Better off Dead rarely strays from those themes, and if not, usually adds new and funny elements to them. We have our dysfunction family  complete with wacko brother, insane Sundays and a mad paperboy mafia. We have our central focus of the drama  the hero wishes to take his life since he has lost everything, or so he seems to think. Of course, he finds that life is not lost, that his obstacles can be overcome, and that the hero of the film must win, in the end. Apart from the cheap photographic techniques of the 80's, the movie is largely well done and the comedy is times effectively. The dialogue seems to follow well, and we see that much of the male high schooler's life is mush driven  that is to say, literally and figuratively. Some bold new elements arrive when twists to the storyline and thrown in. For better or for worse, the plot plays out pretty obviously, and Lane (Cusack) realizes that the confines of high school rarely reveal true life. ""I just wanted to thank you for everything. Merci buckets"" RATING: 8/10",Better Off Dead...

And now at long last it is every bit as lame as I thought it was. In the years since it's release I've read accounts of how funny this movie is. It is low budget crap that is one lame scene after another. John Cusack was a relatively new actor on the scene when he starred in this turkey. So I can understand how he took any role he could get in his salad years. The demure Diane Franklin was a favorite of mine at the time. She is seriously underused here.

88,charliesonnyray,"Weird, Fun But Very Flawed",5,22 October 2016,"I love weird movies. I love it when a film maker dares to go into odd territories-especially in comedies-and talk about twisted ideas which Better Off Dead does in spades. But I also enjoy a well paced story and rich characters which Better Off Dead sadly lacks. Lane is an ordinary guy with an unusual family and the only thing going for him is his gorgeous girlfriend, Beth. However, she dumps him and this sends Lane spiraling into depression. He even goes so far as to commit suicide-even though he's never successful. Things start turning around though when he meets Monique-a french foreign exchange student-with whom he begins a new romance with. If you enjoy Monty Python's style of humor, then you will get a kick out of this. One running gag is that everyone from the mailman to flipping Barney from the Flinstones is asking Lane if it's okay to ask out his ex. Lane's best friend is a drug addict who tries to get high off of everything from jello to snow. There is literally a random musical number in the middle of the movie with a singing hamburger. It's pretty off the wall. However, the pace of the story suffers from all of this randomness. Half of that stuff I just mention add up to very little if anything at all. Remember how Lane starts up a new romance with that French girl? Lane apparently forgot about that since it feels like he doesn't get to that until the third act. It seems like the real story of this movie takes a back seat to any surreal joke or idea the writer can throw on the paper. Because of this, we don't really get much development out of our characters either besides a few quirks. The actors do manage to pull through and make these performances interesting with their own unique charms. To reiterate if you want some trippy humor with some likable performances, Better Off Dead is a safe bet.

Some of the lines and situations in this are wonderful. All of the actors perform very well. Directing was also very good, especially the setups and the payoffs of the jokes.

The bitter person he is today makes me wonder if he often thinks he would have been better off dead. However, before he got delusional and irrational with his bizarre political rants, he made this film.He plays a depressed teenager who's hot girlfriend dumps him for the stud ski instructor. He doesn't have much going for him. He loses to Japanese guys who always seem to want to race, has a weird little friend in Curtis Armstrong (who is absolutely hilarious in this film and steals each scene he's in), gets harassed by an intimidating 10 year paperboy with a switchblade-style comb, a broken down Camero, a mother who's cooking would help the world's fattest man lose weight in no time (watch the movie-you'll see what I mean), a nerdy little brother, and a crummy job. And, to top it off, he can't even successfully end his misery as every time he tries to kill himself he fails, leading to this classic line ""There goes a perfectly good white boy"".When he is not bemoaning his lot in life, he has an active imagination, leading to a scene that inspired my love of Van Halen with the classic ""Everybody Wants Some"". Never has a movie been able to capture a burger coming to life Frankenstein-style and singing and dancing to Van Halen the way this film did. It is very funny, very creative, and again, John Cusak in his best performance as a leading man. Certainly worth a watch.",Better Off Dead...
91,Idolprincess,For fans of absurd humor and silly 80's teen comedies.,9,16 June 2004,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I admit I'm a huge fan of 80's comedies, and that probably affects my judgement as I write this. However, this movie wasn't the typical 80's comedy at all. I'll explain myself. This comedy has a very particular, absurd humor. Unlike a lot of comedies that were made in the late 80's and early 90's, it's not a rip-off or a bad version of something that was made in the early 80's. However, it's not a type of humor that anyone can enjoy. But if you do enjoy it, you'll love this movie and it can easily become one of your favorite. The strange family of the main character and the main character himself played by John Cusack are extremely amusing and funny. It's seen as a teen movie by a lot of people, but I personally don't think it is. It's an unique genre, but it's also easy to wonder if it's a parody of the typical 80's teen movies. If it is a parody, it's a lot easier to understand the typical cheesy ski film aspect of the movie and the romance with the exchange student. But if it's not, then the movie would be separated into a horrible cheesy teen movie and a hilarious comedy. This is what is so strange about it. The typical 80's love story really doesn't work in this movie because of how goofy it is. I prefer believing it's a parody, and it probably is. Basically, I think this is a very enjoyable fun movie that no one can possibly hate. Specially if you're a fan of absurd humor and the 80's.",Better Off Dead...
92,mgchainsaw,This is one of my favorite films that I watch over and over.,10,30 January 2001,"This is just a funny film.  The premise is that Lane Myer (John Cusack) is suicidal now that his girlfriend Beth has decided to leave him for the class ski-jock.  The story line is basically an excuse to go from gag to gag, and the gags will make you laugh 80% of the time.  If a gag leaves you flat, don't worry, another will come along shortly and will probably make you at least smile, and sometimes belly laugh. Depending upon your sense of humor, there are quite a few scenes in the movie that would be defined as your favorite.  For whatever reason, I enjoyed the breif scene with the less than attentive mailman the most, but there are at least 10 more scenes that are close.  I confess that I have to look pretty hard to find a John Cusack movie that I don't like (""Con Air"" comes to mind), but this, along with ""Gross Pointe Blank"" are my favorites, with this getting the slight edge.  I can't really give it higher than an 8 because the movie is far from perfect, but I have enjoyed the movie more than movies that I may given a higher rating. Catch it on the comedy channel when it comes around (I don't think very much, if anything has been cut out).  You will probably recognize half of the cast from somewhere.  Curtis Armstrong is awesome in this movie: ""Lane...I've been going to this high school for 5 and a half years. I'm no dummy.""",Better Off Dead...
93,Shrykespeare,Sublimely Wacky,9,15 June 2004,"John Cusack is, and always has been, one of America's most underrated actors.  He's done comedies (like One Crazy Summer and Grosse Point Blank), dramas (like Identity and Runaway Jury) and action movies (like Con Air). That in itself shows what a range he has, and his face is so expressive that every nuance of emotion comes across as perfectly natural.Better Off Dead, one of John's first in a starring role, is an incredibly wacky movie, with a predictable plot but enough crazy characters and hilarious lines to make it worth seeing over and over again. 
It's always depressing when people come up to you and ask you if they can ask your ex-girlfriend out now, but when such people include:  your MUCH OLDER teacher, your mailman, and Barney Rubble....John does such a great job playing the lovable loser here; we know that everything will work out eventually, but it's a great ride.Just look at the supporting cast:  the shallow-as-hell girlfriend, and the stereotypical blonde jock she dumps him for.  The druggie best friend.  The absolutely clueless parents.  The smarter kid brother.  The horrible neighbors from Hell.  The Japanese brothers.  Lane's boss, who just happens to be Porky!  All memorable, and all hysterical.  And of course, let us not forget the most determined and fearsome paperboy on the face of the Earth!And last but not least, Diane Franklin as the scrumptious French exchange-student Monique.

Unrealistic plot twists involve walking dinners, exploding parents, and a father whose attempt to 'speak the lingo of his son' falls flat short on meaning and long on funny.

It starts out like your typical 80's John Hughes teen comedy, but as you're watching it, you realize that all the standard elements of those comedies have been mutated into something hitherto unknown. There is the love interest, but she speaks only French for half the movie. There's the popular jock rival, but instead of being the captain of the football or basketball team, he's the captain of the ski team (!?). There are the school bullies, who in this case are a couple of Asian foreign exchange students in matching tan suits, one of whom speaks no English and the other of whom can only speak English like Howard Cosell. And just when all this is getting too weird to believe, then come the dancing hamburgers. Once the dancing hamburgers enter the screen, you are no longer watching a movie, but have entered some sort of higher plane of consciousness. The hamburgers make sense; you don't even feel the need to question them. Amazingly, the madness does not lull after this, but maintains itself until the very end. The actors seem aware of what sort of dimension they're in and have far too much fun with their roles.

Maybe they haven't vanished, rather, like the intended audience, Better Off Dead type films have just matured and evolved into the species that includes Being John Malkovich. This film defies the logic of the 80s teenage romantic comedy; a system that you will find in the typical John Hughes film of this time. There is not a better actor than John Cusack that could play a lead role in an off-the-wall 80s suburban fantasy; for Pete's sakes, a skiing team? Around John Cusack's Lane Meyer, revolve a bevy of delightful, exotic characters. The writing is acceptable, but the vision and imagery is colorful and robust.

Also, at some-parts there is a blend of live action and animation, which is really cool as well.

100,thelastjedi_good,"A hilarious and memorable movie, best enjoyed without expectations",9,13 July 2017,"I read the plot summary for Better Off Dead... and immediately assumed that it would be a darker, heavier high school movie than most. I could not have possibly been more wrong.Better Off Dead... fits in a genre that I think would be considered absurdist/surreal comedy. It compares well against films like Airplane! (1980), Monty Pyton & The Holy Grail (1975), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and others. If you're willing to buy into the wackiness, you'll be rewarded with a charming movie that you will quote with friends forever.Lane Meyer (John Cusack) is a high school kid obsessed with his popular and beautiful girlfriend, Beth. When Beth dumps Lane for the most outrageous jock stereotype in the world, Lane decides that his life is no longer worth living, and devises ways to kill himself. The remainder of the movie is more or less a barrage of bizarre episodes of nonsense as Lane fights to win Beth back.Any semblance of a real story and real character development takes a back seat to the movie's absurd humor. Some characters are simply self-aware exaggerations of tropes from other movies (see the laughably hammy jocks).The cast is great in portraying the off-the-wall. Cusack is, as always, mostly normal with lovable quirks while the others in the film excel in their over-the-top portrayals of their mostly one-note characters.Comedy is subjective, but in the eyes of this viewer everything in Better Off Dead... works. The film's greatest triumph is its ability to make the viewer ask himself ""what the hell is happening?"" dozens of times. If absurdist comedy is your thing, this will be a hell of a good time for you.",Better Off Dead...

Cusack was able to pull of this type of role for a few years, and nails it again here. The background characters (the mom, paperboy, horny neigbor kid, brother, etc...).

This movie keeps me laughing from start to finish. The gags, the things some of the characters say, the weird scenarios, and Lane Myer's over-active imagination, all add up to a great movie! Unfortunately when I taped this off tv some time ago I missed the beginning. On my tape the movie begins with Lane's father struggling to get the garage door open before the psycho paper-boy can break another window. So I don't know how the movie actually begins.

The lead into it and the lead out of it are great, because they have Cusack. But, the singing hamburger scene itself isn't up to the level of the rest (although the fries are a little cute).Kim Darby is magnificent. Cusack is perfect. Ogden Stiers is flawless. Franklin is stupendous.You get the picture. The acting in this film is really good, and the casting is brilliant (e.g. Ricky and his mother). One can almost believe that the guitar-playing suitor is a high school student and not someone who looks 25.There are so many completely improbable moments and characters. The director and writer don't obsess over every gag, either. Some of them are presented with just enough time and emphasis to punctuate the humor, as when Beth is seen in the car with the math professor.The surreal aspect of the film is an excellent additional layer that gives it interest.Really, the only thing that isn't pitch-perfect in the entire film is the Claymation scene. Even the adorably clichéd ""girl waiting for the guy who loses out"" — a staple of 80s teen comedies, appears. This time it's much more well-done than it is in films like One Crazy Summer, where one has a much harder time believing that Cookie is going to go for Mr. Average.I skate. You skate.

Plus it has one liners... but they're not annoying like Nepolean Dynamite.It's one of those movies that is funny because it is showing the life of a teen and his mind around his girlfriend dumping him, while there are hilarious happenings that are important to the story too. Like the evil paper boy who wont stop at anything, EVEN A CAR WASH AND FALLING OFF A MOUNTAIN! just for two bucks that the main character owes him. Also there is the guys that keep racing him at the same stop light. And then there is the foreign-exchange student that he falls for but is in the hands of this fat, ugly kid and his obnoxious mother.Plus you have Dan Schneider from the Revenge of the Nerds movies to make it better.

His follow-up work (One Crazy Summer) was slightly recognised by a few, as a clever romantic-comedy, yet this far exceeded it in every way. But the genius behind both has been relegated to the world of TV programmes. A total waste of talent. Just like John Cusack doing gangster movies etc: their forte is obviously here: in the world of inspired and brilliant comedies.If you do one thing in your life, make 90 minutes available to see this - preferably with friends: when I watched this with my elder brother (a straight-laced scientist) seeing tea spray from his nose as John Cussack's dinner crawled off his plate made the humour all the more appealing. 11/10 at all levels",Better Off Dead...
111,MrBallroom,The ultimate teen angst flick!,10,23 August 2005,"If there was ever a role that John Cusack milked until it mooed, this one would have to have been it. His portrayal of Lane Meyer will forever be remembered in high school lore as the Ultimate Champion of the Underdog. I laughed so hard my sides ached and tears were running down my cheeks. What has long been a cult classic, this film did an excellent job of portraying the awkwardness of those teenage years that all adults thank God every day that we now have behind us. ""Savage"" Steve Holland's directorial debut was simply sensational; he could not have picked a better vehicle in which to make his mark! Rounding out the cast includes Amanda Wyss as the fickle girlfriend who is more interested in her popularity than anything else; David Ogden Stiers (Major Winchester from M*A*S*H fame) as the dad who tries too hard to be ""in"", Kim Darby is priceless here as the mother who is completely, absolutely and utterly clueless, Scooter Stevens as Lane's little brother Badger is one ongoing surprise after another, and what is probably going to go down as BY FAR the most coveted film role in the 20th century, Demian Slade plays the paperboy from Hell. His portrayal alone makes the film not only worth watching, but worth buying! To close matters off in the casting department, the chemistry between Cusack and Diane Franklin  who plays the French foreign exchange student Monique Junot, is something that simply cannot be denied. Keep in mind however, that whatever you do  that like The Cable Guy  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT take your eyes off that paperboy! Cusack and Holland do a perfect job of capturing that period of time in the 1980's better than any other film of the period. This film is well worth an evening's entertainment. Rent it once, and then buy it, as you will want to watch it many times over. It took me SEVEN YEARS to find a copy in VHS. The DVD was just bought for $10.00 and change from from Wal-Mart.com.

It's hard not to see what's going to happen around every corner of this movie with romance and people getting their comeuppance when they deserve it. It's fine, really, it was made in the 80s after all and I guess they had a certain formula to them.Anyway, this movie was really funny and I recommend it for its original comedy but as far as 80s ski movies go, you've seen one you've seen them all.",Better Off Dead...

I heard high praise for it every now and then even though I'd never seen it released anywhere.It's a bit of a shame as it is indeed a bit of a gem like the ZAZ movies (Airport! and the like) were in their time. Quite far from the usual cretinous teen high-school movies, it creates a new genre all by itself.Now I finally saw it for the first time at 38 so it can be fun even without the nostalgia bit kicking in that has been mentioned by a lot of others. The sheer creativity and crazyness of the moviemaker is in itself reason enough to see the movie. Several times even.As a native French speaker though, it is quite irritating to (as usual) have the French character portrayed by an actress who obviously doesn't speak a work of the language and who invents a kind of generic ""foreign"" (to a US audience at least) accent. It is a minor annoyance though and doesn't spoil the film.

118,filmbufferx,Endlessly quotable 80s teen comedy ...,8,20 December 2017,"BETTER OFF DEAD is an impressively energetic debut feature for writer/director Savage Steve Holland. First time director Holland is conspicuously the new kid on the block as he saturates his film with so many ideas, a clear giveaway that he is yet to trust himself enough to release the reigns enough to let his movies breath. The results are spectacularly manic but it really works. Amidst the zany comedy and plentiful sight gags (the cereal boxes with all the giveaways cut out, for example), Holland throws in some amusing cel animation, a stop-motion fantasy sequence, and a cameo from Barney Rubble. Yet despite all the mania, the film's comedy has a level of discipline and restraint that ensures all the jokes land and humorous plot points established early on are satisfyingly resolved. One of my favourite characters in the film is super-enthusiastic maths teacher Mr Kerber, played by late-great character actor Vincent Schiavelli. Telling maths formula jokes to his spellbound class, Schiavelli spins comedy gold using that discomfortingly warm tone that made him such a sought-after talent. His is one of several casting choices that are pitch perfect: John Cusak as the self-involved teen who wants to end it all when his vapid girlfriend (Amanda Wyss) dumps him for someone more popular; Laura Waterbury as the odious loud-mouthed neighbour and gas guzzling mother of shy bullish nerd Ricky Smith (perfectly played by Dan Schneider); Kim Derby as the timid clueless stay-at-home mom who makes slime-ridden meals that seem somehow sentient and slide off the plate by themselves (her ""Frawnch"" dinner party host is unforgettable); Curtis Armstrong ostensibly reprising his role from REVENGE OF THE NERDS gets the lion's share of one-liners and he delivers them with so much aplomb; Chuck Mitchell reprising his PORKY'S role is perfect as bad-tempered burger baron Rocko; Diane Franklin as the hapless frustrated French exchange student who is both a fairy godmother and the surprise love interest; monster child Scooter Stevens who wields newspapers as weapons and to whom two dollars means the world; and the super talented David Ogden Stiers as the priggish father attempting to bridge the generation gap with his checked-out son.BETTER OFF DEAD is not for everyone and the film is most likely best enjoyed by those who lived through the 80s and understand its cultural peccadilloes, but if you have watched your fair share of 80s comedies like SCREWBALLS, 16 CANDLES, BACHELOR PARTY, PORKY'S, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION, REAL GENIUS, ZAPPED, or POLICE ACADEMY, you might wanna give BETTER OF DEAD a chance.

119,ninjaturtle89,TOO Good!,10,8 May 2007,"Excellent 80's movie. I don't think it could've been much better. It was cliché, but in a very good way. A lot of people might remember the south park episode with the skiing in Aspen, which was heavily influenced by this movie. The director chose a very good cartoony style for this movie, which went very well with the movies plot (e.g. the overblown suicide attempts, and the various larger than life characters). As a child this movie basically taught me about dating and was definitely one of my favorites then, and even now. I recommend this to any fans of the John Hughes movies of the 80's, as well as the Harold Ramis films.",Better Off Dead...
120,Random Terrain,Better off without it,2,11 June 2003,"I can't believe how many people like this movie. It's cartoony fluff about shallow rich kids who like to ski. The main character (Lane) wants to kill himself because his girlfriend broke up with him. He eventually gets over it and falls in love with the first girl who is nice to him.Although Lane and his family seem to have more money than God (he has a huge walk-in closet on top of everything else), they somehow can't afford to pay the evil paperboy two dollars. The paperboy then stalks Lane throughout the movie which is just one of the many things that lowers the quality to the level of a second-rate Saturday morning kiddy show.If you're a not-too-bright, upper-middle class ten or eleven year old kid, you'll probably love this movie and laugh until you wet yourself. But, if you hate trivial movies that contain silly chase scenes, lame car crashes, idiotic daydreams, and unbelievable situations that the director seems to think are ever-so-wacky, you'll want to avoid this movie.If you like wacky movies, but don't want your intelligence insulted too much, try ""Weird Science.""

121,almdudler,Totally bodacious,10,27 December 2002,"When people ask me what my favorite movie is, they are surprised to hear ""Better off Dead."" The question is, why? Quite simply, it is the quality of repeat viewing. I have seen this literally dozens of times, and the laughs simply do not subside. I've come to anticipate almost every funny moment in the film, and consequently, I spend the entire time either laughing out loud or eagerly anticipating the next laugh. The pacing of the comedic elements is unrivaled; it is unrelentless, never letting down with gags, funny characters, or hilarious interplay and situations. It also qualifies for me as a Christmas film because of a significant segment of the film that revolves around the family's Christmas antics, and therefore, it has become as much a holiday standard in my home as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" I will concede, however, that those who didn't grow up in and appreciate the 80's culture will not be as enamored with the film as I am. For me, it's not only the best comedy of all time, it is in some ways a time capsule that captured my high school years and brings a big-time feeling of nostalgia back to my mind.",Better Off Dead...
122,almdudler,A holiday classic,10,22 December 2003,"You might be confused by my summary of this movie, but viewing Better Off Dead has become a holiday tradition for me and my family. It has a nice segment of the movie set around the family's gift giving at Christmas, and it sort of gets you into the mood on Christmas Eve for what lies ahead. I'd encourage anyone to pop this movie in and watch family members gather around to join in with laughter.I've probably watched BOD about 30 times, and it's the only comedy in my collection that has never gotten tired. I grew up in the 80's and would never say that BOD captured the Zeitgeist of that era; it's farcical and way over-the-top, which is half the beauty of the film. The characters are hilarious. There are so many gags and great lines, and it only has one or two examples of potty humor, unlike a lot of comedies now that rely almost exclusively on it. John Cusack played the role very well, as one might expect. I will say that I didn't appreciate it as much on the first viewing when I saw it with my middle school friends in the theatre, but it has gotten better over time.

123,tony-ritchie-965-605112,Funny 80s Comedy,8,11 January 2018,Very funny comedy about growing up in the 80s. Silly at times but there is always a laugh. John Cusack is a hypocrite to complain about this movie possibly hurting is career. He has been a few questionable choices during his career while this gem enjoys a legacy and following of its own. Highly recommend if anybody has not seen it. Fun to watch during the Holidays with the Christmas and New Years references.,Better Off Dead...

John Cusack is great and this performance alone forced me to watch his career very closely there on.Up there with the greats, incl.

125,htownsteve,One of the smartest and best-written movies from the '80's,10,10 June 2010,"I first saw this movie on VHS back in the 80's, and it became a staple in the htownsteve catalog. I've seen this movie hundreds of times, and it never gets old. The writing is brilliant, and John Cusack shows what he's going to become. Some of the lines are well-known (and oft-quoted)by my peers, as BOD is a staple amongst us. If you are looking for gratuitous nudity, look elsewhere. This is quite possibly the greatest 80's movie sans nudity. The only question I have is this: Whatever happened to ""Savage"" Steve Holland? I've seen his Bio on here, and i love ""Summer School"" also; but ""Disney Channel""?If anyone is on the fence on this one, and needs a kick in one direction or the other, here ya go: It's freaking funny, and it still stands true today!

""Better Off Dead..."" is one of Holland's best films. It's got lots of odd humor, a nice love story to go side by side with a messed up love story, and singing/dancing hamburger patties.

Similar to Savage's other movie ""One Crazy Summer"" with Cusack, Demi Moore & Bob-Cat...but BOD is better. Even tho I grew up in the 80's, I really disliked a lot about them.

I also noticed that this almost seemed like a prequel to High Fidelity which obviously has different characters and different actors, with the exception of John Cusack, but it was essentially the same storyline. Even if you disagree with me in that perspective, you have to agree that it is a great movie. John Cusack's acting is very good in both, as is the case in all of his movies. He seems to have mastered the dejected, desperate man-seeking-woman character as he has mastered his other characters.

The rest of his flick is pure gold.There's really no other movie like this. One Crazy Summer and How I Got Into College (all three babies of Savage Steve Holland who also animated the Whammy from Press Your Luck) share characteristics but they fall flat on many elements. Better Off Dead, on the other hand, rests devoid of mistakes. I watch it over and over and there's not a line of dialogue that I would change. In my opinion this movie's production value is an A+ especially given the era.There's a YouTube interview of Holland discussing the Whammy thing for reference.",Better Off Dead...

Mainly because I wasn't really an active member of society, having only been alive to experience eight years of it. But when I think of the movies, I think of John Hughes, Amy Heckerling, and Savage Steve Holland. This film is a staple of great 80's movies. Not only does it include some of the most random jokes (""why would someone throw away a perfectly good white boy like that?""), it is one of the only two legendary ""John Cusack is a normal guy and Curtis Armstrong is his wacky friend and it was directed by Savage Steve Holland"" films. The other is ""One Crazy Summer"", if you haven't guessed. Sure, they are both generally the same movie but with slightly different settings, and sure they both have the exact same moral, but who cares.

Better Off Dead is no such film; Lane is a relatable protagonist, and his friends, family, and rivals are all very human. The plot is unique and over the top, but grounded in a solid emotional foundation that we can all understand. The characters are a bunch of weirdos, but in the best possible way, and they find themselves in one hilarious situation after the next.

141,Kevin B,An excellent movie about the joys of growing up,10,8 September 1998,"Enter Lane Myer. A likable, amiable type guy who seems to have a world of problems. His obsession with his current girlfriend Beth, his wanting to make the school ski team, his having to deal with a family that seems to define dysfunctional itself, and his having to deal with all the problems beyond his front door.The story, in essence starts off with his girlfriend Beth breaking up with him because she wants to go out with someone more popular: Roy Stalin, the captain of the ski team. With the help of his friend Charles de Mar (who has been going to the same high school for seven years, knows teens, but isn't a dummy), Lane attempts to win back his ""lady love"" Beth. However, he is constantly outdone by Roy at every turn. He even tries going out with other girls and fails there also.Feeling like life has nothing left to offer him, Lane decides that suicide is the only answer. After his repeated failures in this area, he meets the new French exchange student next door, Monique. Although he is still hung up on Beth, he starts to find that Monique appreciates him more for who he is and not what he could be. The fly in the ointment is the house where she is living. This mother and son ( Ricky) team could definitely qualify for the screens strangest family. As Lane puts it, Ricky spends all day snorting nasal spray. It seems that Ricky has eyes only for Monique and wishes to pursue her, however, she has no interest in him whatsoever.The story continues on through the same misadventures until the climatic scene where Lane challenges Roy to ski the K-12, the deadliest slope in the valley and one that Lane never can seem to get the hang of. I'll let you watch to see the conclusion.The running gag throughout the movie is the paperboy who constantly hounds Lane for the $2.00 he was jilted out of.Also, be prepared for great music and some pretty hilarious visual effects as Lane let's his imagination run wild.This is definitely a keeper and gives John Cusack a great jump off point for his next movies. A must see if you just want to sit back, forget about things, and laugh until your ribs are sore.Two thumbs up!",Better Off Dead...

Yes, there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, but who cares? This is the perfect ""It's raining, and there is nothing on TiVo worth watching"" type of movie. Relax, put it on your DVD player, and pass the popcorn. You won't remember any of the plot line, but you'll find yourself quoting it for the next ten years!

147,tyronequin,Better off dead: A bad Movie that grows on you.,5,17 August 2006,"Better off Dead was a B movie, but the story of the French exchange student saves this ill-serious film. Most comedies aren't worth watching, just like most Horror films are disagreeable. If most of us were asked what our favorite movies were, they would be the unread films, like ""Once upon a time in Mexico,"" or something nobody else approves, like, ""The Legend of Billie Jean."" Better off dead starts off like other B movie comedies, and then becomes a more serious film.

I only knew about the plot because I read about it beforehand. If I hadn't done that, I would've had no idea on what was unfolding. Scenes just... Happen, there's no rhyme or reason as to why, I'm not being told a story. This is a series of gags all piling on top of each other and being pushed to me as a story.When watching this I felt as if I'd gone on a bad trip, there's random scenes of people screaming and acting like wild animals, at some point a burger comes to life, everyone is completely mad. Watch this movie if you would like to know how it feels to need to be put in a mental hospital.After doing that meandering for what feels like hours, they then attempt to patch things up and make it a real movie near the end. But the problem is, they fail so hard at that, there is no movie. This is something you put on in the background while you're not paying attention.

John Cusack was born to play this role, no one else has the ""guy who is much smarter than he appears"" persona down to an exact science. There are probably more laugh-out-loud moments in this movie than in any other.The suicide attempts and everyones total lack of acknowledgment of it. The paperboy from hell. The friend ""Booger"" who has a way of precisely nailing the utter ridiculousness of any situation. The genius brother who can make a space shuttle out of spare parts.

Animated burgers, weird paperboys,and freakish characters made this a film I really just wanted to end after about half an hour. The fat gimp boy is irritating, Monique's French accent is very poor, and the guy out of Moonlighting laughs too much. Cusack is fine, but the film is far too surreal in parts for my liking.

Although it does introduce aspects of romance, even that is presented through a, if not several, comedic devices. Off-beat jokes, dark humor, running gags and a fantastic use of props fly nearly non-stop throughout this movie. It'd be foolish of me to say they all hit the bulls-eye, but so often do they hit the board you'll be in hysterics regardless, even past the first showing.John Cusack (Lane Meyers), in one of his first leading roles, is absolutely fantastic here. His ""everyman"" appeal definitely breaks through, and you'll find yourself rooting for him, despite the nature of the circumstance. Past Cusack, almost every actor in this film deserves a mention. From the love-interest that is the French foreign exchange student to the formidable paper boy, this cast here is absolutely excellent, and each lend their hand to a unique style of comedy.In retrospect, a lot of the humor here may be lost to the 80's, but it remains almost perfectly quirky, dark, and at times genius, that makes this, above all, a downright funny movie.The request for two dollars has never been so grim.",Better Off Dead...

A lot is happening in the side plots like the mailman who sorts your mail for you. The paperboy mafia who wants his $2., etc. The animation scenes are great in a crude pre-Eek the Cat sorta way. Anyone who had a mother who was not a great or even good cook can find the humor in the Christmas exchange scene or the scene where the green goop crawls off the plate and our hero Lane Meyer has to be excused. Way too much going on in this movie to convey the total greatness of the whole interconnected plots in less than the required 1000 words. I would still consider this a great stay at home date movie even now. One more note : In the scene where Lane Meyer and Charles De Mar are on top of the K-12 and Charles De Mar states that this is a pile of pure snow.. Notice after he snorts said snow off his stove top hat that for a sec or so it looks like the #42 on top of the hat. Happy ending for the end.. Of Course.",Better Off Dead...
170,HolyHouse90,Cusack!,10,2 July 2006,"I have probably seen this movie 20-25 times and it never gets old. JOhn Cusack is and will always be The Man. This is one of those 80's movies that you just love having around. Everyone can relate to some part of this movie, except for maybe the Asian Howard Cosell. WHether it's the outcast, the nerd, or the bully, we have all been there. Curtis Armstrong goes down as Thee 80's Sidekick and David Ogden Stiers has to be the most unaware Father in America. Throw in a guy who can't get over a break-up, a French girl who likes the Dodgers, and the anti-Martha Stewart as a mother and you have one of the best 80's teen movies ever. And lest we forget, a ruthless paperboy.",Better Off Dead...
171,katesgsdmail,Simply the best...,10,1 January 2016,"Simply put, this is the funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. (and in 58 years, that's a lot of movies) The casting is superb, all the actors chosen for these parts were brilliant. If you are ever sad or in a bad mood, have this movie handy to throw on, and you will forget your troubles, at least for a little while. How those actors managed to get through their lines without constantly cracking up is beyond me. And while all the actors and their characters are terrific, Kim Darby will you leave you with your sides aching. Also, David Ogden Stiers is very well suited for his part. Curtis Armstrong, a stitch, Diane Franklin, adorable, Laura Waterbury, OMG, no spoilers, but a running joke between my late husband and I for years! And John, just the best. Buy this movie - laugh!!!! It's the best medicine.",Better Off Dead...

173,pd_mcfly,about the movie better off dead.,8,5 January 2006,"""Life suck's when your not there"" I would recommend this film to anyone especially teenagers who like the comic retroactive movie scenes. Because it is a good family, comedy and all the characters will make anyone laugh. And because of the characters create a sense of realism that I think many people go through the same problems in their teenage lifetime. I have seen this movie about a dozen times at my house usually with my friends but this time I watched it alone, because Louisa left. No matter who is with me it will make laugh, and will put my in a good mood. I thought the foreign exchange student was a good character she knew how to do every thing. For example cars, skiing, and is smart and tricky the way she keeps her silence when she not with Lane. She is cool too because she likes the dodgers (that is a baseball team.). The first because is that the movie is funny, for example when he was depressed because of his girlfriend dumping him he kept trying to kill himself but all his methods failed because of his unawareness. Like when the foreign exchange student pushed on the gas forcing lane to race the Chinese guys in his piece of crap car. Then they end up going into road construction and landing in a Hugh whole that had ducks on it when they were going to school. Or the part when Lane dresses up like a kamikaze person and finds primer (gas like substance) in the garage and was going to drink it. However, Ricky's mom drinks it first and then goes to like a cigarette and blows up. That is funny right.Well the second because is that the realism is throughout the movie. Like some problems, that Lane goes through is breaking up and that is always a hard thing to go through especially with your first love. He is depressed, feel like suicide is the answer. Few others are, having people pick on you at school or having trouble driving. In addition, sports that can makes a person stressed pretty good too.Plus the movies comedy is not the only thing to the movie. Lane is also starting too fall in love with the foreign exchange student, so there is some romantic scenes that have some more sense of humor in them. If I could play and instrument like Lane does I would play it for my girlfriend, it would get on her good side.I like this movie because of the comedy it made me laugh all through the movie. Better Off Dead captures the bad teenage years and makes hilarious. Also the story plot is unique, and I like that in movies. I did feel like I could relate to it. In addition, I like watching these movies because they can teach me some lessons.",Better Off Dead...
174,custardsoup,one of the best eighties comedies,10,15 December 2005,"unfortunately this comedy with john cusack is often one that is overlooked, I saw it back in the eighties and loved its weirdness and black comedy.John cusack plays a guy who has just been dumped by his girlfriend and so wallows in self pity and is always looking for ways to put an end to his life, which never go to plan. Also has the little guy in it from 'moonlighting' who is excellent as cusacks junky mate, always looking for his next high. There are so many little ongoing jokes in it, such as the paperboy trying to get his 2 dollars back (even going so far as to follow cusack down the side of a mountain on his BMX) and the lil brother and his obsession with cereal box offers. All in all its a very enjoyable silly comedy.",Better Off Dead...
175,lalonnie,Lookin Good Meyer...Lookin Real Good...,9,28 March 2006,"I must give this movie a 9.9, but that wasn't an option on the scroll-down. The score would have been a 10, but I was forced to deduct one percentage point for the Van Halen burgers. This movie is a classic in my book and a favorite for all time. I had just recently watched this movie again, with a friend from back-in-the-day, and I couldn't stop laughing from the opening seen on. (Typically, this would have been annoying if she hadn't been laughing just as hard.) The characters in this movie are perfect! I love the little things, like Ricky jumping after his balloon floating away after the dance; and the obvious things that are hilarious, like a math class where students are actually, well, awake. Great, great flick. If you haven't seen this, go and get it now...leave now...go.",Better Off Dead...
