0,Leofwine_draca,Woo's worst,8,19 December 2015,"John Woo's 1996 thriller has to be the worst Woo film that I've seen. For some reason, the magic just wasn't all there this time, maybe Woo's heart just wasn't in it. For one, the film lacks his typical visual flair for shoot-outs and gun battles, and there is a low death toll. Secondly, the plot has to be one of the most hackneyed things I've ever seen, with the old story of someone stealing nuclear weapons. The ending even rips off UNDER SIEGE 2, but at least things pick up a bit here, with an exciting fight sequence on a train.Sure, there are a few good moments; the bit where a man has a hammer thrown in his face, a bit where a nuclear weapon explodes underground, and the finale where Slater and Travolta slug it out on board a train about to crash, but these moments are few and far between. The miscasting in the film also doesn't help. Christian Slater is more suited to playing psychopaths rather than action heroes, and frankly he just isn't very believable in the role. John Travolta overdoes his psychotic madman role too much, and comes off irritating and childish rather than in the least bit menacing. Still, it's obvious he's enjoying himself in the role, and some of that enjoyment rubs off on the viewer. There are a couple of good actors in supporting roles (including cult favourite Kurtwood Smith), and Samantha Mathis is nice as the female lead, but the pairing of Slater and Travolta just doesn't work very well.Sure, I enjoyed this film a lot the first time I saw it, but on second viewing I realised just how empty it really is. Despite a few moments of impressive chases and fights, this is nothing we've not seen before and a big disappointment. The way that every helicopter explodes in the film is pretty ridiculous too.",Broken Arrow
1,Leofwine_draca,A hark back to Woo's Hong Kong career,8,12 May 2018,"My opinion of BROKEN ARROW has fluctuated each time I've viewed it over the last couple of decades. When I first watched it in the 1990s, I found it somewhat insipid in comparison to John Woo's other Hollywood flicks of the 1990s, HARD TARGET and FACE/OFF. I come to it again after a gap of twenty years and to my surprise, BROKEN ARROW is a lot better these days - huge fun, in fact. It's certainly superior to anything that Woo made post-FACE/OFF, and the entertainment value keeps on coming. The film is exceptionally cheesy, over the top and over-directed, but these things help combine to make it fun. Christian Slater is one of the closest US stars that Woo could find who was similar to Chow Yun-Fat in terms of build and movement, and his relationship with Samantha Mathis isn't bad. Woo is absolutely in love with John Travolta and that love affair would continue in FACE/OFF. The film's plot is preposterous, but the story and action is always on the move, and there are two big action set-pieces (the mine and the train) which contain the kind of massive, violent, well-choreographed shoot-out action familiar from Woo's Hong Kong productions. Great stuff!",Broken Arrow
2,SnoopyStyle,John Woo action with Graham Yost script and Travolta villain,6,27 December 2015,"Maj. Vic Deakins (John Travolta) and Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) are tasked with flying the new stealth bomber on a low altitude test run with two real nukes. Colonel Max Wilkins (Delroy Lindo) is tasked with tracking them. While flying over Utah, Deakins tries to shoot Hale. Deakins ejects Hale and drops the nukes before crashing the plane. Pritchett (Bob Gunton) hired the group of ruthless mercenaries tracking the nukes. Park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) finds Hale and helps battle the bad guys. When the nukes are found missing, Broken Arrow is declared.This has some of the standard John Woo action. It's excessive and fun. I can do without his overuse of the Mexican standoffs but that's also his style. There is good stunt work and lots of explosions. Travolta proves that he can play the bad guy without a heart. Graham 'Speed' Yost finds a way to write another convoluted script that somehow works. This is more compelling that it has a right to be. It is a bit long. It needs to shorten the last bit on the train to make it more exciting. By the time Hale returns to his people, the movie needs to quickly blow up and wrap up.",Broken Arrow
3,kosmasp,Woo's Action,5,2 April 2007,"The second (US) cinema outing from John Woo. It ain't bad, the action is thrilling, as you would expect it. The story is kinda lightweight and the acting is OK. But if you watch the movie you will do so, more likely because you're interested in the action part of it.And it delivers, but as the story isn't engaging and there is not much tension build, you kinda will be yearning for more. If you know (and love) his earlier (HK) films (like I do), even more so. For an American movie is is pretty good. On more problem that I have (but that's entirely me): I don't really think Travolta is good in it (I don't really think he's much of an actor, although occasionally he has a good role -> Pulp Fiction)",Broken Arrow
4,gavin6942,The Arrow Isn't All That's Broken,5,4 September 2005,"Broken Arrow has Christian Slater and John Travolta as two sparring Air Force pilots. Slater is a lovable hero and is very charismatic on the screen, as he should be, and Travolta is a washed-up two-bit actor who talks through his teeth and in this movie makes a horrible opponent for Slater. When two nuclear warheads are stolen by a group of terrorists, Slater teams up with the deformed yet somehow alluring Samantha Mathis (who was also with Slater in the much better film, ""Pump Up The Volume"") to steal back the warheads. What follows is over an hour of poor computer graphics and some very unsuspenseful and uninspiring fight scenes in the wasteland of Utah. Will everything turn out alright? Will Howie Long get sacked? Will Slater and Mathis become a couple under pressure (like Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in ""Speed"")? Check it out to see. This film is not recommended. (Worst one I've been forced to watch by my friends in over a month.)",Broken Arrow
5,lee_eisenberg,Just how many movies like this do they plan to make?,5,1 May 2006,"For the most part, ""Broken Arrow"" is another action movie, with a bad guy stealing nuclear weapons and a good guy having to stop him. I never expected to see John Travolta as a villain, but he does an OK job in the role. Granted, I really don't see why Hollywood feels that they have to make movies involving two hours of things exploding.Anyway, this is the sort of movie that you watch solely to kill time. There's nothing that we haven't seen before. I think that most of us agree that pretty much all the cast members (among them Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Frank Whaley) have done much better than this. Passable at best.",Broken Arrow
6,jboothmillard,Broken Arrow,7,8 July 2005,"I really like action films with a good villain, and this is a really good example of one of those films. Major Vic 'Deak Deakins (John Travolta) and Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) used to be okay friends. But Riley discovered that Deak had a secret plan to destroy a city with an atomic weapon. He is now on the run from Deak and his gang of terrorists. However he does have some help from Terry Carmichael (Super Mario Bros. star Samantha Mathis). A high action, high flying and high exploding film. The best example of Travolta's villainous role is the final showdown. Also starring Delroy Lindo as Col. Max Wilkins and Bob Gunton as Pritchett. Very good!",Broken Arrow
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Wow, What An Incredibly Sophomoric Movie",3,11 December 2006,"What a sophomoric action-adventure story this turned out to be, one in which nobody can shoot straight, people aren't killed when they are supposed to be, the heroes get out of impossible situations all the time, etc., etc., all making this a movie with absolutely NO credibility.Tack on a very irritating female heroine who turns from park ranger to Rambo overnight, and it really gets ludicrous.However, there were a few bright moments. There are some great shots of the Grand Canyon and of Utah and the underground nuclear bomb explosion is spectacular with excellent sound. Then again, one can always except spectacular action shots from director John Woo. However, most of Woo's films are also dumb, like this one.John Travolta was fine in a low-key role but the rest of the cast.....forget it. It's too stupid a movie to recommend.",Broken Arrow
8,rmax304823,Engaging waste of time.,6,24 January 2005,"There are so many stupid action movies out there -- mind-numbing, explosion-filled, cartoonish, slow-motion-bodies-falling, gore, ugly guns, special f/x, mismatched heroic couple of mixed sex, wisecracking villain -- and I've SEEN so many that I'm beginning to be able to tell the difference between them.This is one of the better ones. The plot has John Travolta as the smiling treacherous heavy, and Christian Slater as the true-blue captain in the USAF out to spoil Travolta's plot to blow up Denver with a kidnapped nuclear device. There is a cute red head thrown fortuitously together with Slater. She has nice plump lips, big blue eyes, and the tightly tailored slacks of a Park Ranger. Very nice. We watch her from below as she climbs the ladder on the side of a boxcar. There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars, roll down sandy hills, and so on.But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie. What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two -- a knock on the door, a tug on the trigonal, whatever -- you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned. None of the characters changes in any way. There is no dialogue worth remembering. There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner. I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter.I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu. That's why I genuinely like it. I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin, for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson, for the ripoffs from ""Indiana Jones,"" for the gorgeous Utah scenery, for the rocketing diesel train, Lake Powell, the redhead climbing the ladder, the fist fights, the bouncing Humvees, the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale, the redhead climbing the ladder, the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them (three times), the redhead climbing the ladder.I just like it, that's all. Anybody up for some sesame oil?",Broken Arrow
9,Tweekums,Don't shoot at the nuclear weapons!,8,26 February 2011,"This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters!The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.",Broken Arrow
10,BA_Harrison,I say god-damn what a rush.,8,27 January 2012,"There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition.Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.",Broken Arrow
11,paul_haakonsen,What exactly does a suspicious truck look like?,5,21 September 2012,"Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch.The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis).There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie.I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round.For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in ""Broken Arrow"", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them.There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here.""Broken Arrow"" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!",Broken Arrow
12,edwagreen,Broken Arrow is Broken-Spirited **1/2,5,10 March 2009,"John Travolta smokes it up as a psycho-army man with nuclear weapons within his cache in this 1996 routine nonsense. Didn't Travolta swear off cigarettes after his phenomenal performance in 1977's ""Saturday Night Fever?""Christian Slater co-stars as his fellow aviator taken in by Travolta's fiendish plot to steal nuclear warheads and then sell them to someone representing terrorist organizations. While the premise is a good one, the film soon dissolves into a shoot-up fest between the good guys and the bad guys. Along the way, Slater finds a romantic interest in the girl he finds when he is ejected from the plane.Broken arrow refers to the idea when nuclear reactors are missing.

13,searchanddestroy-1,Die Hard rip-off in the desert,7,13 December 2019,"One more DIE HARD rip-off film, as you found hundreds in the nineties. A group of mercenaries planning something big but put in jeopardy because of one man. This time, it's not in a building - DIE HARD - nor a ship - UNDER SIEGE - nor a train - UNDER SIEGE 2 - or a plane - AIR FORCE ONE - even a submarine - ??? I don't remember which grade Z movie I was in this scheme, but in the desert, with John Travolta as the heavy. What I liked the most in this film, is not the gunfights, of course, with the characters ALWAYS with John Woo ""forgetting"" to reload their ammo magazine ( look for THE KILLER) but Travolta, in front of his locker and salute it. this scene takes place at the beginning of the film, before the audience finds out that Travolta's character has already in mind not to come back to his locker room.

14,hitchcockthelegend,Battle is a highly fluid situation.,6,27 January 2011,"Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography.Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger.John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye.Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10",Broken Arrow
15,Theo Robertson,Dumb But What Did You Expect ?,7,4 May 2005,"Like nearly every other in this genre BROKEN ARROW is dumb with a capital DUM . It suffers from a myriad of plot holes and factual errors that anyone who has surfed the net looking through sites dedicated to the military will be able to spot at once . One early example is when the pilots eject and control have no idea to their fate . It's a well known fact that pilot suits contain a homing beacon so pilots who eject on missions can be instantly traced We as an audience are supposed to forgive this ignorance and this audience member found it very easy to . Yeah it's a Hollywood movie from the 1990s so we're treated to very unlikely plot twists in a movie where the good guy and an innocent woman just doing her job have to stop bad guys so get ready for firefights , explosions and the obligatory scene of a countdown BROKEN ARROW might not be a classic action adventure movie ( It's a little too formuliac ) but it's better than most from the 1990s . Travolta purposely does an impression of Tom Cruise except he's a bad ass and Christian Slater may seem an unlikely action hero but he's far more convincing than Steven Seagal or even Keanu Reeves . John Woo directs in a workman like manner and though it's not his best movie Woo does treat us to some spectacular and grisly deaths",Broken Arrow
16,preppy-3,Sure it's stupid but fun,7,4 March 2010,"Major ""Deak"" Deaker (John Travolta) gets two thermonuclear warheads from the US (under ridiculous circumstances). He plans to blow up Utah if he isn't given money. A buddy of his named Riley Hale (Christian Slater) tries to stop him with the help of park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis).The plot is stupid. It's full of huge lapses in logic, loopholes and questionable sequences--according to this if a nuclear warhead is blown up 2000 feet underground it will NOT harm anyone aboveground. Please! Also there are far too many sequences with people getting shot at who magically escape getting harmed. Still, this is a fun movie. If you can ignore the dumb plot you'll have fun. The movie moves so quickly you don't have enough time to question it and has plenty of incredibly exciting (it totally illogical) action. The acting is good--Slater is OK, Travolta amusingly underplays his role and Mathis is a strong independent woman who doesn't back down in a fight or cower in a corner when the bad guys attack. I hated this back in 1996 (I thought about it too much) but like it in a non-think kind of way now.

18,poolandrews,One of my favourite overblown 90's action flicks!,8,9 October 2007,"Broken Arrow starts as pilots Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) & Major Vic Deakins (John Travolta) board a Stealth bomber equipped with two nuclear missiles, they fly the Stealth over the Utah desert in what was supposed to be a routine mission to monitor radiation levels but Deakins tries to kill Hale in an attempt to steal the nuclear weapons. Hale manages to eject from the Stealth before Deakins kills him, Deakins then drops the unarmed bombs & ejects himself leaving the plane to crash. Having witnessed the crash park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) goes to investigate & finds Hale, meanwhile Deakins has managed to trick the army into thinking the nuclear weapons have been breached & therefore rescue teams cannot be sent in. With easy access to the bombs he intends to bribe the Government into paying a ransom or he'll use them to wipe out half of the country, that is unless Hale & the park ranger can stop him & his men...Directed by John Woo Broken Arrow was his second American action film after the fabulous Hard Target (1993), I personally rate Broken Arrow, & Hard Target for that matter, as one of my favourite over-the-top action flicks from the 90's & for that I apologise to no-one. The script by Graham Yost is as action packed as they come, there's loads of shoot-outs, fights, explosions, crashes, vehicular mayhem & near misses. Most people seem to think the basic story is pretty far fetched & I have to agree but it's by no means sillier than a lot of 90's action flicks like Speed (1994) for instance. What I like about it is that it moves along like a rocket & there isn't enough time between all the fights & explosions for small things like plot holes to make any huge difference. I also liked the character's here, the relationships between Hale & the sexy park ranger & between Hale & Deakins in particular, I just thought the character's & the way they were written & developed were better than the average action flick with themes like friendship & betrayed. I liked it, a lot.Director Woo knows how to turn in a decent action flick & he doesn't disappoint here, while the unmistakable style of his earlier Hong Kong films may have been slightly sterilised by Hollywood the set-pieces in his films still remain very impressive. Broken Arrow probably has more helicopters being blown up & crashing than any other single film I think I've ever seen. Some of the explosions are huge, the fights are varied & well staged & most of the action is done the good old fashioned way on set in camera with real stunt men & real explosions rather than awful CGI computer effects which have become commonplace. The only scene which really made me cringe was when Hale falls off the back of the truck & he then picks himself up, runs after it, catches it up & jumps on the back! I don't think so, the truck itself had at least a 10 second head start before we even discuss how slow it would have to have been going for Hale to physically run after it & catch it up. The violence isn't too excessive, there's not much blood in it & the violence isn't sadistic or gloating as in say a lot of Steven Seagal films.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Broken Arrow is well made with that Hollywood polish about it, the special effects are good & there's plenty of big bangs & explosions for the money. The acting is alright, I liked Travolta (who was apparently paid $7,000,000 for this) as the villain in particular but he does come across as a bit theatrical at times, I thought Mathis was fine as the love interest although I thought Slater was a bit bland & forgettable as the hero.Broken Arrow is a great action film, it has a good cast, great action scenes, loads of explosions, better than usual character's & it moves along at a good pace. I thought it was great & it's as simple & straight forward as that.",Broken Arrow
19,Boba_Fett1138,Average action flick only made interesting by the main villain.,6,17 April 2004,"Nothing about this movie is above average. Average action, average performance's and an average story make this movie a...well, average one.It seemed like John Woo was holding back. A shame. Nowhere in the movie can you see his unique action style except for a few (too few) trademark John Woo slow motion scene's that aren't original or spectacular enough. The only really spectacular scene was the plane crash in the beginning, after that the movie only goes downhill.Who's crazy idea was it to cast Christian Slater for the role of the hero? It was an horrible choice! But luckily the movie focuses a bit more on the main villain played by John Travolta, who is about the only interesting thing about the movie. He is a really cool villain, cool enough to save this movie of being a disaster.The story is simple and not always likely and/or interesting and of course they also managed to put a female character and love story in it.

20,view_and_review,Cut It,1,9 September 2020,"The rapper O.T. Genasis has a song titled ""Cut it."" That's what I was feeling about this movie.""This plot is way to dumb you need to cut it.This scene is straight bulls*** you need to cut it.""""Broken Arrow"" is ""The Rock"" but worse. Why do I compare it with ""The Rock""? Well, they were released the same year, and both entail a military outfit stealing a WMD for money.It already had a weak plot and even weaker script. Then there's John Woo. John Woo certainly can make explosions and slow motion repulsive. For him there can't be enough explosions or enough ridiculous ultra-cool slo-mo shots. But even more nerve-wracking than the explosions is the bad guys' insatiable need to talk rather than shoot as if their words were deadly ammo. I can't count how many times the two heroes were encountered by armed bad guys who decided to give fair warning of their intentions instead of just doing what they intended to do.I mentally checked out when our park ranger turned action hero decided to pursue the highly trained super-terrorists to take them down. I'm talking about Park Ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis). It further devolved when she tried to stop the Navy SEAL from setting up the nuclear warhead. After a brief tussle and he had a gun trained on her, she picked up a hammer, threw it at him, hit him in the head, and killed him. Because throwing a hammer from ten feet away is faster and more effective than pulling a trigger.Bu bu but wait it gets worse. When our megalomaniacal arch villain had the shero dead to rights he decided to play games with her instead of, you know, killing her. Which, of course, gave her time to be saved. It wasn't like he needed her as bait, or she was his ex-lover, or anything that would make a killer hesitate, except that she was the only female and Hollywood doesn't like to kill the only female. It was your classic Hollywood cliché give-me-a-break moment.Flyboy and hero, Hale (Christian Slater), saved the day in John Woosian fashion. He did a bunch of death-defying stunts, creatively killed bad guys, and then won the final fight. The final fight has been practiced by many a action movie. It can be a fist fight or a gun fight, but mostly it's a fist fight because a gunfight would be anti-climactic. Usually, it's when the protagonist and antagonist have run out of ammo or lost their guns which leaves them to duke it out.Well, in this lump of excrement of a movie, the two opponents eschewed guns to slug it out. We knew they would do this too. How did we know? Because it was gawkishly foreshadowed at the beginning of the movie when Hale and Vic Deakins (John Travolta) were boxing and Vic was getting the best of Hale. The whole time Vic was beating the snot out of Hale he was also giving Hale his entire strategy-for everything. So, Hale, being the MENSA genius he was, deduced every move of Vic's based upon that boxing lesson-up until their last fight where he was able to beat Vic's ass and disarm the nuke while doing a gymnast swan dive out of a moving train.Aaagh! what a turd sandwich this movie was. Can someone please snatch the cameras and the bullhorn away from John Woo? He should be banned from Hollywood. In fact, he shouldn't even be given a smartphone that has a camera. If the Zapruder Film were the Woo Film then JFK's head would've exploded as well as everything around him. He's plain awful.",Broken Arrow
21,anaconda-40658,More Than an Arrow Broken Here.,3,6 May 2015,"Broken Arrow (1996): Dir: John Woo / Cast: John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Frank Whaley: Witless action film that might have worked had the filmmakers eliminated everything deemed stupid. That would pretty much require a rewrite. Title represents a damaged nuclear bomb but it could also symbolizes John Travolta's lack of loyalty. He and Christian Slater are sent on a routine flying mission. Equipped with two nuclear warheads Travolta takes control of the plane and ejects Slater. After landing he encounters a female park ranger and together they set out to find the two warheads before Travolta does. The warheads are taken to an abandoned mine shaft where Slater attempts to disarm them but in doing so he accidentally activates one. Mindless action conclusion in full brutality skillfully directed by John Woo. Travolta and Slater travel a predictable set of events. They part in the open then they race against each other to obtain the warheads before meeting in a brutal physical encounter that is predicted from their first physical encounter. Samantha Mathis is ridiculous as the wonder woman ranger. Delroy Lindo and Frank Whaley also appear but nothing of worth comes out of these roles. The film regards nuclear warheads in the wrong hands while the screenplay was certainly in the wrong hands and needed a rewrite. Score: 3 / 10",Broken Arrow
22,FlashCallahan,Shooting at thermonuclear weapons....,5,5 October 2013,"Travolta and Slater star as pilots who have a mission to fly a plane with nuclear weapons for test run.Overacting, Travolta attempts to kill Slater and steal the weapons, but that would finish the movie early, and it's a Woo movie, so we need a little bit of slow motion gun-play...When this movie first came out, I thought it was brilliant, Travolta was on this stupid comeback, so anything he was in made huge amounts of money until Lucky Numbers (remember Michael and Phenomenon?), and John Woo had come from the east with some major movies under his belt, it had to be good.But as the years have gone one, you begin to notice that the film is a little boring in places, and Travolta is awful in this film. Truly awful. And it doesn't help that every time we see Travoltas character, that Duane Eddy guitar piece plays, and it grates.Woo can handle the action, but he seems very restraint in this, turning the film into one of his lesser works like Paycheck, rather than Hard Target or Face/Off (i'm only mentioning his western movies).Slater is okay, but can't get a word in edge ways thanks to Travoltas stupid pantomime theatrics.Lindo and Smith add a little depth to the movie, but up until the final act on the train, it's pretty groan worthy.When I first reviewed this film back in 2007, I gave it a seven, now it's a solid five.One of those rare films that gets poorer with every viewing.",Broken Arrow
23,Aaron1375,"A popcorn action movie in every sense. Totally forgettable, but passes time nicely.",7,2 October 2010,"I enjoyed this action movie starring Christian Slater and John Travolta. Another more action type star would have helped here instead of Slater, but he does an okay job here. Not great, but certainly good enough for this film. John Travolta though is rather good as the somewhat over the top villain. A villain in a second tier type movie such as this should in fact be over the top and go all out. Throw in an ex football player Howie Long and a cute gal and you have your not quite a B, but not an A movie. The film is about two military men where one of them basically hijacks a nuclear missile with plans to use it to get money. Nothing that has not been done in countless other movies, but hey it is always a nice simple way to introduce danger to a film. You have your great action scenes as Slater's character tries his best to stop Travolta's character's scheme with the help from I believe is a park ranger or something to that effect. Just know she was cute. There are great action scenes involving a cave and a narrow escape and a nice finale on a speeding train. Once again, rather cliché, but a train always makes for a nice action scene in my opinion. Though that mode of transportation is becoming less relevant everyday and will in all likelihood disappear all together. So while this is light cinema to be sure it was still a fun movie to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but passes the time quite well.",Broken Arrow
24,Wuchakk,"Some roll-your-eyes parts, but delivers the goods",7,30 June 2014,"I was 18 years late, but I finally got around to catching 1996's ""Broken Arrow."" I remember there was talk about it at the time and then it quickly fell into near-obscurity.The title -- ""Broken Arrow"" -- refers to a nuclear warhead that's been lost. The plot revolves around a duel between two Airforce pilots, Deakins (John Travolta) and Hale (Christian Slater): Deakins steals two warheads in the Utah desert while Hale teams up with a good-looking park ranger (Samantha Mathis) to stop Deakins and his sinister cohorts.I have to admit that I usually don't like mindless action flicks, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns,"" mainly because the stories are shallow and nothing more than an excuse to string together endless absurd action sequences. For an action film to work, the story & writing have to capture the attention of the viewer, like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" both superb examples of the genre. I was pleased when the plot of ""Broken Arrow"" pulled me in and the film took me for a good ride. No, it's not great like those other two films, but then not many action films attain their level of expertise.Roger Ebert complained that Travolta makes an unconvincing villain. Poppycock. Travolta easily owns the role, swaggering around in over-confident non-glory. He's one of those villains you both hate and enjoy to watch. Surprisingly, Slater makes a quality protagonist and believable action hero. And Mathis is just a pleasure to behold from beginning to end. Some complain that she's somehow ""annoying,"" but I feel the opposite: She totally enhances the movie. How so? She's a likable and comely protagonist, pure and simple. How exactly is she ""annoying""? She falls upon a questionable situation and reacts in a cautionary way. Once Hale wins her trust and she understands the situation it's easy to root for her. Moreover, she looks great in tight ranger pants climbing a railcar, lol. So where's the problem? There are other positives, like the great location cinematography (shot in Utah, California, Arizona and Montana); the outstanding score and the wall-to-wall fun action scenes. Unfortunately, this last positive also morphs into a negative. There are so many action scenes that you'll start laughing at the screen. I can't help but wonder how the park ranger suddenly transforms into Indiana Jones. Was she in serious training in her spare time? Also, in order to include as many over-the-top action scenes as possible the filmmakers completely omit details, like how is it that the ranger goes utterly undetected on the boat? They don't even show.But these types of things don't matter much in an action movie like this; it's all about going for a fun ride and ""Broken Arrow"" delivers the goods from most angles.The film runs 108 minutes.GRADE: B",Broken Arrow

It created quite the thirst.Getting down to it, the movie's memorable mostly because of John Travolta, who's clearly relishing the bad guy role here. It's a balls-to-the-wall performance (keeping with the tone of the movie) as he feasts on the scenery in almost every one of his minutes on screen. Seriously, the guy's working on a higher level than the rest of the cast, and walks away with the movie from the more earnest Slater.Aside from the delectable Samantha Mathis, it's all slo-mo shootouts and explosions. Bottom line, good old-fashioned cheap thrills.7/10",Broken Arrow

I enjoyed it the first time, but only on second viewing did it strike me how average, misused and mediocre this film is.Christian Slater and John Travolta play US pilots who have to fly nuclear weapons cross country. Unfortunately, half way, Travolta tries to hijack the ship and shoot Slater, but fails. He releases the nukes over sandy dunes, then launches himself and Slater out of the ship.After crashing on ground, Slater teams up with a cutesy-tutesy ranger and the two go after Travolta to find out his plan.Travolta plans on stealing the nukes and making the government pay to get them back, or else he will nuke the south-west of the US. So Slater and what's-her-face end up fighting for the nukes on a speeding train.""Broken Arrow"" borrows from just about every single action film out there, including ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""Speed,"" ""Die Hard,"" and the list goes on and on. Mad Man steals nukes; makes people pay; Good Guy fights him. Seen it, right? Sadly, right. Everything is cliched, but the worst thing is that it has been done before, and ten times better. ""Speed"" was just about one of the most explosive films in recent years; ""Broken Arrow"" is just another rip-off.Director John Woo, who usually makes quite good kung-fu/slow-motion flicks (""Face/Off"" is one of the best action films in recent years), fails here at what he usually does so easily. Some of his mistakes are classics.1. He presents us with an overused plot (as I said before), and shallow characters and dialogue. Now sometimes the dialogue is fun, like when an attack chopper is chasing Slater and the pilot says, ""Let's have some fun.""Because if he didn't say that we'd be saying, ""C'mon, he's in a helicopter and he can't shoot the guy?"" But because he says he is playing with them, it makes it more fun to watch.There's also a part where the female lead runs at a computer nerd working on a nuclear bomb, and he grabs her and says, ""You thought I was a computer nerd, didn't you? Lady, I was a Navy Seal!""Stuff like that is great, but the other things characters say are pretty shallow.2. With a plot (and characters) as shallow as this, he tries to make everything very dramatic and tense and symbolic. In an intelligent action film like ""Face/Off"" that works, but here the characters ARE shallow, and when we see them walking in slow motion making appearances (look at the scene where Travolta walks over a sand dune) just looks stupid. I nearly laughed when I saw Travolta filmed in slow-mo, and the whole thing with the twenty dollars is both overused and misused.3. Too many explosions for its own good actually makes the film boring after a while. Truly. We get so used to the explosions that pretty soon they just get tiring and boring. I was getting pretty tired watching this flick, and thought about flipping it off at one point.4. The ending (spoilers) involves John Travolta fighting in a train with Christian Slater over a remote control that makes nuclear bombs go off. Things like that have been done before, and while the ending is particularly messy and nice, I still have seen better endings (""Face/Off,"" ""The Rock,"" ""Speed""--to name more recent ""explosive"" movies).I don't hate this film, and it is okay, but I'd never strongly recommend it, mainly because it is worn, misused, and slightly entertaining, but not entertaining enough.Before I close this review, I want to address one more thing. The nuclear bomb remote. Now, hold on a sec.Does it seem odd to you that the fate of 500,000 people can be held within a single remote control? Is this what our tax-money goes towards? So computer nerds can make really large digital readouts that look like alarm clocks, with a blinking interface that looks like a cell phone? Does our money pay so some guy can hold a TV-remote and determine the fate of half a million souls?I sure hope not.",Broken Arrow

He demands $250,000,000 from the government in return for the warheads and his co-pilot, Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and U.S. park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) attempt to stop him.This movie has some good direction and a fast-paced plot that kept the story interesting and captivating. The acting was OK for the most part and, from what I remember, there is much edge-of-your-seat excitement seeing Hale pit against Deakins in the warhead mission after he gets beaten by Deakins in a boxing match earlier in the movie. Travolta portrayed a very sneaky and formidable villain and Slater gave a heroic portrayal of the protagonist. Overall, it's a good action flick to pass the time.Grade B",Broken Arrow

I saw it many more times on VHS, I believe and maybe a couple of times on DVD in the 90s. Haven't seen it since. For some reason, I chose tonight, on its anniversary weekend - purely by coincidence, to revisit it. And I wasn't too disappointed.Yeah, it's total 90s. Total John Woo. But...not total Travolta. He was only on the cusp of going crazy back then.As always, nukes are the bargaining chip for the bad guy and the smaller mirror of a good guy must break all the rules to save the inevitable love interest thrust into the action. Will our hero save the Princess, nukes and countless lives in this desert-set action?Ever since Pump up the Volume I had a crush on both Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis. (Don't ask.) Nice they continued to star together in Fern Gully (still haven't seen) and this film. They really do have some great chemistry. While Slater would continue a bit with his career, I was always sad she really didn't take off.Nevertheless, it's a better movie with them in it, Travolta still tame though fun and mostly, if not no-CGI action set pieces. It's not perfect - the bad guys have PLENTY of opportunities to take out our heroes, but don't because...movie needs to happen, but it's fun and harmless.If you like 90s action tropes, this is for you.

33,g-bodyl,Features Plenty of Action!,8,10 December 2013,"Broken Arrow is your typical John Woo movie because it does deliver the thrills. As John Woo's first big budget film, he does a decent job. While the story may not be consistent and the film seems to be a little overlong, there is plenty of action and explosions to keep action junkies happy. Given the fact that there are two big stars to carry the film, it's not a bad film at all.John Woo's film is about two bombers named Hal and Deakins who are stealth bombers and are assigned to an exercise that features live nuclear weapons. But the weapons are eventually stolen by a surprising turn of events and that may cause some serious trouble if weapons are not found.Christian Slater and John Travolta are the two main stars of the film and they do a solid job. I sometimes find it hard to see Travolta as a baddie and he does well overall. But, I can't help mention that there is this cheesy scene when we first discover he is indeed the bad guy. Slater does really good and he is the guy we love to root for.Overall, this is a good movie that certainly doesn't back down on the action. In fact, the final forty minutes of the film is just action. But being a Woo film, the action is wonderfully staged and often engaging. A weak-ish story does not really hinder this film all too much.

34,CuriosityKilledShawn,More Holes Than A Truckload Of Old Socks,5,4 January 1999,"Imagine a nuclear apocalypse movie from hardcore Asian director John Woo, written by the guy who wrote Speed, and starring John Travolta as the villain. Does it sound good? It might have made for a good pitch to a Fox executive but as a movie it's pretty damn pedestrian.The problem is that the uninspired, slow, plodding story is full of holes. There are so many errors and mistakes in the plot that you'll be hard pushed to find a more illogical and nonsensical movie. Travolta's campy performance doesn't help matters either. He seems to be under the impression that every nuance he's worked into the character is cool and slick, but Vic Deakins really is one of the most annoying bad guys of the 90s, purely on his own arrogance. Travolta is, without a doubt, miscast in the role. Deakins has clearly lost his mind, though we never feel the slightest bit of empathy for him, which is trademark of John Woo villains. But his direction is almost entirely muted too (it's practically a generic action film), with little of his usual flair. It's supposed to be fast paced, going from one climax/hair's breadth escape to the next, but it's padded out with dozens of 'helicopters just flying around' scenes.Christian Slater is simply okay as the stupidly-named Riley Hail, the hero of the flick, and the gorgeous Samantha Mathis doesn't have much to do other than stand around looking distressed and pretty. When her beautiful face isn't on screen the film truly lags, which is a tragedy for an action film.And how many helicopters did they blow up in this film? It seems as if a helicopter blows up every five minutes. It becomes so dull and repetitive. Boom! An explosion! Wow! What so interesting about the zillionth ball of flame rising into the air? The only thing that saves the movie from a lower rating is Hans Zimmer's highly exciting and atmospheric score.

35,The-Sarkologist,A John Woo Action Flick from Hollywood,7,5 November 2011,"When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North.Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting.The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.",Broken Arrow

43,dee.reid,"Travolta vs. Slater in ""Broken Arrow""",7,25 March 2005,"""Broken Arrow,"" John Woo's second U.S. feature, is perhaps as exciting as an action movie could get, but somewhere in there, much like the nuclear warheads that are the pawns of much of the film's dialogue, things get lost along the way.It could be stated that Woo is one of the most valuable directorial talents Hollywood has seen, since making his American debut on 1993's ""Hard Target,"" which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme. Woo was already an established director in his native China, with several blazing action movies to his credits. But, go through any of Woo's movies (Chinese or American) with a fine-tooth comb, and you'll be hard-pressed to find anything that doesn't show S-K-I-L-L.Fans and critics would argue that Woo's career has been wildly uneven in America, both camps being eager to make the claim that his American efforts are a mixed bag, and that 1997's ""Face/Off"" is probably the peak of his career here.1996's ""Broken Arrow"" is one of the director's most controversial American efforts, with star John Travolta playing bad guy Vic Deakins and Christian Slater as Riley Hale, the good guy. The unlikely pair star as two Air Force pilots flying a stealth bomber over the Utah desert, hauling two nuclear warheads, and things get ugly when Deakins gets the idea to steal the nukes and then sell them to some anonymous terrorist organization that plans to blackmail the government.Soon the government gets wind of the incident, as countless Washington bureaucratic stereotypes argue over how to keep the situation from the press. They eventually dub the incident a ""broken arrow,"" which is the term that's used to describe what happens when a nuclear weapon is lost. (***NOTE*** According to IMDb, the term ""broken arrow"" actually refers to when a warhead is accidentally detonated; the real term for when a weapon is lost is called an ""empty quiver."" I guess the execs at Twentieth Century Fox thought that ""broken arrow"" had a lot more selling power to it.)What ensues of course, are plenty of stylized action scenes as the two dueling participants try to one-up the other and try to anticipate the opponent's next move. Along for the ride is Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis), who bears witness to the action and teams with Hale to try to stop the mad Deakins.From the get-go, the plot quickly begins to resemble ""Die Hard"" and ""Under Siege,"" in that the characters quickly dive into the archetypes developed in those two action movie classics. But under the expert and skillful tutelage of director Woo, the action is given that extra kick that elevates the material above any average qualities.The action scenes have those ultraviolent attributes that's become trademark of the director's films, complete with the duel-wielding gunplay, slow-motion actions shots, and the two men that are at constant war with one another, persistently trying to outdo the other man's actions.I certainly enjoyed ""Broken Arrow,"" despite its inconsistencies and (supposed) gaps in logic.

From beginning to end we are treated to pulse pounding fighter jet chases, delightfully cheesy dialogue, bone crunching man to man combat, and endless shootouts bathed in the bloody, nerve shattering glory that only the 90's could deliver. Woo brings his operatic grace out to the desert, and amongst the constant brutish blunt force trauma, his pointed touch is unmistakable. John Travolta gives a loony toons worthy performance that's so far over the top, he shatters the ceiling and blasts off into orbit, grimacing like the joker hijacking an F18. He knows he's in camp territory too, and milks it. He plays Deakins, a jaded lunatic Air Force pilot who absconds with two deadly nuclear warheads, intent on selling them to radicals. Christian Slater is Hale, his second in command, who finds himself on a warpath with Travolta as he chases him through the desert. Woo and team surgically remove any unnecessary, dragging plot lines and distill their process to one simple formula: action. Furious quantities of it too, and indeed Slater finds himself constantly hopping trains, emptying clips into countless paramilitary cannon fodder and taking down helicopters he scarcely finds time to breathe. He gets support in the obligatory female lead, feisty park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis holds her own amongst the boys splendidly). Woo is an action maestro, and he unleashes a hell storm of beautifully staged set pieces and delirious fight scenes for fans of the genre to bask in. Accompanied by Hans Zimmer's thunderous, effortlessly cool score, it's a real treat. Supporting our three leads are Kurtwood Smith, Chris Mulkey, Bob Gunton, Frank Whaley, Howie Long, Delroy Lindo and Daniel Von Bargen filling out the respective genre archetypes that we love to see. It doesn't have the 007 esque class or panache of Face/Off, but it has plenty of sound and fury to slake anyone's lust for gaudy, excessively enjoyable slash and burn action that's off the rails.",Broken Arrow
47,questl-18592,The CW Presents: Broken Arrow,6,4 February 2021,"Watching this back to back with Face/Off is an odd experience. I think what makes Face/Off work is it's utter wackiness and a lot of that really hinges on Cage's ability to play unhinged like no one else and Travolta trying to emulate it. In this, we have Travolta and Slater, both being a little too dialed down in a movie that I like but find to be pretty average. There's some fun dialogue and a few interesting scenes but I've seen this a few times and it feels so generic for long stretches it's hard to really love it.What it is though is perfect background fodder. You don't really have to pay attention to much to follow the story, sometimes fun things happen but mostly it's just ""Oh look, more desert.""",Broken Arrow
48,a_chinn,"Disappointing by John Woo standards, but solid by US action film standards",6,3 September 2017,"Hong Kong action maestro John Woo's most bland of American action films. It's not a bad action flick and is actually better than most, but it's a pretty dull script about corrupt US military man John Travolta trying to steal a nuclear warhead and his subordinate, Christian Slater, trying to stop him with the help of a plucky park ranger, Samantha Mathis, which make me want to consider this film a sequel to ""Pump Up the Volume."" The action is decent and there are Woo trademarks like two gun, Mexican standoffs, enemies back-to-back on opposite sides of a wall, etc. but it feels like he's just going through the motions. The studio supposedly heavily re-cut the film and maybe there exists a director's cut that's much better. Disappointing for a John Woo film, but satisfying enough by Hollywood action film standards.",Broken Arrow
49,PredragReviews,Travolta carries this movie!,8,18 March 2017,"In his second Hollywood action movie, John Woo lives up to his tag- name ""The Mozart of Mayhem"" : and he certainly doesn't disappoint! One of the best things about this film was seeing a strong female role played by Samantha Mathias. For once Hollywood used a woman who did not have to rely upon a man to save her. This was not a ""love interest"" part, it could easily have been played by male or female. The direction was good, as with all John Woo's work, and not cluttered up with too many special effects. The action rattled along. John Travolta made an excellent villain and delivered some pretty cool lines - all credit to the script here for avoiding too much cheesy dialogue. Delroy Lindo as ever, was good, as was Christian Slater - good guys are never as much fun to watch as the villains!John Woo imposes his signature dramatic flair and, so, elevates this from the more generic action thrillers. The slo-mo balletic action beats. The poetic gun-play choreo. The prolonged stand-offs. The flash on this guy! Is it a case of style over substance for this movie? Probably. The story is essentially Slater and Travolta in a cat-and-mouse chase that encompasses the canyons and hills of the desolate Utah badlands. So, it's a travelogue, as well. This movie is far-fetched and mindless and anathema to airtight plotting. If nothing else, this movie is worth it for reuniting Slater and Samantha Mathis who rocked it so hard in ""Pump Up the Volume"". John Travolta is terrific. Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice, sane soldier doing his duty. The love interest isn't an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty. She is cute, earthy, and actually believable. If you want a film that delivers well paced action, some great one-liners and plenty of thrills, Broken Arrow is one to watch.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Broken Arrow
50,philip_vanderveken,"A typical action movie, but certainly one of the better in the genre.",6,8 November 2004,"Broken Arrow is a typical action movie, but it is a nice one. The movie starts with John Travolta and Christian Slater in a boxing ring. I didn't know what kind of movie this was, so I thought I was going to see a movie like Rocky or perhaps Raging Bull. But I was wrong, this movie isn't about boxing at all... It's about the air force pilot Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, on a test mission with a stealth bomber. He has two nuclear bombs on board which he wants to steel. He only has one problem: his co-pilot and friend Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater). He betrays him, but Hale survives the plane crash. With the help of a park ranger Hale will have to save the nukes before everything is blown away.I know, it all has been done many times before and yes it is all very Hollywood, but it is till nice to watch thanks to the actors' performances (especially Travolta), the nice special effects and stunts. I'm sure that the fans will love all the action scenes which take place really everywhere: on a train, with helicopters, car chases in the desert, a lot of shooting... everything you can imagine. Even though I'm not a fan of action movies I still give it a 6.5/10. I'm sure a lot of people will hate it, but the fans of action movies certainly should watch this one.",Broken Arrow

53,Terryfan,Action Packed and Underrated,8,2 September 2015,"Broken Arrow is one of my favorite movies and perhaps one of the most underrated movies ever.It feature a lot going for it, Good cast, good plot and very good directing.The plot of Broken Arrow centers around two pilots Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slate) and Major Vic 'Deak' Deakins (John Travolta) are order to fly a B-3 Bomber carrying two live nuclear warheads however Deakins ends up betraying Hale and is working a deal to sell the stolen nuclear warheads.He eject Hale from the plane and meets with his team to sell the nukes.However Hale survives the attack and begins working with Park Ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) and it is up to them to put a stop to Deakins and his men before it is too late.Director John Woo did a really good job with the camera angles for the action scenes and knew exactly what to do at the right moment.The Action scenes in this film are very good it goes to show the 90s were good to action films. The Scene where the plane fly over Terry and she falls backward the shot was very well done. My personal favorite scene in this movie is when Hale and Terry first meet and they get into a fight that scene was set up just right and they end up joining forces.There are a lot of tense moments in the film and you will be wondering what would happen nextPlus the writing for the film has some smart one liners and they actually made the story and characters enjoyable. John makes a twisted villain, Samantha does pretty well in this film and Christian shows how well he could do given the right people.The score in the film matches the story and action in the film's final fight it really shows. The Stunts are very good as well and it just goes to show that the film does what it can. Plus the creative work that went into the action scenes is smart.Plus the climax of the film is balance really well. Broken Arrow just does a lot to make it a worthy film in the action series and it should get more creditWith a good story, good action scenes and John Woo directing it should be right up there with the best films of the 90s I give Broken Arrow an 8 out of 10.",Broken Arrow

55,vip_ebriega,BROKEN ARROW's one heck of a joy ride!,8,12 May 2008,"My Take: Mindless, balls-to-the-wall action thriller. Grab on to that chair.BROKEN ARROW may be required to take a deep long breath, because when it starts, it's a ripping action-packed joy ride complete with guns, explosions, action heroes, great baddies, helicopters, jeeps, chases and all under the great helm of Hong Kong action god John Woo, here having a filed day with special effects, stunts and style. It may be off on implausibility, but you won't need much to think about once the theater gets dark. And when the theater does get dark, and the film starts, the action just keeps pouring in. Woo delivers style over substance (there's more action here than plot), but what style! This is one of the finest piece of action escapism in years, it's also one of the most stylish ones.John Travolta and Christian Slater star as two military pilots who volunteers to transport two nuclear warheads via Stealth Bomber jet. Turns out, the true reason is Maj. Deakins (Travolta), who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time, is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom. When he ejects his partner Capt. Riley Hale (Slater) and crashes the jet in the middle of the desert, Hale is out to stop his old partner from detonating the nuclear bombs if his demands of a large amount of cash is met. Samantha Mathis co-stars as a local sheriff Terry Carmichael who gets caught up in the entire mess, and ends up helping Hale out to stop Deakins from going ballistic (there are very few romantic in-turns between the two, just for the good of it).The film runs at 108 minutes, and Woo doesn't let things up. There's action here and action there. It's wall-to-wall full of action and less plot in comparison. The film's plot resembles that of the previous year's hit SPEED, which may due to the writer being Graham Yost, who also wrote that recent blockbuster hit. But who cares, both films take liberty from the DIE HARD films, and they both turned up well. In the matter of execution, this derivative affair is brought with style and pure wall-to-wall action and thrills. And, under Woo's hands, the action is done with style and freshness.Although with a large amount of violence, Woo is the kind of action who treats them like paint in his canvas. Action fans will be pleased by how who treats the heart-pounding excitement and pure action as his ballet . It's action filmdom as a form of art. Highly recommended!Rating: **** out of 5.",Broken Arrow
56,fmarkland32,Slater's final hour...,4,3 September 2006,"Christian Slater stars as Riley Hale, an air force pilot who finds himself the only able to take back a nuclear weapon from Vic Deakins (A shamelessly hammy John Travolta). Seems that Deakins is out to launch it due to him being passed up for promotions and the like. Of course aiding our hero is Samantha Mathis who is a park ranger. The problem with Broken Arrow is that it is too hollywoodized for John Woo to really work with. The premise has been done so many times that even John Woo's approach seems mundane. Sure there are some moments that excite and Woo crafts some decent suspense among the action sequences but generally you get the feeling you have seen it before and basically it is all half hearted. Worst of all is that it has Howie Long who is quite simply terrible in the role as head mercenary. The characters themselves never engage and really the movie never builds enough momentum. Certainly in comparison to Woo's HK work and even his work in Hard Target, Broken Arrow is nothing but a gigantic disappointment.* * out of 4-(Fair)",Broken Arrow
57,ivo-cobra8,John Woo's classic one of his best 90's action films till it's date!,10,22 January 2016,"Broken Arrow (1996) is one of my favorite John Woo best US action films alongside Hard Target which is my first John Woo favorite film, Broken Arrow is my third personal favorite John Woo action film that I love to death! Hard Target was his first American movie, this is his second American movie, which I think is incredible classic action thriller from the 90's I have ever saw. It is going to be 20. years since this movie come out and i still love it today more than any other movie.I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. He acted convincing as the main villain Deakins in this movie. Broken Arrow has a great score, great actors and different style of terrorists, who stole nuclear warheads, but didn't took over some plant or building or plane or train etc.. It is completely different action movie. Christian Slater was awesome as the main hero. I love this movie and it is never too long or boring unlike Face/Off. In my honest opinion the movie to me is compared to Die Hard and it is one of John Woo's best underrated action movies but that is just my opinion. It is a die hard movie in a desert heat much a like as Stallone's Cliffhanger. But with very different story and it is a stand alone movie which I love that. John Woo never liked making sequels so A Better Tomorrow II (1987) was his last sequel he made, so I am glad this movie doesn't have any sequels, remakes or reboot. In my opinion the 80's had a lot of better action movies, but the 90's had a very cool action movies too. I still love Die Hard With A Vengeance to death and still love other action movies that were made in 90's. I love Broken Arrow to death! It is my favorite John Woo movie! This is a great film recently and it is a cool action movie. It's got action, excitement and interesting characters and Legendary music. I love this film. Christian Slater as the Good guy, the Hero was cool and John Travolta was an intriguing character and hilarious, damn what a rush. The action in here is amazing. Fun action, good acting, quick pace, and entertaining. The final sequence on the train has some quality explosions and even has bad guys killed by helicopter blades. The best thing about this movie though is John Travolta who hams it up beautifully; he is having an absolute blast as Vic Deakins, former US Air Force pilot turned terrorist loon. He also has one of the most over the top and awesome bad guy deaths of all time. I have always enjoyed this movie, I never felt bored I love the action sequences on the train when Hale (Christian Slater) uses one of his martial arts to defeat Deakins (John Travolta) was spectacular he deactivate the nuclear device and kills Deakins it was outstanding. Hans Zimmer theme for Deakins ripped off movie Scream 2 for Dewey (David Arquette) theme. Hans Zimmer provides one of his greatest scores to this movie with some nice twanging guitar from Duane Eddie. I love how any time Travolta is on screen he has this hilarious guitar theme tune which is cool, but hilarious funny at the same time. Broken Arrow has Woo's trademark slow motion and double gun-play galore. I believe there is the odd pigeon thrown in for good measure too. Not entirely sure Samantha Mathis was all that great as the female love interest, but it is cool to have a Pump up the Volume reunion (1990). Which I never watched that movie before I am glad they both of the actors (Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis) worked together once more again.Broken Arrow has plenty of flaws but for sheer explosive entertainment you could do a lot worse. I love the movie and could watch it on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Blu-ray's to get me this movie on Blu-ray I actually have this film in Blu-ray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find.

It is up to his co-pilot, whom he thought he killed, to stop him. Great action scenes with tradition Woo relentlessness, a good use of music, and some good lines make this a good thriller.Also worth mentioning is the finale with an awesome string of deaths for the bad guys.

The tone was set perfectly by the boxing at the beginning, and even though it was incredibly obvious that Slater would win the eventual rematch, the action that was sandwiched between the two fights was hugely entertaining.  The leads all gave good performances, and the humor was predictably silly but still somehow fun.  If you're looking for an intelligent, thought-provoking film, this movie is sure to disappoint.

60,Movie-Misfit,Brainless Fun with Diluted Woo!,6,19 November 2014,"As an avid fan of Hong Kong cinema, I'm never been overly happy or excited when one of my heroes makes a move to Hollywood. I've always had this thing were I believe the big fat US execs are drumming their fingers together thinking of ways to knock this foreign film maker down a peg or two, especially if they generally make better pictures than most Hollywood directors!Which a lot of them do.When John Woo, who made quite possibly some of the finest films in not just HK cinema history, but overall, got his big break in Hollywood with Hard Target, I knew this would be the beginning of the end for him.Jumping on to Broken Arrow, and along with Face Off, these seemed to be the final passing moments of a cinematic master...Long gone were the wow factors such as Hard Boiled, The Killer, and Bullet In The Head, had given us. Now, Hollywood were pounding the crap out of Mr. Woo to spit out what we know as typical Hollywood blockbusters, most of which work on a visual level but are a flop to both their studios and their fans!The first problem that hit me with Broken Arrow, was the over-rated John Travolta. This odd looking man overacts his way through this flick with pure cheese as his guide dog, that lends itself to a cartoon like bad guy for the duration.Slater actually comes across quite well, and handles the action scenes enjoyably which shows. The park ranger was okay. She wasn't anything exciting, but got stuck into her role which impressed. I for one, would have put Cynthia Rothrock in her place that would have lent itself for more hard action scenes and some kick ass moments.Overall, Broken Arrow does pass the time enjoyably enough. I'm used to real John Woo movies, and in this we get a few moments that hark back to that. My husband was yelling and jumping quite a bit with certain close calls of action, scenes of terror and such, but I had yet to get overly excited much like when I watch A Better Tomorrow or any of his other classics.Its almost like Hollywood refused to let Woo bring what he does best to the table. They say action, yes by all means, but the brotherhood and drama of his own films is what really screams Woo and we don't really see that in his Hollywood junk.Broken Arrow is fun. Its not perfect fun, but it does have its moments!",Broken Arrow
61,emm,The arrow points the wrong way!,4,21 January 1999,"For a John Woo film, this one is pretty redundant. It's not usual to watch two attackers point weapons at each others' faces, but BROKEN ARROW sure could use a ""face""-lift! The acting needs better work! Neither of the two leading men can act as tough as they should, with John Travolta in the worst-case scenario. Samantha Mathis, while attempting to be the leading action lady in a few parts, suffers from a nervous breakdown. What's interesting is the suspense of preventing a nuclear catastrophe, but that premise is overridden by too many borrowed cliches from other action-adventure movies. Listen for Travolta shouting ""Hush! Hush!"" in a softer, keener voice when he's the one plotting the destruction. Woo fans can woo over FACE/OFF or any of his original material. Some things are meant to be broken, and this movie doesn't put itself back together.",Broken Arrow
62,redkiwi,Significant career step,7,29 March 2001,"A significant step in the resurrection of the career of John Travolta, Broken Arrow is a preview of the evil side of his character that he portrayed later so masterfully in Face Off, when required to take over the personality of Nic Cage's character.Christian Slater is the foil to Travolta's plan to hold the American government to ransom with the nuclear threat that he possesses, and if more than a little predictable, this is still reasonably well constructed as a good vs evil action film.The supporting cast backs up the two well, and there are some stunts that make this entertaining, if not anything that you could ever take that seriously as a motion picture.",Broken Arrow

It all becomes clearer when you look at who directed this film; John Woo has learned the business of film-making in Hong Kong making (in my opinion) tacky Kung-Fu movies, where action and action only is the essence of every film. Quite understandably, he resorted to what he knows best in making his big-budget Hollywood debut. Unfortunately, I do not like dumb Kung-Fu movies...So, apart from the ridiculous (or non-existent) screenplay, the bad Directing and other deficiencies, we also have to contend with Travolta as a nuclear terrorist. Honestly, I do not know if he was simply miscast or whether his acting just sucked in this film. He was so believable in his role, that instead of fearing a thermonuclear detonation, I was expecting ""Staying Alive"" to start up any minute and Travolta to start dancing... So much for this movie.

I was left with a memory that it was a little bit above average action movie. The plot was pretty much forgotten along the years but I remembered there was some cool action. Now when I watched it again since long time, those memories were pretty much accurate.The action legend John Woo directs and creates some visually great scenes. The most memorable thing are the desert landscapes and the battles that take place there. Cars flying over dunes in slow-motion...that's the image I remember the most.The actors John Travolta and Christian Slater aren't the greatest in the world but they seem to do their best here to create interesting characters. There's an exciting tension between the hero and the villain, and I also liked the sidekick (played by Samantha Mathis) - just some park ranger who just happens to know how to fight. That's perfect!Overall I'm afraid the movie is a bit mediocre. I felt like the buildup was better than the outcome. I watched it last week and already start to forget what happened in the latter half.Not a huge masterpiece but it's a decent action thriller.

68,malkane316,Quick Reviews!,9,12 November 2004,"This is the film which proved John Woo's adaptability to Hollywood. Broken Arrow goes for the simple plot, while keeping to Woo's running themes of brotherhood, and the hate/love homosocial relationships between men. And guns, obviously. Throw in the feisty, beautiful, and highly talented Samantha Mathis and we have a winner. For Woo fans, there isn't much you haven't seen before, except now we have a bigger budget and household names.Where this stands out from other Woo films is in its length and script. It is short, with fewer breaks in action and moments of reflection than in his other movies, and the script, while simple, is accessible to all and full of great dialogue. No-one does cool like Christain Slater and John Woo, though i haven't seen Windtalkers yet. The action is the main draw here, and it is some of the best produced by Hollywood in the nineties, moving from air to land to sea via various explodable vehicles with fluidity. Cue lots of slow motion glances, balletic gunplay, and massive explosions. Travolta and Slater have a pretty good chemistry, as do Slater and Mathis.

Hard Target (1993), Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996) and Paycheck are my top four favorite movies I watch from John Woo that he ever did. I don't watch Mission: Impossible II or Red Cliff I do have those movies on Blu-ray in my collection. I hate Face/Off I don't own that film anymore so terrible it is. John Travolta and Christian Slater are in their finest roles.This breathtaking John Woo rollercoaster action movie. This is ""Die Hard"" in the desert and I absolutely enjoy this movie so much. It has incredible music score theme from Hans Zimmer. It is wonderfully directed by John Woo, it has a wonderful pacing and It has a great paced on to a fight in the finale. I enjoy this movie MILES more than Face/Off the most overrated John Woo film. Broken Arrow is my action movie from the 90's that I watch constantly.The stunt work in here is very dangerous and all practical real, for example Christian Slater's character is right above the ground shooting the helicopter and you see the helicopter hops right over him and Samantha Mathis one in the same shoot. The helicopter almost cut Samantha Mathis legs if Christian Slater wouldn't pulled he away she would have been almost cut, that stunt was for real and it was real dangerous. This is my movie and I like practical effects and stunts that are done for real. Christian Slater run's while John Travolta and Howie Long are trying to run over him with a army jeep Am General HMMWV M1043 and Christian Slater jumps on the back of the jeep and John Travolta hit's the back of the jeep HMMWV M1043 in front that army jeep. That stunt was real and it was really dangerous. Christian Slater did his own stunts. No CGI or fancy editing that was all done for real a lot of dangerous stunts in this. It is an adrenaline rush and an underrated film. No one talks about it today.I think it is the most underrated in the action genre. John Travolta in my opinion is a finest actor I love his work; I love his movies he is my favorite actor. This was the second US movie that John Woo directed and yes it was really good done action movie. I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. This is not only John Woo favorite film of mine but is also Christian Slater's favorite film. I absolutely love his character Capt. Riley Hale.I love the finale, I love the sequence on a train where Hale cut's the helicopter power line and when a pilot try's to fly off and Deakins seas gas spiting on a floor and the pilot starts the chopper and Deakins yelles ""Cut the power"" and the pilot shows such a weird look and when he pushes the button, the chopper blows up, killing the bad guys to pieces. I love the train sequences. I love how Christian Slater kills on a train one of the bad guys, he stands right before Terry and he jumps grabs the gun and shoots the bad guy right between her legs.The guns are used well in this movie and you will see them a lot. The explosions are fantastic in this movie. No CGI no shaky cam this is perfect underrated action movie that I love to death!10/10 I love it to death! I love this movie to death.

The film is directed by John Woo. He's a popular Hong Kong director the man behind films like Face/Off, Paycheck, and Mission Impossible 2. John Travolta and Christian Slater are great in their roles as Deakins and Hale two friends turned adversaries after a training exercise goes awry. Travolta is terrific as the villain and Slater makes for a believable hero. Their scenes together are worth seeing it alone. The rest of the supporting cast including Samantha Mathis as Park Ranger Terry Carmichael, Delroy Lindo as Colonel Max Wilkins, and everyone else in the film are good in their roles. With the plenty of action, drama, suspense, thrills, and some humor Broken Arrow is an entertaining thrill ride with great performances by it's lead actors. A well made action thriller thats sure to please any fan of the genre.",Broken Arrow

while the action scenes are not a total loss, they could have been a lot better. Whatever good action there is, is brought down by extremely poor dialogue, a completely over-the-top bad guy (John Travolta, not as poor here as in ""Battlefield Earth"", but coming very close), and incredibly boring hero (Christian Slater) and just way too many cliches.

78,Ziya90,"John Travolta is at one of his bests, so is John Woo",8,12 December 2009,"In comparison with some recent soap bubble and pretty slow paced action movies, Broken Arrow is a very good action movie, even if it is plain. Its rating is pretty low by the way. However, without any comparison, it is the same, a well made action movie from an action expert, John Woo. It starts with a boxing scene which I think that probably the most fresh one I have ever seen. Owing to its editing, you feel like you punch or you are punched. As for John Travolta, I liked the character a lot and every time, it it fun to watch. Honestly, without him, the movie might have been run of the mill. His smoking cigarette style and his mimics are unforgettable. The scene which he tries to break the bomb is one of my favorites. There is a very long action sequence in a cave that recalls The Rock. As we expected from a John Woo movie, a lot of bullets, acrobatic acts etc. almost all it has. I like the explosion scene, too, again especially for John Travolta. Despite, the movie and the characters seem shallow, I believe that one of his best performances of John Travolta is here. The relationship between Riley and Terry is very cliché (generally, there is a supporter of the hero in action movies and it is often a female), but this is not so important. The last part of the movie is again a very long action sequence and some moments feed on other John Woo movies like M:I-2, but I did not like the end, it was disappointing and a bit weird. Against all these, a lot of fun.",Broken Arrow

Travolta, the bad guy, wants to steal the nukes, along with the people who fund this project, and hold the U.S. for ransom. O.K. , then it really gets crazy with action, and multiple sub-plots, that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Car chases with gun fights, train chases with gun fights and regular fights galore. Helicopter chases with gun fights, and more!Riley is rescued in the desert by Park Ranger Terry Carmichael(Samantha Mathis) and the hi-jinx ensue. More car chases and plenty of guns shooting every which way. So, on a believability scale it gets a -2, on an Action scale, it gets a 10 ! So, if you want a highly action packed flick that doesn't want you to think, then enjoy this film, BUT , if you require a little more insight and thought process, then you probably want to skip this movie.Film run time 108 minutes, bathroom breaks allowed.",Broken Arrow
80,Benjamin_Cox,Doesn't deliver the goods - 49%,4,4 April 2006,"There is some history between this film and I. It was the first movie I ever saw in an aeroplane, on a flight to Detroit to visit relatives for Christmas. The problem is, it was immediately followed by the Jerry Bruckheimer action flick ""The Rock"" and if you've seen both of these movies then you'll know which is the better. In which case, you may as well toddle off right now. If you haven't seen either of them then pay attention because ""Broken Arrow"" is a shocking effort from arguably Hong Kong's finest director John Woo. Lacking much of the Woo style and polish that propelled him into Hollywood, this is little more than a brainless, trigger-happy waste of a film that quickly runs out of steam and descends into farce.John Travolta and Christian Slater play a couple of US Air Force pilots on a routine training exercise over Utah. Whilst testing a stealth plane's abilities, Major Deakins (Travolta) takes the opportunity to steal two nuclear warheads that happen to be on board the plane (despite the fact it's a mere training exercise) by ejecting Captain Hale (Slater) out of the plane and crashing it near others in on the plan. It is soon left to Hale and an impossibly cute Park Ranger by the name of Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis)to recover the warheads and make them safe, while Travolta's evil plan begins to take shape. Not exactly rocket science but there you go.It's safe to say that this is one of the simplest action films I've ever seen, with a relatively small cast and a plot so basic that only the most moronic of viewers will struggle to keep up. Despite this, there are some truly awe-inspiring lapses of logic such as the hilarious scene where Travolta, seemingly having planned everything down to the last detail, can't find someone hidden beneath a blanket in a small boat. It almost takes your breath away how clichéd the whole thing is and without the usual stylistic tricks of action-master Woo (seen in stuff like ""M:I 2""), it feels like a cheap and nasty TV movie. Slater is probably the best of the performances alongside Delroy Lindo as an Air Force support guy but Travolta is in standard pantomime-bad-guy mode. For further examples, see rubbish like ""The Punisher"" or ""Swordfish"" but only if you wanted a laugh.It's such a shame that Woo's American career got off to such a dodgy start (this is the second US film he made, after the Van Damme film ""Hard Target""). The plot and genre are hardly taxing and yet this is a real dog's dinner. Compared to something like ""The Rock"" which is not the best example of an action movie (and one I was forced to compare this to by the airline), this is an absolute waste of time, money and effort. Indeed, I'm struggling to see what attracted Woo to the project in the first place unless he was straining at the leash to work with a resurgent Travolta. Assuming you switch your brain to just above comatose levels of activity, you might enjoy the whole silliness of it all but honestly, I can't recommend anything about this picture to anyone. My advice is to stick with Woo's later material such as ""Face/Off"" or his earlier Hong Kong career such as the gritty cop film ""Lashou Shentan"" (""Hard Boiled""). Or you can watch another action film altogether because the chances are, it'll be better than this.",Broken Arrow

Well, for me it falls into that so bad and cheesy that it's awesome. John Woo directed this movie and his style is just a little too much for some people at times and I can understand it. In fact, I would say he went a little over the top in this one as well.The one thing I can say that this movie actually gets right in terms of good and bad is the score. Hans Zimmer composed the music of this movie and it's pretty much one of the best soundtracks of all time.To sum it up, Broken Arrow is terrible, it's so cheesy and stupid you have to leave your brain at home to enjoy it.

It's got the usual assortment of action movie clichés and conventions. The John Woo directed action scenes stretch over the top at times, there's the mentally unstable talkative nemesis and yes even one of those bombs that graces us with a digital readout. All prerequisites for movies of this type and saying all that I'd usually be complaining by now. Yet for one reason I can't. This movie entertained me. It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it.Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing people die, bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the get-go. If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role over-the-top and delivers some fantastic lines. It doesn't hurt that him and Slater tango well neither. If Travolta attempted this movie now instead of when he did - it wouldn't work. He's done too many goody-goody roles to come back down to this. Laws of nature will not allow him to make another good movie where he plays a bad guy. Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one.",Broken Arrow

Now, this movie's entertaining from start to finish and my only problem, besides all of the unrealistic action, of course, is when Hale tells Colonel Wilkins that Deke is doing a rope-a-dope. Wilkins looks lost and goes, ""A what?"" Hale explains what that is and Wilkins interrupts with, ""Yes, I know what the rope-a-dope is--what's your point?"" lol Well, he just implied that he DIDN'T... Also, well before that part, why would Hale tell Deke about another crafty move he's thought of about taking the second bomb down below to be buried under tons of rock?

This is the second one I've seen and it's still very, very good fun entertaining movie and I am now officially a fan of Woo and am going to look at other movies of his. There's a certain grounded in reality feel to this movie - like in Woo's other movie I've seen - and I really love it. Broken Arrow is violent, but not overly-violent and certainly not in the cringe-worthy, can't-watch way - quite a lot is kept off camera with a conveniently placed object.
John Travolta is absolutely excellent as the movie's villain. A brilliant but insane, sick, sadistic person and Travolta totally captures it to a T.
Christian Slater is great as ever as the movie's protagonist. Samantha Mathis is great as Terry Carmichael, the park ranger and, of course, Slater's character's love interest, something you can tell is going to happen as soon as they meet.
This movie's plot is fast-paced, gripping, and very entertaining - but somewhat generic and predictable, but it doesn't prevent you from thoroughly enjoying the movie.

The show was very much stolen by John Travolta though, his performance was fantastic- insane, sadistic and looking like he was having fun in the process.

I was in the mood for some action.John Travolta stars as a USAF Major who is planning drop of the nuclear bomb he's carrying for a test run and steal them. Unfortunately, his co-pilot and a park ranger was not part of his plans.Let's start by saying this is a 100% pure action movie. Cheesy dialog, big explosions, a chick and impending doom. Who can possibly ask for more? The writing is OK. The plot is OK, but there are holes and less logical things. The dialog is fake and cheesy at times. The characters is nice enough developed, but there could be done more work here. There are some nice touches done in the writing too, I'll give it that. All together the writing is OK. Not the best, but in no way the worst either. The story was probably just an excuse to fly helicopters and blow stuff up.The cast is very varying in their performance. John Travolta does a great job, in portraying his villain. He portray his character in an incredible way, and is such a bad ass. Christian Slater is not bad either, but not quite there. As for Samantha Mathis, we've seen better. Not all bad, but far from good. The rest of the cast is average. No one worth mentioning in particular.The film is technically good. The cinematography is good. Some cool angles and stuff and all over good. The sound editing is nice and the special effects, well being an action movie you gotta expect good special effects and you get it. Big explosions, bodies thrown through the air, crashing aircrafts, bullet hits everything is there and most of it is well done.One thing to notice is the music. Zimmer made a nice theme that follows the score through the movie. Very effective and combined with the visual, very cool.What makes this movie get a five out of ten is all the minor flaws and rather bad story it has. It's far from a good movie. The good thing is, this movie does not try to be anything it's not. It's just a simple entertaining mindless shoot 'em up action flick and not trying to be anything else it's a good one at that.

John Travolta's performance in this is probably as he was directed to be but I do not think it is one of his greatest performances....it is as though his face is stuck in the same smarmy position all the time.
I like Christian Slater very much and he plays the part as directed, but it's not the greatest role for him. The story-line is predictable, a bit ploddy but could have been so much more thrilling. I think Samantha Mathis should have got a mention in the film precis, she does as good a job if not better, than Travolta! A good plot, poorly executed I feel.

I find Slater to be OK but incredibly bland, the kind of actor who is just there but doesn't add much to the movie in terms of acting or charisma. Travolta on the other hand is overacting and having so much fun being the bad guy I wanted him to kick Slater's ass and ride off into the sunset. Of course this is a typical 80s/90s action movie so the good guy wins and gets the girl but even though Travlolta's character dies he goes out in style. The movie overall is super cheesy and fun, this is what an action movie should be, not the super serious, wannabe realistic schlock we get today.

This film also has one of my favorite action scores of all time by Hans Zimmer who captures the tone of the film beautifully.I personally feel this deserves the attention that Face/Off gets because this is more fun, but that's my opinion.

However, Deakins reveals he's a bad guy and wants to steal the weapons and sell them to terrorists, and so he tries to kill Hale, but ends up ejecting him out of the plane. Deakins ejects himself out as well, leaving the plane to crash and the weapons behind. Deakins meets up with his crew of goons, and Hale meets up with a park ranger, Terry (Samantha Mathis). Together they must thwart Deakins plan and get back the nuclear weapons.Broken Arrow is a very fun action film. It has zero flaws, and was just straightforward entertaining. The story was very well thought put, brilliant, and made perfect sense. The acting from everyone was amazing. John Travolta did an outstanding job at playing a crazy villan and Christian Slater was awesome as the hero. Samantha Mathis was really good as well playing Slater's sidekick.
The action is easily the best thing in the whole movie. The explosions, the gun shootings, and the awesome final fight between Hale and Deakins towards the end was all so satisfying.

110,thestarkfist,This movie breaks the implausometer!,1,7 February 2013,"Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead!Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle.Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many ""oh-come-on"" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of ""oh-come-ons"" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming ""you want to punch him in his face"" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort.

113,JackDevoe,My first intro to Woo was great!,10,14 March 2003,"I did not know who John Woo was when I first saw this movie in the theatres. But I loved this movie. I watched it four times on the big screen. And this was even before I knew that Woo's HK works and later films were twice a extravagant.I've heard that Woo's fans didn't like this movie because it was too tame for him. (Limited double gun action and so forth) While I would have liked this movie even more if Woo went all out like in THE KILLER or HARD-BOILED, he showed that he doesn't need to depend on bullet ballet film making to create cool action scenes. Relying on a ""gimmick"" is what kills some film makers, and Woo is a man who doesn't need to rely on his creation. (WINDTALKERS is another film that doesn't need HK styled action to look good) I was glad that his other traits were able to go on film. The standoff scene with Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis where he has the gun and she has a knife was put to great effect. And even though it seems odd that a park ranger would know a thing or two about combat, it made sense for Mathis' character since she was that type of ""actiony"" person. (I'd be fighting and shooting it out if I were a park ranger.) The use of slow motion was cool too. All of the sequences of things blowing up were awesome, and didn't rely on CGI as movies of today do. (Even though some of them use it correctly.) Of course the performances of the actors were all great. What else can I say other than John Travolta's vilainous performance was slick, and that Slater made a great action hero? (I hope he's the star of another cool action film. It was nice seeing his brief role in WINDTALKERS, but he needs more.) Samantha Mathis was really cool. Wo says he's always wanted to make a strong female character, and he really came close with her. The movie also features one of the best Hollywood fight scenes with the showdown between Slater and Travolta. Even after the ""Asian Invasian"" seeing this fight scene is still a good watch. This is still on my list of best action films.10 of 10",Broken Arrow
114,The_Sun_Toucher,Every genius stumbles now and again.,5,25 May 2000,"Simply put, this is John Woo's worst film to date.  Not only does it pale in comparison to classics like ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"", it's not a very good action/adventure on it's own terms.  Woo does what he can given the source material, but only Christ himself could turn water to wine. The screenplay seems like it was written for a straight to video production. If one is not familiar with the films of John Woo(or Hong Kong cinema in general)this would not be a proper introduction.Recommended for fans of second-rate action flicks with top-notch talent behind, and in front off, the camera.  A wasted effort.",Broken Arrow
115,twolanebl,John Woo hones his craft here in America,9,2 July 2002,"John Woo, after his many Hong Kong efforts, came to America and made Hard Target (1993), which due to studio interference and bad taking of direction by Jean Claude Van Damme, wasn't as good as it could have been. Woo got a bad reputation due to his conflicts with both the MPAA and Universal, and it took him awhile to get this one off of the ground. Woo had never worked with special effects, so he was treading into new territory. Luckily, he got two great leads, Christian Slater (soon to be in Windtalkers), and John Travolta (Face/Off). They take his direction well, and each gives a good performance. As the traditional villain's henchman, which I like to call Indestructable Villain Sidekick, Howie Long gives a good performance, and dies a good death too. I never appreciated this movie that much until watching it tonight, and I realized, this is probably the most action-packed movie in a long time. It takes only about 6 minutes to get going, and then, boom! boom! boom! Action sequence after the other, no let-down in between. This movie has plently of shootouts, explosions, and great innovative twists (kicking the rear blade of a helicopter to knock a gun out of one's hand) to make a action movie good. John Woo's cinematography, the great shared moments (the 20 dollar bill and whatnot) are what makes this one a great action movie. Another thing that makes this flick great is that it gave Woo the power to get Face/Off, his best Hollywood outing, the greenlight. I'm looking forward to Windtalkers and love all of Woo's movies.9 outta 10.",Broken Arrow

None of the actors are particularly good, and the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese, but you have a movie with over the top action and that's pretty much all you should care about John Woo films.

It's a straight action movie with some great pre-Matrix effects, decent acting (esp. Travolta) and continual movement. Much like Speed, there is just no time for a sophisticated plot or in-depth characterization.  (The two protagonists don't even know each other's names until the last scene.)  If you don't go into this movie with highbrow expectations, you will be quite entertained.  Sometimes we all need a night off.  In case you need a reference point:  I watched Art of War and Shaft (2000) on the same day and liked Broken Arrow a *lot* better.  It has no pretensions, so you won't feel disappointed. And the violence is much more integral to the plot.Thorn in my paw:  Christian Slater was miscast.  He does well enough in each scene, considering the limited demands made on him, but on the whole Travolta simply overpowers him.

Surprisingly, the folks liked it too and didn't mind me watching it over and over. At first I thought it was over the top, but I really liked the soundtrack(by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers), and as I watched it more for the soundtrack, the over all experience of the movie grew on me. The theme for Travolta's character just made him the badass his character needed to be. Slaters unlikely role as the scrawny hero worked out for the betterment of the film and his character. Long's only good film appearance as the muscular right hand man fit him to the T. John Woo's affinity for action movies is exemplified in this film. Mathis's role as the female element was believable(she didn't come off as a dit and one could see her has a park ranger because her proportions weren't medically exaggerated). The shootout in the mine, the Humvee chase, the Helicopter pursuit of slater and Mathis, the opening scene with a fight in the cockpit of the stealth bomber, and the climatic train sequence made this a cool movie. So what if it wasn't Oscar material, not every movie is, and the ones that aren't are the most entertaining.

By hijacking two nuclear bombs, he threatens to make ""the west coast a quiet neighborhood for about 10,000 years.""  Slater does a respectable job as the good guy trying to stop the madman.  The onscreen chemistry between Travolta and Slater adds to the movie's persona.  They work well together and seem believable in their performances.

Christian Slater and John Travolta both started as rival military pilots, one as the ""good guy"" and one as the ""bad guy"" with evil intentions. Originally working together, their intentions differ and their differences collide after Travolta turns to the ""bad side"" and helps other ex-military officers steal two nuclear weapons from Travolta and Slater's abandoned military jet. Travolta and his crew end up racing against Slater, who has teamed himself with a female park ranger who even attempted to arrest him after he was forced to parachute out of his jet during a sky-high confrontation with Travolta. Both teams have their eyes on the nuclear warheads, with their explosive atom-splitting power that we have seen the effects of before (200,000 dead in the U.S. nuclear attack on Japan)... only, both the teams have quite different intentions. Slater, of course, plans to disarm and return the weapons to the U.S. government. Travolta plans to detonate them...This was a pretty basic comic book bubblegum-style action movie. There was lots of good special effects and vehicle/helicopter chases, machine gun battles, and explosions. It had a pretty basic plot (kind of similar to a mediocre combination of ""Face/Off"" and ""The Rock"") and good acting...

143,smvouriot,Fun 90s Action Flick,10,12 March 2017,"Now these were the days. Broken Arrow is a terrifically entertaining action film that reeks of 90s cheese. It's chock full of slow motion, campy dialogue and a bombastic score. The movie knows what it is and makes no pretensions about itself, which unfortunately cannot be said for many of the drab, self serious action films Hollywood pumps out nowadays. Storywise, the movie keeps things simple. Crazed Air Force Major Vic Deakins (John Travolta) has stolen two nuclear warheads and threatens to detonate them over a populated area if his demands aren't met. Now it's up to his ex-partner Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and Utah park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to foil his scheme before a major U.S. city is reduced to a mushroom cloud. This sets the stage for a relentless game of cat and mouse through the canyons of Utah, as Riley and Terry battle Vic and his henchmen for possession of the warheads. This plot is mercifully coherent and avoids the mistake many action films of today make in becoming too convoluted for their own good. As Deakins, Travolta steals the show. He is so cartoonishly over the top that he almost seems to be from a different planet from the rest of the characters. But this is how it should be. Action films live or die on the quality of their villains. Just look at some of the best ones: Die Hard, Speed, Terminator 1 and 2. Can you imagine any of these films with a lesser antagonist? A great villain is something that can turn a merely OK action flick into a great one, and Travolta's scenery chewing helps in elevating Broken Arrow closer to classic action movie status (He also gets a hilarious and over the top exit, another factor sorely lacking in today's action movie climate). While admittedly overshadowed by Travolta, Christian Slater nevertheless holds his own and creates a solid hero in Riley Hale. Samantha Mathis is fine as plucky park ranger Terry and the supporting cast is populated by reliable character actors such as Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Kurtwood Smith. John Woo directs the film with style and fluidity, although his technique here is slightly more subdued compared to his earlier work. His direction and Graham Yost's script keep the film moving at a breakneck pace that never lets up. The film's pace is exhilarating, and Hans Zimmer's kinetic score further pumps up the movie. A quick note about the score. While Hans Zimmer may have received vast recognition and acclaim for his work on The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception, his compositions for Broken Arrow rank among the best he's ever done for the genre. They juice up the already thrilling action scenes into something that truly feels epic and only highlight what a difference a great score can do for a movie. Broken Arrow is a gleefully absurd 90s action flick that is pure fun from start to finish. Over the years the film seems to have been somewhat forgotten, with Woo and Travolta's subsequent collaboration Face/off overshadowing it. Admittedly, while Broken Arrow may not be quite as good as Face/off the film still holds up. It has well shot action, a brilliant score, a memorable villain and the 108 minute run time flies by. This is all further enlivened by John Woo's operatic directorial flourishes which elevate the film's scale and, consequently, making the stakes feel even larger. Perhaps most refreshingly, the movie never takes itself too seriously, which helps to inject the most important ingredient into a film of this genre. An ingredient that too many action/adventure films of today seem to have forgotten: Fun.",Broken Arrow

The rest of them were so cheesy. And when John dies, i think that would be the most fake death i have ever seen. It was so obvious it wasn't real!! I just laughed at the movie because of how cheesy and fake it was!! But i thought it had some funny lines in it, some of the lines John says are hilarious!! I always watch Broken Arrow with my friends because we just love laughing at stupid cheesy movies!! But anyway i still liked it. It wasn't the best movie i have ever seen but i still liked it.",Broken Arrow

Usually for me the indications are....1) I'm not bored 2) I'm not yawning 3) i don't have to make an excuse to goto to the toilet even when I don't need to. This film did not have me doing any of these things.John Woo during the early to mid 90's had a range of good films in Hollywood before he went stupid during the 2000's. This along with Hard Target, Face/Off, Once a Thief and Mission Impossible 2 was one of them.From the get go this movie had Woo written all over it....the slow motion shots, the double guns, John Travolta, and the Mexican stand off - although this time with a gun and a knife. From the opening boxing match, to the underground nuclear explosion and the climax on the train this movie thrilled.Admittedley, as other commentators have pointed out...this is a run of the mill action movie which is elevated by John Woo, Travolta and Slater to above average. I hate to say this but I could watch this a second time and still not get bored with it.Overall, this movie did do it for me. Great to have a pizza and a six pack on a Saturday night DVD fest with the guys.",Broken Arrow

Tomorrow, I will demand that he reimburse me for the three dollars I wasted. Folks, this movie S-U-C-K-S. There are more factual, continuity, and common sense errors in this movie than I could even begin to list. Character development is nonexistent and the action sequences are completely forgettable, it really feels like they were scripting it as they went along. I'm assuming Travolta took the role of Major ""Vic"" Deakins because he lost a bet to Woo. If they were still taping Mystery Science Theatre, I'm sure this movie would be high on the list of films to feature in the future. I rate this movie ""poo"" out of *****.",Broken Arrow

Slow pace - too much footage to show little real script progress. 3. Doesn't look real at all. OK, I know it's a movie. It's fiction. But hey, too many coincides and Good Luck on part of the military officer and park ranger. 4. Stretched out sequences. Seriously, the train sequence could have been shrunk to 7 minutes and nobody would've shed a tear. But hey, they stretched out the sequence to such a long one that it becomes boring.You can avoid the movie and you won't miss a thing.

It is good to see him yet in yet another area, the bad guy.  I was surprised at how well he did.

I have seen this movie many times and will enjoy seeing it again and again.",Broken Arrow

The plot pops out of nowhere, ""experienced"" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.",Broken Arrow

Travolta's acting is just brilliant and the ending is even better, just because of a one facial expression Travolta does!! Don't believe me? Watch it. Must see for John Travolta fan's and must see for any action movie fans. Brilliant film and brilliant story...

151,batmanvsjoker-95658,One to watch.,10,26 July 2016,"One of the best things about this film was seeing a strong female role played by Samantha Mathias. For once Hollywood used a woman who did not have to rely upon a man to save her. This was not a ""love interest"" part, it could easily have been played by male or female. The direction was good, as with all John Woo's work, and not cluttered up with too many special effects. The action rattled along. John Travolta made an excellent villain and delivered some pretty cool lines - all credit to the script here for avoiding too much cheesy dialogue. Delroy Lindo as ever, was good, as was Christian Slater - good guys are never as much fun to watch as the villains! I would compare this with the under-rated ""Chill Factor"" rather than ""Speed."" If you want a film that delivers well paced action, some great one-liners and plenty of thrills, Broken Arrow is one to watch.",Broken Arrow

""I say Goddamn what a rush!"" is just electrifying when delivered by Travolta.Of course there are holes in the plot, and the 'two plucky heroes' format may be getting worn, but Woo and his cast make it work, and deliver a film that is sure to set your action muscles a-tingling!",Broken Arrow

He can only play very cool people, and this is exactly what he has to do here. Broken Arrow has a standard plot: a man steals two A-Bombs and then blackmails a USA. As John Woo could not take this seriously, the movie is very funny. And the actors do a good job. My vote: seven out of ten.",Broken Arrow

Despite this, it was very enjoyable and in my opinion deserves 6.5 stars-slightly more than it actually got. I never realized that Travolta was such a good ""bad guy"" actor and almost deserved an Oscar! But Christian Slater was just as good as the out and out good guy, along with Terry Carmichael as his side-kick.

A plot as contrived and preposterous as any one might find in a rejected RoadRunner cartoon script.This film has it all, culminating in a death scene as silly as you'll ever see. The plot involves the theft of a set of nuclear weapons which Christian Slater is trained ""to disable"". These nuclear weapons have a keypad you can set for thirty minutes.

158,mansonthismadting,Cinematic masterpiece,10,26 July 2016,"John Woo (Director of Face/Off) creates a dazzling array of frantic gun battles and gripping action centred around the duelling pair Slater and Travolta. Where else do you get to see a US Stealth Bomber crash into bits as slow motion shrapnel whips over the camera? The word 'cool' embodies the film's relaxed music, quirky humour, snappy one-liners and Woo's trademark visual candy. 'Broken Arrow', the US Military's term for a missing nuclear warhead, is the motivation of the plot as treachery and duels become the centre of the movie. Slater's desperately attempts to capture his co-pilot's bounty from the wreckage though Travolta is always one step ahead of his hapless former friend.

159,basilcourt,Fair Warning: Don't Associate With Anyone Who Hates This Movie,10,3 December 2018,"This is one entertaining flick from start to finish: the action is fluid and engaging; the plot is completely logical within its own constructs; the cinematography is gorgeous; the dialogue is spot-on; and the acting is simply wonderful. The supporting cast does a fine job, Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis deliver just the right degree of straight acting to keep the film from veering into satire, and John Travolta delivers his BEST performance to date: you can FEEL his perpetual inner tension, his channeled insanity, his command and control of the film to its denouement -- he pulls us along with him for the entire coaster ride. Woo's command of the direction is absolute: he knows where he wants this to go, and the journey is very, very satisfying.For those who don't ""get it"" -- who don't appreciate Travolta's tour de force, or who take issue with the ""realism"" of the plot, or who find Woo's direction too violent or one-dimensional: these are the kinds of people you do NOT want to get dragged into conversation with at business conferences or cocktail parties. In fact, a good barometer to gauge whether they are worth you time is to ask them: ""Have you ever seen 'Broken Arrow' with John Travolta?"" If they say ""Yes!"" and their faces light up and they mention some element of the film they really liked, then you know you've found an interesting person with whom to converse. But if they say ""Ugh... yes. I hated it!"", then quickly excuse yourself and avoid them for the rest of the meeting or party. Fair warning!",Broken Arrow

Howie Long, an actor, GIVE ME A F***ING BREAK!!!  Christian Slater also knows how to choose the stupidest movies (ala The Flood), or to put it more simply, he's just a horrible actor.  Seeing Slater play the hero and the good guy almost made me puke!!  It is even harder for me to believe that this piece of trash was directed by John Woo, whom I believe to be one of the more talented directors in Hollywood right now.  However, he made up for it with the spectacular action movie, Face/Off.

He played his role perfectly and I cant picture as a good in this film. This action flick has every thing you want: Explosions, Guns, boxing, Jets, bombs, it has everything basically. The intro is brilliant and the ending is brilliant, just because of John Travolta. You can tell straight away that John Travolta could get his arm chopped of and he wouldn't give a too much f**** and he would probably say its a good thing it happened.

Nothing in the movie comes even close to being plausible - every plot detail is riddled with holes and demonstrates the producers had a complete lack of understanding of how things work in the real world. By the end of the movie I was left wondering why I had bothered to waste my time and money to see it through to the end, had I seen the movie thinking it was intended as a comical parody of the action movie genre I might have enjoyed it a lot more.This is the worst film I have ever seen, ever!

This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect: directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it. If Travolta were playing his role more tongue-in-cheek and the movie itself were touted as a comedy, then it might be palatable. But the movie and actor both appear to be actually taking themselves seriously, and the result is something that is just dreadful to watch. It took all my strength to actually see it through to the end all the while hoping that something redeeming would happen. It did not. Do not waste your time by seeing this movie.
