0,Leofwine_draca,A thriller which subverts expectations,6,11 November 2017,"Forgive me for feeling a frisson of excitement whenever Paul Verhoeven makes a new movie; after all, titles are few and far between these days, and his last I saw, BLACK BOOK, was a well-regarded masterpiece. Not so ELLE, a somewhat convoluted psychological thriller based around the unappetising subject matter of rape. In the hands of the expert director, ELLE becomes a beautifully shot and well-crafted movie, one which remains enjoyable despite the darkness of the subject matter. Isabelle Huppert gives a finely-judged turn as the put-upon woman who reacts unexpectedly when she is raped in her own home one night. The narrative mixes together family drama, mystery, and psychology of an unusual depth, with the end result a film which subverts expectations and proves challenging and unique.",Elle
1,SnoopyStyle,damaged character,7,15 July 2017,Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is a ruthless boss at a video game company. She faces challenges from the game designer Kurt. Her son Vincent's pregnant girlfriend hates her. Her mother sleeps with younger criminal men. She gets brutally raped by a masked man who breaks into her home. She casually mentions it to her friend but never reports it to the police despite the constant stalking and the masked man's repeated returns. She recruits the company's IT guy to investigate users she suspects to be the masked man. She is self-destructive and working through her daddy issues.Director Paul Verhoeven harnesses the full acting power of the great French actress Isabelle Huppert. He pushes buttons as he often does. This is a dark and damaged character. It could have been more shocking if the reveal turns out to be something more. I was hoping for better twists and turns. This is a good actresses playing a damaged protagonist but not much beyond that.,Elle
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Simple title, not so simple movie",6,23 February 2017,"""Elle"" is a co-production between France, Germany and Belgium that resulted in a French-language film from last year (2016). The director is Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, who turns 80 this year and who has worked in film for over half a century. And if you take a look at what he directed in the late 80s, early 90s, you may see some familiar titles as well. But this one here is probably a contender for his best-received title when it comes to critics and awards bodies. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and lead actress Isabelle Huppert is a Golden Globe winner and an Oscar nominee for it, who may be in the best spot to upset front runner Emma Stone at the Academy Awards next weekend. The film itself did not succeed to get in at the Foreign language Film category. Maybe the subject itself and the occasionally pretty graphic scenes were too much for the Academy to stomach. Anyway, this pretty long work (over 2 hours) stars Huppert as a woman who gets raped and the film starts with this scene right away and shows flashbacks later on as well, so we are thrown right into the center of action here. Huppert by the way looks still really good for a woman way into her 60s.Anyway, the film (except the last third) stays mostly memorable thanks to the audience guessing who is the one who did it. With the exception of Huppert's character's son, there is thrown suspicion towards basically every male character in there. Be it her ex-husband, her affair, her neighbor, the colleague who likes her, the colleague who hates her etc. My money was on the colleague who likes her or the neighbor and I will not tell you if I was right. If the film is over, the more time passes the more it becomes obvious to me how Huppert's character really planned it all in finding the guy who did it. The moment she mentions the circumcision is really crucial and shows us how she is a woman with a plan and nothing really is coincidence. It was pretty obvious that death may be the only way out for this film and I genuinely wondered if this means the main character will die or the one who did this to her. Dead birds, dead mothers, dead fathers, dead video game characters, dead people from decades ago and there are more examples. The car crash also may give an interesting direction this film is taking and I did not necessarily expect it. It is all about the double life of the aggressor, about how he needs certain situations to fulfill his dark desires.This is certainly one of the best psychological thrillers from 2016 and I am okay with the attention it is getting. Apparent flaws like why doesn't she let the police check who is sending her these SMS make sense in retrospective as for the central character it was all about her own revenge. She says on one occasions that she decides when her father would die and it is also the same when it comes to her rapist. Still, the ending scene came a bit surprising as there was really no indication at all that the son would show up at their place all of a sudden. Besides that, it is interesting that she had sex again with the offender on a previous occasion and that she did not mind going through that in order to keep going with her plan and better understand how the man works exactly. Anyway, what I found surprising at the end is when she talks to the cop she is not scared of admitting she had a relationship with him and that was a bit strange as it somehow destroyed the aura of suspense surrounding her character. But maybe it was because she was worried the cops may find out about it and see through her plan to kill him. Anyway, this is certainly one of Huppert's most personal performances and it's even more impressive that I liked her in here because I am usually far more critical when it comes to her performances that are sadly frequently too similar. I think she did a convincing job here with a very intimate portrayal and it is certainly among the best revenge films of the last five years. Here and there, we also get to see a moment of comedy (like about a cuckold child), maybe to keep this film from becoming too depressing. And that's a good thing as well. All in all, not one of my favorite films from 2016 and I am not sure if it deserves any awards, but probably some nominations are okay I guess. I recommend seeing it.",Elle
3,claudio_carvalho,Weird and Bizarre,5,18 December 2016,"The wealthy entrepreneur Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is the owner of a video game company that she runs with her best friend Anna (Anne Consigny). She is divorced from Richard Leblanc (Charles Berling) and has a love affair with Anna's husband Robert (Christian Berkel). Her son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet) lives with his girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz) that is pregnant. Her mother Irène Leblanc (Judith Magre) tries to convince Michèle to visit her father that is in prison for a life sentence after killing twenty-seven neighbors in an outbreak. One day, Michèle is raped by a stranger wearing ski mask. She buys pepper spray and an ax for self-protection while she seeks out the attacker. She also befriends her next door neighbors Patrick (Laurent Lafitte) and Rebecca (Virginie Efira) and invites them to a Christmas party at her home. When the stranger breaks in her house again, Michèle subdues him and has a surprise. Who might be the rapist?""Elle"" is a weird and bizarre film directed by Paul Verhoeven. Despite the great performance of Isabelle Huppert, the story is pointless and the movie is overrated in IMDb. Michèle Leblanc is a tough, ruthless, cruel and disloyal woman that betrays her best friend having a love affair with her husband. But the annoying plot goes nowhere and is totally disappointing. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): No Available",Elle
4,lee_eisenberg,Verhoeven and Huppert are among the best,10,26 February 2018,"Dutch director Paul Verhoeven began his career in his native country with movies like ""Soldier of Orange"". In the '80s, he moved to the US and directed a series of audience-pleasing movies (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers). In the 21st century he returned to Europe to resume a serious career. His latest output is ""Elle"", starring Isabelle Huppert (in an Academy Award-nominated role) as a rape victim reluctant to report the incident to the police due to suspicion of them.Huppert's Michèle is one of the most complex characters that I've seen on screen in the past few years. She runs a company that designs video games (that's the last thing that you'd expect of a middle-aged woman, especially a French one). She's haunted by the memory of the arrest of her father, who committed a horrendous crime, and now has a strained relationship with her son. It seems that her friends and cat are the only ones with whom Michèle has a truly healthy relationship. But there's a lot more to discover about each of the characters. No one is truly what they seem.This focus on sexuality, repressed memories, and relationships adds up to one of Verhoeven's best movies. The acting and subtlety of the plot show that a focus on people - as opposed to action - is what a movie needs to be good. I recommend it.",Elle
5,jboothmillard,Elle,7,26 March 2017,"This was only the second foreign language film I had ever seen in a cinema on the big screen, my first was Hungarian film Taxidermia, I only had my guesses what this French film, literally translated ""she"", would have in it, and I was looking forward to it, directed by Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls). Basically middle-aged French wealthy entrepreneur Michèle Leblanc (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Isabelle Huppert) owns a successful video game company, with her best friend and business partner Anna (Anne Consigny). Michèle has a ruthless attitude both in her career and her personal life, she is divorced from ex-husband Richard (Charles Berling) and is detached from her son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet), who is with a domineering, ungrateful and pregnant girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz), and Michèle is having an affair with Anna's husband Robert (Christian Berkel). Michèle's mother Irène (Judith Magre) is trying to convince her to visit her father, who is in prison serving a life sentence for killing twenty- seven neighbours in an outbreak, meanwhile Michèle is brutally raped by a stranger in a ski mask. Following the attack, Michèle buys pepper spray and an axe as self-protection, while she seeks to identify who the rapist is. The masked attacker returns and attempts to rape her again, but she subdues him, pulling off his mask she is shocked to discover it is Patrick (Laurent Lafitte), a banker and her neighbour who she was flirting with, but she decides not to call the police, or to increase her home security, they later bizarrely begin a sexual relationship, including her consent to roleplay another rape. Michèle's company is preparing to celebrate the premiere of their new video game, she is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the various facets of her life leading up to the celebration party. Michèle decides to confess her affair with Robert to Anna, she ends the unhealthy relationship with Patrick, claiming she will call the police, he attempts to rape her again, this borders on an attack and consensual, Vincent is there and bashes Patrick on the head, he dies. The end sees Michèle speaking to Rebecca about moving out of the neighbourhood, Rebecca expresses gratitude that she temporarily ""satisfied Patrick's needs"", Vincent becomes more assertive in his career and relationship, and Michèle reconciles with both Josie and Anna, now that both their relationships with Robert are severed Anna also offers to move in with Michèle. Also starring Vimala Pons as Hélène, Lucas Prisor as Kurt, Arthur Mazet as Kevin and Raphaël Lenglet as Ralf. Huppert gives a fantastic performance as the woman who is anything but a victim, surrounded by many weak men, I assumed it was going to revenge thriller, the leading female character getting revenge on men who did wrong on her, the disturbing rape attack is shown a few times, along with many sexual moments, but the other things going on for the leading female are equally interesting, all in all it is a most worthwhile psychological thriller. It won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!",Elle
6,Quinoa1984,"yes, see it, but...",8,1 January 2017,"Elle is a gloriously f***ed up film, a film noir with a femme fatale who isn't out to screw some average Joe over or anything like that, but instead is a woman who not so much delights in her sexual perversity and taboo but does it out of not having any other choice it seems. The background on Michele Leblanc, Isabelle Hupert's character, is that her father was a murderous monster who killed several people (from my understanding of what the film says some kids too) and has been in prison for 40 years and may be up for parole. But did Michele, even at the age of 10 (and with a picture taken of her after a fire in her underwear as an ""Ash Girl""), collaborate with her father? Could this somehow tie in to her being raped in the very first scene of this film?Oh yeah, if you're looking for a ""content warning"" sticker rape and assault against women is right up at the top of the list. It's also a stalker, as the man who rapes her - and, at some point, will try to do it again - sends her threatening text messages and screws with her at work by changing some footage from a video game she's producing to have one character being sodomized and Michele's face pasted on. Why no one else in the office really questions this - is it just another of those hacks that have been happening lately - or why it doesn't become a much bigger deal in the story may be something of a plot-hole (or perhaps one has to take for granted that the French may react differently than an American would). But no matter - Michele gets a few weapons, some pepper spray, and is ready.Why not call the cops? Good question - would they believe the infamous daughter of this man who is so reviled that it causes complete strangers to throw food on Michele in public places? What makes Elle so disturbing and, to use a synonym for f***ed up, dangerous is where it goes with her reactions to what happened and how it ties in with a larger psychological pattern. This is a woman who has also had to put up with being in a loveless affair with one of her co-worker's husband, having a dips*** son who can't seem to get it through his skull (ala, uh, Me Myself & Irene?) that her girlfriend cheated on him and had a black baby which clearly isn't his ""but, hey, it's still my son so I'll be the father etc"", and her mother who is another piece of work, at least in Michele's view. Oh, and there's the neighbor across the street who is married to a good Christian girl...I don't think Verhoven even means to make this about rape so much, though naturally how he depicts it is rough and brutal and if you really find it repulsive to see even in a dramatized form then stay away from this movie, I mean it, than it is about... being detached from a normal sexual outlook on life (who knows, perhaps I'm reading in-between the lines a bit much here, if her father did things to her as a child before his rampage). In this way Elle would make for a splendid double feature with another rancid story of perversion and societal malaise as another Hupert film, Haneke's The Piano Teacher. Think of that kind of character in a way, only not so much frigid and clinically detached as not 'turned on' the right way.Clearly with where this story ends up going is meant to provoke and shock. I think with the exception of the son's sub-plot, which I found distracting in a way that didn't seem to help the film much (I think eventually there's some emotional moment between mother and son where he states simply that he could be a good father that does connect a little to what's going on, but it's too little and too late for me), because the focus is so much on Michele and the things that happen both to her and that she lets happen and that she does to others, the character study approach works. I was also reminded of another Hupert collaborator who did his share of risqué mysteries, Claude Chabrol, in some of the handling of scenes and how she has conversations with people. But once the movie dispenses with the mystery, well, it turns Full Metal Verhoven on us, in a way that's kind of delightful in a exploitationy kind of way (except that the way it's shot and acted it's too classy to ever get too down and dirty).So, do I recommend it? Yes, but, and it's not a simple but for me to leave here, I'm still wrestling hours after watching if it has more to say outside of ""sometimes damaged people are really, really warped forever and their transgressions can only stop by, uh, choice."" It's provocative and daring and directed by a master of this kind of stuff - in a sense it's also a more, er, mature, less s***-writing kind of Ezsterhaus script ala Basic Instinct - but a part of me thinks, what's the point aside from provocation? It's a conflicted high praise I give, the sort of look I give like the cat in the very first shot of the film - I wouldn't claw his eyes out either.",Elle
7,writers_reign,To Elle And Back,7,12 October 2016,"Isabelle Huppert doesn't make it easy for her admirers. For reasons best known to herself and really none of our business she appears to have a penchant for sleaze which means that for every Les Soeurs Fachees we'll get two Ma Meres, a fact illustrated reasonably well by the 2016 London Film Festival where she stars in the relatively 'normal' Souvenir (where the only outre aspect is her affair with a man forty years younger than herself) and Elle where seemingly anything goes - her father is a serial killer, her mother pays a gigolo for sex and she herself plays sex games with the man who brutally raped her; like the man said, a typical Doris Day movie. On the other hand she has paid her dues, rising to the top ranks in a country that boasts the finest film actresses in the world across the generations - Danielle Darrieux will celebrate her centenary next year and was active until six years ago, right behind and also in their 10th decade are Michele Morgan albeit retired and Micheline Presle who last appeared on screen two years ago. At 63 Huppert is contemporaneous with Catherine Deneuve and right behind are Nathalie Baye,Fanny Ardante, Catheirne Frot,Yolande Moreau, Mathilde Seigner, Isabelle Carre, all the way down to 'babies' like Cecile de France and Deborah Francois and to be la reine over an ensemble like this wants some doing which is why I come here not to criticize Huppert but to praise her. As proof of her ability, if indeed proof were needed she shares the screen in Elle with two brilliant actresses of different generations, Ann Consigny and Virginie Efira and you barely notice them. Sleaze, yes, but if there's such a thing as 'classy' sleaze this is it.",Elle
8,oscaralbert,Sony MegaCorp takes on the World's Religions . . .,7,1 February 2017,". . . by cramming ELLE into (possibly unsuspecting) American theaters. The closing credits for ELLE do NOT even include an MPAA rating number or symbol, since Sony knows that the Pope-appointed (see the 2006 documentary, *THIS FILM NOT YET RATED) U.S. Film Censors would ban the import of a flick about a ""Devout Catholic Dad"" shot-gunning 27 men, women, and children--not to mention six dogs plus a couple cats (at least he spared a hamster) with his daughter Michele (or ELLE) an accessory after the fact--with an NC-17 Black Box Warning. Not content to merely besmirch the Romans, ELLE goes in for some Equal-Opportunity anti-Semitism, as Jewish banker Patrick repeatedly beats and rapes his atheist neighbor Michele a few years later. Being the Official Propaganda Arm and Trade Promoter for Japan's Government, Sony naturally includes a gratuitous scene in ELLE in which Michele's German-made Audi sedan cartwheels off the road into some trees for no apparent reason (there's a director of Non-Japanese Product Disparagement for each of Sony's Sneak Attack Trade War flicks). After seeing ELLE, it's no wonder that the American Public is moving toward an Isolationist Government which will cut all imports from Japan.",Elle
9,evanston_dad,Lurid Potboiler with an Exceptional Central Performance,7,12 April 2017,"Isabelle Huppert gives an expert performance in this psychological thriller, one that justifies her Oscar nomination for Best Actress.The movie around her performance is of the tawdry potboiler variety, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Huppert creates a fascinating character out of Michele, a woman who is sexually assaulted in her home and then engages in a cat and mouse game with her attacker. She's a cold, rather unlikable woman really, and her reactions to the things that happen to her are puzzling, to say the least. Not surprisingly, some traumatic events from her past involving a serial killer father arise to fill in some of the blanks, and if they don't necessarily explain Michele, they at least explain why she's so unexplainable. Huppert resists the temptation to make this woman sympathetic to her audience, and it's a small miracle of acting that makes us sympathetic anyway. I'm not sure many actresses could have walked the tightrope she has to in playing this character.I think ""Elle"" has some pretensions to discourse about gender politics, but whatever it has to say is a bit muddled by its wanting more than anything to be a lurid entertainment. It goes on for far too long, but I will say that never once during its considerable running time did it go in a predictable direction, which in and of itself is a feat that makes it worth watching.Grade: B",Elle
10,ferguson-6,"Unconventional story, powerful performance",8,17 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's best not to pre-judge what to expect in a new Paul Verhoeven directed film. We haven't seen or heard much from him in the past decade (the underrated Black Book, 2006), but we know surprises and twists and entertainment will be part of his work given his track record of Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Showgirls. Factor in that he is now working with one of the best actresses on the planet in Isabelle Huppert, and we walk into the theatre with no assumptions but a high level of anticipation.The phrase 'tour de force' is no exaggeration for Ms. Huppert's performance here. No time is provided for settling into one's seat as the opening scene stuns us with a brutal sexual attack by a masked intruder. Afterwards, the bloodied victim calmly cleans the house, soaks in a tub and orders takeout. This is our introduction to Michele (Huppert) and begins our two hour mission of trying to figure her out.Is she the ultimate feminist? She is the co-owner (with her best friend Anna) of a video game company that specializes in highly stylized and violent fantasy games (no subtle irony in that). Is she demented? She fools around with the husbands of her best friend and neighbor. Is she simply off-center? She scolds her mother for wanting to marry a much younger man, and her son for living with his selfish girlfriend who has a new baby via another man. She is not a good friend, business partner, mother, daughter, wife or person. This is no sympathetic character, yet thanks to Ms. Huppert, we simply can't take our eyes off of her or stop wondering how she will handle the next situation (of which there are many).Based on the novel ""Oh "" by Phillipe Dijan, with a screenplay from David Birke (who has a similar theme in much of his work), the film spares us little from the daily life of Michele. We see her as a confident business person, a sexual being – whether peering through binoculars at a neighbor or trysting with a married man - and a somewhat devious and devilish person intent on revenge. It's not until later in the film that we learn the family history that has been the driving force behind her rebuilding her life while also being unable to escape the past.Ms. Huppert is in most if not every scene. It's a powerful and rare performance that is complemented by some fine supporting actors: Anne Consigny as Anna (Michele's friend and business partner), Christian Berkel as Robert (Anna's husband and Michele's play toy), Charles Berling as Richard (Michele's ex-husband), Judith Magre as Michele's mom, Laurent Lafitte as Patrick (the neighbor), and Jonas Bloquet as Vincent (the dim bulb son). Michele has interactions with each of these characters  none better than the Christmas dinner party where all are in attendance.Verhoeven's film can be viewed as a slightly sleazy guilty pleasure, or as a profile of a strong, independent woman with a flawed moral compass. It's a reminder that we never fully escape the shadow cast by our parents, and some pay a greater price than others. It's rumored that no major American actress would take on the role, which in the end, benefits the film greatly  no other actress could have provided what was needed (except perhaps Barbara Stanwyck, who died more than 25 years ago). Ms. Huppert's performance allows this to cross many genres, and it is undoubtedly the best of the year in this category: a comically mean rape-revenge psychological thriller centered on consent and desire. Should you doubt this, perhaps Michele's own words will convince: ""Shame isn't a strong enough emotion to stop us from doing anything at all."" It's a pleasure to meet you ma'am.",Elle
11,gradyharp,'Shame isn't a strong enough emotion to stop us from doing anything at all. Believe me.',7,18 March 2017,"Isabelle Huppert is a brilliant actress whose career has included many superb films for which she has been honored abroad. In the USA she is recognized in the Oscar nomination for this overly hyped thinly disguised treatise on the chaos engendered by sexual dysfunctions in every aspect of life. Paul Verhoeven ('Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct', 'Spetters', 'Black Book' etc) seems to plead for audience indulgence in this overly long, poorly edited story based on Philippe Djian as transcribed for the screen by David Birke ('Gacy', 'Dahmer', 'Freeway Killer', etc). The thrust of the film reflects child abuse, parental hatred, and the resultant self-hatred of a successful woman whose career has been enhanced by her brains and her odd libido.The plot is tough to summarize without including spoilers, but halfway through the interminably long film the mystery is gone and the rest plays out in a tediously slow and graphic manner. The wealthy middle-aged entrepreneur Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is the owner of a video-game company surrounded by employees that either hate or love her: she runs the powerfully successful business with her best friend Anna (Anne Consigny). She is divorced from Richard Leblanc (Charles Berling) and has a love affair with Anna's husband Robert (Christian Berkel). Her loser of a son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet) lives with his girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz) who is pregnant (the surprise at the birth of her interracial child doesn't seem to be noticed by anyone but Michèle). Her mother Irène Leblanc (Judith Magre), an inappropriately hyper-sexual woman who plans to marry a male hooker Ralf (Raphaël Lenglet) tries to convince Michèle to visit her father who is in prison for a life sentence after killing twenty-seven neighbors and animals in an outbreak 30 years ago, an incident in which Michèle was an unknowing participant. One day, Michèle is raped in her home by an assailant in a ski mask, then promptly cleans up the mess and resumes her life. She buys pepper spray and an ax for self-protection while she seeks out the attacker. When she resolutely tracks the man down, they are both drawn into a curious and thrilling game - a game that may, at any moment, spiral out of control. She befriends her next door neighbors Patrick (Laurent Lafitte) and Rebecca (Virginie Efira) and invites them to a Christmas party at her home. When the stranger breaks in her house again, Michèle subdues him and has a surprise.Of course the audience knows by now. The sequelae of the last B&D rape has permutations that affect all those around Michèle's sick but financially successful life.

Maybe she had some work done but it surely doesn't show like we are used to with other celebrities that had some procedures done. Besides her good looks she is also a good actress and that's also the case in Elle. She's the main character playing a successful business woman with a past, that is being brutally raped.

He keeps this stunning character lead thriller moving forward with ferocious delight even though the subject matter is so hard to digest. He is no stranger to controversy but this film really does go into those areas we would rather not go. A great script ensures that however unpalatable an action, a belief or a desire we will give the performer the chance to take us with them. We are certainly asked to engage with some less than cheery stuff here with multiple rape, mass murder, mothers behaving badly, indeed almost everybody behaving badly and much death but there is a compulsion for us to delve deeper. This belief and fascination in what happens however awful is a credit to script writer, director and the only actress who could have played this role, Isabelle Huppert. Remarkable.",Elle
14,namashi_1,Isabelle Huppert Delivers The Performance Of The Year in this Psychological-Thriller!,10,4 January 2017,"In 'Elle', We Find Legendary Director Paul Verhoeven at his riskiest & creepiest. Its a Psychological-Thriller, that brings its characters in unbearable & unforgivable circumstances. And Isabelle Huppert seems sporty enough to take the challenges & in return, Delivers The Performance Of The Year.'Elle' Synopsis: A successful businesswoman gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse as she tracks down the unknown man who raped her.Based on the Novel Oh... by Philippe Djian, 'Elle' sees a raped victim unaffected & believe me, you need a really strong stomach to absorb this story. Verhoeven tackles a subject as disturbing & shocking as rape & converts it into a thriller, without ever making it depressing. Isabelle Huppert's Michèle Leblanc, the protagonist, is a one of its kind creature, who refuses to be subjected or sympathized with after being violated by a masked man. Its a powerful & at times, despicable character, that is a mix of strength & agony.Expect Oscar Chase for Huppert, who delivers a performance that redefines the word ""embodiment"". I know, I'm the same writer who said Amy Adams in Arrival was the one to cheer for this year & oh boy, what a performance that was! But Huppert is the one who deserves that honor the most. When was the last time we saw a female protagonist this twisted & irresistible? I can't remember. So this will do.I won't add anymore details about 'Elle' & how Verhoeven keeps the narrative going.

It was very sexy and provocative and it pushed the limits as director Paul Verhoeven is known for doing just that!(I remember his classic HBO ""Hitchhiker"" episode ""Last Scene""). This film takes twist and you as the viewer grow accustomed to the pain and drama just as the lead character Michele does. Set in France and done well with French subtitles ""Elle"" is the story of an elegant cougar socialite business lady named Michele(in a fine and top notch performance from Isabelle Huppert)who as the head of a video game company is successful, yet after being attacked in her own home and being brutally raped things change. Life is a guess spin of doubt for Michele as no one around her seems who they are.Michele is a damaged soul anyway as her old father is away at prison on murder charges, and her relationship with her mother is strained and her co workers at work clash as her bed encounters with different members seems to be coming to much to handle. And Michele has an attraction to her next door neighbor Patrick(Laurent Lafitte)a married man who's not what he seems to be.Thru it all life and passion pleasure becomes a cat and mouse game for Michele it's like she grows use to it it's painful ways yet provocative and fun games. And yes many of the sex scenes are violent and raw and Huppert is one sexy woman as I liked her hot scenes of wearing silk blouses and sexy colored bras especially those black bras!

And ELLE, is his first French film which debuted earlier in this year's Cannes, headlined by an impeccably charismatic Isabelle Huppert.Elle refers to Michèle LeBlanc (Huppert), a middle-aged divorcée, who is the head of a video-game company in Paris (an interesting career choice), leads a quite complacent life regardless of some dissonances, like her ex Richard (Berling), with whom she remains an amiable rapport, is dating a new graduate student Hélène (Pons) which raises her eyebrows mixed with a small dosage of jealousy; Josie (Isaaz), the insolent girlfriend of their unambitious son Vincent (Bloquet), is a vitriolic nuisance, now that she is pregnant, they are dependent on Michèle to pay the rent of a new apartment; then her botox-addicted mother Irène (Magre, so sprightly in her age, almost 90), is too smitten with her toy boy Ralph (Lenglet) to be ethical; plus that she is having an affair with Robert (Berkel), the husband of her best friend and colleague Anna (Consigny), just as corny as that.But a horrific accident will disrupt the status quo, she is raped by a masked intruder in her own apartment, and with her own reason of not reporting the case to the police (a more horrific back story here), she carries on as if nothing happens apart from changing the locks and arming herself with a bottle of pepper spray. But the mysterious rapist doesn't leave her in peace, and she suspects that it is a personal reprisal due to some workplace disagreement, so she bribes a young employer to investigate her suspect. Meanwhile, she is sexually attracted to her neighbor Patrick (Lafitte), an urbane bank broker who lives across the street with his God-fearing wife Rebecca (Efira), Verhoeven and screenwriter David Birke pull no punches to foreground Michèle's sexual urges. An honest take of masturbation with the aid of a pair of binoculars bespeaks the unflinching audacity of the film's stance: we are all libido-driven creatures, even it will subject us to very perilous situations, we still cannot resist the delectable temptation.After the plot disclosing the identity of the rapist, the guessing game is over but the story veers into a more stimulating concept of why the act repeatedly happens and how far one would go to fully embrace the exploration of one's sexuality (to the extent of sadomasochism and role-playing), on the latter regard, the film is absolutely female-empowering, while the man is basely submitted to his primal desire, it is the woman who dares to challenge the perversity, question the insanity and take the initiative to navigate the course, which cannily imbues the preordained upshot with a tinge of ambiguity (is it a knowing plan of her or an unfortunate happenstance, which makes audience wonder).The synopsis of the story might sound morbid, but Verhoeven certainly shows his level- headedness to temper it with a comedic bent, mostly owing to Huppert's superb tour-de-force, she is fantastic in her poker-face frivolousness when saddled with the dead-serious matters, and unapologetically affective in the scenes where she is alone in the frame, submerging in her own thoughts and projecting enigmatic gazes, Michèle is a a hard case to crack, so proactive to seize the fate in her own hands, refuses to be sentimental or sympathetic. It goes without saying that Verhoeven has no intention of eliciting compassion or approval from viewers to justify Michèle's erratic behaviour, but admiration of her own unique existence, independent, honest and indestructible. A variegated supporting ensemble adorns and surrounds a sparkling Huppert, notable mentions to Laurent Lafitte, who legitimately balances on a very darker character between deception and candor, delves into the warring battle of a tortured soul and Anne Consigny, who is a refreshing, tendresse-radiating foil contrasting a relentlessly unfathomable Huppert.Love thy neighbors, but don't go overboard, ELLE is wittily provocative, unconventionally allegoric and intoxicatingly irresistible. Also the film has been selected as French candidate of BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURES, so Ms. Huppert is officially in contention for the increasingly chock-a-block Oscar race ahead, the plot deliciously thickens.",Elle
17,Hellmant,Extremely disturbing.,8,24 January 2017,"'ELLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new psychological thriller from director Paul Verhoeven; his first film in ten years (and his first movie filmed in the French language). It's based on the 2012 novel 'Oh...', by Philippe Djian, and it was scripted by David Birke. The film tells the story of a business woman, who's raped by a home intruder and plots revenge; without notifying the police of the crime. It stars Isabelle Huppert; who won a Golden Globe (for Best Actress in a Drama) for her performance. The movie has won multiple other respected awards, and it's been nominated for even more; it's also appeared on many critics' top ten lists. I found it to be a really well made, and extremely disturbing film.Michele Leblanc (Huppert) is the boss of a successful video game company; with a submissive adult son (Jonas Bloquet), and two narcissistic parents (including a convicted serial killer for a father). She's raped, one day in her home, by an intruder wearing a ski mask. At first she doesn't tell anyone about the crime, but later she informs her friends; who insist she needs to tell the police. Due to her traumatic past, she decides to take justice into her own hands.The movie is extremely different than anything Verhoeven has ever done before. It's a serious character driven drama; and not an exploitative erotic thriller, or an ultra-violent action movie. I'm a fan of Verhoeven's other work, and I love seeing great artists (like him) branch out. Huppert is fantastic in the lead, and the movie is an amazing female empowerment film. It's slow-paced, and extremely disturbing (like I already said), but I definitely think it's a film that's worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM",Elle
18,MOscarbradley,Verhoeven's masterpiece.,9,6 February 2017,"A woman is raped in her home by a masked intruder. She doesn't report it to the police but decides to deal with it in her own way. She also happens to be the daughter of a psychopath now in prison for slaughtering 27 people. The director is Paul Verhoeven, now 78 but just as keen to court controversy as he ever was and ""Elle"" may be his masterpiece.It's also as far from your conventional rape revenge fantasy as you can imagine. For starters, it's often very funny albeit in the blackest possible way while working as a genuinely thrilling whodunit; the initial attack is only the beginning. It's also a disturbingly frank study of a warped psychology; in the end are the victim and the perpetrator that much different? It helps, of course, that the woman is Isabelle Huppert, perhaps the only actress fearless enough to take on the role. She's magnificent but then when isn't she magnificent. I don't think there is anyone working in mainstream cinema today who can touch her. And with Huppert in the lead you may be reminded of Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"", another classic study of a dysfunctional sexual relationship. Will it win her the Oscar? Almost certainly not; the Academy seldom embraces anything this dark but when they do pass her over the loss will be as much theirs as it is Huppert's.",Elle
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An enthralling exploration of the taboo desires of slightly sociopathic people.,7,30 January 2018,"Apparently so controversial that several American actors passed up on the opportunity to play the lead part and Paul Verhoeven had to take his long-awaited return (to form at least) out of the US entirely, this subversive pseudo psycho-sexual thriller represents a rather unique take on the tried and tested rape-revenge genre, moving far away from pure exploitation and instead heading into an enthralling exploration of the taboo desires of slightly sociopathic people. There's nothing really conventional about 'Elle (2017)' and that might be what makes it so compelling, with the absolutely phenomenal screenplay brought to life by equally engaging, rivetingly realistic power-house performances, and the fact that each intriguing new layer just feels so natural despite the brazenly bizarre tone and inconsistent pacing is a testament to the rich character development and world building that makes the piece seem so wholly believable. 7/10",Elle
20,dromasca,dark and intriguing,8,28 November 2016,"Paul Verhoeven is close to 80 years old. I was unaware about this biographical detail until reading his bio on IMDb. I thought about him as being much younger, and the reasons are to be found in his films. Verhoeven is a director who does not avoid controversy, from picking his themes and sources of inspiration to bringing to screen strong and special characters (especially feminine ones) who deal with their fate and their sexuality in a very unconventional manner. The director of RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, Starship Troopers, Black Book may be drawing to the end of the 8th decade of his life, but Elle continues to position him as a strong and different kind of director, and does not look at all as a slowing down or concluding film of any kind.The film starts with an ugly and violent rape scene, which sets the main theme the movie deals with, but the way the subject is approached by the main heroine and the director is quite different than expected. The victim is a business woman leading a video games company which produces violent games and has a troubled history of herself. Her father was a serial killer imprisoned for perpetuity (there is no death penalty in France) and his name and dark fame was not forgotten by the public, the blame being reflected on his family as well. The whole family is troubled, relationships are broken or hard to keep, side affairs are managed more or less in the open. No-one seems capable to tell the truth or face truth. Police cannot be involved and the threat of the return of the rapist seems to put pressure on the lead character.The combination of psychological thriller with dark erotics works well because the story is well written, twists and changes surprise the viewers at many moments, and each of the characters (lead and supporting) has a distinct identity and good reasons to act as they do, although their motives may become clear only late in the story. Isabelle Huppert is the perfect casting for a woman who has seen so many and suffered so much in her life, who tries to find appeasement in sex, but do not expect Verhoeven to present some conventional type of relationship. At the end, there is no moral in the story, maybe just an anti-moral conclusion. Trying to tell the truth does not pay up for the the hero of this story. Her short tentative to stop lying and fooling around (with herself first of all) fails and resorting back to the smaller or bigger lies is the only way to re-establish the balance for the heroes of the story. Or at least for those heroes who survive by the end of the story.",Elle
21,851222,Great movie,10,21 March 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Elle"" (2016) is a great drama, solid mystery / thriller and a great character study film. And what a character we have here. Michèle Leblanc is probably one of the most memorable screen characters I've seen in many moons. She is superbly written, dark, hilarious and one of the kind. Acting by Isabelle Huppert was phenomenal. I didn't saw ""La La Land"" so i can't argue who should have won Oscar for best performance, but i kinda think Isabelle Huppert was deserving it more - this is a brilliant, multi-layered performance. And there isn't a bad or weak performance in a whole movie. It is amazingly acted, terrifically written and also superbly directed movie. Overall, ""Elle"" is like a breath of fresh air. It avoids all clichés, its not predictable for a second yet always plausible story superbly told. And even the background of what she does in her life (head of game developing company) is fresh - i kinda expected it to be some art gallery owner or stuff like that at the beginning of movie, but there isn't anything predictable in this movie. This is a one great and hard to forget film.",Elle
22,clanciai,Complicated relationships with frustrations result in more than one 'crime passionel',9,10 April 2017,"Isabelle Huppert is convincing all the way as the executive mother running a turbulent enterprise with many artistic and tempered employees of creating violent computer games and has had a hard time and life creating her position out of an impossible start in life as the daughter of a mass murderer. Her position is seriously put at risk when she is assaulted at home by a masked rapist, the scene of which opens the film and sets the stage and the sustained suspense - not even when it is finally revealed who he is the plot ceases to thicken. Other people are involved, several employees and other lovers, and there is even a childbirth exposing the father as not the father. The main theme and red line of the film however is Isabelle Huppert's settling with her past, with her dying father in prison, with her grotesque mother, with her ex-husband and with her lovers, but she ultimately succeeds in emerging out of all the lies with her integrity saved and intact. It is therefore a very constructive film in spite of its shabby intrigues and decadent love affairs, one worse than the other, while at the same time it's an exciting thriller. The dialogue is intelligent all the way, and there is no risk of anyone falling asleep during its more than two hours in basically the same closed up environment all the time. An excellent if not outstanding French thriller and psychological drama dealing mainly with the ubiquitous human problem of sex.Paul Verhoeven is most famous for ""Basic Instinct"" with Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas 24 years ago, but this is equally intriguing and more complex.

23,Reno-Rangan,Sometimes the Action decides its own fate.,7,24 December 2016,"I had no thought before the watch, but while watching it, I felt it was overrated. That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.The film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.""Michele to her cat: You did not have to claw his eyes out, but scratch him at least.""It is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.I did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.7/10",Elle
24,sol-,Cat's Eye,7,29 October 2016,"Not your average rape revenge thriller, this Paul Verhoeven movie focuses on a middle aged video game designer who becomes internally conflicted after she is sexually assaulted by a masked intruder. In what at first seems a baffling move, she does not report the matter to the police, but as the film progresses, we gradually learn how she has come to mistrust them. Then, as the film progresses further, there is room to wonder whether actually enjoyed the rape in a perverted way. Solid a premise as this may be and convincing as Isabelle Huppert is, 'Elle' is nevertheless compromised by a script that pulls in several directions at once with Huppert's feelings over the rape often relegated to the backdrop. There is a ton of domestic drama involving both her son and her mother, plus there are unanswered questions raised as to whether she assisted her father to commit a heinous past crime. Unanswered questions also abound in terms of a baby's parentage, a pious neighbour's knowledge of her husband, and the list goes on. 'Elle' has been described as a provocative film, but the biggest question it provokes is what all these odd subplots add up to. If flawed, the film still showcases Verhoeven as polished as ever for a director nearing 80 without a feature film to his name for decade. An especially effective touch is how we initially only see the rape off-screen as a cat watches, and yet, as the film progresses, we see the incident play out again and again in increasingly graphic detail. Verhoeven has never shied away from shocking imagery and while less action-packed than 'RoboCop' and 'Total Recall', the film is likely to please admirers of his craft. The video game angle is also very cool given Verhoeven's penchant for altered reality in his oeuvre.",Elle
25,TheMovieDiorama,Elle manages to thrill audiences through exaggerative eroticism with questionable plot points.,7,5 August 2018,"Psychologically stimulating throughout, Verhoeven portrays a different response to the invasive penetration of rape. One I haven't seen before, and considering the event in question immediately takes place as the film commences, the originality of this perspective bursts through the screen. A businesswoman, leading a video game company, is raped in her own home but decides not to report it due to past incidents with the police. Two vital elements of this production elevate it above the endless stream of psychological thrillers. Verhoeven's astute direction and Huppert's electrifying central performance. She, somehow, maintains a role that demands physical prowess and emotional damage. Her character's work life is so important and hectic, that she has no choice but to continue on despite the horrific crime that took place. Huppert magnificently conveyed rigidity, she was a strong character that you subconsciously admire her, even if her moral compass is slightly skewed. The psychological aspects remained refreshing as Verhoeven slowly peels away the complex layers that shroud this thriller. Plenty of backstory, substantial character development and an array of suspicious individuals, each carrying immorality. Some of the scenes, particularly the sexual encounters, felt reminiscent to 90s erotic thrillers due to the musical score. Old fashioned, yet nostalgically innovative. The problem, and it comes down to personal taste, was with a specific plot point that left the entire third act rather unfocused. Once the culprit is identified, Huppert's character seemingly continues sexual activities and it came across as hyperbolically forced, just to further illustrate her dementedness. It didn't work for me and released the grip that this thriller had on me. Also the relentless wave of unlikable characters really hindered the emotional response the story was trying to achieve. A decent thriller, one that is produced to the highest quality possible, but crumbles far too quickly towards its conclusion.",Elle
26,subxerogravity,"I enjoined the movie, all together. Great actress! Great director! good story!",7,14 November 2016,"I must admit, I read somewhere that the movie is controversial. That and Paul Verhoeven as director got me into it. It sure does have his flare. I'm thinking of the Verhoeven who directed such classics as Robocop and Basic Instincts, so it does not surprise me how very sexy the movie is and how the little pieces of violence in the film are not easy to look at.It's an interesting look at a woman who was sexually assaulted. From an American stand point, I can't think of a film that I've seen handle rape in this fashion, especially as a serious main focus. On one hand it was a very explainable down to Earth look at things, on the other hand it seems weirdly improbable.Either way, it was a great drama about a very strong woman trying to get ahead, and keep that strength after being rape. It almost feels like Verhoeven made a sophisticated version of the rape/revenge movie I Spit on Your Grave, and when I think about it that way it's the best movie ever.",Elle
27,jtindahouse,A film that only the French could pull off,8,12 February 2017,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love the way the French make movies. They're so damn thought-provoking. You leave the cinema with 100 questions, all of which are answerable in some way if you dissect the film. 'Elle' is no exception. There are a dozen things I still can't get my head around. It's a particularly twisted tale which strays far from expectations. Based on the synopsis of the film I thought we were for your standard revenge-genre film, but the actual film turned out completely different from that.Isabelle Huppert has been nominated for Best Acress in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards for her very fine performance here. She has already won the Golden Globe a few weeks back. Needless to say, she was absolutely brilliant. The intensity and complexity that she manages to portray to the audience shows the work of an absolute master of her craft - and that's without me even understanding the language she spoke. Instantly, I understood what her character was about (perhaps not to the extent I would later learn) and then not for one moment from then on did she let her portrayal slip. A brilliant performance that I would be very happy to see take home the award.Director Paul Verhoeven shows he is in complete control of his film. He's known for these types of films, where to an extent nothing is off limits. Every scene feels like it holds significance. Be warned, it is a very dark film in nature, but if you're not bothered by that then it is one not to be missed.",Elle
28,Turfseer,Salacious potboiler and black comedy proves decidedly entertaining due to Huppert's strong performance and numerous twists and turns in the plot,7,13 February 2017,"Elle is noted Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's first French language film and first film since Black Book in 2006. Verhoeven--known in the US for the original RoboCop in 1987 and Total Recall, starring Arnold Schwarznegger--based his film on French writer Philippe Djian's novel Oh, released in 2012. Elle, however, feels very American in its sensibilities and that might be due to the fact that the screenwriter is David Birke, a US citizen.Not everyone will like Elle, especially women. It concerns Michèle Leblanc, an owner of a video game production company, expertly played by the noted veteran actress, Isabelle Huppert. Right away one feels uncomfortable with the story as Michèle is the victim of a rape in her home by a masked assailant. She refuses to call the police as she soon tells some friends at a restaurant that she's had bad experiences with them and fears the publicity will ruin her business, which has taken her years to build into a success.Subsequent scenes in which the rapist reappears and attacks Michèle again in her home become even more disturbing as it appears Michèle is acting as if she's enjoying herself. This in itself is enough to turn off the average cinephile. But there may be a number of reasons why Huppert decided to accept the role. First and foremost, Michèle is depicted as a ballsy woman determined to protect her independence at all costs. Her back story is that when she was 10 years old, she was present when her father, now jailed for life, committed a mass murder involving dozens of victims. At that time, an eerie photograph of the young Michèle appeared in the papers and the public condemned her as her father's accomplice. Hence it took her years to overcome the bad publicity--which accounts for her steely demeanor.Despite the salacious nature of the narrative, Elle has so many twists and turns and bizarre sub-plots that one becomes engrossed in the proceedings, after one crazy thing happens after the next. There is Michèle's misguided son Vincent, whose surly girlfriend delivers a dark- skinned baby, and claims the baby is his; then there is Michèle carrying on an affair with Robert, who is married to her best friend and business partner, Anna. Michèle also must deal with her elderly mother who insists on getting involved with younger men.The main plot concerns the aforementioned rapist, who is eventually unmasked as Michèle's creepy neighbor, Patrick. After getting into a car accident, Michèle ends up calling Patrick to help her, and eventually continues to engage in sex with him, despite his role-playing as a rapist.Verhoeven somehow manages to bring this part potboiler and black comedy to a fitful happy ending when Michèle decides to confront her father by visiting him in the prison, only to discover when she shows up in the morning, that he has committed suicide the night before.More happy resolutions include Michèle's change of heart in reference to all the rough sex with Patrick and the apparent set-up where Vincent bashes Patrick's head in after he attacks Michèle for the last time; Patrick's religious fundamentalist wife who thanks Michèle for satisfying Patrick's ""needs,"" Vincent's newfound lack of passivity in reference to his once aggressive wife and Michèle's reconciliation with Anna, who forgives her for all the indiscretions with her husband and offers to move in together.For all those uncomfortable with the main character's unhealthy flirtation and role-playing with a rapist, the inclusion of an act of revenge, undoubtedly masterminded by Michèle, may be enough to warrant approbation after a skeptical viewer's initial misgivings. Coupled with the aforementioned plot twists and Huppert's extremely strong performance, Elle, despite its tawdry underpinnings, may prove more entertaining than the usual recently released American potboiler.",Elle
29,jadavix,Tiring and unfocused... but brave,6,6 January 2017,"""Elle"" is a movie with much to recommend it, but perhaps one fatal flaw. It is an example of a movie which is less than the sum of its parts.Isabelle Huppert is our protagonist, a survivor of rape, and yet never really a victim of it. This is no rape/revenge tale. She makes the decision, for reasons we later understand, to not report the attack to the police. Even the rapist turns out to be more than we expect, and Huppert's relationship with him is one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie.So what, you ask, is the problem?It's simply too loose, too long. Too baggy. You find yourself losing interest and wanting it to end. The movie needed editing at the script stage. The only moments that really grab your attention are the scenes of violence, which are pretty standard thriller territory: the woman crawling away from the attacker, reaching for something to use as a weapon, perhaps finding something, perhaps not, while the assailant grabs her by the legs and pulls her towards him.The rest of the movie isn't glimpsed as clearly as this. Perhaps a great director such as Verhoeven should be given credit for letting the story breathe, but for what purpose? I never thought I'd be bored by one of his movies, but here we are.",Elle

This happens again and she appears to be encouraging this.....um....activity. Why on earth is she doing this many will ask. Later we learn her father was responsible for a grizzly mass murder that she sort of was involved with as a young girl. Grim right! I thought this was going to be about a women tracking down and getting vindication against her attacker. The film isn't over the top with what it shows but many of the character's actions and decisions are preposterous and unexpected beyond the demented protagonist. Avoid this one! 2 points for the production quality.",Elle
31,jimbo-53-186511,It's easy to see why everyone in Hollywood snubbed this project...,1,18 July 2017,"Elle is probably one of the worst films I've seen in quite some time and is nothing more than pretentious art-house nonsense that ends up having very little to say for itself...The central premise is troubling (the main plot focuses on a woman getting raped and then trying to track down the man that raped her). If this had been handled well then it could have been a fast-paced thriller where justice is served at the end of the film, but it rarely, if at all, ever plays out in this manner...To begin with, the film is unbearably slow and unfocused; the story is supposed to be about a woman tracking down the man responsible for raping her, but we rarely witness her actually trying to find out who attacked her. In fact, the rape scene is repeated on about 3 different occasions for no apparent reason?? It's also not a particularly easy film to become emotionally involved in as Michele doesn't seem to react to being raped in the same way that most women would react; she tells a group of friends that she's been raped, but just shrugs it off after that and doesn't report it and generally seems unfazed by what has happened to her. The film then crams in other uninteresting sub-plots; her son and his mad girlfriend, her ex-husband and his young partner. They all play various clichés that seem to just be there to make up the numbers and fill the running time as they are not developed at all, add very little to the story, and never have more than one dimension.I think the most disturbing thing about this film comes with the reveal as to who actually raped Michele and the direction that the story takes from this point onwards; again rather than reporting the man that carried out this appalling act she again carries on as though nothing has happened; having dinner with him, laughing and joking with him. I just found it all a bit sick and couldn't make sense of it? It gets worse later in the film when we learn that Michele's loneliness meant that she enjoyed having sex with the rapist and had been having an affair with him for months? WTF??? What kind of a f***ed up message is that? I understand a bored lonely housewife wanting a bit of action, but with a rapist? I just found the whole film appalling and uncomfortable to watch.According to the trivia section, Verhoeven wanted to make this film in the US, but had to move production to France because no Hollywood actress was prepared to take on the role and after witnessing what I've just seen then this comes as no surprise. Verhoeven was certainly brave taking this project on, but as a social commentary it is a misguided, clumsy effort that lacks any real insight and as a thriller it is unfocused and dull.All in all, it's a thoroughly unpleasant pretentious art-house flick whose ambitions far outweigh its results.",Elle

33,aharmas,What a Woman!!!,10,27 November 2016,"Huppert does superb work here, maybe the best she has ever done. Ironically, the film is not what many in the industry consider as material that showcases the best a good actor has to offer, and it's a sad way to evaluate someone's work. What is important here is how complex and well developed her character and the performance are. ""Elle"" is the story of a woman who carries too much on her shoulders; somehow has found ways to cope with the many difficulties she has encountered. Among them is a family that is as dysfunctional as anyone can imagine. Watch for her exchange in the hospital when she is ""celebrating"" the birth of her grandchild. Communication skills are not her forte, but she has become a successful businesswoman and has upset a few people along the way.She is victimized and assaulted by a mysterious man. As she has done previously, she tries to deal with the situation to the best of her abilities; however, it's a difficult enterprise because it awakens some very interesting emotions in her, an extension of her personality perhaps? Throughout the film, she keeps reliving the experience, and things begin changing in her life.Now, she is more assertive, confronting people at work, flirting with her next door neighbor, disposing of lovers, which she has grown tired of seeing. This becomes more complicated, as her attacker keeps taunting her. There is impending possibility of more violence, of things turning uglier, and in the hands of the director of ""Basic Instinct"" and ""The 4th Man"", things can turn out pretty strange.It's wonderful to see him in strong command of a project like this. Sometimes, I was feeling just like people probably did when Hitchcock came up with a new film. It's an interesting mix of elegance, voyeurism, twisted psychology, and also a pretty dark and disturbing comedy. There are moments when revelations occur, when one has to laugh, most likely a a nervous reaction to something that touches a nerve in the members of the audience. The relationship between daughter and mother is outrageous, and it serves to provide some balance when things start to go darker.Everything is connected. When we see the development of the new video game project, we're reminded of the main story line. Her new aggressive behavior has origins in the past. Maybe her personality was fighting the restrictions of her status, and there's the father's criminal past. Is everything genetic? Learned behavior? All of this makes for some interesting discussions, and everything in ""Elle"" works because of the way Huppert's character interacts with the rest of the people in her life. It's a demanding role, with much to enjoy, and it's both demanding physically and mentally. It's an Oscar worthy performance, and I hope it receives the praise it deserves.Great overall.",Elle
34,valleyjohn,Pretentious,5,20 May 2021,"When I watched the trailer for Elle the words that described the film were Electrifying, Thrilling , Astonishing, Riveting, Audacious , Glorious , Captivating and Ingenious .I think they must have watched a different film to me because I would associate absolutely none of these words to describe this film.The best word to Describe Elle is - French !This is the store of a businesswoman with a shady background, who gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse as she tracks down the unknown man who raped her.When I say this film is French , I mean it's slow . It dialogue heavy. It's full of posh people making stupid decisions and having dinner parties , despite hating everyone they invite .It's too long and it involves sexual deviancy that makes little or no sense .That's most French films in my experience.To call this a thriller is stretching it. It's nothing of the kind .It's the kind of film that students of cinema wet themselves over but 99% of the public don't want to see and for good reason .It isn't all bad. I liked the ballsyness of Elle and I understood her reluctance to get the police involved in what was happening to her because of her past . I also liked the awkward situations she found herself in with friends and family and how bluntly she dealt with them - but that's about it.Arthouse cinema is for the most part , pretentious and this is the perfect example .Director, Paul Verhoeven may have a good reputation in some circles but on this showing , not in mine.",Elle
35,Amari-Sali,"If you thought Gone Girl was twisted, oh you have seen nothing yet.",9,1 January 2017,"Trigger Warning(s):Rape (Multiple Scenes) | Domestic Abuse (Verbal and Physical)Noted Actor(s)Michèle (Isabelle Huppert) | Richard (Charles Berling)Characters & StorylineA rape within the first scene of the film sets the tone, as well as how Michèle acts almost nonchalant about it thereafter. For she has seen and experienced horror, so what is this but another thing to add to the list. Plus, there are mixed feelings about the whole ordeal it seems.That aside, she has too much on her plate to deal with cops, who she has despised since an incident in her childhood, for she is running a company with her best friend, she has a grown son whose girlfriend is controlling and erratic, and she is the mistress to a man who is barely satisfying anymore but keeps her on her toes.Though with it seeming her rapist has decided to become a stalker, and decides to take their obsession to her place of work, so comes a more cautious, though barely fearful, Michèle. For even as things become more serious, she continues to be unbothered for there is so much more to worry about than a coward who doesn't simply ask for what, if he is interesting and attractive, she may freely give.Things To NoteI think when it comes to the Oscars, and other award ceremonies, it is going to be between Emma Stone's likability vs. Isabelle Huppert's performance. But I say this before watching Arrival, Miss Sloane, and Jackie.HighlightsHuppert Is StunningWhile beautiful, yes, I mean stunning in terms of shock more than anything. The way rape is handled, the way she handles her odd mother, the past of her father, her staff, her friendships and more, it makes it hard to believe there was a time Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone, and many others were considered for this role. It seems almost written for Huppert who, almost in a Helen Mirren sense, has this eternal charm yet just as much seems she would kiss you on the lips and stab you in the gut over something you did decades ago.The StoryThe story is comprised of a few mysteries and it tries to redirect your attention and throw you off enough to the point you aren't just sure who did it, but what the reason could be behind it. For one thing, I don't think was often advertised, is Michèle's family past which deals with the type of act which has haunted one town for more than a generation. So with that, her working in a company where most of her male staffers reportedly hate her, then, of course, the usual demented who like stealing a woman's power, dignity, and comfort, you are left constantly question who could it be?All the while, it was strange to not see Michèle done in by the act. Which is part of the praise you need to give to screenwriter David Birke. Michèle is never written to be a victim. In a way, you can barely call her a survivor either for while she buys weapons and pepper spray, and has some PTSD, as the situation evolves you almost question the whole situation and whether you truly know what you think you know.On The FenceMichèle's RelationshipsI'm often conflicted when it comes to the role of supporting actors. Should they be presented strong enough to stand out, maybe perhaps even steal the lead actor's thunder, or should their character solely be about the lead's journey. This is something I struggle with, especially once the movie is over, for, honestly, while many of Michèle's family and friends have full lives without her, they aren't given enough energy or time to make it so their character feels even the least bit autonomous. I mean, even with us meeting one of Richard's, Michèle's ex-husband, girlfriends, it seems not so much about her ex moving on as finding a way to bring up why they divorce and show there is still some part of her that has feelings for him.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing) - RecommendedI was in awe, in shock, questioning every motive and decision, and like a child with my elbows on my knees just lost yet focused on the person speaking. And while, yeah, after the fact I was left questioning why some of Michèle's friends and family put up with her, and some of her decisions, in the movie you are so engaged that this is not even a factor.But what makes this recommended, and not just something worth seeing, is it's so different and isn't reliant on pity, nostalgia, or even the characters being likable. This is purely about performing a role, creating a universe, and bringing you in to the point you don't want to leave. Thus making me mad I didn't just haul my behind to NY in November to see this when it first came out.",Elle
36,EdgarST,Superficial Approach to Complexity,5,23 December 2017,"I am not a follower or scholar of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's worked. I liked a few of his films a lot, others left me indifferent. However, I recognize that there is a gulf between the incendiary films he made in the Netherlands, and what he does now, after establishing in Los Angeles and becoming an ""international filmmaker"". Between the man who made ""Turkish Delights"" (1973) and ""The Fourth Man"" (1983), to the one that directed ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) and ""Showgirls"" (1995). There is a transition from his early simple and honest movies to the standardized products made with high budgets, that lack the disturbing world vision in the first works. And after going up and down, between poor works and other more successful (as the amusingly proto-fascist ""Starship Troopers"" in 2000), Verhoeven returned to Europe taking with him the expertise of industrial cinema, mixed with some viruses that affect the cinema of Los Angeles. In 2016 ""Elle"" was released, his adaptation of the novel ""Oh ..."" by Philip Djian, which provoked debates and controversies about the vision of the female world and the ""empowerment"" of women. Long in excess (2 hours, 11 minutes) and with a pastiche and monotonous musical score by Anne Dudley, ""Elle"" tells the story of an unhappy, perverse and sick businesswoman who is experiences a curious regression towards her past and old family ""values"" , after reaching the lowest point of her downfall when she is violated repeatedly by a masked man. I do not deny that similar stories can occur in reality or that everyone perceives the cinema in their own way, but I really do pass. Verhoeven applied the skin-deep ""know-how"" he learned in commercial films to a story that demanded a bit more rigor, perception and sharpness. He opted for effects and sensationalism: maybe it was always the same in his film prehistory in Holland, and I never noticed it, I do not know... The cynical and feminazi audience of these times ended up applauding a character without ethics, without love, only with an insatiable and almost dry vagina. The ""well-behaved"" world discovered Isabelle Huppert! The actress does absolutely nothing here that she has not done the same or better in countless times... I do not know how many films to mention, because I've always liked what she does: ""The Lacemaker"", ""Violette Nozière"", ""A Story of Women"" , ""The Ceremony"", ""The Pianist"" ... In short, to each his own. Surely, there are those who liked it and want French cinema to lose its own signature and resemble one more melodrama from Hollywood. Bon appétit.",Elle
37,Luigi Di Pilla,Too overrated and disappointing,5,20 August 2017,"I checked this out when it came in the theaters. I had really great luck not having seen it on the great screen. Instead I bought the DVD very cheap. A reviewer wrote that this story lacks of cleverness. I agree with him totally. Which woman wouldn't call the police if she has been raped or even hurt dangerously. This is an example why Elle let me without any special emotions or suspense. At the end I can only say that was it and I will never see it again. Save the money for a much better movie in the cinema. If you are interested in this genre of film I recommend to see Don't Breath, The General's Daughter or 8mm. Too overrated here: 5/10",Elle

Starring Isabelle Huppert, Laurent Lafitte, Jonas Bloquet, Anne Consigny, Charles Berling, Christian Berkel, Virginie Efira, Judith Magre, Alice Isaaz, Lucas Prisor, Arthur Mazet. (R)Divorced mother and businesswoman Huppert, victim of a rape in the opening scene, instigates a psychosexual game with her masked stalker while dealing with a fractured and morally-perilous personal life. Part mid-life crisis exploration, part rape-revenge female empowerment thriller, part corrosive black comedy, it is such a transgressive product of controversial director Paul Verhoeven's identity that one can only assume that the only reason it took so long for him to make it is because it's so fearlessly subversive that he needed to be out of the Hollywood system to get it done (well, that, and because it's based on a novel called ""Oh..."" that didn't get published until earlier in the decade). Huppert is sensational in the lead role, playing a character of such ruthless complications that it's nearly impossible to not detest her on some level while recognizing painful humanity (even relatability) on another. Challenging, to say the least (the roll call is full of so-called deplorables, and one could view it all as feminist anti-heroism just as easily as rationalized misogyny), and flawed around its brittle edges, notably in the way that the climactic ""shock"" rings inauthentic and underwhelming, but the enterprise remains utterly absorbing throughout in its cold, perverse way. Verhoeven's best film in over twenty-five years, but don't expect much resemblance at all to that Schwarzenegger picture.84/100",Elle
39,bandw,Huppert's performance was the only redeeming value for me,3,24 March 2017,"Isabelle Huppert plays Michèle, the woman referenced in the title. Some reviewers have remarked on there being humor in this, but I would not advise anyone to go to this expecting any knee slappers. The opening scene features a brutal rape that makes it hard to imagine its being filmed more graphically. That scene sets the tone. If you are looking for sadomasochism, infidelity, lesbianism, and masturbation, you will find it here. Mix in some repugnant scenes from a video game being developed by Michèle's company, a car crash, and Michele's detailing the exploits of the mass killings of her father and you have a movie that is difficult to watch.Maybe the humor is to view this as a satire on a certain segment of upscale, tech-savvy French society, but if that was the intended takeaway, it flew over my head.Huppert gives a strong, nuanced performance and that was pretty much the only thing I could appreciate. Michèle is a woman who, after the initial rape, picks up the phone and, instead of calling the police, orders out. That certainly turns the current attitude toward rape on its head, until you understand that Michèle has some private reasons for not going public. But the scene does alert the audience of Michèle's being a strong-willed force of nature. I can't think of any admirable male character in this. Is part of the message, ""Men bad?""In sitting through a difficult movie like this, I hope for some compensatory reward, but this movie did not pay off for me.",Elle

It has several themes including violence in computer games, sexual empowerment, and lax suburban crime prevention.

43,proud_luddite,Too twisted,5,24 April 2018,"Michèle Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) is a well-off Parisian CEO of a video-game company. Her past includes a childhood trauma and her life is troubled in various ways among family, friends, and people at work. Things get worse when she is brutally raped and has a very unusual response to the situation.In the film's favour, it is very well directed by Paul Verhoeven who creates a dark and mysterious mood. He is well aided by the haunting musical score by Anne Dudley. Huppert is also marvelous in the lead role. This is to be expected as her presence and performances always raise her films to a higher level.The trouble is in the role itself as well as the script. Yet again, Huppert plays a twisted sadomasochist like she did in ""The Piano Teacher"". While she can be praised for taking on dark roles, it would be nice for the sake of contrast to see her in a cheesy rom-com in which her greatest dilemma would be deciding what to buy as a Christmas gift for a loved one.Despite potential sympathy for all that has happened to her, Michèle, like almost everyone else in the movie, is unlikeable. David Birke's screenplay has too many oddities and leaves too many loose ends by the conclusion. It also has a very contorted view of the traumatic experience of rape - something that leaves a poor taste by the end.",Elle
44,maurice_yacowar,Raped woman survives and thrives,8,29 January 2017,"With his masterful Elle Paul Verhoeven joins the elite — Bunuel, Hitchcock — in seeing how pervasive is the perverse. He extends the explicitness from Hitchcock's Frenzy as he examines the power of the sex drive in a humanity devoid of innocence. Consider the two religious characters. Michele's father obsessively blessed the neighbourhood children on their way to school. Ordered to stop his blessing, he went mad and slaughtered a host of people — and pets. Neighbour Patrick's wife Rebecca is pure Christian, saying grace, watching the Pope's Christmas mass on TV, journeying to witness his visit. But it turns out she's known all along that her husband has been violently raping Michele — and thanks her for giving him what she couldn't. In a Bunuelian twist, Michele is first aroused by Patrick when she watches him carrying in the giant manger statues.Nature seems on the side of the sinful. Michele's cat witnesses the first rape with neither a squeal or a scratch to defend her owner. The storm rages enough to give Patrick the opportunity to come ""help"" Michele and try some normal sex with her. But he needs the weather's rage in himself if he is to perform. Paradoxically, the raped woman who was associated with her mass murderer father is attracted to the handsome banker who seems stable and virtuous (at least, Catholic). But that tall dark and handsome hero is the violent rapist who can't do normal sex. Everything — and everyone — is twisted.Michele's response to the first rape is surprisingly cool. She tidies up, soaks herself, then matter of factly proceeds with her life. She doesn't call the cops because she doesn't want to renew the police and press situation she suffered as a child. She prepares to defend herself against another attack and seeks in her acquaintances and colleagues any hint who he might be. When she tells her friends about the rape she retains that shell.And that's the point. Her childhood experience of her father's sin has left her unemotional, detached, even from her own violation. The press called her ""The Ash Girl"" and now she's the ash woman — dry remnants, all the fires spent. Whether masturbating at the manger scene or hand-jobbing her best friend's husband over a waste-paper basket, her sex is functional, free of passion or commitment. Her analytic remove contrasts to son Vincent's blind ardor for his bitchy fiancée and the obvious act ""his"" son is actually black. Michele supports him and tries to advise him but she lacks a motherly closeness. She even wonders if he might be the son of her best friend Anna, whom she let breast-feed him when her child died at birth. Michele's self-awareness and self-acceptance contrasts both to her grotesque mother's pursuit and use of young men and her ex-husband Richard's infatuation with a young Yoga teacher — who doesn't know his novels! Sex is an irrational drive towards all these characters' abasement. As is, of course, the sex Patrick requires of Michele and would likely continue to ""enjoy"" if Vincent had not stumbled into the scene and killed him. Vincent is as deluded about his mother's sex life as he is of his own.Michele has found a more sensible way to join the world of the young than her husband and mother have. Michele runs a hugely successful fantasy game empire that exploits the age's fascination with and fear of monstrous sexuality. The game scenes point to a society coarsened and savage in its diversions. It also reminds us how all art serves as a sublimation of our most compelling energies and drives. Patrick's brokerage (like his good glacially blonde Catholic wife) doesn't give him the fulfilment Michele's crew of gamers does her.The happy ending has the ironic sting of Bunuel's Viridiana. From the sequence of rape, blasphemy and betrayal a new relationship emerges. Having established the inadequacy of sex with her friend Anna's Robert, her own ex Richard and the violent rapist, now-dead Patrick, and not wishing to sink to her mother's hunger, Michele walks off with Anna. The first time they tried lesbian sex they dissolved into laughter. They have a cozy sleep together here. Whether they go on to a sexual relationship or to a post-sexual intimacy doesn't matter. They have survived a series of sexual and violent relationships and betrayals. They emerge beaten but unbowed. They've survived the destructive powers of sex — and have managed to make a fortune commercializing it for the frustrated adolescents aged 12-76. They are woman. They are strong.",Elle
45,mentalcritic,The rabid Paul Verhoeven fan approves.,8,4 November 2016,"Three and a half hours. In each direction. That is how much time I spent traveling (excluding putting up with certain other peoples' bullshit) to get to see Zwartboek ten years ago.So when I tell you I would gladly let Verhoeven turn one of my manuscripts into a film, understand where I am coming from. Since one of the darkest times in my life in 1988, Verhoeven has taught me more about how to tell a story with feeling and message than anyone else in literary, film, or musical circles. There would be a statue of the man in my private home on the world I would design. But this is not just about Verhoeven. It is about his latest offering in the cinema, a curious rape-revenge story called Elle.First of all, let us clear something up. Elle is a name given unto many girls at birth, but it is also the French word for ""she"" or ""her"". The central character in this tale is actually named Michèle, and she takes some getting used to, as unlike Ellis De Vries or Alex Murphy, Verhoeven does not want you to automatically like her just because she is the star of the story. The film begins with a fairly powerful depiction of her being raped on the kitchen floor of her house. I say powerful because it is repeated several different ways, but it never gets gratuitous or old. She is also raped again during the film, twice, but Verhoeven was paying attention in film school when the professor told the class ""if your scene does not tell the audience anything new about anyone or anything in the film, get rid of it"". We learn a lot about Michèle during this film, and because she is the most developed, most fully three- dimensional character in Verhoeven's entire career, a lot of what we learn churns our stomachs.You may have also gotten the impression from certain ""journalism"" that the film attacks ""social justice warriors"" or the drive to make the world a place where people other than rich white males can enjoy their lives. This is false. If anything, the film tells us two things. One, the world is not a safe place for women in their homes, in public, or even in bits. Two, simply talking about the problem, as opposed to violently making the people who make the problem stop, will solve nothing.Pretty much the entire film, we are watching Isabelle Huppert's character, Michèle go through the trials and tribulations of her life after a masked man rapes her in her home. Some might think the film is about the ""suspense"" of figuring out who this masked attacker is, but it is not. The real meat of the story is in seeing Michèle change as a person. Videos are circulated making light of her being attacked. Messages are sent to her, of a nature that only privileged men could think okay to send. And woven into this are several subthreads about her friends and family, including the fact that her son, in spite of being a foot taller than her or almost anyone else in the story, is in serious need of doing some stones-growing. She tells one man a story about the day her father, a mass murderer, was arrested whilst her ten year old self was standing in the yard, having helped father burn things within the house. This story was in the trailer, and in its proper context it is just as chilling coming out of Michèle's mouth as was the case in the trailer.On a scale of one to RoboCop or Zwartboek, Elle is about eight. Even Verhoeven's worst films have something about them that makes them stand out from the pack, but Elle is by far his most thought- provoking piece. Long have I said that people who want to feel safe and are not rich white men are going to have to fight for it. I will not spoil the climax of Elle, but I do wonder if Paul overheard me. Paul has effectively sent the Overgrown Baby-focused Hollywood a message in Elle. Specifically, I (Paul) am too good for you. Amen, Paul.",Elle

47,rockman182,Elle (2016),7,26 February 2017,"Finally was able to watch the final of the Oscar buzz films that I needed to see prior to the ceremony. Just in time too. While the film was dropped from the Best Foreign Film category after gaining traction, Isabelle Huppert can very well walk away with an Oscar for her performance in this film. Its a strong, outstanding performance from her for sure.I thought the film was mostly good and a return to a bit of form for Paul Verhoeven. Despite this, I still the think the film could have been better.I am going to start with the negatives since they aren't many. The film is quite long and not always focused. The main plot is about a video game company executive named Michele who gets raped in her home. She tries to go about her life as if nothing happened but then finds herself drawn to the rape and the future instances, which really blurs the line between rape, consent, and submission to sexual desire. The film doesn't always stay focused on what it is at heart. Its honestly hard to pinpoint what the film is really about since there's a few points of focus. I felt the film doesn't have many likable characters. And why would it? Its littered with characters who fall into a theme of philandering. I think the film introduces ideas of religion and the psychopathic nature of Elle's father; all of which was unnecessary.The film is long and clouded by things that didn't exactly meaningfully add to the story. I wasn't really sure what the film was going to be about. That said, there's definitely a strong erotic basis for the film which is Verhoeven at his best. The film flirts with the idea of cheating, rape, and consent throughout. Its a pervasive film but its exactly what you would expect from the filmmaker. People will find this film to be disturbing and at times quite vulgar but it remains alluring and pretty hypnotic. As I stated earlier its a return to form for Verhoeven because he plays to his strengths by tackling a sexually charged film once again.I know Isabelle Huppert isn't exactly a household name but she should be after this film. Its a magnetic performance. Michele is a bitch at times but very assertive and strong. She explores her sexual desires and boundaries and can handle her life in a very stone faced manner. She has a very complicated past and even mentions she may be a psychopath. Michele is a complex character: honest and at times scathing but its a wonderful portrayal. The film isn't perfect but I think film lovers need to check it out and form their own opinion on this.7/10",Elle
48,bankofmarquis,Balances comedy and drama expertly,8,22 January 2017,"When the French language film ELLE starts you are thrown into the middle of an act of rape.  Once concluded, our heroine - successful business woman Michele LeBlanc - must play a cat and mouse game to determine who her masked rapist is and how to exact revenge on him while at the same time navigating her wild and wacky family.Did I mention this film is a comedy?Or, rather, it is a drama with comedic elements.  Or maybe it's a comedy with dramatic themes.  Either way, Director Paul Verhoeven must navigate a very fine line between treating the seriousness of the violent act at the beginning of the film with the comedy of Michele's wacky family.And, darn it, if he doesn't succeed.  Director Verhoeven would seem an odd choice to helm this film and then to strike the correct balance, after all, he is the Director of the original TOTAL RECALL and ROBOCOP as well as the train-wreck that was SHOWGIRLS.  But, don't forget, he is also the Director of BASIC INSTINCT and the underrated STARSHIP TROOPERS, so perhaps he is the PERFECT Director for this sort of film.  Verhoeven mines the comedy to the appropriate level that is needed while keeping the camera focused on the serious aspects of this film and the balance of the two work quite well together.Most of this can be traced to the performance of Isabelle Huppert as Michelle.  This veteran actress turns in a career capping performance as a hard working Businesswoman who also must juggle her family, friends and her company whilst figuring out who raped her, why did this happen, and what should she do about it.  Huppert's performance is striking and she is able to balance these items and the drama and the comedy excellently.  Ms. Huppert recently won the Golden Globe for this performance and I predict an Academy Award nomination is coming her way.  I also wouldn't be surprised if she, ultimately, WON the Oscar - it was that good of a performance.  I would also think that this film is a shoo-in for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award nomination and, again, I wouldn't be surprised if it wins.Is this film for everyone?  Well...no.  The subject matter will turn many off and it is in French with English subtitles.  But, if you are intrigued by the balancing act required here along with a strong central performance, then you will be pleasantly surprised by ELLE.  I know I was.Letter Grade A-/B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Elle

50,gregsrants,Perfectly Cast Complex Character Study,7,11 September 2016,"From the late 1980's into the 1990's, Paul Veerhoven was one of the biggest names working behind the camera in Hollywood. Starting with 1987's Robocop and continuing through Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers, Veerhoven mastered the sex and violence ties that brought audiences out to his films in droves.But 1995's Showgirls ended his run of good fortune. Considered by most to be one of the worst films of the 90's (it's not), Showgirls all but put Veerhoven in Guantanamo Hollywood prison. And since 2000, Veerhoven has directed but three films – Hollow Man, Black Book and Tricked.With any fortune, Veerhoven will no longer take such a long sabbatical after his latest effort, Elle which was nominated for the Palme D'Or at Cannes and had its North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this past Friday.Elle stars Isabelle Huppert as Michele, a corporate CEO of a small video-game design company who deals with the emotional effects of a rape that occurs before the screen even fades in with the open scene. When audiences do get more than the horrifying audio of the assault, we view Michele as she fights with a masked intruder on the floor of her home. Beaten and raped, Michele cleans up and continues with her life. A prior bad history with the police leaves her not wanting to report the crime and stoically she marches on with the rape but a blip on life's resume.But as time slowly separates her from the initial attack, it is clear that the attacker is not yet finished with is prey. Michele begins to find her house violated again by the unknown assailant and text messages from the rapist only further the intrigue. But Michele is no victim. She fantasizes about another return visit from the attacker with a more favorable result. And through her emotions she remains consistent in behavior which comes to a shock to others when she reveals the details of the attack.Making things more complex for Michelle is her circle of family and friends. A father doing time for being a serial murder, a mother who pays young studs for sex, a son who can't hold either a job or a girlfriend and her co-workers, some of which she is sexually active with, only complicate her delicate situation.Although Elle might seem like a mystery thriller, it is more of a character driven drama than a 'can-you-guess-who's-behind-the-mask'. So much so that Veerhoven reveals the face behind the ski mask early in the second half of the film. The reveal is to both the audience and to Michelle and how she continues to explore events on her own terms is as fascinating as it is head-scratching.Although Veerhoven has routinely had strong women roles in his films, nothing is on par with Huppert's Michelle. The film is carried by her strong and intoxicating performance and Huppert is remarkably able to keep us involved and rooting for a woman who is mean and calculating to all those associated with her path.Events don't exactly zig and zag towards an ending but I doubt audiences will be able to stay ahead of the smart script in determining what might occur next to our protagonist.Elle isn't perfect, but it is perfectly cast and executed. The story will leave most in the cold and it isn't a feel-good film even if everything does eventually work itself into a nicely bowed present before the end title card.",Elle

52,abisio,Basic Instinct on esteroids,9,14 November 2016,"ELLE is the first French project by Dutch director Verhoeven; in my opinion one of the most interesting and critic directors of our time. He is one of the very few that can make heavy but accurate social commentaries on commercial movies.Just take a look at ROBOCOP or STARSHIP TROOPERS or SHOWGIRLS or many others.ELLE is about a woman (or perhaps a few women) whose level of cruelty is well above the charts. She is raped in the first scene but instead of reporting to the police, she buys a hammer and a hatchet check her house security and attends to a social dinner where she casually mentions the Rape. Far from looking for pity; she is basically enticing her partner and husband (both her occasional lovers ) an her former husband (whose car she destroyed few minutes before and enjoys to humiliate).The movie escalates from there to unexpected levels of cruelty, cynicism and disturbing behaviors, that can only be taken as dark satiric commentary of a certain social class French directors love to put to shame. As absorbing (and unexpected ) the movie is not for everybody. This is not Hollywood movie; here even the rapist deserves some pity; and people who seem saintly are selfish, careless and overall hypocrites.In brief; another masterpiece from a genius USA failed to understand",Elle
53,tonypeacock-1,"A Dutch directed, French movie triumph with excellent performances",8,2 August 2019,"After reading a short premise and seeing the trailer for the film, I had a little bit of trepidation about what was in store.
Indeed the film begins with a horrific sexual attack on the central character Michèle (Isabelle Huppert). However the following couple of hours has an intense screenplay.What follows is a couple of hours of black comedy elements as Michèle attempts to identify her attacker.
There are many suspects. The film showcases several strange characters and their sidestories.
However the triumph of the film is the performance of Huppert as Michèle. A powerful businesswoman who owns a computer game design company.Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) actually made this film in France. A successful modern example of world cinema that won a Golden Globe and Huppert won an Oscar nomination.Verhoeven does have form for films that explore seedy adult elements (Basic Instinct).",Elle
54,Andres-Camara,Long and wide,5,22 January 2017,"1394/5000 I see this movie and I do not quite understand what I see. Every person has their likes, their fetishes, I will not judge anyone, but I imagine they will all be consistent with each other. I do not think in this movie. I do not understand why a person, who of course hates his father for what he did, to dispose of the lives of others without his permission, however, does not flinch at someone who has his own and violates it. I will have to explain in spoiler zone.To my taste, the character of Isabelle Huppert is contradictory. I can understand that other characters draw them cynical, more today. But the one of the protagonist is totally contradictory. While it is true that she is great, like the whole cast.The movie makes me long. I think there's a lot of footage left. It extends between too many topics, which for me are not the story. They only make us distance ourselves from the original idea. And then he solves them, some, with a stroke.He has a very nice picture. It helps a lot to get into the movie. The atmosphere is great. Get it to look like a good movie if it was not for all, for me, script errors.The address is simple. Telling that for my taste, footage remains. The plans are neither studied nor beautiful. They simply observe the story.Everything else gets you into a story. The problem for me is that it is dissipating.Spoiler:I do not understand as a character who is desiring the death of his father for killing people, bone that does not trust the return to society, if not that he wants to die, then rape, I understand that he may like the sado, but still It is a violation, it is not something agreed upon, but it does not search that page. Rather the other way round, you know perfectly well that it will ultimately be her who searches for him. The end, it's like, I'll close topics fast. The son is reunited with the bride and she suddenly accepts it without problems. The friend finds out for her that she horns her husband with her and yet, nothing happens, what's more, I'm going to live with you, you've only deceived me with my husband.I know there are people for all tastes and I repeat I do not judge them, but it is inconsistent",Elle
55,SquigglyCrunch,LOST: Plot,5,3 March 2017,"Elle follows an older woman with some mental issues who, after being raped, goes on living life. And that's it. While most every plot synopsis will try to tell you that she goes looking for her rapist, she doesn't. She keeps living life as if nothing happens. She buys means of defending herself, then moves on. The rape is barely mentioned in the movie actually. Towards the end more stuff starts happening, but even then it's rather confusing and mostly just lacking any sort of intrigue. It's still just a woman living her life, doing her job, interacting with her family and friends. Nothing happens, and it's really unfortunate because Isabelle Huppert is actually pretty good. The movie spends an entire hour after the rape at the beginning leading up to an incredibly predictable plot twist that, because movie, was obviously the case. There's really no actual realism here. Anything interesting that happens happens in a fantasy-movie world where everything is predictable. Overall Elle is just a nothing kind of movie. It's not terribly boring (it is still boring though), but it's not interesting either. Huppert is good, yet I dreaded seeing her on-screen because that meant that the movie wasn't over yet. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this waste of both time and talent.",Elle
56,rubenm,Provocative psychological thriller,6,12 June 2016,"Director Paul Verhoeven is famous for his provocative films, often combining sex, violence and psychological power play. Actress Isabelle Huppert is famous for her demanding roles, often playing powerful women with an obsession for sex and/or violence.Put the two together and you can guess what you get. Elle's lead character, Michèle, is a woman who owns a video game company, specializing in games filled with extreme sex and violence. She casually shares her bed with her best friend's husband. She masturbates watching the neighbour unloading the trunk of his car. Her father is a convicted serial killer. Oh, and she doesn't seem to mind getting raped.At least, that's the impression after the very first scene. After having been attacked and violently raped, she doesn't call the police of even a friend, but a fast food restaurant, ordering something to eat.The film explores not only Michèle's relationship with her rapist, whose identity is established after about two thirds of the film, but also the men and women in her immediate circle. They all have their problems and peculiarities, and Michèle seems to pull all their strings as a hard, cold woman, superbly mastering her feelings and emotions.For the viewer, it takes some effort to understand all the different relationships, and even more to grasp Michèle's behaviour. The only explanation Verhoeven offers, is her troubled youth as the daughter of a serial killer. In my opinion, the film suffers from an overload of characters with psychological difficulties. There's a mother hiring a gigolo because she can't accept getting older, there's a son clinging to a dominating girlfriend, a neighbour with a wife obsessed with religion, an employee playing a dirty trick on Michèle, and so on. Personally, I found it a bit too much.The one thing that stands out in this film, is Isabelle Huppert's acting. Any other actress could easily have made Michèle's character unbelievable. But Huppert's utter detachment from any form of sensitivity makes the part completely convincing.",Elle
57,SkullScreamerReturns,Profound thriller-drama...Verhoeven still got it,7,18 August 2021,"Paul Verhoeven got famous with Robocop and other action-packed sci-fi films. A while ago I watched a couple of his early films which were completely different in style; dramas with a lot to do with sexuality. Now I got to see one of his newer ones. In some way ""Elle"" goes back towards his roots of love/sex themed drama, but it also more mature compared to his wild youthful early films.From what I had read I expected a ""revenge flick"" but that wasn't entirely the case. There is some of that thematic but more than that it's a drama with complicated relations between the characters. To be honest, I didn't entirely understand all of their motivations but I still liked the way it made me ask questions and think about psychology.Isabelle Huppert is the lead actress and she literally leads the show. She acts very good, and the character she plays is interesting and surprising, and you never really know what she's up to. There is a theme of not agreeing to be seen a victim, and that is pretty much what the main character is about. She can be seen as an empowerment figure, though I also had a feeling that the character had some minor screw loose too. Anyway, however you interpret things the movie probably makes you think things in some new ways too. That's always a good thing that makes movies stand out.Ps. The hatchet in still images did not have that much use. So if you are looking for a violent action film, then it's probably not going to be this one.",Elle
58,CineMuseFilms,a gripping thriller about a woman who is a perpetrator and victim of sexual violence,8,13 November 2016,"The women's film label covers the spectrum of feminine empowerment to absolute degradation and several can be read both ways. Elle (2016) is one of the ambivalent ones that can be read as a tale of strong self-assertion or, equally valid, as a tale of a compliant victim of transgressive sexuality and gender disrespect. The story is framed against the violent porn video game industry where women are routinely sacrificed to male gratification and dominance. In the context of video games, sexual assault and other forms of humiliation are normalised and this reality merges with the Elle narrative on fantasy and victimhood.Michelle (Isabelle Huppert) is a successful Parisian video game entrepreneur who leads a company of testosterone-fuelled hipsters whose job it is to hyper-stimulate young males into doing things to women in video cyber-worlds. The film's opening scenes are both disturbing and banal: Michelle appears to be violently raped by a masked intruder and then proceeds to tidy up the mess with barely more than an air of inconvenience. No, it is not a video game, and yes, it happens again as do several other normalised sexual transgressions. For example, when she discovers the staffer who pasted her face onto a video game assault victim she asks the person to expose his genitals in her office. Rather than an opportunity for reverse humiliation or worse, she only says ""pretty"" and walks off leaving us wondering if she is seriously cool or seriously damaged.Divergent plot lines fill out the character of Michelle to explain the reasons for her impassivity. Her father is in prison for crimes against children and her mother pays for sex with younger men. She sleeps with her business partner's husband and lusts for her neighbour, all while lying with the comfort of someone who lives in the twilight world between video game brutality and real-world immorality. While appearing indestructible in her business life her emotional world is a fragile void that cannot be filled with normal relationships. The several scenes that dwell suggestively on her face oozing repressed sexual desire hint darkly of a deeply troubled soul.This is a compelling film that examines the parallel universe of a woman who is both a perpetrator and a victim of sexual transgression and who lives under the guise of wealth and respectability. As such, it is also a portrait of hypocrisy and moral extremities with audience voyeurism forming the picture frame. Isabelle Huppert pushes this role to its limits while showing little emotion beyond what she can say with her expressive eyes. It is hard to judge a survivor like her, and we can only guess what keeps her head together. This film is one of many that push back the cultural envelope that has kept women's sexuality on a pedestal.",Elle
59,rdoyle29,Not the rape/revenge comedy many paint it as,9,7 August 2017,"I think most descriptions of this film do it a grave injustice by focusing on the rape and mystery elements, as if this is some kind of a thriller. While both of these elements exist in the story, it cuts a much wider swath than that, ending up as both a character study and a sort of pitch black social satire. Not a single character in this story isn't essentially despicable, and it's a testament to Verhoeven's deft touch that he doesn't alienate the viewer. It's a consistently surprising film anchored by a truly outstanding performance by Huppert.",Elle
60,gsygsy,Tin,6,29 November 2016,"Isabelle Huppert is the reason to see this uneven thriller. She plays a role which demands an actress with an enormous range, which of course she has. What's more, she makes it look effortless. She conceals any artifice, no cogs are seen to turn as she moves from watchful amusement to the throes of sexual abandon. She embodies her complicated character one hundred per cent.Whether the movie as a whole is worthy of her is another matter. Director Paul Verhoeven is a divisive figure, lauded by some and dismissed by others. It may be that ELLE is less obviously exploitative than his previous movies, but maybe it just seems that way because his leading lady is so magnificent. If it wasn't for Ms Huppert, I don't think I'd be very interested in Michèle Leblanc, whose curious past is gradually revealed during what seemed to me an over-generous run time. It probably isn't helpful to make the comparison, but this film's subject in the hands of Michael Haneke would really have packed a punch. As it is, we can be grateful for the presence of this great French actress giving a solid-gold performance in a rather tinny movie.",Elle
61,avik-basu1889,A very complex and unique tale of feminism !!!,8,7 January 2017,"When it comes to 'Elle', the film that you picture in your head after reading the synopsis is so different from the actual film that you see. It is directed by Paul Verhoeven. The only Verhoeven films that I was familiar with before watching this were unique in their own way. They were really over-the-top, at times comically so, but they all had sly satirical layers to them. 'Elle' has some of the trashy elements in the storyline that can be found in those earlier films too, but here what's new is that the direction is very restrained. The restrained and low-key style of Verhoeven's storytelling in 'Elle' elevates what could be perceived to be a somewhat trashy gets elevated to levels of prestige cinema.'Elle' opens itself up to many interpretations, but I somehow don't think it is a film that is making a commentary on rape culture or any misogyny fueled social problems in general. I think it is a film that it completely and only about this character of Michele. The film goes out of its way to not make her angelic at all, as a matter of fact, she is at times sort of unlikable. I think the whole film hinges on the question of 'power', ego and manipulation. Michele was helplessly exploited by her father in his criminal activities when she was young and she had to endure such treatment helplessly. This must have shaped her mindset and psyche as everything that we see her do in the film is an attempt to exercise power over everyone else and not be on the weaker side of the power dynamics in any relationship. So she constantly manipulates things to gain leverage over everyone whenever she thinks the other person has the upper hand to her. Another example of this is that when she finds out Patrick is the rapist, her idea of getting revenge is not by calling the police, but by gaining the upper hand in the sexual encounter and forcing the rape instead of being the victim. Only after that does she decide to change and be a little nice to others. This is a feminist film not because the rapist gets killed, but because it's the victim who catches him instead of the police and gets to exact revenge in her own way.Verhoeven as I have mentioned earlier is very restrained in his direction. He doesn't go out of his way to compose frames that attract attention to themselves. What Verhoeven's camera excels at doing is capture Michele almost like a lover. We get to see every little expression and every little change in her facial gestures. Verhoeven completely devotes his time to observing Michele which helps the film. This brings me to Isabelle Huppert. Without Huppert, 'Elle' probably won't work at all. She gives dynamism, unpredictability and an oomph to the character. She expresses a whole lot through her eyes. This is one of the most complex, understated, yet extremely powerful performances I have seen in the recent past.However I think there are a few flaws in the film too. Although the storyline is a bit intentionally sensationalised, I did find the portions of the film devoted to Michele's son Vincent and 'his' child a little too goofy. I also didn't like the angle of Anne accepting and forgiving Michele at the end of the film as I think this undermines Anne's self respect. On a broader level, an argument can also be made that using a very sensitive issue like rape that has directly affected such a huge section of the global female population as a means to explore the ego drive and manipulative ways of a rich upper class French woman instead of addressing the issue on a social level is in itself problematic, but that is a completely separate discussion.'Elle' is an incredibly intriguing film with good direction and a brilliant central performance by Isabelle Huppert. It is not for everyone due to its provocative content, but one thing is for sure, it will continue to linger in the viewer's thought and every individual will get something different out of it.",Elle

63,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"A miserable, meandering, misanthropic mess",4,19 March 2020,"Terrible film. I absolutely do not understand the acclaim. I'm generally one for a good transgressive theme, but that alone does not make a movie worthwhile. Isabelle Huppert puts in a committed performance, and the rest of the cast is competent, but that can't save the meandering story, miserable pacing, or the inconsistent tone of the writing.The movie drags on for way, way, way too long at 130 minutes, especially considering no real tension is ever built, nor do any of the characters really blossom much. Really, you just grow to dislike the characters more and more as you become less and less interested in the story itself, probably due to the fact that nothing of any interest happens throughout the majority of the entire film, other than watching characters slowly accept the far-end of damaging and malicious personality traits as normalcy.On top of everything else, the movie is visually very bland and ugly to look at. It really could have used a TON of cutting. I'm a huge Paul Verhoeven fan but this is the first film I've seen that's part of the post-Hollywood, 3rd wave of his directing career, and I was gravely disappointed. Most legends can't keep things up forever ::shrugs:: go watch Turkish Delight or The 4th Man instead!",Elle
64,markgorman,Rather tawdry with a dubious message.,6,23 March 2017,"Paul Verhoeven has a track record that would not immediately make you think he could make a movie that would empower a strong central female character, particularly one where sexual politics (and sexual violence) are key to the narrative.He's the man behind Showgirls and Basic Instinct and, errr, Diary of a Hooker after all - essentially exploitation movies to a greater or lesser degree.And it's highly debatable whether Elle succeeds in its goal, if indeed that is it. Because, despite the incredible central performance by Isabelle Huppert (rightfully Oscar nominated) it takes her from rape victim to rape fantasist over the course of its two hours.Or did I misread it?The opening brutal rape scene knocks you back on your feet and Huppert, as Elle, a successful career woman, recovers from the ordeal remarkably sanguinely and continues her active lifestyle whilst setting out on a revenge mission of sorts.But that mission is deeply twisted and her horrendous experience seems a little ironic perhaps when we discover she is the owner of a games design company that produces games with dubious sexual morality.What's more her father has a deeply unpleasant past, also wrapped in violence in which she was implicated as a child. This only serves to complicate the morality message of the film as a whole.I found it gratuitous overall. I didn't think Huppert (despite an excellent performance) advanced female rights and I think the whole thing turned out to be verging on tawdry and certainly too ambiguous to make its point effectively.",Elle
65,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,1 February 2017,"Michèle (Isabelle Huppert) seems indestructible. Head of a successful video game company, she brings the same ruthless attitude to her love life as to business. Being attacked in her home by an unknown assailant changes Michèle's life forever. When she resolutely tracks the man down, they are both drawn into a curious and thrilling game-a game that may, at any moment, spiral out of control.One thing that is clear to me when reviewing this film is the hardship of doing so: ""Elle"" is uniquely singular film that touches upon its subject matter in an incredibly detached way which is why we are shown events and characters go down from a perspective is totally fresh and new even though it can carry through a little too much.What it comes down to is that how the film treats its characters is exactly reflecting of how Michèle treats them. There is a perfect correspondence of style to story and it makes for a fascinating watch. You are carried through into this characters world and you start to root for her in a very convincing way to the point that you find her to be the the moral measure of the film even though the actions in practice would be questionable from another point of view.This is what great art does in my opinion, it takes the lens of reality and turns it around to make the audience experience something in a new way, that's what this film does in spades. It is not trying to present a world where each character is entitled, there is only one right way and that it because Michèle sees things this way, it is just brilliantly structured storytelling that hits hard on its goals.Then of course at the center of all of this is Huppert's magnetic performance. When watching foreign movies a sign a of great performance is when thinking back I can't remember the language she was speaking, I just remember the character and how alive it felt. She sells every beat of this woman's methods and ideas, there isn't a false moment in what she does and she makes justice to a script that required the commitment she gives it to become convincing.Where I take a little issue is in the clarity of the succession of some of the key events. The film slightly glosses over a couple of key plot point which are maybe intentionally left a little unclear, but in my view, a little too far so. I had some difficulties, especially in the first act, in exactly understanding what went down and because of that I didn't understand Michèle's motivations in the early stages.Yet, once the narrative flow gets thicker it starts being overwhelming and you experience a solid character thriller with a multifaceted uniqueness that stretches from setting, to characters, to core material.",Elle

67,coreyjdenford,Vengeance is blissfully incredible,10,10 March 2017,"This review of Elle is spoiler free***** (5/5)YOU CAN'T BLAME director Paul Verhoeven for leaving Hollywood the way he did or for as long as he did. After dealing with controversy for quite some time after Showgirls and Basic Instinct, granted that isn't the main reason he left but it is one of them. After taking a decade out he's back as a changed man, and back to basics with his latest Elle, a rape/revenge thriller of a woman who is attacked by an unknown assailant and is caught in a game of cat and mouse to catch the man who did this to her. And it's fair to say he found the right actress to star in the film. French actress Isabelle Huppert has been brilliant before but here she is phenomenal, as strong-willed Michèle a successful business woman who works in the gaming industry until she gets her revenge after being sexually attacked. The film opens with a rape behind a black screen so we can't see it but its clear what's going on, however after this attack she doesn't report it to the police, instead she just sits there planning her revenge. She gets herself prepared for another attack providing herself with easy to carry weapons. It's a little bourgeoisie-esque in areas as she's mean to some people in her live more specifically her mother and her high sex-drive, she takes everything in her stride, sure she's back lashed at her job mostly for her age and her ideas of how to make a good game but she doesn't give up. She asks a young man named Kevin (Arthur Mazet) to work closely with her in trying to find out who made her the centre of attention at work, she asks him to hack into one of his co-worker's servers to track down who did that.It takes it's time to get stuck in, in some aspects but when the tension rises the film gets faster, as she never gives up in catching her assailant. She constantly has flashbacks of that moment which essentially gives her the stronger will power to plan her revenge even further, she never gives up. And this rape/revenge thriller has style, too, here feminism is queen it shows that she is a woman who has strength, she's provocative, persistent and also seductive, as she tries to make her sex life better with a man who's close to her. And Verhoeven gives her powerful past surrounding her previous family life and her serial killer father, who tortured her at a young age, it's rare to find an actress who can deal with this kind of emotional heft and Huppert brilliantly pulls it off. It's absolutely phenomenal and is just what we need. VERDICT: Verhoeven's first film in ten years is provocative, luridly mesmerizing and is endlessly thrilling. With an awards-calibre performance by Huppert, Elle is one of the year's best.",Elle
68,yris2002,Confused and unfocused mess,4,14 May 2017,"I had great expectations from this movie, but, to my great displeasure, I have to say that the guarantee of Isabelle Huppert was not enough to raise it above the level of an incomprehensible and unfocused pseudo thriller. It is not the disturbing, although definitely too reiterated masochism inside the main plot: had it been more exploited, it could have resulted in an interesting analysis of some perverted mechanisms inside the human mind. The problem is the presence of a number of subplots, just hinted at and never developed, that result in a total mess of situations and characters, leading nowhere, either in the good or in the bad. I would have appreciated at least a more coherent finale, which on the contrary seems a hurried and puzzling reconciliation of people and situations that seemed totally controverted and unsolved till one moment before. Isabelle Huppert does always a very good job, but unfortunately heading nowhere, trapped herself inside a difficult, but undeveloped character, with no safe or focused direction. On the whole, a disappointing and overrated picture.",Elle
69,themadmovieman,"Heavy-going, but worth it for an intoxicating experience",9,13 December 2016,"I'm going to say it clearly: this film is brutal. From the very first shot right up to the end, Elle is an intense, dark and often very graphic drama that doesn't let up for a moment. However, it's a display of pure brilliance from all parties, as it features some incredible directing, a gripping story and a spellbinding central performance by Isabelle Huppert.Before we get into all of that, I think it's most important that I underline how heavy this film can be at times. Without a doubt, it's not for the faint-hearted, and at over 2 hours long, it drags you through the mud as you watch this woman fall deeper and deeper into a horrifying mystery. It's slow-moving, quiet, and hugely reliant on some very emotionally intense dialogue sequences, and is the sort of film that rewards intense concentration from start to finish.However, Elle is that very rare type of film that, whilst at times harrowing to watch, is an incredibly engrossing and memorable experience. From its heavy-going atmosphere to the emotionally raw subject matter, this film's intensity won't disappoint at the end of its 130 minute runtime.Of everything about the film, however, the one element that makes it so captivating and emotionally enthralling throughout is the lead performance by Isabelle Huppert. Because of her, this film is so much more than just a woman who was victim of an assault trying to find out who did it, as she gives such a mesmerising performance that her character, Michèle, is utterly hypnotic.On the one hand, her performance does the basic work of getting you as the viewer to support her in her search, even though she may not come across as the most likable person. On the other hand, that's almost secondary to the character study that the film becomes, and it's actually her ability to give an often terrifyingly intense performance as a steely and battle-hardened woman that makes for the most intrigue.Throughout, we learn more and more about the character's background, and Huppert incorporates each new tidbit into her performance as the film moves along. However, that means the character evolves hugely throughout the film, and the way she changes her acting depending on what light her character is cast in, whether it be the victim or a morally dubious woman with a devilish smile, is absolutely stunning to see.Of course, whilst Huppert's performance is exceptional, director Paul Verhoeven also plays a huge role in giving the film its brutal intensity. Sometimes taking on a Hitchcockean-style vibe that's often very reminiscent of the classic French thriller Diabolique, Verhoeven sets the scene for mystery and unpredictability well, enticing you into the film's story very quickly, and then keeping you there with an unbelievably eerie and unnerving atmosphere right up to the finish.What's more is that Verhoeven gives the film's emotional power an exceptionally raw feeling. At times, it feels like you're watching a live play where the characters are able to throw the door wide open and directly speak their minds. The extent to which the film takes that, particularly with Huppert's often brutal character, is incredible, and it's that that makes the effects of the assault, i.e. this woman's world being turned around, so much more terrifying and hard-hitting than the initial crime itself.And on that note, I have to mention the costume designers here, who manage to mirror that emotional rawness through all of the character's clothes. It may seem like a strange thing to say, but as we see Huppert's character almost always dressed in very formal dresses, ranging from intimidating blacks to fiery reds, as well as others who become visibly weaker or stronger in comparison to her depending on what they're wearing, it's very clear what the film wants to get across, which I thought was brilliant to see.Finally, we come to the screenplay. As I've said, the story isn't solely about the woman's search to find who assaulted her, but rather the psychological and social consequences of the crime. That's absolutely fascinating to witness, and it couldn't be achieved without the brilliant writing here, which provides you with very realistic and stripped-down dialogue sequences to heighten the tension between all the characters, but also working in tandem with the often more theatrical and dramatic performances and directing, which comes together to make it impossible to look away from the screen at any moment, such is the intensity of every scene.Overall, I was blown away by Elle. Apart from its harrowing subject matter that doesn't let up for a second, and doesn't even give you a chance to prepare early on, it's a hugely captivating film that features brilliant writing and directing, as well as a hypnotic performance by Isabelle Huppert that gives the film incredible dramatic intensity and makes for a simply enthralling watch.",Elle
70,patriciogl10,Interesting endeavour from the great Paul Verhoeven.,7,7 October 2019,"This film is rather controversial, it deals with heavy subject matter that Paul Verhoeven treats provocatively, as only he knows how to. Isabelle Huppert puts on a strong performance; as she completely understood her character, and while it's not a very expressive performance there are specific details, nuances and reactions to certain events that underscore her brilliant portrayal. Let's keep in mind that we are dealing with a woman who doesn't react as emphatically as one would expect, which accentuates a certain strange behaviour, and as the story unfolds, we get to understand her character's tragic life events, and we come to realize why she is broken.As the plot indicates, she becomes entangled in a game of cat and mouse as she is trying to discover the identity of the man who sexually assaulted her. She is a successful woman, who is a head of a video game company. One of the aspects that keeps the plot interesting is that after the attack, she keeps on being harrassed by her abuser in different ways, to the point that she starts to look at several men she knows as potential suspects. Another interesting or rather unconventional particular is the fact that despite her unsettled childhood she became an incredibly sucessful professional but it caused her to respond quite abnormally to such a taxing situation. This completely puts her character in place, and her relationship with those around her.Verhoeven's direction is great, although I wouldn't refer to Elle as one of his best films; this probably falls a bit short in comparison, but it is still a fine effort. I have to mention that the assault scenes are not as crude as others I've seen before. And the tone of the film, chromatically speaking, is on point, very well accomplished in my opinion; that somehow fits perfectly with Michèle's unbalanced facets of her life.",Elle

There is hardly anything borderline, however, about them: straight-jacket material, yes, all around. The film shows how unstable people get together, how they multiply existential & sexistential problems for themselves as well as for anybody else they encounter. Are we supposed to care for them? Well, yes, for the current French way of life seems to support a sloppy mental health system which lets psychos roam free & wild, endangering themselves as well as everyone they interact with. ""Pretentious,"" ""morbid,"" ""tremendista,"" are probably accurate reviewer's labels for the picture.

72,dakjets,Fascinating and demanding,9,16 August 2017,"Fascinating and demanding, on many levels. This movie gave me a great movie experience when I saw it. But it is demanding to look at. There is also a movie that I remember afterwards and it somehow ""gets stuck"". The story is about a wealthy and powerful woman who is exposed to a brutal assault. We follow her in the aftermath and get acquainted with a demanding character, imaginatively portrayed by beautiful Isabelle Huppert. Her character is hard to love, as her behavioral pattern is abnormal and unpredictable. Who is she really? What does she want? The story in the film also shows her life and how she appears inside her network and family. This gives the film an extra dimension, while pulling into her quest for who attacked her. This is be both fascinating and exciting. And thrilling. But the film is brutal, but there are not violence for the sake of violence. Rather a tool in film. The film also gives an insight into dark lusts in people minds. Things are not always what they look seem like. This is so much better than American films with a similar storyline.

73,stuka24,Disturbingly pleasurable.,10,21 April 2017,"Most films with Isabelle Huppert follow a pattern of disturbing, cold characters that we nevertheless end up siding for if not actually ""liking"". For what is there to like in Michèle? She despises both son and mum. Also his star employee Kurt, her only friend A.*, her pitiful ex husband. Of course, her beautiful daughter-in-law Josie and her young ex husband's couple, Hélène. For different reasons, there is nobody she respects. She is alone for a reason, but goes through the motions of classy Parisian life as if nothing really reached her. She only laughs once in the film, definitely at a wrong moment.She knows how to manipulate people, thou. Her relationship with his psychopath father and his carnage is unclear to me, as well as her participation in it. ""She hates him"" but they burned the house down together after it until the police came.It's a film about sex and some sort of perversion (can't say more), but amidst the violence, Michèle seems to be getting the upper hand. In any case, she's so detached from others that one never really knows what pleases her, what does she want, where is her desire, actually. All the other characters are secondary, maybe Anna rises above the rest. The ambient of game creation as big business is well depicted, and her luxuriously French house is the main setting of this film shot mostly in interiors. Paul Verhoeven is a master at crafting gripping stories.It may not get into the history of cinema, but it's a pleasure to watch and leaves you thinking about the loose ends. Love the classical score, lots of Mozart. Like expensive wine, one shouldn't ask for too much to be satisfied.*by having an affair with his man, and the way M says so.",Elle
74,adrian-43767,"Spellbinding, steely performance by Hupert; great direction",9,25 September 2018,"This is not an easy film to watch. I believe in the death penalty for some crimes, including rape, so it was not this subject matter that kept me watching ELLE. Rather, it was the direction by Verhoeven, clearly one of his career peaks; the extremely well done action sequences; great photography; and convincing dialogue.Best of all, Isabelle Hupert, in one of the greatest female performances I have ever watched. She is unfeeling, has no qualms about sleeping with her best friend's husband, and telling her about it; or wreaking revenge on her rapist by descending to his depths, deeper even.The contempt she shows her son makes her character authentic, if not likeable. Do not expect to come away from this movie with strengthened moral values, only the dumb (like her son) are good people in this movie, and Hupert acts like a spider, drawing her targets into a web and injecting her poison.Yes, there are credibility holes in the story, but it is the amosphere, especially Hupert's mental atmosphere, that matter in ELLE.",Elle
75,ReganRebecca,"Deranged, strange, intense",7,2 February 2017,"I first heard of Elle after it premiered at the Cannes film festival. Several critics referred to at as a rape comedy, which raised my eyebrows, but the reviews were almost unanimously positive. And given Huppert's awards sweep I felt compelled to give this a shot and I'm glad I did. First up, the movie is definitely not a rape comedy. There is rape and there are moments that made me laugh out loud, but the rape is never treated as a joke and the comedy is more acerbic then slapstick. The ""elle"" (French for she or her) of the title is Michèle Leblanc, a wealthy divorcé who runs a video game company with her best friend and has an idiot for a son. The movie kicks off with her being violently raped by a stranger, but her reaction to this is atypical not only for movies, but for real life as well; she doesn't call the police or tell friends and instead tries to handle it herself by investing in some weaponry. The reasons for this are because of something in Michèle's past which we learn of later and adds a mildly interesting element to the proceedings. Unfortunately for Michèle, despite the fact that she is all too willing to let go of the rape, her rapist has different ideas, and begins toying with her, sending her vicious texts and leaving unpleasant surprises for her in her home. There have been those who have criticized the movie for using rape as a plot device and I have to say, even though the movie is well made and well written there are times when the fact that both the screenplay and the novel were written by men really comes through. The movie also devolves quite a bit in the second half, never reaching the tension and mastery that the first half of the movie achieves. That said, there are still plenty of reasons to see the movie for those not faint of heart. Verhoeven builds the piece like a Hitchcock thriller and there are so many moments of beauty and of humour. And what to say about Huppert? She handles the role with ease. If you're a Huppert fan this is a must, she is the film and it's satisfying to see her get the accolades she so richly deserves.",Elle
76,JPfanatic93,You may change the language but you won't change Paul Verhoeven,5,4 June 2016,"It's an odd thing, but the press seems to almost unilaterally adore this latest film by Paul Verhoeven, with myself being an exclusion to that fact. Even though I love most of Paul Verhoeven's work - even going so far as to publicly consider the much maligned Showgirls a very fun film - I had a hard time appreciating this film. Even though I admit there's a number of things to appreciate about it.First thing, it's a superb piece of acting by the lead, the fabulous French actress Isabelle Huppert. She delivers a grand performance as the protagonist, Michele, a powerful director of a video game company who one day unexpectedly finds herself the victim of a brutal rape by an unknown assailant. She effortlessly navigates the part of rape victim and dominant, matriarchal presence at her job and as head of her family of miscreants. Better yet, the dormant demons of her shady past awake to stir things up even more, which soon makes for an intense psychological game between herself and those around her. Nobody is a match for her, both in terms of character and in terms of acting. Sadly, the rest of the cast is nowhere near as exciting to watch and mostly consists of sleazy personas out to make her life more miserable. It's a shame less effort was put into making Michele's surroundings a bit more interesting, but with such a powerful performance as her own, it's hard to keep up.Second, Verhoeven basically does what he has always done: not give a damn about cinematic conventions and do as he like without taking what many people would consider 'good taste' into account. His continuation of exploring the underbelly of man proves devoid of adhering to the usual norms of narrative progression. Whoever thinks the rape dictates the rest of Michele's actions is wrong, as she doesn't end up a victim of the act, but rather her environment becomes a victim of herself. There's no tear jerking drama here wherein the violated female must come to terms with the traumatic event, nor is there your typical Hollywood style thriller plot which sees the aggressor hunted down by a revenge driven survivor. Yes, Michele does take matters into her own hands and aims to find her rapist, but this detective story thread suddenly comes to a dead stop as the identity of the culprit is revealed earlier than expected, to unforeseen and rather incredulous results. Wherever you think the story is going, Verhoeven doesn't care about your expectations.Such stubbornness I generally approve of, since there's enough predictable studio drivel going around already. Nevertheless, despite Verhoeven clearly putting his own stamp on Elle which makes it a rather unique final result, I still found it far from a satisfying movie. It's simply too rebellious for the sake of being rebellious. It's a strange and uncomfortable mix of a thriller, family drama and dark comedy, filled with wholly unsympathetic characters. It echoes Verhoeven's scandalous Dutch film Spetters, which saw the auteur heavily criticized and proved one of the prime reasons for him to switch from Holland to Hollywood (and a good choice that was!). However, that film was torn to shreds by critics, while 35 years later Elle is unanimously embraced. The times apparently have changed, but Verhoeven has not changed with them and continues to be an eternal provocateur. In the current political milieu, such an attitude is apparently rewarded. Just not by me. I appreciate Verhoevens refusal to change his style and stick to his (lack of) principles, but I much lament his cynicism. And though it seems the press doesn't share that perspective, I have a feeling many a regular audience member will agree with me upon seeing the strange shock that is Elle.",Elle
77,LiveLoveLead,Surprised by the high reviews.,2,8 July 2017,"One reviewer says this isn't for those easily offended... what's not to be offended by? ...Seriously, besides the fact that they turn rape into some s*xual joke, ALL the characters are so completely unlikeable. They all seem selfish, stupid and loathsome. At first, you do experience a bit of suspense and you want to see how the movie will play out and who the rapist is, but the characters are so annoying and all their actions and responses seem so unrealistic. It felt as if this movie was just an excuses to glorify rape, to try and make rape seem more like some sexy S&M act that can awaken some deep sexual desire in women. It's shameful. I'm sure every high rating of this movie was done by a man. These characters were toxic and this movie has a toxic message.

Gee, Paul if masked man raped you twice, you think you'd raring and ready to go, just as you've portrayed the main character. This is what men want to believe, that ""everything just shuts down,"" that rape isn't totally dehumanizing, torturous and barbaric, and that perhaps this is their misguided and creative way to come to terms with their own transgressions (be it outright rape, groping, objectifying, using, abusing etc.). If you want to see a real movie about rape check out ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" The revenge scene will give a bit more of an understanding of what women go through when raped, you sick piece of rotten plankton.

79,alexdeleonfilm,Huppert and Verhoeven at Peak of Perversity in ELLE --,10,29 May 2016,"ELLE was viewed at the recent 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It's been a while since we have seen the work of Dutchman Paul Verhoeven, now 77, the author of Basic Instinct and Total Recall. His last film, Black Book (Zwarte Boek 2006) was a return home to The Netherlands after a 20 year hiatus in Hollywood. Zwarte Boek, a WWII Jewish resistance thriller starring Carice van Houten was recognized in Holland not only as a glorious homecoming for Verhoeven but was also voted The Best Dutch Film of ALL Time in a poll of the Dutch public taken in 2008.The psychological thriller ELLE is Verhoeven's first film in French and stars the best French actress in captivity by a country mile, Isabelle Huppert, now a hard-to-believe age 63. In this one she plays a still very sexually desirable middle aged redhead, Michèle Leblanc, the hard-as-nails boss of a Major Video Games enterprise, a fiercely independent single women who plays the field and gets violently raped in the very first scene of the film by a fully masked intruder in black body rubber who breaks into her well appointed apartment and leaves her battered, panting, and nearly senseless on the floor, after getting his rocks off (and hers as well!) ... This event is witnessed only by Michele's unperturbed pet cat, an important side player in this study of extreme perversion á deux. The theme of sexual assault by an unknown assailant is also at the center of another Cannes competition film, the Iranian entry ""Forushande"" (The Salesman) but Verhoeven's treatment is infinitely more profound and far more gripping. No comparison -- different league altogether cinematically speaking. As for Isabelle Huppert this woman is in a class by herself as an actress -- something like Bette Davis way back in the Good Old golden Hollywood Days. Too bad Davis isn't around today to see Isabelle Huppert carrying on with the same kind of fearless screen magic ~ Both actresses willing to accept distasteful roles no other actress would dare to for fear of ""damaging their image"" -- and turning such roles into singular transcendent instances of screen interpretation. One thinks of Davis in ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane"" or Huppert in half a dozen other roles in which she somehow turned female psychotics into appealing figures; A woman who slowly poisons her husband in Chabrol's ""Merci pour le chocolat"", ""La Cérémonie"" in which Huppert, a very whacky post office employee incites a shy illiterate maid to murder the entire family she works for ... or ""Ma Mère"" in which Huppert plays a polymorphous bi-sexual nymphomaniac who eventually seduces her own timorous son in a closing incestual death embrace -- All roles no other actress would touch with a ten foot pole or be able to interpret with such verve that audiences are awed and fascinated -- and ultimately entertained. Working with basically instinctual director Verhoeven Huppert has practically outdone herself if such is possible. The character that she brings to life in this film adaptation of a currently best selling novel (""Oh"" by Philippe Djian) is an upper class business woman who, for whatever reasons of her own, gets her sexual jollies by being violently battered and raped -- in this case by the masked sadist who lives next door, a seemingly mild mannered gentleman in everyday life, married to a sincere deeply religious young woman. At the same time she needs to get revenge on the rapist for feeding her deep seated pathological masochism and paradoxically befriends his blithely unsuspecting wife. Verhoeven really goes to town with this material creating a monstrously entertaining picture of the darkest facets of upper class perversity lurking just under the surface of polished bourgeois propriety. This treatment of an extremely violent S&M relationship that is seemingly consensual -- or is it -- between sophisticated adults which will eventually lead to manslaughter, is presented with no excursions into psychoanalytic apologetics -- take it or leave it -- as Michele takes her punishment and ultimately her revenge.Huppert has worked with other cunningly perverse directors before like Chabrol and Breillat, but teaming up with Paul Verhoeven who is clearly the master of molding titillation, shock, intrigue, and entertainment into a single cohesive package, the French superstar actress has scaled a new dazzling peak. The title ELLE may seduce some into thinking this is a film about high fashion (which in a way it is!) but those with soft stomachs beware -- this is a series of shock waves that could shiver the timbers of even the most blasé intellectuals or aloofly critical critics. Please bear in mind that ELLE is a four letter word!",Elle
80,samuelding85,"Female Dominance at its Best, But Pales Compared to Its Predecessor",6,18 November 2016,"Dutch director Paul Verhoeven is back with his latest full length feature film, Elle, after taking a ten's years break in full length film since Blackbook (Zwartboek, 2006). Once again, he uses feminism as the lead of the story, which showcases a different side of female dominance. Based on the novel Oh! written by Philippe Djian and features acclaimed actress Isabelle Huppert as Michele LeBlanc, the leading protagonist, the combination is definitely worth looking forward to. When Michele, the CEO of a computer game development company, was sexually violated by a mysterious intruder who breaks into her home, she began a hunt on the identity of the intruder. Starting from her worker where she recently had a conflict with, she began every single step in self-protection. At the same time, she experiences family and relationship issues, a crush on her neighbor and sexual deprivation after remaining single for years. What she may not realize is that the intruder might be someone she is closed with, and it can be the person whom she trusts. Generally, Elle can be divided into three components: the actions taken to prevent herself from further violation; repairing her estranged relationships with her family members and fulfilling her sexual deprivation from the people around her. In the three components, female dominance takes the leading role to control the situations that falls within the three components. For instance: changing the locks at home, getting an axe and pepper spray, learning how to fire a gun through the assistance of her co-worker displays a sense of security and protection needed for herself. Having a say in how her family members ought to behave, according to her standards, is another showcase on how female dominance applies on her personal relationships with her family members. This can be seen as how she wants her son to meet her criteria before she sponsors a new home for her son and pregnant girlfriend; telling her mother the types of boyfriend she should look for herself while paying for her living expenses. In terms of fulfilling her sexual needs, female dominance will only come in at the later part. Here, we can see how she gave in to her co-worker's request for sexual acts in the workplace, secretly admiring at her neighbor while pleasuring herself till how she fail to resist and constantly fantasize of being rape by the intruder. While the plot focuses on how Huppert's Michele hunts down the intruder and engage in a cat and mouse game with the suspect, the development of the story has somehow distorted and went wayward from the initial plot. At an duration of 130 minutes, the story focuses mainly on how Michele's dominance and sometimes perverted personality came about. While this has provided us with a good understanding on Michele's background which leads to her personality, audience may find it rather redundant, and sometimes, bored, in terms of how this leads to the development of the whole story. Her personality was seen to only be useful at the last 40 minutes of the film, which opens a surprise to everyone. Isabelle Huppert has delivered an excellent performance in Elle, where she was seen as the next female role which uses female dominance as the center stage after Sharon Stone in Verhoeven's classic, Basic Instinct (1992). Audience can find some shadow of Stone's Catherine Tramell in Huppert's Michele, such as how she seduces her neighbor for sexual favors. While Tramell dominates and manipulate the people around her through intelligence and sex, Michele uses her personality to dominate the people around her. To sum up, Elle marks the return of Paul Verhoeven to the big screen with a full-length feature thriller surrounding feminism and dominance. While this can be seen as one of the best foreign feature film of 2016, it is not exactly the best film from Verhoeven. Elle can be seen as a successor to Basic Instinct, but it has some way to go in order to achieve the cult-classic status earned by Basic Instinct.",Elle
81,Michael Kenmore,An almost awful & lurid film that exploits the female sex; Verhoeven a poor man's Brian De Palma,2,5 February 2017,"As the header title notes, the director Paul Verhoeven is indeed a pale imitation of Brian De Palma.I saw this movie at the art-house where it was the only one film that plays anywhere where I reside at this time of writing, in a second-run circuit. Needless to say, despite my intrigue with the great French actress Isabelle Huppert, this movie is patently ludicrous -- so absurd that it demands the suspension of disbelief with some confusion as to the female psyche, as imagined from the male perspective as the armchair psychologist.I am not a feminist or a ""white knight."" Far from it. However, besides the risible and infuriatingly frustrating absurdity of the plot twists, this movie is unbelievably lurid with exploitation, that is demeaning toward the female sex.Even for the aforementioned actress, who has to be the bravest actress in this world, who is willing to take on any edgy film project that pushes the envelope, so to speak. Anecdotally, I saw The Piano Teacher at the same art-house venue, starring the same lead actress, exactly 15 years ago. Which is an incredible coincidence. Unlike ""Elle,"" The Piano Teacher is far more nuanced with Michael Haneke's clinical directing style, slow-burn pacing, and Ms. Huppert's astonishing portrayal of a tormented and psychosexually twisted character.In my humble opinion, Huppert's role in The Piano Teacher is one of the best performances ever captured by the actress; the other (equally and non-manipulative) astoundingly superlative performances being the fellow French actress Marion Cotillard for ""La Vie En Rose"" and Bjork's one-off-only lead acting in the poignant ""Dancer in the Dark."" But ""Elle"" pushes the envelope not only too far, but also shreds the envelope to the extreme edge, outside of viscerally obscene hard-core pornography.The MPAA is wrong to have given this movie a mere R rating. It should be NC-17, period.""Elle"" doesn't make any sense whatsoever, that confound me as to the point of the plot and subplots. It's a rather vacuous commentary on the female psyche, and the sheer ludicrous elements of the entire plot leading to the bizarre ""happy"" ending left me flabbergasted with frustration and disbelief, because this movie demands that I leave my brain at the door in terms of excessive suspension of disbelief.Paul Verhoeven has proved himself to be the poor man's Brian De Palma, the latter who, at least, knows how to pull off the crazy plot twists and intrigues without coming off laughably absurd, until recently in the last two decades, when De Palma simply went off the deep end, not unlike Lars von Trier in the last decade. ""Elle"" is simply ""Basic Instinct"" in reverse, and still as ludicrous as that infamous 1992 erotic thriller with plot holes and equally absurd demand for suspension of disbelief that infers puerile male chauvinist fantasy.This said, Isabelle Huppert is, as I reiterate, the bravest actress. I doubt that she will an Oscar for Best Actress (she had won Golden Globe Best Actress award last month), simply because the Academy members, in particular elderly and perhaps more prudish, will be so offended and outraged by the risqué content and absurd plotting in ""Elle"" that they walk out in droves midway or turn off DVD to eject in palpable anger, given that this movie is one of the most provocative ever made to date.That this movie made me cringe with horror -- and The Piano Teacher barely made me wince, being hypnotized by the great and magnificent Isabelle Huppert's performance -- especially with grotesque sexual content (not just rape acts but also involving other elements that are just as morally offensive) is quite an accomplishment. And I braved through Gaspar Noe's brutal and nasty films (I have not seen Nicolas Refn's films, especially ""Only God Forgives"" and ""Neon Demon"" that are said to have prompted walkouts). Ergo, ""Elle"" certainly takes the cake as the most edgy movie released in recent memory, outside the typically pretentious and over-edgy film festivals like Sundance, Telluride, Cannes and Toronto. Paul Verhoeven should be rightly called a hack, because he could not cease to direct the latest films laden with inane plots and perfectly ludicrous premises, as if he dares the audience to suspend disbelief by forcing us to leave the brain at the door, to be insulted and mocked for daring to question the parallel world of ruthless reality and plausible fiction. Verhoeven apparently hates the audience enough to mock us, and ""Elle"" is not an exception that belies his utter cynicism toward humanity in terms of values or the lack thereof.This ""film"" is borderline rubbish that thieved my ten dollars -- I seldom go to the movies -- save for Isabelle Huppert's courageous and competent performance, that no sane film actress in Hollywood and London will agree to by taking on the lead role that is perverse, dreadful and exploitative.I will be genuinely shocked if Ms. Huppert wins the Oscar for Best Actress, defying the odds given that ""Elle"" is the most infuriatingly ridiculous and deliberately provocative movie in recent years. * 1/2 out of four",Elle

I went into it thinking I was going to see something completely different and becoming rather perplexed when it was not as I expected. I thought it was about a woman being raped and her tracking her rapist down on her own terms and exacting revenge. This movie had elements of all those things but became totally twisted as only the French can do.I also winced at the many negative references to religion, particularly Catholicism. I am not a fan of Catholicism and I am as liberal as they come but it just went too far - imho.No likable characters either.

84,StregaAsuka,Elle est Mdme Huppert,9,4 June 2017,"We are presented with one of the best movies of the year 2016 (if not THE best). Although the movie might seem long (about 2,5 hours of your time), you will enjoy it for sure; that is, if you can stand the topic that it presents and then developed, which is mainly violence in different life aspects, starting with the rape of the main character, a not so young woman.The director has us well used to this kind of films where violence is the main dish; you just have to remember other movies from his filmography such as ""Robocop"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Total Recall"" and the maybe not so know in America movie, but one of his finest jobs (with the permission of the present film), ""The Black Book"". What ""Elle"" describes and shows on its opening sequence is something that will impact you for a while, if not shock you; the way it is projected, nothing harsh, but still real enough will not leave you unaffected. From there on the story flows at a pace where you are trying to discover together with the main character who is behind the attack against her. But not everything is as it looks like. We learn about her life, her past, her present and her future; and when you are starting to pity her, like really pity her, there is something that she does or happens that makes you change your mind really fast.Of course this movie couldn't be done nor could it have such a great impact if it wasn't for the amazing performance given by Isabelle Huppert. She is flawless on screen and just perfect in this role. A role that was rejected by many American actresses because of what implied doing and what they had to actually do in front of the camera, because let's not forget: this is a French movie, with French cast, French crew and a Dutch director, and there is absolutely no way that this could have been made in the USA with such a magnificent result. This movie is the French selected movie to represent their country at the Oscars, and I strongly hope that it will be picked up by the Academy as one of the five finalists for best foreign movie. Moreover, I sincerely hope that Isabelle Huppert will get many nominations and awards for her impeccable work, as she is still one of the best actresses in the world and she deserves to be reminded of it.A movie that is a must watch for everyone who wants to see something different, something more real or something just different. Although what happens is something that we don't like to watch or be aware of, this story is worth of your time as this is not the typical told story, where the victim feels sorry for herself or decides to go with a vengeance against her attacker. This is something different; less fake, less artificial and more real; showed in a European way, although at some points It could feel a bit surreal altogether.

85,stroggos,Manages to be both a character study and a nailbiting thriller,8,20 March 2017,"At the outset, ELLE appears to be the story of a rape. Michèle's horror starts with the very first scene and rape is essentially the premise on which the whole movie rests. Rape is the lens through which this movie is viewed, a dark vision of humanity.Michèle tries to find the perpetrator in what at times feels like a detective story. But then amidst this crime story, she also has to deal with her son's questionable life decisions, a secret love affair, a malicious father... in short, the full catastrophe of human life!The movie is shockful of complex characters with ulterior motifs and unfulfilled desires. Everybody is either sad, depressed or longing for something—and if they seem otherwise, you immediately suspect pretence. All of this complexity is reflected in and through Michèle, who is played by the magnificent Isabelle Huppert and holds everything together. Her character is reminiscent of Hamlet in terms of how many internal struggles she faces, jumping back and forth between hatred and loneliness, self-loathing and pride, frigidity and desire. Yet this complex bag of character traits and human emotions never collapses under Huppert's brilliant performance.The director Paul Verhoeven knows just well enough that in order to make this movie work, one needs to simply hold the camera on Isabelle Huppert's face—she has an aura of respect surrounding her when she doesn't speak, and when she does speak, she's all the more impressive. It took me a while to get into her unrelatable character, but in the end it was worth the emotional effort, as I felt myself carried deeper and deeper into her abyss. Some of the cringe-worthiest moments in the film aren't those that deal with direct violence, but those that uncover the coldness in everyday social interactions.If at all, my only concern regarding ELLE is that having so many twisted characters in one spot connected with each other with so many bad things happening to them is a tad bit unbelievable. In that sense, the story is a bit pretentious. But if you take ELLE as pure fiction and as an allegory for the atrocities of human life, then this can easily be ignored. If you let yourself go, you're in for a wicked ride of violence, sexual perversions and French wine.",Elle
86,qeter,mixed bag,6,30 October 2016,"Seen at the Viennale 2016: As usual, a perfect performance by the great actress Huppert. She might be the main reason for people flocking to this (rather unnecessary) movie anyway. I guess, also Verhoeven and Birke could trust upon Huppert, that somehow she will rescue the overloaded plot. And yes, she did. Good enough, that it is entertaining enough to watch her. Apart from Huppert's acting I liked how sexual lust was shown. There was a kind of truthfulness in it that is missing in 99% of all other love movies. Sexual interest needs common sexual fantasies. A fact that is neglected by pure romantic love movies too often.",Elle
87,JoshuaDysart,"The Life, Times, & Assault of a Narcissist",9,2 February 2017,"Paul Verhoeven is as thematically ambitious, ethically challenging, impishly excessive, and darkly funny as ever in this, his best film since returning to European cinema. Isabelle Huppert is amazing as a destructive narcissist who may have inherited sociopathic tendencies and impaired empathy from her father and who creates video games riddled with overtly sexualized misogynist content, even after becoming a sexual assault victim herself. The assault sequences are not easy to watch, and I'm still wrestling with the ethical soul of the film, but Verhoeven takes, what on paper, should be terribly offensive and manages to humanize it, as well as give it an almost Hitchcockian air at times. There's a lot here about the sexual and social needs of men and women and the consequences of those needs on one another. Open to debate is whether or not the work justifies its existence, or that we need a man to tell this story, but taking all that into account, Verhoeven navigates the tricky material extremely well. The fact that it runs head on towards some pretty touchy subject matter means viewer mileage may vary, but personally, I've been thinking about it for days.",Elle
88,axapvov,Michèle: Portrait of a seriously troubled woman,8,2 February 2018,"Isabelle Huppert migh have signed a pact with the devil. She´s still incredibly sexy at over 60 years old and as unique as always. ""Elle"" it´s all about her (duh) and no other actress could have possibly made it. A classy production with moments of great tension but I find this to be a character study more than anything else. A woman and her circumstance: her family, her work, her friends and, of course, her sexuality. It might be controversial but it´s not cheap. She´s not an ordinary woman and her father and her mother both have an important role in the film as to know why. Everything else is plausible due to her condition, from her son´s character issues to her affairs and further. Nothing is taken lightly, every situation or decision is determined by her psychology.Now, I´ve seen how it enrages a lot of people. I guess they´re not familiar with Huppert´s work. There´s, of course, ""La pianiste"" but I find ""Ma mère"" to be worse. She´s always had a taste for moral uncertainty and she´s never been afraid of playing with its limits. Verhoeven is similar and this is a clear highlight in his appalling filmography. I wonder what would happen if ""The Clockwork Orange"", for instance, was made today? I´m not a fan of it but it´s widely regarded as a classic. We shouldn´t forget these are movies, not real life. Violence or pshycopathy are still a part of the human condition, however unpleasant they might be. I´m unfortunately close enough to rape reality to assert my opinion. ""Elle"" isn´t overly serious and never tries to be more than it is: two entertaining hours of drama.",Elle
89,mallaverack,Zero for plot. Five stars for everything else.,5,26 January 2020,"Wow. I cannot believe the number of awards this film was nominated for. You can call it provocative, avant- garde, , different, etc. But how can these so-called qualities of approach override the utter implausibility of the plot?Woman is raped and assaulted in her home. Woman decides to carry on as if nothing unusual has occurred. Woman finds out identity of the rapist. Woman tells nobody. She then puts herself in situations to be battered and raped again. In some scenes she if struck so violently but shows zero physical or emotional affects. She invites the rapist into her home. She welcomes rapist into social circle of friends and workmates. She informs rapist while driving home with him that she intends reporting all to the police, with not a shred of concern for her own safety! Finally, she is violently attacked again within minutes of having notified rapist of her intention, but miraculously help appears when someone (I am trying to not reveal too much of this absurd plot) strikes the rapist over the head with a fatal blow.Remarkably, I kept watching to the very end of this film for two reasons. The standout performance by Isabelle Huppert and the possibility that the plot could become even sillier.Not recommended for women sensitive to the idea of a rapist being embraced by his victim.",Elle
90,RaulFerreiraZem,not that good and definetly not that bad,7,10 January 2018,"Elle is an unpredictable, messed up thriller with an very uneasy theme throughout. 
For me the biggest highlights were Isabelle Huppert's performance and the unpredictable, uncompromising depictions of sexuality.
The issues i've had with this film though were mostly the dialogue and the unnecessary and absurd subplots such as the Michelle's father backstory and the whole Vincent's girlfriend thing. To start with the first one, it really takes away from the tension and the seriousness of the plot to have surreal cheap gags(?) like him killing himself just to not to have to talk to his own daughter. I mean he literally killed about a dozen people and lived with it for another 30 years or so but its his daughter visiting him that gets him to be desperate enough to hang himself?come on movie.
The vincent thing is really predictable and clichéd , the scene when he first sees his son is straight out of a My Name Is Earl episode, and his girlfriend is your standart stereotype of annoying, unfair, demanding and cheating girlfriend. At the end of the day i find it very hard to believe that any of the characters in the film(except michelle) could exist in the real world as they seem very cartoonish and one note. 
All in all was a decent film even with some serious flaws.

91,conannz,Awful and shocking,1,28 July 2016,"I have been a film fan for 40+ years now. There are very few films that shock me as much as this one. I have no doubt the director is trying to be provocative but in my opinion he has crossed too many lines. I gave this film a 1 but only because I can't give it a zero.Isabelle Huppert in the lead performs what is like a 1 woman show. We never really feel like we know her. She has two standard expressions which she uses a lot in this movie. The first one is a kind of puzzled glance and the second is when she is answering her dammed phone again. Actually the phone should get its own credit as the second most active character.She even manages to shock a room full of bro gamers with her games direction at one point. The director can argue it is all satire but I think he is wrong.I saw this at a film festival and while festivals take chances I thought this was really a chance too far. I would have liked some trigger warnings. As it was I didn't manage to watch the full movie which is 2 hrs 10 minutes. It may be that the last 15 mins of the movie makes up for some of the earlier scenes but I don't think they could.What the synopsis refers to as ""attacked in her home"" is a brutal rape by a man in a ski mask. That was when I first wanted to walk out on the film. That is replayed and repeated later on and echoed in a disturbing animation. There are a few moments of very black, dark humour but not enough to make this film watchable. I couldn't stop shaking for an hour after seeing this. Rape is not something that should be used to entertain audiences in my view. I am profoundly disappointed that this film is getting any attention. Later I found out the director had trouble getting a U.S actor to play the lead role. No doubt their agents all advised them that this film is borderline hate crime in the making and they should stay away.",Elle

But beyond the sadomasochistic representation of the story, evident from the very first bars, I mean the author literary as the director seems to focus on the ""cynicism"" that surrounds the protagonists of the story. Therefore, according to this reading, more sociological than intimist, the work paradoxically assumes moral value in denouncing ""the indifference of the times"". Michèle behaves so it is for the traumatic childhood experiences but above all because she is a ""daughter of the times"" and her ""cynicism"" towards others but above all to herself is the only way out for r not succumb. In this, Huppert's acting professionalism is extraordinary, capable of giving life with her corporeality to a disturbed and disturbing character that had already been seen in ""The Pianist"".

96,mancinibrown,"Great acting job, but the actions of the character make no sense",4,21 June 2017,"The first thing to be mentioned of this film is that the lead performance of Isabelle Huppert is fantastic. She covers all the range of emotions the director wants to give her, and you can feel her living the life of the character.With that out of the way, the choices this character makes seem very out of step with reality. The movie opens with her being raped, and then she goes about as if it's just another every day occurrence. Not only that, but subsequent decisions go against any type of logical progression. Call the police? No, she has a checkered past with them. Shy away from any contact with men? Quite the opposite, seduce and re-enact the rape.I'm not saying all women need to react the same if this were happen to them. However, the path walked here seems so far off as to be unbelievable. They can say she's trying not to be a victim, but I didn't see that. I saw an unlikely reaction.",Elle
97,graupepillard,Horro Porn,8,3 February 2017,"In director Paul Verhoeven's new film, men are brutes. The men in ELLE, a psycho/sexual/sadistic thriller, are cheaters, liars, wife-beaters, and ""gamers' who produce video games that are an extension of their puerile fantasies - bloody and savage. The movie begins with a close-up of a cat's vertical eyes - narrowed and expressionless observing a violent rape scene; we hear the pounding and stifled screams of struggle, but do not witness the scene until later when the victim relives itover and over. We eventually meet the rapist, costumed in anonymity who can only reach ejaculation's pinnacle of pleasure through rough, furious acts of inflicting pain as his launching platform for intense sexual rapture.Isabelle Huppert plays Michelle - a stylishly successful business woman who with her good friend runs a company which produces wildly graphic, titillating videos - where women are attacked by creatures who invade every orifice of their body with monstrous tentacles, etc - the more horrific the better. Safe from the fantasies that she peddles, Michelle has now become a victim of an uncontrollable psychotic - and like her cat, she does not reveal any emotion, nor does she report the event, preferring to plot revenge in her own distinctive way as she attempts to search out her attacker. The film slowly reveals the psychological underpinnings of Isabelle - her relationship with a father who was imprisoned when she was a young child for heinous crimes, her mother whose desperate relationships with very young men, in an attempt to maintain her youth, is broadcast on her taut stretched face - the scars of surgery. And Michelle's handsome adult son, who has not yet found his way and is about to become a father, though still being supported by Michelle.Sexual tension, desire and intimacy permeate this film. Isabelle Huppert is cool, amoral and calculating, seduced by the power of a sadomasochistic urgency into a dangerous situation which is audaciously grotesque. Walking a tightrope over lies and deceit creates collisions that pull and strain one's conception of self. When I left the theater, I kept wondering if I just saw a horror-porn movie or a titillating morality tale? Is Isabelle a victim or a participant? Ethical ambiguity permeates ELLE - and Isabelle Huppert is at the center of every scene - the ELLE of the movie - dominating every moment; a beautiful woman who is an enigma, rarely giving any indication of her thoughts or feelings, as we witness her shell slowly cracking.",Elle
98,artmania90,The performance is the redeemer of this confused story,5,16 January 2017,"ELLE is a confusing movie, filled with inconsistencies and characters that feel flawed from the script level. Their motivations are at times unclear, and the plot wanders in and out of reason. Watching the trailer, one might expect a thriller of the highest order. Instead, Paul Verhoeven's latest film feels like a jumble.The film has been generating significant buzz since it's debut at the Cannes Film Festival, and I am genuinely curious about the film that I apparently missed. Here's what I gathered: a woman (Michele, played by Isabelle Huppert) is raped after a home invasion. She is in shock, but quickly recovers and moves on with her life. She does not report this incident to the police, and she only casually tells her close friends about it over dinner days later. Michele is apparently unaffected by the act, and is only curious to find out who the man is. She works as the boss for a video gaming company, currently working on a new fantasy game for PS4 consoles. She receives calls from the rapist, mysterious emails, videos, all indicating that the man knows who she is. She suspects a coworker.At the same time we learn about her biological father, a man locked away for life for unspeakable crimes he committed when she was a child. When it happened, she was looked at as a sociopathic little girl. Growing up, we see the hardened woman she has become, closed off to everyone (colleagues, lovers, her mother, and her son). On the outside, she has all the resemblance of a successful woman. Inside, she is a complete mystery.I will admit that while the plot had me curious, the ultimate message of the story was a complete turn-off: that a woman who is raped would be so intrigued by her attacker that she would lure him back time and again to continue his assault against her. I will tell you that she finds out who committed these crimes against her, and yet she does nothing to end his violence. In fact, Michele later goes to his house willingly where she is subjected to further abuse in his basement. It's presented as a two-way relationship in which both parties require torment in order to feel a connection. Passivity is not enough, these two get off on control.Verhoeven is no stranger to such topics, having directed English-language films like Basic Instinct and Showirls. Here, there is craft on display but very little to show for it. Even without the ""thrilling"" aspects, there are funny moments in the film, particularly around Michele's son and his relationship with his vile girlfriend. She gives birth to a black baby and the son is blissfully unaware that he is not the father. Michele meets with her mother frequently who is dating a man nearly 40 years her junior. In a world where crime is around every corner, Michele is unable to escape the madness in her own life.Though I am not familiar with Huppert's career as an actress, I will admit she gives a mesmerizing performance. With deep voice and piercing stare, she becomes a woman who is both fearful and yet able to instill fear on those she oversees. There's a commitment to her performance that is never ""over-acted"" and yet hits all the right notes perfectly. Were it not for such a spectacular show of acting I don't think I could have brought myself to rate this film so high.At this movie's core there is an ugly story. I can see the appeal of such a story, but with overly-gratuitous sexuality and shock value simply there for shock, I can't understand the final message. Who are we meant to root for, and who are we meant to hate? A movie can be well-acted and well-directed, but without characters that intrigue us even in the slightest, it makes for quite a bore in the theaters.",Elle
99,IanIndependent,Verhoeven : Just misses the target again,6,5 January 2018,"I so much want to like Paul Verhoeven films. The promise much in what I want from a film. Good stories told differently, thought provoking plot-lines, interesting characters and, of course, eroticism. Yet, I haven't found any of his films totally convincing. 'Elle' is another that doesn't quite meet it's aims. I think the narrative with multiple plots could have been better told by another director. Isabelle Huppert hold all the stories and the often implausible situations together really well and is outstanding as always but cannot lift the film above average. If not for her lead then the film would have been a 3 or 4 star disaster. Having said that I wonder if the great Miss Huppert is slightly tooold for the role. I think the leading lady is now in her sixties Michele is supposed to be around 50? At times it shows.

I felt that the inclusion of this was rather anti-climactic & the film would have truly benefited from a plot twist (e.g. she participated in killing the animals/ children) If this was the case, it would explain much more why her demeanour throughout the film felt very detached and lacked emotion (I refer to her mother's death & her opinions of her sons ""child"")Very unsure of wether Elle, to some degree enjoyed her sexual relationship with her neighbour/rapist. Whilst I understand this film has tried to be transgressive, it does not succeed.The ending was terrible.

It feels like a soap opera -- now this person gets raped, now they cheat, now that one dies, now they kiss, now this one's true nature is revealed, and on and on. And all through this severe lack of focus none of the characters have normal emotional reactions to anything, which is what's supposed to make this movie so amazingly absurdly clever but actually just makes it shallow and annoying. And then back to point one -- since no one really feels much of anything, it's very easy to change from subject to subject until we end up with this silly mess.There are some good parts. The main character does make you root for her, since she is a typical cool and ""strong"" female character -- which, in movies, means someone who is devoid of actual feeling and sensitivity. She's got sass and does what ever she wants with little regard for others, except of course when she's coolly letting herself be used and harmed for men's purposes, because of course that adds interest to her character and makes it provocative, gasp. There's the soap-opera intrigue that will keep you watching for some cheap thrills, twists and turns and red herrings and what not.

The only remotely relatable character is the daughter of a serial killer which might explain why she is so organised and monumentally messed up.

107,Mbakkel2,A film which shows contempt for rape victims,1,5 July 2017,"Today I have watched Paul Verhoeven's critically acclaimed 2016 film ""Elle"". It's hard to believe that I have watched the same film as the reviewers, because I look upon it as a speculative rubbish. If an American B-film director had made it with unknown actors, it would probably have been panned. It helps to be a reputable director and have the famous actress Isabelle Huppert playing the lead role.It's labeled as a""psychological thriller"". ""Elle"" is flooded with many distractions. Distractions are necessary to increase the suspense, but what about a film that totally lacks suspense? The word ""suspense"" is embedded in the term ""thriller"". It's no thriller, but maybe it's more a drama about a rape victim? The viewers expect that a drama film about a rape victim is truthful and realistic. There is little about the film's main character, Michèle, which indicate that she has been raped. She has admittedly purchased pepper spray and a small ax, but uses them against ex-husband Richard by mistake. The rape doesn't affect her sex life either. Michèle continues to be a sexual predator, sleeping with her best friend's husband and leg flirting with her married neighbor. Elle neither shows shame, guilt, fear of men nor anxiety. When she gets injured in a car crash, who does she call? ""Ghostbusters""? No, the rapist.I hope I'm excused, but I think this film is a mockery of all rape victims. It supports the male chauvinistic falsity that women really like to be raped. Elle continues to interact with him, even after he has raped her three times. Michèle is not, therefore, a revengeful rape victim, as the female lead character in Abel Ferrera's ""Ms. 45"".Some reviewers have made a point of Michèle ""turning tables"". She makes it difficult for him to enjoy raping her, because she pretends to be consenting, which rapists are known to dislike. Yes, but it this not strongly focused on. It is incorrect to claim that Michèle is a strong female character. She is the weak part and the rapist is the strong part - following the traditional gender role patterns. When the rapist's wife thanks Elle for being temporarily able to satisfy her husband's needs (!!!!!!!!!), you may really wonder in what period this film was made. I wondered when they were going to play ""Stand by Your Man"". Now I understand why French women got suffrage as late as in 1944.Rather early I suspected who the rapist was, and will not reveal that. Why didn't Michèle call the police? You see, her father was a famous serial killer and she wanted to have nothing more to do with the police. Michèle's eccentric mom in her seventies looks like a blueprint of Endora in the TV series ""Bewitched"" and she has a young lover.If you would like to watch a good film about rape victims, I recommend Ida Lupino's ""Outrage"" (1950) or Jonathan Kaplans ""The Accused"" (1988). I liked Verhoeven's ""Zwartboek"", but this film was both speculative and mysogynic.TRAILER.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM96ne-XiH0",Elle
108,indiecinemamagazine,Elle,6,23 February 2017,"If Verhoeven's most famous film Basic Instinct was made under Hitchcock's influence then the film Elle is strongly reminiscent of Haneke's work, who also filmed in France and even cast Isabelle Huppert, the lead actress of Elle, in his film The Piano Teacher, which investigates similar problems. When Basic Instinct was created it was on the level of Hitchcock's cinematic classics, and was excellent in the visual and musical sense. Strong visual side characterizes Verhoeven's films, unlike Haneke's cinematic output which is typically gray, bleak and drab. It is very sad that in the film Elle, Verhoeven did not display himself as the artist he is.But the main flaw of the film is the miscasting of the main actress who should not be too young or too old. She should be in her forties, and not sixty like Huppert. The film is focused on one woman which is why it is important to have had an actress who is able to hold the viewers interest with her acting and her looks.The plot of the picture is also questionable and not convincing enough. The director could not decide if he wanted to do a comedy or a drama, and combining the genre elements did not prove entirely successful. The male characters are also not impressive either and the main villain when unmasked is not scary in the slightest.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2017/01/elle/",Elle

Huppert plays Michelle who is divorced from Richard. They have a son Vincent who is a clueless millennial with a pregnant girlfriend Josie. Michelle calls Josie, the girlfriend, psychotic. Curious since Michelle grew up with a sadistic serial killer father and it is intimated that she helped him with his crimes as a child before he was caught and imprisoned. This has made Michelle something of a celebrity and not in a good way. She has grown up and made a life for herself, married, had child, has real relationships, and runs a very successful video game company with her friend Anna. Anna is married to Richard. Michelle's next door neighbors are Patrick and Rebecca.The film starts off, yes that's correct, starts off, with the rape of Michelle by a ski masked intruder. She does not call the police but instead takes a bath. Later on she is raped a 2nd time, by the same ski masked intruder. Yes folks, there isn't just one rape scene, there are actually SIX rapes scenes if you include her day dream of killing the rapist during a rape. Sigh. It's a lot of rape scenes. The story plot has a lot of red herrings involving boys who work at the video game company and someone has made a violent video piece of Michelle getting raped by one of the creatures from the game. OK, Seven rape scenes in total if you count that one. Eventually the rapist is exposed, which is her next door neighbor and Michelle and he go on to have what could be questionably called consensual sex. Some other reviewer suggested that this explore how far one would go to fully embrace one's sexuality to the extent of sadomasochism and role-playing. What hogwash. The only thing I got from the film, was that her father was a sadist and killed people. And that coincidentally as an adult she gets involved with her neighbor who is a violent rapist. Ultimately this long, tedious film, saved only by Ms. Huppert's acting, as she is in every single scene, ends with the son coming in and killing the rapist. It's all very confusing and convoluted. I thought the story could be tweaked a bit better. It seems to me that Michelle sets her son up to interrupt the rape to help him in some way grow up. And that the killing of the rapist, helps her to become a nicer person.Does that sound like a good movie to you? I found it very disturbing and very long. I would have rather watched it on video. Sorry Paul Verhoeven, but a Michael Haneke you, are, not.",Elle

I believe that 130 mions to tell the story of a women thats raped and then she looks out for its rapist its ay too long maybe 100 mins is enough (or less) the story for me felt too long at the verge that i had to ask my brother (i was watching it with him) about the time and when he checked and told me ""we saw one hour so far"" i said ""one hour?"" like thinking oh damn another hour? Honestly 130 mins i felt them like 240 mins way too pasive and honestly the ""harrasment"" elements (when the guy stalks her gets in her home blah blah blah send emails messages blah blah blah) were totally not convincing for me i don't know i didn't like the movie i rate it 6 because its Varhoeven nothing more watch it if you want to but i didn't like it much not even to spend a boring rainy Sunday afternoon home alone totally bored day to ""Kill time"" This movie makes me say that Hollow Man and Starship Trooperrs are real gold imagine that!!!",Elle
111,jarthur0111,"Verhoeven + Huppert = subversive, 3rd rail baiting fun.",9,19 March 2017,"Whatever you think this movie will be about it is not. Paul Verhoeven has never been better or more provocative. His past film work has often touched the 3rd rail of social norms & morality & this film practically gives it a bear hug. It is gleefully dark.Isabelle Huppert is phenomenal as the amoral CEO of a graphic (emphasis on ""graphic"") video game company. The film opens with a shock as she is brutally & sexually assaulted. The first face you see, however, is that of her cat implacably watching the act. Huppert's ""Michele"" treats the aftermath with the same sort of chill. She will not let herself become a ""victim"" defined by the violence done to her.The movie becomes a study of manners of her & the people she is surrounded by --good & bad-- & it is, more often than not, hilarious. (The rest of the cast is great.) You don't know if she is plotting her revenge upon her assailant or trying to put it behind her. The assault is always there but takes on less importance. What becomes fascinating very quickly is Michele's past & present. It is one of the best & nuanced characters I've ever seen in movies. If you want to champion her ""female empowerment"" you can. She is not a terribly likable person, but you have to admire her backbone.Verhoeven's style may be more muted her than in his previous films but he still pushes boundaries of tastes. There is a French coolness & sophistication that perfectly fits the hot button themes in it & that leads to some very funny & cutting scenes. (But I laughed uproariously at the excellent ""Gone Girl"" too. Nothing bad happens to ""the cat"" in either movie. Whew!)If you are opened-minded to the unexpected & casually cruel then you'll find ""Elle"" to be one of the best movies of the past year.",Elle
112,Ser_Stephen_Seaworth,Huppert lends poise to Verhoeven's world.,8,5 October 2016,"Paul Verhoeven has always worn the mantle of provocateur with pride, from the alluringly pulp ""Basic Instinct"" to the scandalous stripper saga that was ""Showgirls."" Even when he dips his toe in genre fare, there's still nevertheless an undercurrent of erotic satire in them (remember the tri-boobed woman in ""Total Recall""?). Even when Verhoeven plays it straight, like in the brilliant ""Black Book"", his films nevertheless drip with sensuality. His latest film, however, takes a more measured but by no means less lacerating tack.At first glance, ""Elle"" is so cold-blooded it could almost be mistaken for a Michael Haneke film, especially as it features Haneke's muse, the glacially poised Isabelle Huppert, at its center. Certainly, ""Elle"" kicks right off in a suitably brutal manner one would typically see from Haneke: namely, the savage rape of its primary character in her own home by a masked intruder. Shades of ""Funny Games"" certainly are evident here, but Verhoeven nevertheless keeps his own brand of reptilian energy alive in the film. Huppert's Michèle immediately gets back into her daily routine: overseeing the newest release from her video-game company, dealing with the drama of her son's upcoming fatherhood with a girl Michèle cannot stand, and seeing her mother tentatively flirting with a new marriage while her father, a convicted murderer, languishes in prison. With everything on Michèle's plate, a little sexual assault is merely seasoning.The shocking opening scene will certainly have audiences squirming, and indeed Verhoeven revisits it a couple of times throughout the film as Michèle mulls over the event, with variations here and there as she imagines how she could have defended herself—or provoked him further. And despite her desire to move on from the event, it continues to linger, especially as her assailant sends her threatening texts that he may not be done with her. But rather than go to the police, Michèle finds herself almost being an encouraging presence to her assailant, as though she craves the demeaning, degrading act to which she was subjected.It is certainly a problematic viewpoint for any film to have: that of a rape victim desiring to return to the act itself. But Verhoeven's lurid sensibility strangely doesn't hit the exploitative level that he typically sets out to achieve. While the story does juggle its fair share of melodramatic subplots (swapping out an affair for a cuckolding here while touching on a dark childhood there), it mostly focuses on playing up the stalker cat-and- mouse theme. Michèle goes the ""Brave One"" route at first: buying (and using) mace, going to a gun range. But as all of her life's little foibles start to coalesce all at once, it's almost as though she seeks the grim simplicity of simply being a ""victim.""I've always found Huppert to be a technically masterful but nevertheless somewhat clinical actress, one whose austerity can sometimes keep us at arm's length when she should instead be drawing us closer, deeper. I find that can be a bit of a detriment to some of her performances, but ""Elle"" relies on that puritanical presence, and her ascetic approach to her portrayal of Michèle is largely what makes the film work in the first place. She navigates the hectic labyrinth of her life like a ship cutting through thick fog, and even as Verhoeven puts his thumb on the tongue-in-cheek scales, she never once feels like she's in on the joke. Though Huppert was not Verhoeven's first choice (he shopped the script to the likes of Marion Cotillard and Carice van Houten beforehand), she nevertheless feels like the right one. Her flinty nature provides the dour center the film requires.""Elle"" does feel a bit bloated in his second half, and I honestly could've done with most of its tangential subplots being axed. Verhoeven's films generally outstay their welcome in terms of runtime, and Ellecomes dangerously close to that, but Huppert's compelling performance and Verhoeven's approach to the material will keep audiences in their seats, albeit forever squirming.",Elle
113,zken-1,Watching a beautiful actress be raped over and over,1,28 November 2016,"This film, showing the raped of actress Isabelle Huppert, graphically shown, is not fun, not clever, not full of ideas or great craft, but a monstrosity of intention and execution. It starts with a rape, and then the shots of the rape are shown over and over. Exactly how many times I do not know, since I walked out a got a refund after slightly less than an hour. Watching this brutal scene once was more than I could bear. And then there is the fact that Huppert is shown to be so nonchalant about the whole experience was too much to sit through. I advise you to avoid this total trash and save your money. Also, I will NEVER trust a film critic again.

Literally from the first scene you are going to understand what you are about to see for the next two and a half hours (long movie but it passes by surprisingly fast), it's the story of a strong independent woman - who has some ""demons"" of her own - seeking revenge against her rapist but not in the classic avenger ""vendetta"" but more in a rational state of mind then an emotional. Yet the truly beautiful aspect about this movie to make note of is performance given by Isabelle Huppert who dazzles the audience in every single scene, truly one of the top actresses of our time. Only God knows why she didn't win an academy award for this performance.But my words won't do justice to this film, only one advice see it, you will not be disappointed!",Elle

The fact that Huppert reportedly actually sought out to play this role outs her as a disgrace to women and thinking men everywhere. I had my doubts about watching this film after discovering that Verhoeven directed it. He has a history of making films that objectify women and show blatant misogynistic tendencies. Apologists for him and his film, who call him ""provocative"", should also be ashamed. Actually, everyone involved in this production should be castigated.The problems don't end with a premise that actually promotes rape. Characters don't act like realistic human beings; they seem to be puppets acting out Verhoeven's sick fantasies. But the lack of realism doesn't end with behavior, it extends to the lack of physical evidence of a brutal attack on a woman; no bruises, cuts, etc. after showing a man punch and slap a woman repeatedly.Without explanation, after extremely nasty behavior between multiple pairs of characters, in later scenes they are together as if nothing had happened. This is really, really terrible filmmaking. It should be avoided at all costs.",Elle

117,Mystic1000,Ugh. I'd rather be forced to watch Showgirls again.,2,12 January 2017,"I'm not sure I can convey how much I didn't like this movie. That it won Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film simply informs me how out of touch I am with the sensibilities of the Hollywood Foreign Press. Or maybe it's how much the HFP is subject to current glamour, politicking and fantasy of what could have been. I think of it like The Artist winning Best Movie of 2011. Everybody liked it for about 5 minutes and then there was ""buyer's remorse"". (Reminds me of a certain recent election, too, but that's another story). Look, Isabelle Huppert is an awesome actress and I have no problem with her getting the recognition she deserves (thus the 2 rating!), but this movie is a mess as only Paul Verhoeven can construct. You will go out of the theater thinking: ""WTF, who lives like that?"", and ""Wait a second, that subplot was for...why?"", and ""OMG, how contrived can you make a character backstory to justify your tale of perversion and delusion?"". Lastly, I know the French have their cultural perspective on monogamy, art and what sexual and economic equality looks like, and I consider myself very accepting of different worldview and cultural mores; but this movie just left me with vomit in my mouth and a dislike for humanity. If for Verhoeven creating strong revulsion in the viewer is an art form, then I suppose he is a genius.",Elle
118,Plamen_Nenchev,A Twisted Celebration of Female Empowerment,10,17 March 2017,"Michele (Isabelle Huppert) is brutally raped in her living room. After the assailant flees, she casually wipes herself, then orders sushi. When her son visits her later and asks her how she got the bruises on her face, she says she fell from her bike. She is just as nonchalant about what happened when she tells her friends (amid some very shocked glances) as when she starts looking for the rapist herself.The assault doesn't stop her from flirting with her married neighbour, nor from sleeping, yet again, with her best friend's husband. At some point, we learn that Michele is the daughter of a convicted mass murder, who slaughtered half the people in her street when she was little, and then it pretty much dawns on you: if this hasn't managed to break her, a mere rape will hardly do it. Meanwhile, the rapist strikes again, but this time Michele successfully fights back. She manages to stab him in the hand, tears the mask off his face and finds out who he is. Yet, not only does she do nothing to bring him to justice, but when she crashes with her car, it is him she calls to come and get her.Michele is not the only one who is a bit 'off' in the movie ('off' here being an euphemism for 'twisted')—this can be said about pretty much everyone around her—from her 90-year-old mother, who has a lover 60 years her junior, through her son, who wants to be a father so much that he doesn't even bat an eyelid when his girlfriend gives birth to a black baby, to her most trusted employee, who, in his infatuation with her, creates porn animation where she is—well, of course—raped again by a demon from hell.If you haven't guessed by now, the director of this lovely mess is Paul Verhoeven. No one other than him (or perhaps David Cronenberg) can concoct such a mixture of sex and violence and get away with it without being crass or vulgar. As despite the oozing sociopathic sexuality, 'Elle' is anything but vulgar. Quite the reverse, it exudes smashing, exuberant, despite-all-odds vitality. Scene after scene, Verhoeven and Huppert successfully convince us that whatever it is that happens to you, however bad it is, if you refuse to be a victim, if you refuse to give in, if you refuse to surrender, you can survive and get over practically everything. An incredibly strong female lead and an incredibly strong role for Huppert. It comes as no surprise why the movie is simply titled 'Elle' (She).",Elle

But, if one excludes this dimension, Elle is more than just an unusual film about an unusual character. Rather, Michelle Leblanc (played by Isabelle Huppert) defies our expectations at almost every turn. Nor can we entirely attribute this to the tragedy of her childhood. Even her choice of whom to help her after a car accident is beyond belief. Advocates of the film will suggest her bizarre actions are an outgrowth of her unfortunate childhood. Hogwash. They are simply a way to rationalize the sensationalism injected into this film by its director.To the extent that the film is well acted, well shot, and has a consistent plot line, it can still be considered mildly entertaining, especially if bizarre and unexpected behavior is your cup of tea.

Paul Verhoven has a bad habit of going over the top and reveling in extreme violence, gratuitous nudity, and pure shock, which I think he does to hide the fact that his scripts are not very good and the stories very inconsistent, as is the case here. In his latest perverted fantasy, the main character is repeatedly raped, and later in the film, it is revealed that she actually enjoys the experience.

Every single character in it is either an awful person or a dumbass. The horror elements of the movie are all stupid jump scares, including the literal ""it was just the cat"" cliché.

Don't expect to be wowed, but go in with no expectations and expect to be pleasantly surprised.The story is non-conventional, dealing with difficult themes but in a very strange way. It does court controversy a little, but not needlessly. I don't want to spoil the film for potential viewers but the film is not ""difficult"" or ""painful"" to watch. There are some scenes and themes that are meant for mature audiences but they're presented in a neutral, very distant light. You are more of a cold observer than anything.There is no ""gratuitous nudity"" - I think people don't understand what gratuitous means. These are adult, middle-aged people having normal lives. There are only flashes of nudity here and there (sometimes really less than a second) but that's it. I was not disturbed nor offended by the unconventional behavior of the protagonist. I think it's more offended to say that all victims behave the same and that there is a template for victim behavior that this film should've followed. Every person is different. Sometimes people do the strangest things. The media is filled with real life rape accusers coming forward that simply cannot explain their subsequent behavior toward their rapists. People have all kinds of defense mechanisms. They don't just curl up into the fetal position and cry in the shower.My issues with this film is that there are many sub-plots and they don't tie in well with the story. The sub-plots are either given too much time for something that doesn't tie in or not enough time for them to be tied in. They're in the middle of nowhere.This film also does something interesting in letting your mind play tricks on you, making you see everyone as a potential rapist in a crazy whodunnit as the world goes on.This film is not for everyone. I'm a person who couldn't handle Irréversible but this particular film was not a problem for me.

Not surprisingly, the more religious the character, the worse a person they are portrayed as being (the opposite of what generally occurs in the real world, but this seems to be a film motivated by hatred rather than reality). Several hatreds actually. Besides religion, there is the hatred of women and of men.

She is in essence completely disconnected from the heart.She's a special type of crazy because she has never experienced sanity, so she has nothing to compare it to, and that's dangerous. Her money and status in society and her posh dwelling place always remind her to justify her actions, such as cheating, and that she's doing life right, when in reality she is border-line dead. Oh, she moves her and there with pace, but she is next to death. Not just her, but her neighbors across the street, her acquaintances, co-workers, and relatives. They are all, literally, like demons.This movie apologizes for insanity and wraps it up in a story to justify it. It brings you into the world of people who don't know what to do with themselves, so their high points in life are raping women ""because it's necessary,"" stroking their genitals, pumping out a baby when you don't have the means nor the maturity nor a loving partner to do it with, decorated with awkward ""casual and polite"" conversations with fake smiles and laughter from a group of people who feel nothing but numbness or anger.As research material for the Psychologist, it is a triumph.

All of them are true, although comedy is a bit of a stretch, even a black comedy. This is a very, VERY DARK film.The film opens with a rape scene. The violent and vicious rape by a masked intruder of Michèle Leblanc, played by Isabelle Huppert, while she's in her home.This has caused some arguments between people who believe everything sexual is part of the patriarchy, and this this film, being both written and directed by men, is therefore exploiting women. Others feel that this film empowers women, by showing their complexity and strength.I found this film fascinating. Don't get me wrong, it's not an easy watch. Sometimes the story is a little slow, other times it's a very uncomfortable watch. None of that makes it less captivating. It's almost like a French version of a Hitchcock film.I will admit that I worked out (educated guess) who the rapist was, but I didn't expect the film to play out as it did. Its darkness reminded me a little of Nicolas Winding Refn's Neon Demon. Not in Demon's horror aspect, but as a dark thriller that asks questions of its audience, of their morals, of the strength of their stomach.Interestingly there isn't a character in the film you can truly like. On the face of it, Michèle is strong, almost bulletproof, when in reality, she is twisted up inside, probably due to an incident in her childhood, which the film spends a little time going into. Her son is a weak, spineless idiot, with a warped sense of responsibility. Her mother is a shameless, pleasure seeking narcissist. Everyone else seems to be cheating on their significant others. These are not good people. But, that's what makes them interesting. It's a person's weaknesses that makes them real, that makes them appealing. That allows you to see yourself in them. It's the reason why Batman will always be a better character than Superman. He has more weaknesses, more flaws, it allows you connect to him. For the same reason, you find yourself feeling slightly connected to these broken individuals.The film revolves around Michèle, and her search for the identity of the rapist, but it doesn't simply focus on that at the cost of everything else, there are a number of sub-stories unravelling around her, making this feel more like real life, in a slightly over the top and bizarre way.As I said, this isn't an easy film to watch, it takes an investment, in both effort and time. That being said it's worth it. This film will stay with you for a while. I'm sure this will become a film I reference. It's made me think, and I love that about it.This is a good solid film, and if you think you can commit 2 hours and 10 minutes to a subtitled film, and you can stomach some fairly violent scenes, then I think you'll get quite a lot out of this one.Give it a chance.",Elle

137,pinansky,plodding borefest,2,1 March 2017,"I was really excited to see this film. Being both a fan of Verhoven and the rape- revenge thriller genre, I had very high expectations. I thought this could be the perfect vehicle for his unique sensibilities and the result would be a wonderfully controversial movie. While the film certainly flirts with controversy it ultimately falls flat. It also fails to work as a thriller, while numerous scenes could have been played for high tension the movie never really makes the viewer feel any level of fear for the protagonist. The script sacrafices trying to develop the main plot by including a large number of side plots and ancillary characters that neither add to the mystery nor help us understand the motivations of the main character. We spend an enormous amount of time discussing her serial killer father, however nothing ever comes of it. It simply never really becomes important to the plot at all. While I will commend the filmmakers for bothering to wrap up every loose thread and side-plot none of them seem particularly worth following up on and it only seems like padding out an anemic plot.",Elle
138,lion_month,Good but not perfect!,5,12 December 2016,"Elle is a movie with a combination of sex and violence. A movie about a raped woman (Michele) who finally came to know her raper is her neighbor (Patrick). I wouldn't describe the story here but I found it an intermediate movie. It was very long and slow. I mean for that story, 2h 10min was long. I think the screenplay and story could be written much better than that. However, The story had a couple of layers since it was a psycho-thriller movie and it was difficult to find out who the raper can be until the middle of the movie. As a leading role actress, Isabelle Huppert played it well but she was not perfect to be nominated for 74th Golden Globes. She didn't have a full sense of acting. I didn't expect that ""Elle"" be nominated as best foreign language movie. I got surprised. It was a little bit far from it. In my opinion its unfair that this movie be awarded.

Bad storytelling( just one example: Michèle leaves her son at the party, on arriving in the house she got raped( again...) and after a couple of minutes who turns out to be her saviour? Yes her son, a real Deus ex Machina....pffft..) The biggest flaw is the psychology and character building in this movie; behaviour of the main protagonist is like we are watching a drama from Pluto...erratic and impossible to empathise. Yes Michèle was traumatized is a child( in itself a grotesque story)but that explains very little about how she deals with the rape, with the people around her, etcetera.

142,Colourofthelife,Explanation of this bad fairytale.,1,20 February 2019,"There are many misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding this film. I will try to address few of them so that people would have a better understanding of the film.
The plot is very simple, Michèle is a businesswoman who seemingly has a dull life, surrounded by unsuccesfull characters, especially men. One day she got brutally beaten and raped at home but she went on her life as if nothing happened. Many critics and some reviewers here celebrated this as strenght which is untrue. She went on her life seemingly unscathed because of mainly two reasons :1- She is a depraved, deranged, emotionless, selfish psychopath bordering on sociopathy, so she cannot feel anything nor can actually care for anybody. If she were a sane, healthy and normal human being, i'd call it strenght but at her case, this is just a lacking of basic human emotions.2- She enjoyed, actually loved getting brutally beaten and raped. She was moaning, groaning with pain and pleasure and her throes made this obvious.So she just went on her life and she never attempted to go to the police nor to reveal her rapist's identity. She just accepted her beating and rape and moved on. After a short while, she started to receive messages from her rapist which actually made her excited , even aroused. One day after she got home, the rapist attacked and started to brutally, viciously beat her. She fought back hoping he could beat her more viciously and mercilessly. At one point of struggle, she reached out his mask and revealed his identity which happened to be her married neighbour with whom she has been flirting. She got confused and wanted him to get out which he complied.Then she and rapist began a sort of relationship based on S&M and rape. Those supposedly violent rape and beating scenes were quite funny. In the cinema, the majority of male audience laughed loudly. That's because they were extremely unrealistic. For example, he thrown her away and when she's on her four, he kicked right on her face which should cause extreme damage. He then grabbed her head and smashed it against wall repeatedly which also should ansure very serious brain damage. Addititonally, he got punched and slapped her face dpzens of times yet not even a scratch appeared on her face. If you watched Irreversible, by Gaspar Noe, it was pretty much the same beating and Monica Bellucci's character in that film ended up in coma as it should be.Throughout her relationship with her rapist, she was very weak and passive. The rapist did use her as an sex object, as a piece of meat and a punchbag and she complied. Some also call this as if she turned table on her rapist and got upper hand which is wrong. She gave him whatever he wanted and at no point she was in control nor shpwn any sin of consciouss and strenght in the relationship with her rapist. Imagine you go to a school and some bullies beat you to take your money, lunch and force you to do their homework. Then one day you decide that to give them whatever they wanted, money, lunch etc., willingly. Would you call this strenght? Same happens to Michele too. She was just a punchbag and toy so that he could satisfy his sadistic urges upon her body. Surely she liked to get beaten and raped too but she did not initiate anything. She was just passively receiving whatever given her by her rapist.Another big misconception is that people somehow believe she orchestrated, plotted the demise and punishment of her rapist. In reality, she did not. At no point of film she shown any kind of conscious, awareness of her self-destructive and self-loathing behaviours. There is literally no sign within the film that she planned her revenge. Here is how it goes :They thrown a party and everybody was there. She wanted to leave early and asked her rapist to take her home. During the driving, she told him that she was going to go to the police and report his crimes. In reality, she never had such an intention throughout the film. She told this to provoke him so that he could way more brutally beat and rape her. This is all she wanted. She even wanted to get brutally beaten to death. That is because his crimes were extremely henious and, depending on the country, would warrant 15 years in prison which would ruin his life entirely. So the rapist had no other choice but to beat her to death. It's worth to note that Michele was an extremely masochistic woman.After they arrived, she got out of car and entered house but left the gate unlocked so that he could sneak in easily. As usual, she fought back to make him angrier to receive extremely vicious and brutal beating. Then out of nowhere, her son appeared and bludgeoned him to death. As i said earlier, many somehow believe she arranged this whole justice and revenge and that she told her son to be at home. In reality, no she did not do such a thing. The son was supposed to be at the party. That him being at home was pure coincidence. She wanted to get brutally raped and beaten to death but this random event ruined her plans. It's like golden shot drug addicts often apply themselves and usually they end up dead.So what is my evidence that she did not planned this whole revenge but it was random? Here they are :1- There is no sign or evidence to suggest that she planned this. She did not talk to her son at the party about this. Her intention, when she told him she was going to go to the police , was to provoke him so that he could get angrier, reckon how his life could be ruined and decide to beat her to death.2- In the Phillippe Djian's book,which this film based on, it was obvious that she did not plan this nor attempted to get any revenge. All she wanted was to get brutally raped, beaten and eventually murdered at the hands of her sadistic rapist.3- Isabelle Huppert, in her interviews, clearly stated that this was a random event. Her son was not supposed to be at home and it was pure coincidence.4- Similarly, Paul verhoeven also stated that it was a coincidence. He even went further and said "" It was a divine punishment ""You can google for these aforementioned interviews.Many also call the ending happy but i disagree . Sure if we realistically think, a sadistic rapist, who very likely raped ,beaten and perhaps murdered other women too and will continue to do so, was eliminated and justice has served but there is nothing realistic about this film. Even Huppert herself state that this is just a fantasy, just a fairytale. It was an unhappy ending because our heroine did not get what she wanted. Her son's intervention ruined Michele's plans.As for the film itself, The plot is dull, characters are like caricatures and not well developed if any at all. This also includes main character. She was an emotionless, selfish, unlikeable psychopath who just wanted to get beaten and raped and she ended up just like that. She never developed any kind of consciouss or awareness or shown strenght at any point of the film.Many people complain that this is a mispresentation of women and it portrayed women as if they want to get beaten and raped. Counter argument is that she was just a woman, an individual and cannot represent all of the women which is true. The key point here is that it's not about her, it's about the acts of rape and violence against women. The acts of rape and violence against women portrayed as welcomed, wanted, desired and sought out. This also reinforce and strenghten male myth that women secretly want to get raped. The film takes this a step further and add extreme violence beside rape. Films, books have certain influence over people even in subconscious. Anybody who watched this film may get that idea that women may like to get brutally beaten and raped and this idea will stay in subconscious, waiting to be triggered. It may never get triggered perhaps but also it may. It is only a woman depicted in the film that enjoys getting raped and beaten but if such a character does exist, then why there shouldn't be other women like Michele? ALso there are other countless films that depict women just like this. Betty blue and Killer Instinct came to my mind quickly. In UK, every 1 in 6 women get raped and in USA, around 1900 women get raped everyday. The sexual assault and voilence against women is a very serious problem in every society. At the end of the day, we all have mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and female friends. This resonates a question, should actresses, directors, producers have any responsibility for people, society and their well beings or should they do whatever they want? This is a long, deep subject matter which i won't delve right now.Huppert's performance was above par but i somehow have grown up tired of her acting. I watched a bunch of her films and she, less or more, plays pretty much same characters with similar mimics. You would lose nothing if you don't watch this film and you would gain nothing either if you do.This film also made it obvious that why less and less people read critics' reviews because they are very unreliable and misguiding.",Elle
143,steppeck,Stultifying. Predictable. Shallow. Pretentious.,1,16 March 2017,"I can only wonder at the attraction of this hackneyed French social satire with its violent rape twist. Indeed I found it as funny, subtle and perceptive as what I imagine an actual violent rape to be. To clarify, that's not at all. The only reason I can score this cinematic abhorrence one out of ten, is the protagonist is female, middle aged and sexually alive. That's where the merits end. She is an emotionless, one dimensional superhero who, I guess, we are supposed to admire for her stoicism. The film is threaded with the post modern reductionist themes of the preposterously realised pitfalls of religious sexual repression. All of the characters are dislike-able. To say I didn't care about any of them would be to give them more energy than I care to. The weakly written caricatures (the botoxed mother, the sad divorcée academic, the steely business women, the cheating best friend's husband, the computer geek with a crushzzzzzzzzz) dryly wind their tedious way through a plot so contrived into cliché as to bewilder. The only real emotion we are exposed to, clumsily at that, is that of the son, whose travails are witlessly shaped into an utterly preposterous sub-plot. I think his story was supposed to be the comedy in the piece. It was probably after the first hour that I became so bored that I wanted to leave, but I was sat front and centre at the superb Clapham Playhouse with some travel bags at that. I thought, ""It's probably nearly over so I'll wait it out..."" I was wrong. There was another hour of pointless meandering events occurring within a dis- believable framework of base motives belonging to utterly charmless ""characters"". How can a film that graphically challenges concepts of sexual violence be so boring? Because it fails to challenge anything. Utterly. Maybe making sexual violence boring was Paul Verhoeven's objective all along, if so, then this is a tour de force.",Elle
144,maxdbarr,Incredible,10,15 January 2017,"Story: This film follows a middle-aged, highly successful woman who's life begins to crumble after she is victim of sexual assault. As she struggles to reclaim control of her life, events play out that challenge her, pushing her to the brink of what she can take. It takes a lot to make an audience accept a character so much that they follow them on such an intense journey, but from the first moment (which is highly dramatic,) you are on Elle's side, and want to see her overcome. While the story may not be original, it is told in such a brutally honest way that as an audience member, you place yourself in each scenario. This is the kind of story that you are uncomfortable the entire time, you want to stop and look away, but you're so engaged that there is no choice but to keep going, and wanting to see this woman overcome.Performances: This entire cast is wonderful, no one does a poor job, but this film pushes the main character, played by Isabelle Huppert, who's performance is mindblowing. She carries the entire emotional journey, hooking you in and balancing pretty much every human emotion it is possible to possess, all in a single performance that addresses such complex situations that it is astonishing to see. The brutality of the story, it's events and it's emotions demand the finest acting and strength. And Huppert certainly delivers that, and more.Craft: First of all, this script is stellar. It balances a combination of brutal honesty, heart-breaking and at some points, absolutely hilarious in a way that can be naturally believed. This script is tight, witty, real, honest and phenomenally brutal. But of course, the best scripts are only truly successful when partnered with a good director, and Paul Verhoeven delivers a powerhouse directing job. This is a man who understands people. He understands what makes people who have been pushed the furthest operate, and he knows how to harness emotion to make an audience be engaged from the first moment. It's top notch. Entertainment Value: As I've said, you are uncomfortable from the first moment of this film, but you are engaged in the outcome of the events, so you have no choice to look away. The film isn't ""entertaining,"" but it is gripping. It takes you places that you can't believe you're going willingly, and in some cases, you don't have a choice. As you watch Elle move through her path, the choices she makes are drastic at times, but you as an audience member understand them. And you're with her every step of the way. Memorability: This movie will be remembered. Whether a good or bad response, this is the kind of film that elicits a response, an emotional engagement that demands the audience's attention, and never lets you go even after the film is over. It asks the questions that many people will often ponder but never address, and hopefully will never have to. This is a film that is either fulfilling or completely disturbing, and will be heavily polarizing. But that is what truly great art does.",Elle

In amongst these main topics are a number of different subsidiary story lines involving family members of the businesswoman.If there is one thing that I will take from this film, it's the use of convoluted plot that so brilliantly grips an audience. Elle also managed to apply humour to serious topics.In short, Philippe Djian created a gripping story that has been excellently portrayed by Paul Verhoeven on the big screen. A great effort.",Elle
146,MindPeriod,"If you're not hooked the first 20 minutes in, leave",5,10 April 2018,"Although it begins with a deep, unsettling scene, I felt Elle is oddly naturally paced, especially keeping in mind the motley of contexts the lead character Michèle finds herself in. The runtime of the film is 2 hours plus, which should give you a clue this isn't per se a revenge film but a journey, a discovery into self.Michèle is stoic. Some may even feel she is astoundingly dignified in her approach to handling the colorful men in her life. These are men that are vulgarly selfish and infinitely wanting: they don't stop with their harvesting at all.I liked the movie except I'm not sure whether I'd recommend watching it. The reason is that I find MichèIe to be mostly one dimensional (except towards the end), mechanical, and therefore unrealistic. Her reactions are too contained and her expressions frigid.If you don't have anything else on your list or have time to spare, I'd suggest only then you go ahead and watch the movie.",Elle

148,aliceflupper,Pretentious pointlessness,1,7 September 2017,"Pointless, irritating, and boring are words that stuck in my mind while watching 'Elle.'The film attempts to deal with a delicate and intricate subject of rape in an ignorant way. Having been abused, Michèle goes on as if nothing had happened. This can be attributed to the traumatic past of her character. Her childhood has hardened her, which makes her psychologically interesting. However, the importance of the shocking event is further undermined by an avalanche of everyday events such as office work, family squabbles, and shallow interactions with the ex- husband, friends, lovers and subordinates. The crowning scene is the Christmas dinner which the victim organizes herself. It is full of uncomfortable silences, malicious remarks, jealousy and deceit which are not funny but laughable in light of the background events. It seems that it doesn't serve any other purpose than distracting the spectator and in turn trivializes the abuse. After all, Michele pays as much, if not more, attention to her dinner guests than to her abuser. Additionally, 'Elle' doesn't have a genre. It starts out as a psychological thriller, becomes a bad comedy with the dinner-party ending in complete chaos, morphs into a crime drama as both Leblanc's parents die one after the other, and Michele sits down with the police to discuss the murder committed in her own house, and ends with a Hollywood happy ending as everyone goes back to their lives and carries on unperturbed.The tension throughout is so diluted I ended up asking myself what the film was about. Did it tell the story of a hurt, psychotic woman? Was it trying to warm audiences to perverted sex? Or was it a distasteful Christmas comedy? (To be frank, an hour in, I expected Will Ferrell to fall down the chimney dressed as an elf.) 'Elle' resembles an angry toddler's doodle-book rather than a film. You could have a look but not necessarily exhibit it.",Elle
149,ershkia,provocative and more,8,16 November 2017,"It is often unhelpful to try to squeeze a film into a single main idea and that is even more true if the film is a good one. But I am going to break my own rule here to talk about the latest film by Paul Verhoeven. Not that I think Elle lacks nuance, but without seeing the thread that binds this film together, the intentionally provocative tone of the film can detract from its merits and push the film into lazy pigeonholes: misogynistic, exploitative, incoherent and if you are looking for a longer list of pejorative adjectives, Richard Brody's review in the New Yorker is an excellent thesaurus.Elle starts with a rape scene and what follows is how the main character, Michèle, deals with this presumably traumatic experience. I say presumably because her reaction to this incident throughout the film defies all expectations of how anyone might react to an assault. After the intruder leaves her house, she gets up, with some difficulty of course, sweeps the broken plates off the floor, takes a bath and orders takeout for dinner. And when she finally realizes that the rapist after all was her neighbour, someone whom she happened to have a crush on, the viewer is confronted with another what-the-heck moment when she, this time willingly, gets herself beaten down again. Let's start with the easiest hypothesis to refute. This film is plainly not about the damage rape can do to the victims, the film doesn't even try to make the protagonist likable enough to get the viewer's sympathy. A revenge thriller with a strong female cast? Surely there is an element of revenge in the film but it is hard to reduce it to a revenge story when the protagonist is drawn to her rapist. A misogynist story, disguising itself behind a criticism of conventional morality to show rape as a common fantasy and not all that terrible in reality? If she, a woman with a strong and dominant personality throughout the film, subconsciously yearns submission, why does she have to ruin her dream came true by taking her revenge at the end? And here is why I think a single main force behind Michèle's actions can save us from this confusion, and that force is not morality, or a sense of justice or shame or anger, or the society's pressure, but the agency to do what she desires to do in spite of all that. What the film is doing here is highlighting agency by taking the notion to its unnerving and sometimes darkly comical extreme. After the assault happens, she is physically hurt but mentally settled enough to order a takeout. She doesn't call the cops not because she is embarrassed or afraid of telling people what happened, she tells her ex-husband and friends about the story in the restaurant scene after all, but why bother with the cops if she can take matters in her own hand? Her reaction is no different every time someone reminds her of her mass murderer father out of spite, she keeps calm and carries on. But why does she willingly fall prey to the neighbour's sadistic behaviour? Is she a masochist? Well, the last thing she probably cares about is we pondering what she is or she is not.This is not to say that Elle should be seen as a manual on how to handle sexual assault, or as a realistic character study of Michèle and her motives. What the film does though, so effectively and so outlandishly, is bring to life not perhaps the most lovable but a memorably strong character that leads her life with the ultimate agency.",Elle

The first image of the coldly distant, observing cat puts the spectator in the right frame of mind. A very clever script that makes every scene count, peak and slice away. A brilliant mise-en-scene that refuses to heighten the emotions or prettify. Isabelle Huppert absolutely shines, balancing all the minute emotional ticks in every scene, perfectly in control. She leads an ensemble of actors that play the diverse characters/antagonists to perfection. The story is actually all subtext, the main plot only used to connect all the dots and leading us by the nose to the bigger picture. The movie is marvelously playful, refusing to be dramatic, cute or opt for an easy way out. At the same time everything is done with great style and measured, cooked to perfection. Curiously i felt like i was about the only person in the audience who was chuckling along with every scene, maybe my dark sense of humor or feeling the unmistakably Verhoeven tone more acute with every movie of this great director i get to see.

152,lralbright1,Disturbing!,8,26 October 2016,"Elle has been making the rounds at film festivals since its premiere at Cannes this past year, with much acclaim and, in typical Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Showgirls) fashion, some controversy surrounding its content. It tells the story of Michele Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert), a successful business woman, who is raped by an unknown ski-masked assailant. Unfortunately, in today's world, this isn't something that's entirely shocking itself, but it's the way Verhoeven's Michele reacts to the rape that will unsettle viewers.The film opens with a struggle that isn't seen. The noises that are being made, however, are unmistakable. When we catch a glimpse of the sight, we see Michele on the ground with her assailant dressed in black standing above her, he quickly leaves, Michele still lying on the ground stunned for a moment before getting up and doing everything a rape victim shouldn't do. First, she cleans up the crime scene and then gets into the bathtub with a glass of wine with an odd look that I couldn't discern the moment that I was viewing it, but as the movie went along, I figured it out.Her look was that of pleasure.Yes. This film goes there. Michele doesn't tell her son when he asks about a bruise on her face. ""Fell off my bike,"" she says as she continues about her evening as if nothing happened. It isn't until later, at dinner that she tells a group of people, including her ex-husband, that she 'supposes' she was raped.Her odd behavior is given a backstory. Her father, Charles Leblanc, was a serial killer who killed a number of people in their town and it's even suggested that ten year old Michele may've participated in this horrific act.As the film continues, a thread of dark comedy surfaces; Michele goes to the doctor to get an STD panel. ""Are you concerned about a recent exposure? I can give you some PEP?""""Nah. I'll just roll the dice.""She looks at a co-worker's outfit, similar to that of her assailant. She gives her co-worker that same look she had in the bathtub. ""I like your outfit.""It's safe to say, this isn't a typical film about rape, and those who are sensitive to this topic probably should avoid it. It's slated to have an awards friendly November release date, most likely for Isabelle Huppert's fantastic performance, but I'm not sure how awards bodies are going to take to this. A French movie about rape from the point-of- view of a woman who enjoys it? How on earth does someone sell that?",Elle

It makes me think that the theme of rape treated by a man is just not doable--unless he has himself been raped!! NO RAPED WOMAN GOES TO DINNER AND ANNOUNCES matter-of-factly pass me the bottle of wine and by the way i just got raped. It often takes weeks, months, or years to recover. I came out of this movie upset, because i thought that is the line of conduct that is prescribed for the women to come???

Here it is made entertainment--it had nothing to do with Basic Instinct that was a top movie. ELLE is a flop--with a lot of money and bad taste backing it... This 'coldness of being' is setting an example for the youth; let's not forget it. No one wants to make friends with the rapist--even if it is to take a revenge.

In Paul's movie, - it's the second shot.And it's rape! Then the plot gets thicker and thicker with every scene. It's like pretty normal life of adult woman at start, but DAMN is there a lot going on! And it's hard to say if she normal after all. So, you might think that's it's hard to swallow one. But the smooth tone of the movie really helps to get over it painlessly.The cast works well with their characters. And I'm sure the team must be great on such a project.

156,frank14,This is not one of the 'clever' reviews.,1,2 August 2017,"This film is nothing but pro-rape propaganda. A middle class, intelligent, confident woman is violently raped by a masked home invader... and she is fine with it and enjoys it, as the same rapist breaks into her home and brutally rapes her again and again. This movie encourages rape like nothing I've ever seen, and there is NO possibility that it *hasn't* directly caused the rape of many dear women--our mothers, sisters, and daughters. Those who have given 'clever' positive reviews to this film are equally guilty as its makers. A Golden Globe Award goes to the pro-rape propaganda Elle. A Critics' Choice Movie Award goes to the pro-rape propaganda Elle. A César Award goes to the pro-rape propaganda Elle. Many 'clever' people are going to burn in hell.",Elle
157,timbercrew-223-320228,The good old Paul,9,4 June 2016,"""Elle"" means ""She"" - the whole movie is seen through the eyes of the character played by Isabelle Huppert, a woman being victim of an aggression in the first scene of the film.From there you will probably be unable to predict the plot, as its structure doesn't follow the rules we've been used to. At one point during the screening I thought the movie would end soon but it went on and was still engaging. At first you might think it's just a thriller but the writing has more to offer and deploys in original ways.Isabelle Huppert delivers a great performance playing a strong female character, something quite rare in movies.The film can be quite shocking, but never gratuitous. Verhoeven's ability to balance a serious drama with his usual ""funny"" ways is thought provoking without being ponderous. This dynamic was always Verhoeven's strength, even in this kind of more ""auteurish"" work.Don't await slick Hollywood style here, but a somewhat dark & gritty satire on human relationships.Loved it, can't wait for Verhoeven's take on Jesus",Elle
158,owen_kane-99775,Tried too hard to be subversive,3,2 May 2020,"I had read a lot of reviews before watching, which may have set my expectations too high. The protagonist is rather flat, and delivers an almost robotic performance. Throughout the film it is hinted that she aided her father in gruesome murders as a young girl, though it is never revealed whether she was involved or not. I felt that the inclusion of this was rather anti-climactic & the film would have truly benefited from a plot twist (e.g. she participated in killing the animals/ children) If this was the case, it would explain much more why her demeanour throughout the film felt very detached and lacked emotion (I refer to her mother's death & her opinions of her sons ""child"")Very unsure of wether Elle, to some degree enjoyed her sexual relationship with her neighbour/rapist. Whilst I understand this film has tried to be transgressive, it does not succeed.The ending was terrible. The fact that she now accepts her son & approves of his girlfriend and they are shown to be a happy family simply because he killed her ""rapist"" was highly implausible. The premise of the storyline had such potential, but sadly failed to deliver.",Elle
159,subintegral,(SPOILERS) The worst movie you could watch to ruin an evening!,1,2 December 2017,"I ended up writing an essay about how much I hated this movie and IMDb forced me to trim my review down. I started again, but let me be as concise and clear as I can be: don't watch this movie. It's so awful.1. It makes no sense at all. The characters are capricious and not in a fun, loving way. They are frustratingly stupid and moronic. You cannot connect with any character or feel empathy for them. I don't feel sorry for Michele basically asking to be raped. If she goes down into a basement alone and desires sex (as she admits at the end of the movie, getting laid was part of her goals), I can't feel sorry for her when she is treated badly. I lost any sense of feeling sorry for the character.2. The worldview is negative and idiotic. Everyone is apparently deaf, dumb and blind. Her mother ends up dying... just like that. The baby born two times darker than Vincent doesn't strike him as odd. It's silly and stupid.3. It won't leave you feeling educated, inspired or happier. It's a waste of time. You won't get anything but a massive headache, which I did get. I took a painkiller (wish I was joking), because the headache from that movie was intensely painful.I hope that no one wastes their time on this trollop. It's the worst movie I have seen to date. Again, I wish I was joking, but I have never seen anything this bad. This takes the cake, except the creepy neighbor will probably rape the cake according to this movie's standards.There are good French films out there if you want to find something fun to watch on Netflix. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",Elle

161,RyanNanni,Story is a missed opportunity,3,23 December 2016,"Look, I'm not even going to engage the question of whether this movie is essentially misogynist or not. I'm going to take the film at face value. Because I actually enjoyed the first third of the movie immensely. Isabelle Huppert's performance is fantastic and compelling, the concept of a woman dealing with a violent rape by sitting back and methodically preparing to take her revenge, and the way she treads through the male world she lives in are all compelling ideas!But the story is a train wreck! And not in an enjoyable way!The first engine of the movie is Elle's mission to track down her rapist. Very compelling.Then we get this backstory that her father was a mass murderer. Also interesting enough to keep me watching. But not tied in to the rest of the movie in anyway whatsoever. It almost seems random.And then some very boring subplots about her whiney son and his obnoxious girlfriend, and some casual relationships with the other people in her life. No tension driving those subplots.And then! *spoiler alert*She discovers her rapist, it's the neighbor she has a crush on! Wow, interesting! The person she's been trying to track down this whole time! But then, she seemingly doesn't care at all! She lets him go, gets into a random car rack which he saves her from for some bizarre reason, she continues to hang out with him, he rapes her again but it's bizarre because the movie plays this like it's a bad thing but she also wants it maybe? Not clear. And then he tries to rape her again in the end which is totally undramatic at this point because she's totally given up on trying to stop him from raping her.The last third of the movie lacks tension or any compelling conflict at all. This could've been a good movie. :(",Elle

It plays like an inside view of the moral depravity of the Democrat and Republican parties. The cast is first rate and Huppert's performance is exquisite - if wasted. As the protagonist she is completely unlikable. The attacker is played as marginally more human than the attack victim. Every possible universally held value is destroyed.

""Elle"" reminds me of the romantic intensity of Verhoeven's early works (i.e. ""Turkish Delight""), and I was truly captivated by the storyline throughout. As well, the film is paced with the expertise of a master, never forgetting atmosphere and the beauty of location along the way. The photography of this piece is gorgeous, lots of deep blacks and blues offering a sullen landscape on which Elle must travel in her search for revenge and love. Laurent LaFitte is a strong male counterpart in the film. There's some wonderful three-dimensional personalities among the characters. All are believable.

Isabelle Huppert is directed in a revenge thriller about an even more Basic Instinct. I am surprised because Michele as a rape victim is far from predictable, she refused to report the rape to the police. In fact, after cleaning up and taking a bath, she pretty much continues life as usual. Michele has a complicated personality because of affecting by shocking background related to her father who brutally killed the ordinary people and his neighbors. I can't remember recent movies like Elle with so much plot, so many things going on. Each scene relies on more incident, more different argument. Elle is not a particularly story about rape, but it asks questions about social interaction. > P.S: My favorite scene is when the camera takes the cat's eye view on the rape scene.",Elle

171,AaronLivingston1,A Great Thriller from Mr. Verhoeven,8,5 January 2017,"This was a movie that did a great job of keeping me engaged for the entirety of the film despite a couple small things. Firstly, it is decidedly harder to pick up on the nuances of the film if you are relying on the subtitles. Secondly, the side plots that go hand-in- hand with the main story line suffer from some convolution. That being said, the film wrapped up nicely with a dramatic statement on main character herself.Isabella Huppert was incredible in her role. By far my favorite performance from a female this past year. Her depiction of a independent and calculating woman was Oscar-worthy.The movie sets a tone of uneasiness from the beginning. The main plot device of brutal rape serves as a reminder that people can suffer unimaginable happenings in the human condition.Elle did a wonderful job of making me question the origins of the main character. As the movie develops and the relationships between the characters continue to grow, we learn more and more about the intentions and nature of her being.This was a fantastic addition to Mr. Verhoeven's filmography.

I think a lot of Americans just view French folk as aloof and a bit mysteriously sexy, and this movie panders to that sort of conception. That said, it forces actions on people that are totally nonsensical. 1. She gets raped, realizes that she enjoys the experience, and then proceeds to get raped and re-raped a bunch of times because that's apparently what happens when you're attracted to your rapist and the power play dynamic? WHAT?! This makes no sense.2. Then, to get out of this little situation she's created, she has her emasculated son kill the rapist, under the guise that this will make him feel like a hero and will help him grow a pair. Also, his girlfriend with whom he has a child, also magically goes from being a total bitch to a somewhat tolerable human being. Right. Am I the only person who is outraged by the fact that people like this movie? I mean, the fact that it's getting good ratings is making me question everything in my life. Do I have the right job? Am I married to the right person? Is my car actually green?I don't know what's happening. Please help. And DON'T watch this impossibly stupid movie.",Elle

Those are misleading. If the larger public saw this film rather than just critics and film snobs (myself included) there would be outrage. I'm not upset about including a rape scene. I'm not even upset about Michele's character reacting so calmly afterwards. This is actually common in rape victims, and sometimes it's important to show things like this to educate people on the experience of survivors of sexual assault. What upset me, was when the film turned about halfway through to Michele enjoying the rape and encouraging it. This is not a reaction any sexual assault victim I have ever known would have. Maybe a few do, but when you take on a subject as serious as rape in your film, I do think part of your responsibility is in educating people on what that experience is like to create more empathy. This film did not do that, and I cannot say enough how outraged I am that this film decided to sexualize rape. Great acting Isabelle, but this film should have never been made.",Elle
177,bridgeemailimdb,A fable on the inheritability of Violence and its impact on intimacy,7,4 December 2016,"There are many clues in this movie that point to the fact that it is a fantasy-fable. Many little events throughout are odd and seemingly irrelevant to the plot's unfolding. They are just weird.First among these oddities is when Michelle takes a bath after being raped. From the white foam of the bath, blood emerges. While this is certainly a sign of the brutality of the act she has been a victim of, it is also clearly, a symbol of lost virginity. Odd! Again, long before she knows that her neighbor is her attacker, Michele has a strong attraction to him.In the courtyard of the hospital in which her son's girlfriend just had a baby, Michele confesses something very strange to a nurse. This hospital nursery is where she met her friend Anna. Anna had lost her baby the same day she had her son, and Michele accepted that Anna breast feed her boy. Really strange! What does this have to do with the story? But wait, Michele's grandson who was just born in the hospital is black. Yet, his putative parents are white. Strangely again, a friend of the young couple is present to see the newborn. This friend is black. Of course, everybody notices the genetic oddity. That is, except Michele's son who is oblivious to the fact.What is the meaning of this twin hospital scene. Is Michele's son really her son? Could she possibly be a virgin, as maybe hinted by the bath scene? Hold on! This does not make sense. We see Michele engaging in sexual activities. How could she be a virgin? She is having an affair with her friend Anna's husband after all.Well. That is true, but none of the activities shown involve intercourse.The only time we see her having intercourse with her friend's husband is after the rape scene. And, in that scene, she is playing dead, oddly acting as if she was a corpse. Weird game. Who does this kind of thing? And most importantly, what could this have to do with the story? At one point towards the end of the story, Michele confesses to her friend Anna that she has been having an affair with her husband. Later on, as Anna confronts her, Michele strangely admits that she did this very casually, because the occasion presented itself. Then she adds that this is not the worse of it. That the worst of it is that she willed it, or did not find the will not to do it (I can't recall). Like the proverbial scorpion that stings the frog who is helping it cross the river.Michele is fully aware of the violence she has been the victim of, which she inherited from her father. She knows how it has transformed her. She despises her father and her mom who forgives him. She probably regards her mom as an accomplice.Michelle knows evil. The power she has in the workplace and in her relations with others comes from her familiarity with violence. She can be violent, and yet remains perfectly courteous and likable.But of course, the price of this power is her inability to experience any sort of intimacy: with others, with herself and, dare we say, with God. She knows the curse that entangles her, but she cannot escape it.She manifests her frustration with little acts of cruelty, like the destruction of her cash-poor ex-husband's car. (He is the exact opposite of what she is: an idealist who has been dealt something very different by life. What she received in violence, he clearly received in innocence or love.) She resembles the cat that can't help playing with the sparrow that was knocked down to the ground after it hit her window.The only way Michelle can relate to others is a with a very French cynicism - the typical godless, hedonistic mood that binds the French elite.So it is no wonder that when she meets a man who is as infused with violence as she his - her neighbor and rapist - she is troubled. A form of dance unfolds between the two of them. Intimacy at last? But as the dance evolves and becomes more dangerous, justice ""somewhat"" prevails. Her assailant is killed by her son when the neighbor tries once again to rape her. Crime cannot remain unpunished. Even if she clearly enjoys seeing the monster go down and may have enjoyed the dance.Michele regains a bit of her humanity. Her relation with her son and daughter-in-law are normalized.She even lets herself be humbled by a conversation with the wife of her assailant... When she realizes that the pious Catholic wife of the ""monster"" knew all along about her husband's misdeeds.Michele must have told herself: ""Yes Michele. You are not alone to know the cost of evil. Time to stop being so self-centered..."" Great fable about violence and intimacy. The European take on ""a history of violence"". Not as polished as a Hollywood flick, but nuanced and smart. What a relief from men wearing tights and punching each other in the face.",Elle

180,FarnoReviews,Unimpressed,2,21 October 2017,"Greetings, fellow film watchers...I just didn't buy into this film at all, though I genuinely did try to (at first)...As if someone who is that capable and professional and 'together' as Michelle appears to be, gets raped by her neighbor, no less, and then lets it go on/enjoys it, has dinner with him etc...I disagree with the other reviews saying it's all about sexuality etc etc...Rape is rape, and it's horrible, and there is no way that character would have tolerated it, let alone engaged with it further.I found the whole thing stupid and unbelievable. I'm giving 2 out of 10 purely for the actors' performances, but seriously, there was a lot of unbelievable stuff going on with that narrative.Umm... Vincent had a dark-skinned baby, and never thought to question it? Don't give me some philosophical theoretical thing saying he was in denial. NO ONE is that stupid. Michelle's best friend, asking to move in with her after knowing that Michelle slept with her partner? LOL...Fault of the writers, perhaps?Either way, this film contributes nothing to society. Just because it's French, doesn't mean it's cool...It's a shame, because I'd heard a lot of good stuff about this movie, and I set my Sunday aside to watch it. What a waste of a day...PS: daughter of a mass murderer - and not damaged at all, to the point where she is the head of gaming company? LOL... In my respectful opinion, it's totally stupid, apart from the brilliant acting/directing....Just my two cents...Go well, fellow film watchers...farno",Elle
181,beckyhiggins-29000,What an unconvincing pretentious loads of nonsense!,2,8 February 2018,"Having read many reviews on this film, it's fair to say Elle splits opinions; it's either a masterfully acted, powerful psychological drama, or a convulted piece of drivel with gratutitious sex and violence. I was intrigued to watch this after reading some of the reviews, particularly of Hubbert's 'Oscar-worthy' performance, though disappointly, I happen to share the latter viewpoint. This is a film trying to be clever, and getting it all wrong. I have so many issues with this film; Firstly, for it to be a great psychological drama there has to be some genuine intrigue as to who the mystery rapist is. Considering there's only really about 2 or 3 possible suspects, one of whose character's is never built sufficiently for it to be him, and another is quickly suspected then discounted in the same breath, it hardly becomes a real whodunnit... more of a baffling why... and even more bafflingly/ troublingly why she reacts like that. Also, why reveal his identity part way through and then have nothing come of it... it was quite anti-climatic (unlike all of her sexual encounters). The (totally pointless) back story of the serial killer Dad is perhaps meant to provide some explanation for why she troublingly seems to let all men, except her ex-husband and some random employee at work, walk all over her. She's presented as obstentiously this hard-nosed women who'll take no prisoners at work and who'll never forgive her ex who once hit her, but then but will forgive the random masked stranger who comes in, beats the shit out of her and rapes her repeatedly, yeah sure that makes sense. Perhaps she's meant to subconsciously feel guilty or unworthy of love, but that's never really expressed and she seems to have no qualms about cheating on her childless best friend and admiring herself in the mirror, so perhaps that's not the case. As someone else has mentioned, it's not just Michelle who has bizarre emotionless reactions to events. Really no-one in the film really reacts with anything even remotely resembling human emotion to anything that happens to them, making it genuinely difficult to relate to any of the characters. Her son seems absurdly dumb, grinning inanely in front of the clearly mixed raced baby in front of his black friend; her friend is oddly calm on hearing her best friend and husband have been cheating on her, the uber religious woman isn't at all mad/ sad her husband's dead, everyone is allowed to say the most offensive things to each other and just get away with it and after one car accident, two affairs, three break-ups, multiple deaths, several rapes and a cacophany of other shit that would bring down even the strongest individual no-one cries.... the whole thing is bizarre!The plot has more stories (and plot holes!) in it that a latin american telenovela. Everyone has some psychological disorder/ lazy stereotyping; the son is a lazy layabout, good for nothing, his girlfriend is a blonde pyscho, her mother is in denial of ageing/ ever been married to a serial killer, there's the pretty pious one, the ex with a thing for younger yoga instructors, the clueless, kind best friend, the sleazy lothario best friend's husband, the token black guy, the list goes on... The most troubling thing in this film is the portayal of woman and what they either do, or have to put up having done to them; Michelle, the main character; receives physical assaults for the actions of her father when she was a child, sexual harrassment at work by an employee, verbal assault by an employee, is used for sex by her best friend's husband - despite callling it off- after a car accident which leaves her in crutches and his response was 'well we won't be skiing' and then plays dead during intercourse, is harrassed by journalists and is raped several times - something she claims she can't report to the police because of her past involvement with her father's crimes, in someway implying she believes/ accepts she deserves it, and is beaten to the point of near unconsciousness. Her mother is used by a younger guy who wants to screw the wife of a serial killer, her friend accepts the betrayal of her best friend and suggests to move in with her and the daughter in law is presented as erratic, unfaithful, controlling and irresponsible. If anyone has pyschological issues in this film, then I'd say it's the director! He has a disturbing attitude towards women. If fact, it's pretty ironic this film is called Elle/ Her, as the perspective couldn't be any more masculine; of course she works making erotic, demeaning to women video games, of course she's letting herself be abused by a stranger, taken advantage of by a friend and showing herself as sexually provactive to a neighbour. Of course all women masturbate over a man across the street moving furniture - or they do Verhoeven's sick head. Of course she's wearing revealing, rip openable dresses and sexy underwear to be raped. Of course she tells her friends calmly of the rape, and then suggest they order food. Of course she has a terrible relationship with her mother, a disapproving reaction to her son's girlfriend and a jealous reaction to her ex's new partner. Verhoeven has made some kind of sick fantasy of his into a film, where this women secretly enjoys being attacked, beaten and raped. The rape scenes are genuinely shocking and if i believe they were done to show the horror of sexual violence I could just about contenance their inclusion, but to me they feel gratutitous and profoundly disturbing to watch, let alone film. In the week in which the topic of male director's subjecting female actors to distressing scenes in the name of art, it's worth again considering whether this is art, or abuse of power. Of course in his eye's a 'strong female character' means detatched and devoid of emotions and complicit in her own abuse. I really struggle to see how anyone can watch this film and view any of the female characters as strong, any of the reactions believable and any of the plot line convincing. Some good acting (Isabelle Hubbert should have saved her talents for a film worthy of them) and good camera work aside, this film is a farce.",Elle
