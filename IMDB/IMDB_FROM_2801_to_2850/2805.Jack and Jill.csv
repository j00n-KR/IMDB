0,MartinHafer,"Jill is, perhaps, one of the easiest characters to hate that I've ever seen in a film.",1,2 March 2019,"Before I get to the review, I want to talk a bit about twins. While the film is about fraternal twins (all boy/girl twins are fraternal), so many of the jokes are about identical twins and how they think and act and look alike. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than any brother and sister....so a lot of the act alike, think alike, feel alike jokes in the film are wrong and the only way this COULD work was if either Jack or Jill underwent sexual reassigment surgery and both were born the same gender. So, for this film, it SHOULD have been about twin boys...identical ones.Adam Sandler plays both Jack and his fraternal twin, Jill. Jill comes for a visit and is about as welcome and pleasant as Ebola. To say she is incredibly annoying is right on the mark! And, not surprisingly, Jack is annoyed by her and can't wait until this visit is complete. The audience feels pretty much the same about Jill! All the scatological jokes involving this character didn't help any!
So does this film work? Good grief, no! The film is currently #38 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and the film has set a record for most Razzie awards. This is because Adam Sandler was able to do something unprecidented...he won for Worst Actor AND Worst Actress!! In addition, it took home Razzies for Worst Picture and took home a total of 9 of these trophies!I think the reason it got so many Razzies and is rated so low is due to two things. First, the annoyance factor...Jill is so annoying and easy to hate that it's really hard to watch the film. Second, in recent years, Sandler has been in career freefall due to some very bad choices and it's become fashionable to hate his films. But is it among the worst movies I've ever seen? Not even close. An Ed Wood, Al Adamson or Willaim Grefe film would be much worse. But in the case of these filmmakers, they spent almost nothing to make a crap film...and Columbia spent a staggering $79,000,000 to make this crap! That's enough money to make an entire list of bad films!! So, while I hardly think it's among the worst films I've seen, it is, dollar for dollar, the worst...and it's a film that is completely brainless and annoying from start to finish.By the way, a couple things saddened me about this film. I find it hard to believe that Al Pacino would appear in such an awful mess and playing a man who is infatuated with Jill AND I was annoyed to hear one of my favorite songs in the movie. I now don't know if I can ever hear ""Don't Bring Me Down"" by ELO again without thinking of this godawful film. I could, however, easily believe that David Spade, Vince Offer and Shaquille O'Neal were in this film...they were right in their element.",Jack and Jill
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, Adam Sandler's worst movie!",1,16 November 2011,"I like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them.As much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad.So why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances.When I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently.Jack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen.The acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say.I was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either.Worse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.Story-wise, Jack and Jill lacks any kind of structure, it all feels very broken and rushed. As for the characters, they are either annoying, shallow or both, I finished the film not only not caring for them but also forgetting them.All in all, Sandler's worst movie and one of the worst(I think only Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star, a movie I saw out of curiosity with little else to do, was worse) of a very hit-and-miss year. 0/10 Bethany Cox",Jack and Jill
2,SnoopyStyle,Avoid Avoid Avoid,2,15 September 2013,"Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) is a successful L.A. advertising executive with wife Erin (Katie Holmes) and kids. He hates Thanksgiving when his twin sister Jill (Adam Sandler) visits.Rarely do I hate a movie. I always appreciate how hard it is to get something done. So there has to be something dramatically wrong, morally repugnant, or societally damaging. As much as it was annoying the heck out of me, it didn't fall to the lowest rating. I give it one notch up from the bottom. Jack is actually functional, and I'm willing to see how Katie Holmes would screw this up. But Jill is horrible. She is ugly (on the inside). I wouldn't sit and listen to her in real life. So why should I sit and watch her on screen. Save yourself and skip this! Even if you're a die-hard Adam Sandler fan.",Jack and Jill
3,kosmasp,Numb,3,17 September 2012,"You should know what to expect from a ""regular"" Adam Sandler movie by now. And the people involved have that attitude towards the viewer too. The ""we-know-you-know-we-only-play-pretend""! Wink wink! But is that enough fun for you? It's something that is tough to answer for any individual. I'm pretty sure I'd be laughing out loud if I was pre-teen watching this.But even when it gets meta on you (Jack/Jill, you'll get it, when you watch it, if you watch it) it doesn't really work. So why and how did Al Pacino get involved? Everyone needs money, right? But he does give the whole thing gravitas. I still wasn't feeling anything particular, but he did deliver a speech towards the ending of the movie, that no one else in the cast could've made look as believable as him. And we're talking about some really messy phony message ... I wonder though how many boys/men will refer to this in the future as the beginning of a beautiful relationship ... to womens clothing!",Jack and Jill
4,jboothmillard,Jack and Jill,1,29 July 2012,"I saw trailers, and I heard that it broke the record for most wins at the Razzies, the original record being held by I Know Who Killed Me starring Lindsay Lohan with eight wins, this got ten - the total amount of categories, so I had to see if it was really that bad, from Razzie winning director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, Grown Ups). Basically ""identitcal"" twins Jack and Jill Sadelstein grew up together as children, but as time went by it was clear that Jack was the more gifted and Jill trying to gain attention in the wrong ways, and now grown up, they hardly see each other. Jack (Razzie winning Adam Sandler) has become successful advertising executive in Los Angeles, married to beautiful Erin (Razzie nominated Katie Holmes) with two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary Sadelstein (Rohan Chand), and they are spending Thanksgiving together, and twin sister Jill (Razzie winning – for actress – Sandler) is visiting. Jill is needy and a passive-aggressive personality, and her irritating habits and overall presence is turning a normally calm Jack's world upside down, and she cannot help but ruin things for most people around her, because her rude comments and loud speaking. She has a list of things she wants to do before she goes back home, including an appearance on a game show, so she goes on The Price is Right, she also goes horse riding and goes on a studio tour, and as her plane ticket is open-ended she can stay as long as she wants, so she decides she will return at the end of Hanukkah. Jack is in charge with helping his client get a big name for a Dunkin' Donuts advertisement, and he is hoping to get actor Al Pacino (winning a Razzie, for playing himself), but with Jill around he is forced to have to listen to her problems too, especially while she is trying online dating. Hoping to get rid of his sister Jack decides to spruce up Jill's online dating profile, and sure enough she gets up to one hundred responses from men interested, she even goes out with a man calling himself Funbucket (Norm MacDonald), but of course he is scared off by her when they do go out. Feeling guilty, Jack decides Jill needs cheering up, and hoping that Al Pacino will be there too, he takes her to a Lakers game, and he does get to talk to Pacino, and the actor meanwhile spots and develops a crush on his sister. Jack was hoping that Jill would leave by New Year's Eve, since he and his wife and kids and planning a cruise, and his work colleagues find out that he has a twin sister, so they extend the birthday party they were throwing for him so that she is part of the celebration too, and later Pacino takes her to his place to pick her own birthday cake. The next day Jill is planning to go home, but Jack's gardener Felipe (Eugenio Derbez) takes her for some fun in the park, and Jack wants to invite her on the cruise so she is not alone on New Year's, but she doesn't want to go. Also Pacino will only agree to do the donuts commercial if he gets a date with Jill, and he was told that she will be on the cruise with the family, so Jack sees no choice but to use his identical twin status, and disguise himself as his sister to do on the date. On the date Pacino really expresses that he really cares for the real Jill, and Jack realises he does care about his sister, but he finds out that he disguised himself as her, and has gone back home to the Bronx. Jill goes into a restaurant feeling sorry for herself, and there a group of old high school classmates are there, including Monica (Razzie winning – for supporting actress – David Spade) who teases and taunts her, but Jack and family show up to support her, Jack does fight with Monica, but they all return home. Back at Jill's house they all make up, and Felipe has decorated the place to declare his love for her, she is overjoyed as someone loves her, and they embrace, and soon after Pacino shows up, in his performance swashbuckling costume to show his love too. In the end Pacino stepped down seeing that Jill is in love with someone else, but he still did do a commercial, where he is advertising and promoting Dunkaccino coffee with a rap song, but he hates it and tells Jack to destroy it and all copies. Also starring Derbez as Felipe's Grandma, Razzie nominated Nick Swardson as Todd, Tim Meadows as Ted, Allen Covert as Otto, Dana Carvey as Scrapply Puppeteer, Johnny Depp, Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal, Regis Philbin, Drew Carey, Michael Irvin, Jared Fogle, Dennis Dugan as Al Pacino's Standby and Rob Schneider as Alan. There are some people who like Sandler and his films, and there are some who don't, I'm sort of in-between, because I really liked Big Daddy, but some of his films are silly, and some are just bad, this is easily very bad, and he deserved his two Razzies. The acting is pretty terrible, Sandler is worst as his female character, Pacino tries to mock his serious actor image but just makes himself look like his career is dwindling, and Spade is awful also dressed as a woman, this is probably the lowest of the low for cross-dressing comedies, none of it made me laugh, none of it is original, and Jill is easily one of the most loathsome creatures on screen, don't bother with this piece of garbage, a stupid comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Ensemble for the entire cast, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Sandler & EITHER Holmes, Pacino, OR Sandler and Worst Screenplay. Poor!",Jack and Jill
5,paul_haakonsen,A fairly mediocre comedy...,5,27 January 2013,"""Jack and Jill"" is another of the mass-produced, generic comedies that Adam Sandler has been putting out there recently. It doesn't really distinguish itself from so many others of his movies.That being said, then the movie isn't necessarily bad, it is just an indistinguishable movie - a plain and stereotypical comedy that he has been making for quite some time now.The story in ""Jack and Jill"" is about an odd pair of twins, where Jill loves Jack and will do just about anything to spend time together, while Jack is ashamed of Jill and tries hard to avoid her at all costs. Having to spend time together over the holidays, it becomes a period of hardship for Jack.Story-wise, then ""Jack and Jill"" was alright, it didn't really bring anything new to the comedy genre, and it was all stuff that basically had been seen before in other movies. However, it did work out well enough and the story was entertaining from start to end.As for laughs, well then there were a good amount of moments throughout the movie that causes laughter and smiles. I was thoroughly amused by many of the scenes in the movie.The movie does have some good names to the cast list, but that doesn't necessarily elevate the movie out of mediocrity.For a comedy, then ""Jack and Jill"" doesn't deliver all that it could have done, and that is a shame, because these types of comedies tend to be nice.",Jack and Jill
6,tavm,Seeing Adam Sandler playing Jack and Jill and watching Al Pacino playing himself was both funny and a little cringe-inducing but it wasn't too embarrassing,5,15 November 2011,"I admit it, when I first saw the trailer of this movie, I cringed especially when that Indian kid hit Adam Sandler's Jill character during the Thanksgiving dinner scene. But having just seen the whole movie myself with my movie theatre-working friend, it wasn't as bad as I'd thought especially with the many cameos of Famous People that appeared throughout the film. And yes, Al Pacino himself didn't embarrass himself too much here. And I got a kick out of what happened between Sandler and Pacino during the near-ending scenes. I mean, I knew the latter wasn't going to get another Oscar nomination here but, really, he seems to be having fun and that was infectious. So on the whole, Jack and Jill was pretty good, if not great, and I had a good time despite myself having some eye rolling moments some of the times...",Jack and Jill
7,edwagreen,Jack & Jill Went Down A Hill With this Movie *1/2,3,2 July 2012,"Foolish fanfare with Adam Sandler playing twins-a brother and a sister. The sister part required him to lisp when he spoke and to make himself heavy, homely and with a Bronx accent no less. Jill sounded just like a ""yenta"" on College Avenue.How did Al Pacino ever get talked into doing this miserable picture? Is he so hard up for money?The parts where both Jack and Jill ask people to convert to Judaism was insulting and totally uncalled for.The part with Jill relieving herself after a day of Mexican food was vulgar and disturbing just to listen to.",Jack and Jill
8,michaelRokeefe,"Loud, stupid and flatulent.",1,12 November 2011,"It seems that Adam Sandler thinks he is Ben Stiller, having enough money and ego to put any kind of crap on film and call it a movie. And somewhere there is a thinking that dressing over-the-top in drag is funny. Jack Sadelstein(Sandler)is a successful advertising man that is trying to wrangle Al Pacino into doing a Dunkin Donuts commercial. It would seem that a lot of this movie's budget came from the over-kill of placement and mention of products. The mild mannered Jack is about to have his world turned upside down when his twin sister Jill(Sandler)arrives for the Thanksgiving holiday. Jack and Jill of course are as different as night and day personality wise; but the physical resemblance can't be ignored. The girl from the Bronx just doesn't feel happy in sunny California, so Jack's attractive wife(Katie Holmes)recommends dating. The landscaper Felipe(Eugenio Derbez)finds chemistry with Jill. But somehow Jill ends up being used as bait to lure actor Al Pacino into doing Jack's commercial. Hard to believe, Pacino actually wants Jill...and wants her to the point of obsession. This movie is full of crude humor that doesn't seem to come across funny. Joke after joke falling flat. Then there is a scene of almost a minute of flatulence...over-the-top adolescent; but garnering the most laughter in the whole movie. Well recognized stars scattered throughout the cast: Tim Meadows, Norm MacDonald, David Spade, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin, John McEnroe, Shaq O'Neil, Michael Irvin, Christie Brinkley and Johnny Depp. Pacino is a total hoot barely beating Holmes as the movies bright spot. If you happen to be a Sandler fan, you will probably bust a gut.",Jack and Jill
9,bevo-13678,Adam Sandler at his best,10,10 July 2020,One of Adam Sandlers worst movies and that's saying something. I watched it on the telly. The best bit was when they stopped the show and went to a breaking news broadcast.,Jack and Jill
10,zardoz-13,Talk About A Drag!,1,17 November 2011,"Inevitably, most popular comedians at some point in their careers cross-dress for a laugh. Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Tyler Perry, and Martin Lawrence have donned women's apparel and kept audiences in stitches with their audacious antics. ""Little Nicky"" star Adam Sandler has finally followed their footsteps, but his antics in a dress, wig, hose, and heels are nothing but a drag. In his latest and lackluster comedy, ""Big Daddy"" director Dennis Dugan's ""Jack and Jill,"" Sandler plays identical Jewish brother and sister Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein. Jack is a married, well-to-do advertising executive who produces television commercials, while Jill is his passive-aggressive spinster sister who still lives alone in the Bronx. She embarks on her annual Thanksgiving visit to Los Angeles, and Jack counts the hours down to her departure. Predictably, before his obnoxious sister leaves, Jill turns Jack's life head-over-heels. Sadly, Dugan and Emmy nominated scribe Steve Koren, with Sandler contributing, have contrived the least offensive but also the least hilarious Sandler comedy. This lowest-common-denominator farce boasts the usual bowel humor. The adolescent counterparts of our hero and heroine blow bubbles in the bathtub. No, those bubbles have nothing to do with soapy Mr. Bubble. So skeletal is the plot in ""Jack and Jill"" that this farce yields few laughs.You might even say Sandler is suffering from a humor tumor. Indeed, the best things about ""Jack and Jill"" have nothing to do with Sandler's cross-dressing exploits. The funniest parts are the pre-credit and post-credit scenes of actual twins talking about themselves. These scenes are nothing short of brilliant. Vaguely, this recalls a similar story strategy in the Rob Reiner movie ""When Harry Met Sally."" Aside from these scenes which have no narrative linkage to the plot, the only other notable thing about ""Jack and Jill"" is Al Pacino. Clearly, Pacino must have wanted to get his funny bone on because he has a field day not only playing himself as a cantankerous actor but also stealing the show from Sandler. As usual, all of Sandler's ""Saturday Night Live"" collaborators--David Spade and Nick Swardson--as well as friends turn up in bit parts, even ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" superstar Johnny Depp puts in a cameo. Unfortunately, ""Jack and Jill"" never conjures up the frantic hilarity of earlier Sandler sagas such as ""Big Daddy,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" and ""The Waterboy."" The predicament Jack contends with in ""Jack and Jill"" isn't so much his sister's annual visit but his most prosperous client's outrageous demand. Dunkin' Donuts has singled out a specific celebrity for their next commercial. Nothing about the product placement in ""Jack and Jill"" is remotely subtle. The company wants ""Godfather"" actor Al Pacino to pitch their latest coffee flavor, the 'Dunkaccino.' If you aren't rolling your eyes up in agony at this plot, ""Jack and Jill"" may be your kind of movie. If he cannot land Pacino, Jack stands to lose the Dunkin' account. No sooner has Jill arrived than Pacino sets out to court her. He spots her at a Lakers' basketball game that Johnny Depp attends. He sends her a hot dog with his name and number on it. Initially, Jill isn't too sure about Pacino, but they date. Most of the humor in ""Jack and Jill"" is the mild, amusing stuff that might have alienated audiences back in the 1950s. Remember, this is a kiddie friendly PG-rated Sandler epic so nothing really obnoxious happens and the happily-ever-after ending is nothing short of schmaltzy. Meantime, Dugan and company throw in a subplot about a lovable Hispanic gardener (Mexican comic Eugenio Derbez) who is always kidding everybody, including Jill. He has his eyes on Jill, too. An infatuated Pacino doesn't throw in the towel easily. The biggest surprise is when Jack decides to masquerade as Jill to land Pacino. This is about the time that our hero realizes that his heart is in his wallet and he changes course.Al Pacino skewers himself with glee. During a Broadway performance of Shakespeare, Pacino hears a cell phone ringing and suffers a meltdown. Later, during another performance, he discovers that the cell phone ringing is his own! While he is dating Jill, Pacino talks about an opportunity to play Don Quixote. The pay-off scene has Pacino dressed as Quixote tilting with a ceiling fan. Pacino is genuinely funny because he isn't trying to be funny. The same cannot be said for Sandler. His farcical female impersonation act falls flat. He plays Jill as if he were in an amateur talent act. It doesn't help matters that both twins are rather colorless as characters. Meanwhile, Pacino isn't the only celebrity in sight. Indeed, John McEnroe, David Spade, Shaquille O'Neal, Drew Carey, Christie Brinkley, Michael Irvin, Regis Philbin, Dana Carvey, and even ""Subway Sandwich"" pitchman Jared Fogle participate in this pabulum. None of these stars can salvage this silly, shallow, second-rate slapstick that relies on hopeless stereotypes and obvious pratfalls. The ending with Pacino and Jack watching the ""Godfather"" Dunkin' commercial is the best thing about ""Jack and Jill."" After Pacino watches the commercial, he tells Jack that nobody can see it. Pacino might well have been talking about ""Jack and Jill."" Altogether, ""Jack and Jill"" yields few laughs.",Jack and Jill
11,Boba_Fett1138,Not necessarily bad because of its humor but more because of the way it's constructed.,4,8 December 2011,"Honestly, with its comedy this movie is not any better or worse than the average modern genre attempt but the one thing that does make this movie worse is the entire way it got told and made.The one thing with this movie that kept bugging me was that it felt like a couple of loose shot scenes, that weren't really connected by a story. It's like they went ahead and shot this movie before there even was a script ready. It's weird and it makes the movie feel like such an incomplete one.But other than that, is the humor more lame or childish when compared to other similar genre movies? And is the Jill character really more obnoxious, irritating and unconvincing than any other forced comedy characters? Not really. As a matter of fact, the movie its humor and characters didn't bother me all that much. It's a comedy, so of course everything is being over-the-top. When you go along with that, it's not all that bad of a ride. It might even make you chuckle a couple of times.One of the things that also really makes the movie worthwhile is Al Pacino as himself. You perhaps would expect his role to be no bigger than a cameo but as a matter of fact he is essential to the 'story' and you could even see he plays the second biggest and most important role out of the movie because Jack and Jill are both being played by the same actor, Adam Sandler, of course. And yes, Al Pacino was quite awesome in this. Most of the movie its best moments involve him and he plays his role very Pacino-like, so all serious and with all of his talents and skills.It's really too bad he wasn't in a better movie than this one. None of the developments or backgrounds really work out for its story or any of its characters. Because of this also a lot of characters are making a very redundant impression in the movie, such as Jack's wife and kids. And his wife is actually being played by Katie Holmes but her role is hardly important at all for the movie.It's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, it just is not a very well made one.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jack and Jill
12,neil-476,"If you are not an Adam Sandler fan, this film will not make you one",5,9 February 2012,"Jack is a successful advertising executive living in Los Angeles with his young family. Jill, his twin sister, has looked after their mother in The Bronx until Mom's recent death. She comes to stay with Jack for her annual holiday: unfortunately, while Jill thinks the world of Jack, she rubs him up the wrong way and they always fight. Add in to this that Jack needs to persuade Al Pacino to do a cheesy commercial for Dunkin' Donuts, and that Al Pacino forms an attachment with Jill due to their shared Bronx background...... oh, and that both Jack and Jill are played by Adam Sandler...My habit is to come clean about reservations I have before seeing a film, and Adam Sandler is one of those. I do believe that the man has some ability as a performer, it just seems that I mostly dislike what he does: he leans heavily towards the crass, the ugly, the crude and the sentimental. Yet I recognise that his offerings find a market.Watching this film in a movie theatre with a moderate audience was an education. The film starts with a selection of twins giving on-camera interviews, and that section is quirky and entertaining. Then we meet Jack and discover how unpleasant he is. Then Jack meets Jill at the airport and we discover why she drives him up the wall (these sections seemed to amuse the young element of the audience: I sat there stony faced, and marvelled at the product placement). Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. Then there is some schtick and they quarrel. At some point Al Pacino gets sucked into it. At one point Sandler is in drag playing himself as a man in drag imitating himself as a female in drag. There is (surprise surprise) a sentimental feelgood ending.I would have thought that this film was completely horrible had there not been a few things which redeemed it slightly. One is that there was no bad language - it is, I think, aimed at families although I doubt whether I personally would regard it as a suitable family film. Two, it was good to see Al Pacino slumming it and happily ripping into his established screen persona. Three, the effects which placed two Sandlers on screen at the same time were well done. Four, a fart sequence proved to be reliably funny. And, five. there were some laughs elsewhere. These usually arose from little quirky touches, like Sandler's adopted son of Indian origin who, for no apparent reason, tapes things - including small animals - to his body. That made me chuckle: little else did, and even the laughter in the cinema didn't last beyond the first half hour.Oh, and after this and the forgettable ""horror"" she was in a few months ago, Katie Holmes needs to rethink her comeback game plan.",Jack and Jill
13,anaconda-40658,Jack and Jill Went Up the Hill to Fetch a Pail of Shame.,1,14 January 2016,"Jack and Jill (2011): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, Nick Swardson, Tim Meadows: One joke farce where the budget seems blown on buying a dress and makeup for Adam Sandler who plays twin siblings of the opposite sex. The title is about the height of creativity. Jack is a family man who reluctantly invites his twin sister over for the holiday and as predictable formulas go they do not see eye to eye despite being so much alike. It is obvious that Jill will drive Jack crazy but not nearly as much as the film drove me crazy. The plot is simple and its big joke of Sandler in drag is not as inspiring or as funny as the film's makers wish for us to believe. Sandler and director Dennis Dugan have collaborated numerous times and only You Don't Mess With the Zohan is their best at this time. Sandler has done well in both comedies and even dramatic pictures such as Punch Drunk Love but throwing a wig, dress and makeup on him makes him look more creepy than funny, and throwing his voice is phony. Katie Holmes as Jack's wife is standard support centre and one dimensional. Al Pacino takes a real risk playing himself falling head over heels for Jill. Jack seeks Pacino for a commercial he is putting together and Pacino seems to be laughing at himself. His final scene at a restaurant is over the top but we shouldn't expect a Godfather type performance here. Then we have a slew of other Sandler regulars fitting in with the foolishness. All in all this film is devoid in laughs rendering Sandler, not Jack, to fall down and break more than his crown. Score: 1 ½ / 10",Jack and Jill
14,FlashCallahan,Caramel swirl....I knew it was you....,5,18 December 2011,"So yes the film is awful, but Sandler must be doing something right because look at the box office for this.But it's nowhere near as bad as what the critics or other users on this site are stating.The film does have no plot though or no fluid narration. What there is of a plot goes like this. Sandler runs an advertising agency, they may close down unless they get Al Pacino to star in a commercial.Jill comes to town, Pacino falls in love with her. Thats it.But thanks to Pacino, the film is one of those wondrous creations like The Room, or Troll 2, which are awful, but have so much longevity about them, they demand to be watched.Pacino is extraordinary in this, and if it was just a normal actor playing a character, it would be one of the worst movie ever made.The film becomes funny whenever Pacino is on screen, because Pacino knows how to be self deprecating and he knows how to overact.Sandler doesn't overdo the Pacino bit though, but doesn't focus on the rest of the film sadly. The rest is devoid of humour, but not atrocious stuff, because you can watch it in awe.Depp gets asked if he was in Duran Duran and he says yes, and admittedly, the last three minutes are the funniest thing i've seen all year.Maybe Pacino and Sandler were watching a rough cut of this movie when Pacino says 'this must never be seen'.Thanks to you guys who have lambasted this movie on IMDb, this will becomes Sandlers cult movie, the movie people will be watching in years to come.Egg on your face for the haters, I think they bumped the box office up...",Jack and Jill
15,phd_travel,Ignore the bad reviews - it's got quite a few laughs plus Al Pacino,7,20 January 2012,I read the bad reviews about how annoying it was but it wasn't annoying. The basic premise has potential - maybe Jill could have been funnier but there are quite a lot of laughs about siblings and twins. The writing doesn't have Farrelly Brothers originality and bite.What you probably don't expect to get it Al Pacino in a major comical role as himself. That alone is worth watching. There is some toilet humor but no more than in Eddie Murphy comedies.Adam Sandler doesn't try too hard to be a woman. The blending of the 2 in the same scene is quite good. Kate Holmes doesn't have a lot of lines - it could have been anyone in her role.

Pacino pitches in a Fantastic, Unforgettable Performance, while Sandler takes up 2-roles, and delivers a really sporty & relaxed performance.'Jack and Jill' Synopsis: Family guy Jack Sadelstein prepares for the annual event he dreads: the Thanksgiving visit of his twin sister, the needy and passive-aggressive Jill, who then refuses to leave.As a film, 'Jack and Jill' will work for those who love over-the-top comedies. Its strictly NOT meant for the pseudo intellectuals, who only have an appetite for Hardcore-Serious Cinema. I won't say I loved this comedy, but I definitely didn't hate it either. Come on, you're not meant to take this film seriously, its meant to make you laugh, that's it! Ben Zook, Steve Koren & Robert Smigel's Screenplay is over-the-top, but funny at times nevertheless. Dennis Dugan's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are functional.Pacino is truly Unforgettable in here. The Emperor of Acting delivers a load of laughs, thanks to his Fantastic Comic-Timing & Undeniably Screen-Presence. Sandler, on the other-hand, delivers a very relaxed & sporty performance. He's good as Jack & completely ""fun"" as Jill. Among other performances, Katie Holmes is her usual self. In cameo roles, Johnny Depp & Shaquille O'Neal are Superb.On the whole, 'Jack and Jill' is funny in parts. Watch it for Pacino & Sandler's Winning Performances.",Jack and Jill
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"God, Adam Sandler is so in love with himself! Why not just call the film Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler dresses and acts like an obnoxious troll?",1,8 July 2012,"Think back to the 90's with Adam Sandler, he was a writer/performer on SNL and had several hit movies. Back in the day, his baby sounds and squished faces were not only cute but hilarious. Now, like all humans, he gets older, but mentally is stuck in the 90's where people found his movies very funny. Now, the strange thing is, Adam Sandler has proved a couple of times that he could be a good dramatic actor. I'm not sure why he hasn't moved on probably because his best friends are desperate for money and he's got to keep his dumb movie company ""Happy Madison"" going, so naturally he writes a bad story with predictable jokes and for some reason he thinks he's so funny, so naturally the movie somehow gets green lighted and that leads us to Jack and Jill. I was warned several times that this movie was awful, but one of my friends wanted to see this movie and rented it. She begged me to watch it with her and told me that I should keep an open mindfair enough, right? I was thinking I was too close minded and I should let go and just have a good laugh. So during the movie, my expression did not change, I just couldn't laugh at anythingI look over and my friend is laughing hysterically. Why am I not having the same reaction? I don't know, but I guess I'm one of the rare people that are seeing the down fall of society with Sandler's movies.Jack, a successful advertising executive in Los Angeles with a beautiful wife and two kids, Sofie and Gary. Jack is incredibly irritated about the Thanksgiving visit of his ""identical"" twin sister Jill. Following a series of problems from the airport to the house, Jack's patience is soon stretched increasingly thin. Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down. Jill says she has a list of things she wants to do before she leaves; she wants to be on a game show, go horseback riding, and do a studio tour. Meanwhile, Jack's client wants him to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. Jill tries online dating, but doesn't get much of a response until Jack alters her profile, leading her to get over 100 responses. Jack feels bad so he takes her to the Lakers game where Al Pacino is supposed to be. He is there and he develops a crush on Jill as he gives her his phone number. Now the commercial is dependent on her taking a liking to Al Pacino.One thing that I wonder: what the heck did Adam Sandler do to these celebrities who make a cameo in the film? Johnny Depp, one of the greatest actors of our generation makes a cameo. Shaqwell, I withdraw my question on that one. But Al Pacino, did Adam Sandler take a picture of the guy luring children into his gingerbread house or something? But given credit where it's due, Al seems to be the only one putting any effort into this movie. Adam Sandler's character of Jill is very close in the running for most obnoxious characters in cinema history. What I don't get is how in this universe that anyone can stand her? She's loud, racist, crude, ugly and just plain annoying, yet somehow people defend her and somehow 2 guys get a crush on her?! Plus I love how in every Sandler movie now that he writes, his character is: successful, ""good-looking"", has a gorgeous wife, smart, witty and everyone just admires him of course. This movie in itself is a big joke and I really tried to enjoy myself, but just have to go with the negative reviews on this film, it really is that bad. As for people like other users and my friend who found it funny, try watching other movies. I promise, there's a whole world of comedy out there that is much better than this.1/10",Jack and Jill
18,Hellmant,A genius comedian!,1,7 March 2012,"'JACK AND JILL': A Half a Star (Out of Five) Adam Sandler for the majority of his career (in which he's been the most bankable star in Hollywood, for the majority of it) has consistently made crappy movies (with the exception of a few good ones like 'FUNNY PEOPLE', 'PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE' or 'HAPPY GILMORE' here and there) and they seem to be only getting worse. He certainly has never reached as low as he has with this film and I hope he can't go any lower. The funniest thing about it though is his films all (including this one) are huge box-office hits (except for the good ones, like the ones I mentioned). They all make over a $100 million a piece and huge profits. He's only making the films that people want to see, is what's the most ridiculous thing about it. Which proves that people love crappy movies. They may say they don't (and make fun of movies like this) but they keep getting made because people love handing over their money to see them.In this one Adam Sandler plays identical twins Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein and the one joke premise revolves around the idea that Jack can't stand his annoying and grotesque sister when she comes to visit him and his family for the holidays each year. This time it turns in to an extended visit and Jack goes crazy trying to get rid of his sister. The craziest thing about the story is that Al Pacino plays himself as a crazed stalker who falls madly in love with Jill but Jill, despite always repelling men, isn't into the millionaire superstar. This drives Jack even crazier as he's been trying to secure a business deal with Mr. Pacino.The movie is insane! It's one of the most painful experiences I've ever had watching a movie. The premise of the movie, in one effect, works because we as viewers experience fully how crazy Jack is going by having to put up with Jill but it's never funny. It's just disgusting and annoying. Sandler used to be funny and this is what he's seriously trying to pass as comedy these days. Honestly I don't seriously think he believes it's funny though. He knows it's crap but he knows that's what people want. He is a genius comedian but even more so he's a genius businessman and that's why he's the biggest star in Hollywood. He knows how to make a money making hit every single time. He produced the movie, wrote it (if you can call it that) with his buddies Steve Koran and Ben Zook, cast a bunch of his friends in it and hired his director friend Dennis Dugan (who directs most of his films) to direct. He made the movie for $79 million by allowing himself and his friends to pocket most of the money and put almost no effort into making a quality film because he knew it wouldn't matter. The studio still made a huge profit and everyone involved is happy. It seems the biggest joke is on all the viewers who paid to go and see it; Sandler is messing with everyone and getting richer and richer in the process. That's a genius comedian!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQaCI5Qk34",Jack and Jill
19,thesar-2,"Jack & Jill, Here's My Bill",1,20 February 2012,"The most surprising thing about the anti-comedic Jack and Jill was that I didn't hate it. The least surprising thing was that I didn't laugh.Much like a small town with an accused murderer everyone knows and it's tough for a jury not to have a set opinion if the trial doesn't change its venue, it would be even harder not to go into this movie without preconceived notions as this movie has been used as toilet paper by more critics than even Twilight. Still, I try my best to have an open mind and every movie has its fresh slate as it begins.Oh, don't get me wrong, by the end of the film – along with it's terrible bookended ""Twin"" coming out stories, as if twins are the new gays – I was not pleased either. It sure was awful and all jokes, if you can call them those, appeared to miss the mark by a six-hour flight. It was almost as if they started with the premise ""What if we can get Al Pacino play himself and ask the audience why he only has one Oscar"" and blindly wrote the script around that.The film had ancient ideas wrapped in clichés and bad characters with even worse dialogue. I'm guessing here, and I think the obvious finale will back me up, we're supposed to care about the obnoxious and sad Jill, but it didn't happen. Make that nothing happened to make us care about anyone. Even Adam Sandler's Jack looked bored, confused and tired thorough.How could he possibly think this was a good idea? Or any of the dozens of cameos? And if I may, I can understand Al Pacino is doing everything (and any project) he can to stay in the limelight, but poor once-great Johnny Depp. I think Johnny just gave up. He said he's made his billions did enough fantastic projects and now will just stop all what made him grand once. (SEE: The Tourist and Pirates 3-4.)The basic plot, and yeah, it's flat-basic, is yearly visitor Jill overstays her unwelcome by her twin, Jack. But, wait! If Jack can get Jill to date Al Pacino, he'll star in a Dunkin Donuts ad and Jack won't lose his biggest client.This micro-thin Three's Company lost episode was sad before it began and it appears even Adam Sandler realized it. The puns were lazy, juvenile – and not in the typical Sandler fashion, I really mean a kid wrote them – and were never said with any conviction. And Al Pacino apparently was repeating his Colonel Frank Slade from Scent of a Woman if he would fall for Jill – she wasn't just obviously ugly outside, she was a beast inside, as well.Some movies are so bad they NEED to be seen, such as The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or Troll 2. Mostly for curiosity reasons. After you read my 10-second plot synopsis, you need not spend another hour and half wasting your way through female Adam Sandler falling down or male Adam Sandler looking more indifferent and sad than frustrated.",Jack and Jill

21,bowmanblue,This film needs a warning label on it,1,20 May 2014,"Okay, so I'm not Adam Sadler's biggest fan. His films are hit and miss in my opinion, but I'm always willing to give them a go (I did recently enjoy Funny People). However, this is one time when I should have researched a film before I watched it. If you look at the online reviews you'll see what I mean.The other thing I should point out is that my 'review' is only based on the first half an hour. That was all I could stand. I'm sorry. I hope I'm not doing this film a massive disservice by not watching it in its entirety. Perhaps it really picked up and I missed some real comic gold. However, from the opening act, I really don't think so.Adam Sadler plays two roles - twins Jack and his 'identical' sister Jill. Jill comes to stay with his family and 'hilarity' results. Unfortunately, Jill is the most annoying character ever to grace cinema screens. I know what you're thinking - you're thinking that you've seen the Phantom Menace and that no one can top Jar Jar Binks. Wrong! Seriously, it's like Jar Jar has had a baby with Ruby Rhod from the Fifth Element and produced Jill. All she does is shriek on and on, in between generally being rude and stupid and insensitive towards anyone who is unlucky enough to get near her.Now, I have nothing against annoying characters in films. If a character is annoying then that's part of who they are. My problem with Jack and Jill is how other characters deal with them. If we meet someone annoying, we stay well clear. However, in this film everyone extends her too much courtesy to make it believable. Yes, I know she's family, but even so, you wouldn't let her anywhere near you if you know what she's like. Yet, everyone makes massive allowances for her, even berating her long-suffering twin brother Jack (who is pretty unlikeable in himself) for not being nicer to her.In short, there is not a rating low enough to describe this rubbish. Do not watch it, it's truly that bad. The only thing vaguely interesting about it is how they persuaded Al Pacino to appear in it. Does he really need the money that badly?http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Jack and Jill
22,MLDinTN,quite possibly the worst twin movie ever,2,30 June 2012,"This is by far one of Adam Sandler's worst movies. I usually like him, but not in this. Sandler plays both Jack and Jill. Jill comes to visit for Thanksgiving and hangs out through the New Year. She is annoying, has a pet bird, and sweats a lot. Jack needs Al Pacino to star in a donut add and for some add reason, Al gets the hots for Jill. But, this is good for Jack, so he can get close to Al.The whole thing was just silly, I mean Al Pacino wanting to date Jill. And Jill is just so manly and has such a whiny voice. It was just silly and not funny. Katie Holmes has a lackluster role in this, why was she even there? FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time with this.",Jack and Jill
23,g-bodyl,Awful Movie!,4,22 May 2013,"I'm a big Adam Sandler fan, but I must say Jack and Jill is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was meant to be funny, but I hardly laughed. It was loud, obnoxious, and a waste of time. I think the problem is Adam playing is twin sister. I could not stand that screechy character at all! I'm disappointed because I really liked his other 2011 effort, Just Go With It.Dennis Dugan's film is about a guy named Jack, who is a very good advertising executive. Unfortunately for him, he has to deal with his annoying twin sister for the holidays and get Al Pacino to appear in a commercial. Will her survive? I don't understand how the great Al Pacino would fall for this tripe. He is a screen legend and should know better. That being said, he did deliver a strong performance. Adam Sandler, though tolerable as his manly self, was completely awful as Jill. He should not have done Jill the way he did because I never met such an annoying character.Overall, this is the worst Adam Sandler movie I have seen to date. It was not funny and I spent the majority of the movie cringing whenever Jill was on screen. I guess the kids will enjoy this, but everyone else will find this torture. My ""high"" rating is due to the saving grace of Al Pacino. I rate this film 4/10.",Jack and Jill
24,ericstevenson,I thought it was a joke,2,8 August 2018,"I first heard about this movie when seeing an episode of ""South Park"" that referenced it. I seriously thought it was just something they made up! I didn't think that an idea this stupid could actually be real! So, the plot is that Jack's sister Jill is coming over for Thanksgiving. It's sad that there are so few Thanksgiving movies out there and this is one of the most well known. Anyway, Jack needs to get Al Pacino to do a Dunkin Donuts commercial for him.As you might have guessed, Pacino falls in love with Jill. It's mostly because they both grew up in the Bronx. This is a pretty stupid reason to fall in love seeing as how Jill is ugly and annoying. We get even more hideous and embarrassing makeup throughout the film with David Spade as a woman and some old Mexican woman with one tooth who eats peppers. Jack has an adopted Indian son who likes taping things to his chest. This is stupid and pointless, much like the entire film.In fact, the kid characters serve no purpose at all. We have to deal with Sandler's annoying voice as Jill throughout the whole film. Of course there's a lot of farts in this movie! Oh, and Jill pooping Mexican food. I think the only reason this didn't get a PG-13 rating is because there were no swear words in it. This won more Razzies than any film in history and while it's not as awful as ""Daddy Day Camp"" or ""The Master Of Disguise"", it's still horrendous. *",Jack and Jill

I have liked almost all of Sandler's movies and I think he gets a bad rap for some of the things he does (much like Eddie Murphy), but I'm sorry Sandler...I can't back you up on this one. This one is almost as bad as what you have heard about it. There are a few parts that made me laugh, but when the best part is a little kid taping animals to his back that shows you what kind of movie this is. On a side note Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time, but the last scene with him made me cringe...watch it and you will see what I mean. The only reason I kept watching was because of Pacino, but that scene almost made me regret it. Overall, a movie I can't really recommend...""Just Go With It"" was much, much better. I give it a C-.

27,vincentlynch-moonoi,I'm one of the few who liked it...it has a heart...but still too much farting,7,28 July 2013,"I don't go to the theater to see Adam Sandler films. I have learned that many of his films are just low-brow to the extreme...full of fart humor (and the like). Then, every once in a while, on cable I'll see one that I actually like. Unlike most of the rest of the IMDb-ers who reviewed this film...this is one that I actually liked...although Sandler couldn't resist one unnecessary scene with fart humor. Grow up, Adam.I actually thought this film had a heart, something not many Sandler films have. And, of course, it's fun to watch Adam Sandler being Milton Berle. How Sandler got so many stars to appear in cameos (e.g., Dana Carvey, Christie Brinkley, Johnny Depp, Bruce Jenner, John McEnroe, Shaquille O'Neal, Regis Philbin)...and have Al Pacino co-star throughout the movie as himself...well, Sandler must be very well-liked in Hollywood. But all these appearances help make this a fun...if still low brow...film to watch.The story, as I said, does have a heart. Twins have grown apart as one matured and became (dare I say it) more sophisticated (Adam), while the other remained a bull in a china shop (actually, also Adam, as a female). Through an odd set of occurrences, the female finds love (albeit not Al Pacino), and the male learns to appreciate his twin sister. There's actually meaning here...in this Adam Sandler film.But it's still low brow. But there's nothing wrong with a little low brow humor. After all, we all fart in private.",Jack and Jill
28,The-Sarkologist,Agonisingly Bad,2,14 June 2021,"I thought I had seen some pretty bad films in my time, but then I saw this one and I have to say that this one comes pretty close one of Sandler's worst. Mind you, I'm not alone in this if the number of Razzies that this film was nominated for is anything to go by, as well as the ratings that I have seen for this one on the various review sites as well. Yet, for some bizarre reason, this film still made money. It just seems that Sandler has this ability to make money no matter how bad the film happens to be, and this one was certainly right down there.The story is about this advertising executive (a Sandler trope - he always seems to play these rather wealthy Hollywood types in his later films) who has an identical twin sister (who is also played by Sandler, which is what actually really put me off the film). To say that his sister is annoying is a serious understatement, yet his kids seem to get on well with her, as well as his wife. She comes over to Los Angeles from New York to celebrate Thanksgiving, and then stays around for a while.The thing is that Sandler has to convince Al Pacino to do a commercial for Dunkin Donuts, otherwise they lose the contract, which will probably send the company bankrupt. Fortunately, at a basketball game, Pacino meets his sister and he falls in love with her, but she isn't all that keen on him. So, most of the film is about Sandler trying to hook up his sister with Pacino to get Pacino to do the donut add.They seem to suggest that Pacino has standards, but honestly, he played a major roll in this film, which makes me think that he doesn't. Honestly, I am even baffled as to why he even agreed to do this film, particularly since that he doesn't seem to be all that starved for roles, not in the way that Robert Deniro seems to be. Yet, here he is, playing a role that is definitely beneath him.Then again, there happens to be a lot of cameos in this film, but that is probably because Sandler does happen to have some pulling power, and as I suggested, he just seems to be able to have an ability to make money of a film no matter how bad people seem to think it is. Then again, I'm sure his luck is going to run out sometime, but it certainly didn't when it came to this film. Hey, I watched it, but then again I'm making my way through as many of his films as I can.",Jack and Jill
29,Floated2,Completely forgettable,1,30 June 2012,"I'm pretty sure it has been said and written many times before, and like other reviewers, I am a fan of Adam Sandler's. I enjoyed most of his other films, but this movie was a mistake. I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with ""Yes"" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career. The whole main plot-line barely made sense. I mean, why would an establish legend in Al Pacino (playing himself) be attracted to Jill (Sandler in drag). I also didn't like how earlier Jill was introduced. There was no build up to her character, and no suspense.If you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free or online, or basically anywhere in which you won't be paying!. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes. It really was a waste a time and one of the worst films of 2011 (if not the worst).",Jack and Jill

I mean, there is no sex jokes that often are served to you by comedy films these days, but still some situations were just too much. And the Mexican jokes were too many on the edge of being racist. Now, the performances were bad also, mainly from the main duo. You kind of expect that there will be some good acting in the film, as there are so many big names performing, but somehow they managed to be as bad as the final result that they presented to us. Finally the film had no story line. Seemed to me that things happened randomly and they just somehow made the best of it.

Burning in hell would be more entertaining than watching this ""comedy"" again. Satan...take me! One Sandler still making outdated comedies is more than enough. To have two Sandlers in the same film is the stuff of nightmares. The catalyst in creating a colossal black hole that will end the universe as we know it. Sandler dressing as a woman to portray a twin sister should be disallowed. Illegal. A crime against humanity. It's not even a case of the comedy being outdated, because I am one million percent sure it still would not be funny. Twenty, thirty, heck make it fifty years. Toilet humour isn't funny (including but not limited to farting in the cinema, violently excreting after consuming Mexican food and explicitly scratching one's testicles). Annoying characters aren't funny. Sandler isn't funny. Two Sandlers aren't funny. Sandler dressed as a female purposefully showing off his masculine shaved legs isn't funny. You see my point. I'm not even going to describe the plot, it would be a waste of a sentence that could be better used to decimate this atrocity. Holmes was underus...wait...wasn't used at all. The screenplay contained absolutely zero laughs. I didn't even smile, not even a smirk. Just large glaring eyes as I stared at the screen bewildered by what I just experienced. Pacino...why? The only one with a worthwhile committed performance, because he was playing himself. No acting required. Although subjugating yourself to an advertisement for donuts where you sing ""Dunkaccino"" does make you wonder why such an acclaimed actor would do this. The last line of the film is ""Burn this! Don't let anybody see this!"". Ironically, I feel the same about this film. Thinking about watching this? Go outside, run to the local store, buy (or perhaps steal...) a copy of the film and give it to your best friend. Then watch them suffer as you laugh maniacally. That'll make for a more amusing time then watching this. Sandler can no longer come back from this. His professional career is officially deceased in my eyes. Goodbye.",Jack and Jill

I swear its like his trying to impersonate Ben Stiller and his WAY better than this dude.Anyway Jack and Jill is definitely the worst film I have ever seen after White Chicks from the Wayan Brothers as it was god-awful. Here he plays Jack a executive producer who is filming a commercial and wants a famous celebrity to star in it. And yup guess who is in his soon to be commercial, Al Pacino YES the dude from Scareface and that mediocre film $imone is IN this film. Seriously???But Jack has to pick up his sister Jill(played by yup Adam Sandler in drag,sporting a Fran Drescher accent which is terrible btw) who is coming back from wherever she/he lives and celebrates Thanksgiving with Jack and his wife Erin(god bless Mrs Ex Tom Cruise herself Katie Holmes for starring in this **** of a movie). As Jill spends some time with Jack and his family,Pacino wants a date with Jill so you can guess what happens in a parody of Mrs Doubtfire gone wrong scenario.Overall I highly recommend you to NOT watch this film. Its a waste of time and the actors time and having Sandler done up in drag is terrible I mean god I knew straight away it was him with the dark long wig and the fat suit on him,and wearing make up instead of prosthetics to make him more feminine looking.0/10",Jack and Jill

This is just one of those movies Sandler could make with his eyes closed. It requires no dedication from him whatsoever and I don't blame him. Why try to change what you do when it is having results? It doesn't matter that the critics don't enjoy his films because the audience seems to keep on coming back for more. I find most of his films pretty much alike and haven't enjoyed one of them in a long time, but it doesn't matter because Sandler fans will continue to support his movies and fill theater seats. One thing is for sure, Sandler has a lot of fun at work. He probably has a blast making these easy movies which don't have anything memorable about them, but sometimes are enough for a few laughs. I think I enjoyed Just go With It a little more than this movie, but I really had a hard time deciding which film was worse. Director Dennis Dugan has worked many times with Sandler in the past beginning with Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and ending with Grown Ups and Just Go With It. They seem to be making the same films over and over again and repeating the same jokes, but Sandler has his fan base and he stays true to them. I enjoyed his earlier films, but have stopped doing so in recent years. The jokes have gotten old and there are many other better comedies coming out these days. I wouldn't be surprised if this film actually wins every Razzie Award it's been nominated for, including Worst Picture.Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) is a successful commercial producer who has a happy life alongside his wife, Erin (Katie Holmes), and two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary (Rohan Chand). They are expecting Jack's twin sister, Jill (Adam Sandler), annual visit for Thanksgiving. Jack doesn't get along with Jill very much although she thinks the best of him and misses the old days when they spent all day together. The truth is Jill is very loud and obnoxious and Jack enjoys his normal and quiet family life. What should have been only a weekend visit ends up being a long one since Jill feels lonely after her mother has passed away. She ends up staying and things get out of hand at times. In the meantime, Jack needs to sign Al Pacino (played by himself) for a commercial and so decides to try to convince him to accept the offer. Pacino ends up falling in love with Jill, but she wants nothing to do with him. Jack tries to use her in order to convince him to do the commercial but things begin to get out of hand. The film doesn't really have much of a plot as we have to sit down and see a Sandler double feature but that is pretty much all I can say about the plot synopsis. I don't see how anyone could actually enjoy this film, but I'm guessing most Sandler fans will like this considering they get to see two Sandler characters. The highlight of the films might be the special cameo appearances as we get to see Shaq, David Spade, Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin, Dan Patrick, Drew Carey, John McEnroe, and Johnny Depp among many others. I don't know how Sandler gets all these people to show up in his movies but somehow he manages too. This may be Al Pacino's worst role to date, I guess he just wanted to try something new, but he looked absolutely ridiculous in this film. Katie Holmes was alright, she didn't have to do much, and her character wasn't funny so she just played a safe role. Eugenio Derbez was the best thing about the movie. His character, Felipe the gardener, was by far the funniest thing about Jack and Jill. There is not much more I can say about this, It is really a lazy comedy, but I can see how all these actors might have had such a fun time playing together and making easy money. I was tempted to stop watching this movie right after it started, but I decided to suck it up and stay to the end. My favorite scene was when Jill was working out in the cruise with the two beefed up men and making them look bad. I really laughed hard at that scene, probably because I was just too bored with the rest of this terrible movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Jack and Jill

36,davispittman,Has its moments far and few Inbetween,5,15 February 2016,"Oh Adam.... What are we gonna do with you LOL. Well here is the film that believe it or not won every category at the Razzie awards, thus breaking a record. This movie isn't as bad as the critics suggest, but it certainly isn't good. It's somewhere Inbetween. Like I said, it does have its moments of laughter, but there aren't enough to make it a successful comedy film. I enjoyed Katie Holmes in the movie, thought she did fairly well. Adam Sandler was Adam Sandler, I'm sure u know what I mean. There were some moments where I found myself laughing. But this movies problem is that there weren't nearly enough of those moments. The other moments I was just saying why is this happening lol. And to be honest Al Pacino made me uncomfortable in this movie. I did not like his performance at all. To be perfectly frank this movie is not really worth watching. It's not terrible, but it's not good. No I do not think it was the worst film of the year, but I can see why some people might think that. Overall, this gets a 5/10. Not really worth your time.",Jack and Jill
37,Mozjoukine,Adam Sandler strikes again.,9,31 December 2011,"Someone explain to me why Pedro Almodovar is supposed to be cutting edge outrageous and Adam Sandler is called stoopid.I look forward to everything Sandler does and he delivers every time. This current film is pushing the envelope in it's depiction of the twin relationship and the way it turns. It gives Sandler a chance to do three (not two) characters, which he aces, and the effects work is so in-obvious that no one notices - Brother Adam dragging sister Adam, dancing together etc. Another thing people miss is the back story, where Sister Adam nursed their mother while brother Adam went on to put together the nice house, business and family.It's really hard to keep up with all the walk ons - Bruce Jenner, David Spade in drag, Santo Sequra. Also love the cockatoo in the chocolate fountain.",Jack and Jill
38,masonsaul,Painful comedy,2,16 February 2020,Jack and Jill is a painful comedy that's extremely unfunny and extremely hard to watch. The plot is terrible and Adam Sandler's committed performances only make it worst and the rest of the cast are okay. Al Pacino is the only good thing in it and the musical number/advert at the end is the only funny part.,Jack and Jill

40,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Jack and Jill (2011),2,6 March 2012,"Jack and Jill is a hideous movie that aims for the lowest common denominator. This isn't comedy, it's desperation and laziness. Like many a comedian before him, Sandler has decided to take on duel roles as brother and sister. When will these people realise they are not Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness. It takes great skill to seamlessly integrate yourself as more than one character. Here all I saw was Sandler in drag. Jack and Jill is about Jack, a director of commercials trying to land Al Pacino in a Dunken Donuts commercial. His sister arrives for Thanksgiving and she is the most horrible human being you can imagine. This was my biggest problem with the movie. There is nothing to connect us with this foul waste of space. Like Mater in Cars 2, this character is infuriating, She has no people skills. SHe is offensive, ignorant, loud, and just revolting. Sandler must feel destroyed by his family in some way, because with this and Click, he shows himself as a decent hard working man, constantly shat on my his family. Holmes is the worst wife in the world, not to mention a bland character. She repeatedly enables Jill to continue acting the way she does. The film tries to squeeze out some emotion, but fails, because we hate this bitch. If she was bullied when she was young, then perhaps the film makers should have shown this. Pacino has a lot of fun as himself, but the only way I wasn't embarrassed was by imagining his pay cheque. On top of all this the jokes aren't funny and the editing is abysmal. One scene sets up a joke, as Jill must find her way home without a car, and then it skips the punchline and gives us one to a scene they never showed us. It's confusing. As is the moment when the movie tried to get laughs from showing the face of Felipe's grandmother. I didn't know why they kept showing her, but once I looked on IMDb, I saw the same actor played both Felipe and the grandmother. This joke doesn't work if you don't know that. The film avoids the lowest rating barely, by having some fun jokes. Such as Johnny Depp in a Justin Bieber T-Shirt, or Spade mocking Rob Schneider. Predictable, crude, heartless, and annoying. This is a film that must be hated.",Jack and Jill
41,Kingslaay,It's pretty bad but not a complete disaster,5,13 May 2017,"Jack and Jill is not a very good film, it is very silly and childish but I don't think it's the disaster people scream about. Unfortunately I've seen worse. A person playing two roles has been done before and often good actors pull it off so that's not a criticism on its own. Sadly Sandler is not really pulling it off too well in this film and for that reason among many others this film is bad. It's plot was pretty thin but yes there was some plot that tried to put it together even if done badly. It managed to have some funny moments with Al Pacino's cameo and Jill being so absurd. Even in his worst films Sandler manages to make silly or stupid appear funny even if it is for a few moments. Katie Holmes was quite decent and seemed to be the only one carrying this wreck of a film. So overall and trying my best to be objective its a 5/10.",Jack and Jill
42,FlushingCaps,Was Sandler was thinking was...,7,28 November 2011,"Saw this film yesterday in a theater about half filled.I will not duplicate the many, many reviews here in detail. I believe I have a plausible answer for the people asking ""What was Adam Sandler thinking when he made this film?"" First, a short summary: Family man Jack's single, lonely, twin sister comes from New York City to greater Los Angeles to visit her brother and his family. Of course, both Jack and Jill are played by Adam Sandler. Although she smiles and says some nice things, she thoroughly annoys everyone at the Thanksgiving table with rude, hurtful comments. This first part of the movie is, I think, the worst, because they made her seem quite unlikable.I believe the notion was to quickly let the audience see why Jack really doesn't like her visits, why she drives him crazy.For the rest of the film, we see a twin sister who is sad, lonely, and who needs to feel wanted. She doesn't realize how dumb and wrong the things are that she says.One weakness in this movie is that Jack, other than having a bad temper, is a pretty normal guy and doesn't do a lot of funny things. It's like he is the straight man to ""Jill"". The character of Jack's wife is given, as I recall, nothing funny to add to the film at all. She was there, but wasn't annoying or funny or really, memorable.The main focus is on Jill, and her attempts to find a man through the computer, helped unknowingly by Jack's Craigslist ad directing people to her computer site. After a disaster of a first date, Jill winds up happening to meet Al Pacino, the actor, who her brother desperately wants for an ad campaign he is working on.There was a lot with Pacino, who was fascinated by Jill and wanted much to date her. Most of the best parts of the film involved Pacino's pursuit of Jill, and Jack's efforts to keep him happy so he'd make the commercial Jack needed done.I thought the character of Jill did enough likable things to make the audience want her to be happy.It wasn't the best comedy ever, but it was far, far from the worst. I thought there was one scene that should have been cut from about 3 minutes to 20 seconds and the film would have improved--the listening through the door to the bathroom scene referred to elsewhere on IMDb.So, to my thought, ""What was Adam Sandler thinking when he made this movie?"" I believe the correct answer is, ""Millions of people in theaters around the country will get a fair amount of laughs when watching."" I can tell you that there were a lot of people, adults and children, laughing in the showing I attended, including my wife and myself. It was reasonably funny.",Jack and Jill
43,Pumpkin_Man,Pretty Funny!!!,8,15 November 2011,"I take pride in liking bad movies. One man's trash is another's treasure. With that being said, I actually liked this movie. I'll admit some scenes toward the beginning were painful to watch, but it gets better later in the movie. To me, Adam Sandler becomes believable as both Jack and Jill. The Jill character was the funniest because she's always moody and very masculine. During Thanksgiving, Jack is forced to bring his sister over for just a few days. She's drives him crazy, and stays up until New Year's. Jack is an advertising executive and needs Al Pacino for his business. Soon, Al becomes obsessed with Jill and tries to get with her. (There are many hilarious nods to Scarface and The Godfather trilogy) If Jill doesn't date Al, then he won't do business with Jack, but he soon realizes that family is forever. If you want mind-numbing comedy, then you'll enjoy JACK & JILL!!!",Jack and Jill
44,ketgup83,Thanks to Al Pacino for saving this boring movie !!!,4,9 March 2012,"Jack & Jill is an over-the-top comedy which is funny at parts but is surely a letdown. Jack is a happy-go-lucky family man with caring wife , beautiful kids and perfect job. His life turns topsy-turvy when his twin sister comes to visit them in the summer vacation. Jack & Jill , directed by Dennis Duncan , could have been better , funnier and probably more sensible like Sandler's previous which had at least some story to tell. Adam Sandler is not in form this time. He simply goes over the top and is sometimes irritating especially when he is playing the female character. The least I say for the direction , the better for you. The screenplay is terrible. The dialogues are passable. Adam Sandler do make you laugh at certain scenes but at one point of time , he just disappoints. God knows what Katie Holmes was doing in the film. The only silver lining was Al Pacino. The veteran actor has small role to play but he does justice to his part. Jack & Jill is watchable only in parts where as rest of the movie is just about OK. Average 2/5",Jack and Jill
45,tim-764-291856,Unwatchable.,1,15 March 2013,"Unlike many - and many who have posted negative reviews here, I am occasionally endeared to Adam Sandler. Therefore, I gave this film every chance - spurred on by seeing Al Pacino of course and Katie Holmes' radiant sweet face always helps.However, after 40 minutes the delete button the recording I'd made from Sky Movies sent it where it should have been consigned, even before it was scripted.Sandler, as the drag 'twin' has a voice that will send armies of rats across rivers and entire continents to escape his high-pitched wail. The comedy, such as it is is more obvious than obvious and never funny. They often jibe at ethnic and taboo subjects but never have the smartness or follow up to make them acceptable.As for Pacino, well, I did get to see him, in a big heavy parka jacket and false beard. Jack, or was it Jill? makes a lazy connection with Osama Bin Laden and our Al removes said false beard and it's suddenly 'Hey, it' me!'. Yes, you can see what I mean.Lazy, boring, annoying and a big big waste of talent. And time. Don't waste yours - avoid.",Jack and Jill
46,tbills2,Dunkacino! I knew it was you. Dunkacino!,5,13 September 2015,"The best line - 'I can smell horny from across an ocean.' The worst part - Adam Sandler can't even do his own jump roping stunts. Jack and Jill saves itself from being an all out atrocious comedy by having a good enough sense of humor and sense of family entertainment.Regis is funny at the beginning in his cameo with Dana Carvey. It's good seeing Norm MacDonald and his date scene has a really funny end. The Indian boy is terrible. Both the kids in this movie are meaningless and terrible. Al Pacino saves the funny day. Al hiding out at the Lakers game with Johnny Depp is hilarious and fun. It's nothing but laughs when Al's on the big screen or on stage. Popcorn!Sandler has terrible chemistry with Katie Holmes, like, Adam, Katie's super sexy man, goooossshhh. Katie's still a major fox hound. Adam is really good in playing Jill and really poor as Jack. Swardson is always great with the Sandman. What a nice comedy career for Little Nicky Swardson.The Jared from Subway scene has some God awful intrigue. Have fun in jail, gooosshh, here's an extra prayer for ya. McEnroe is hilarious. (Not like he was in Mr. Deeds or anything. That would be too much to ask for.) Love seeing Dan the Man Patrick, gooosshh. Shaq is funnier than anybody eating ham and also the most dominant force in the paint in basketball history! (Sorry Wilt the Stilt.)My sandman reviews are way too freaking long. I love the Sandman. I love Katie Holmes. Worst comedy ever?... Noo, no way. Al Pacino is too funny in it. I gotta give it a 5, really enjoyable at parts, really bad at parts, but still, a 5.Hey, homeless hobo dude, do another Grandma's Boy with Linda Cardellini. Sandman, do another Big Daddy or even Just Go With It. I loved Just Go With It. Why wasn't Jared in the scene with the hobo eating the parakeet in the sub sandwich, goooooooshh. Jack and Jill, worst comedy ever?.......noooo. Kids will like it even though the kid characters are terrible. Not that bad. Actually, kinda good.",Jack and Jill
47,spookyrat1,Was Al Pacino Prescient?,2,14 July 2020,"I refer to the final scenes of this stinker. ""Burn this! Destroy all copies! It must never be seen by anyone.""Truer words have rarely been spoken when it concerns Razzie Grand Slammer Jack and Jill. Though it has to be said, Pacino is in the singular funny scene in the movie, which is the rather humorous Richard 111 telephone scene. But everything else ... ??? What were they thinking?This is just a terrible comedy and I'm not a serial Sandler hater. Tootsie and Mrs Doubtfire this is not. All the cleverness and fun of those two great films, is just buried under an avalanche of general stupidity and sweeping inanities.It has to be said that Sandler may have had the last laugh. He's supposed to have been paid $20 million for his goofy twin performances and despite the critical derision, the world-wide Sandler diehards, ensured the movie ended up turning a reasonable profit. It frankly doesn't deserve to have done so.",Jack and Jill
48,Likes_Ninjas90,These people should not be making films. They have only the most threadbare knowledge of filmmaking and even less regard for storytelling itself,1,3 December 2011,"Jack (Adam Sandler) is an advertising executive under a strict deadline to try and bring actor Al Pacino in to star his commercial for Dunkin Donuts. Jack is a family man, married to his wife (Katie Holmes), with their two kids. Yet Jack is reluctant to welcome his sister Jill (also played by Sandler), who is visiting for Thanksgiving, into his house. She is loud, rude and awkwardly behaved but also lonely. Jack has the bright idea of trying to find her a man to keep her busy. At a basketball game Jack and Jill bump into Pacino himself and the man is immediately infatuated with Jack's sister. Jack tries to capitalised on this situation by encouraging her to call Pacino but she isn't particularly taken with him. Early on in this unfunny comedy Sandler's character calls someone out for being borderline anti-Semitic. He tells the man that only he can do it because he is Jewish. Is this self-assurance? Sandler was born of Jewish parents in Brooklyn and that alone asks us whether it's acceptable for the likes Sandler to take aim at his own people, rather than someone else's ethnicity. It's meant to be self-parody rather than prejudice so it must be inoffensive right? The answer to me is no but neither Sandler nor his long-term director Dennis Dugan care. They've made no less than seven films together, which means he thinks Sandler is funny and bankable but not necessarily in that order. These people should not be making films. They have only the most threadbare knowledge of filmmaking and even less regard for storytelling itself. They hurriedly clump threads and skits together simply to cater to an audience that I will never understand: one unconcerned by characterisation, representation, reality or purpose. The only intention this film has is to judge characters solely on appearance rather than action. Jill is from Brooklyn and has a voice so grating that she makes Fran Drescher sound soothing. I had to put my fingers in my ears the first time I heard it. Sandler recycles a lot of the same clichés Drescher embraced in her show The Nanny years ago: the big hair, the excessive luggage, the voice. But this film is straight up mean- spirited. Jill is apparently so dumb that she can't even use a computer. She has no friends or social skills. By choosing to play her himself Sandler immediately deprives her of being a normal person. She becomes literally a joke, without any semblance of charm or humanity. He intends for us to dislike her but for what reason? I think it says a lot about people's expectations of cinema knowing there was so much laughing and clapping during the screening. Not only is the film cruel but it offers little more than a checklist of the lowest brand of comedy. Prepare for fart jokes, fat jokes, vision of ear wax, perspiration and armpit hair. People twenty and over find this appealing? It's dumb, obvious and not funny. I barely laughed once and the belated attempts at sentimental family values are condescending and hypocritical. I took most offense to the scene involving a Mexican soccer game. A Mexican character, a gardener of course, frequently makes jokes about stealing and sneaking into places but assures us he's joking. He introduces his kids who all have the same name and during a soccer match we keep cutting to his grandmother with one tooth, who keeps glaring at people. Pathetic. That's before the other Mexicans stuff huge chillies into their mouths. Also pathetic. I find it sad that in the space of a year we've had no less than two films associate Mexican food with diarrhoea. A lot will be made by how obnoxious Sandler is as Jill and quite rightly too. There's not a positive note in his performance. Yet this will overshadow how dull and bored he looks as Jack. A few years ago, P.T. Anderson took Sandler out of his comfort zone, giving him a performance so haunting that few could really believe that it was Happy Gilmore himself. Financially, Punch Drunk Love (2002) tanked badly and Sandler has never returned to anything as daring. He doesn't even look like he's trying here. I don't know why Katie Holmes agreed to this movie beyond a paycheck because she has nothing to do. And are things that dire for Pacino? He's depressing and his final scene involving a commercial is frankly an embarrassment. Though somehow the old dog draws a faint smile when he says: ""Burn this"". Self-parody? Self-assurance? Great awareness.",Jack and Jill
49,Christian_Dimartino,"I didn't despise it as much as everyone else, but it's not good.",3,8 March 2012,"Jack and Jill was one of the worst reviewed films of the year. And from what I believe, it's earned Sandler just some of his whopping, record topping, Razzy nominations, possibly shared with Just Go With It. But here's the thing: I didn't think either of those films were that bad. I mean, Jack and Jill isn't good. Admitted. But it's not terrible.It's kind of missing a story. But this is what I got out of it: Jack and Jill (both played by Adam Sandler) are twin siblings. Jack is a successful family man, and Jill is his neurotically stupid sister. She goes to visit for Thanksgiving, and obviously, if you can't see where it goes, you might like this movie. Jill won't leave, and Jack wants her gone too bad.Guilty, I laughed a few times. And Sandler actually makes a pretty convincing woman, no offense. But a lot of the jokes don't exactly work, it's way too predictable. If I wanted to see Mrs. Doubtfire, i'd of put it into my VCR (don't laugh at me). Jack and Jill isn't necessarily good, but some of it works. Or at least, Al Pacino, who plays himself, does.

There was no plot to this movie at all, and i hope the terrible director Dennis Dugan doesn't make anymore sequels to this god awful mess. Then later in the movie you have Al Pacino acting like a goofball, and Katie Holmes acts too unlike the way she acts in her other movies. And this one of the worst movies of 2011, i never ever want to see this crappy god awful piece of crap ever again.

51,apryla-58795,I can't believe I actually like this!,7,22 June 2019,I am not an Adam Sandler fan at all. In fact I think most of his movies are cringe-worthy and most of his humor is really just annoying rather than funny but that being said I actually thought this was not only funny but that it was a fairly decent movie overall. I found myself really liking Adam Sandler playing Jill and feel that I could watch more of him doing that character. Compared to some of his other movies this was a little more sedate and low-key. The humor wasn't quite so over the top and stupid like most of his movies. The little kids were funny (why aren't they acting anymore?) and some of the cameos were funny (looking at you Johnny Depp in your Justin Bieber T-shirt) so it wasn't just about Adam Sandler. The Al Pacino thing could've been completely stupid and it was to some degree but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I guess I would say this movie was more heartwarming and sweet rather than Adam's typical inane fare. David Spade as always was completely ridiculously hilarious.The only misstep was Katie Holmes. I really like her (and she was probably at her most gorgeous during filming at that time in her life) so this isn't a slight to her but honestly I think any actress would've been wasted in that role because there really wasn't much to work with. She barely made an appearance and was given so few lines that it was like she wasn't even there at all. They should've just made Adam Sandler's character a widower or something because the wife role just didn't work and Adam and Katie had no chemistry.I don't find much funny so the bar is pretty high to entertain me which is why I can't believe that of all films this is one that managed to make me laugh. I'm not mad about watching this.,Jack and Jill
52,Rickting,Jill comes to stay for the holidays. Hilarity doesn't ensue.,1,21 June 2014,"In Jack And Jill, a successful advertising executive (Played by Adam Sandler) is annoyed because his obnoxious twin sister (Also played by Adam Sandler) is coming to stay for the holidays and a lot of trouble happens when she arrives. In terms of plot, that's pretty much it. This film did something very striking at the Golden Raspberry Awards. Despite 2011 being a truly awful year for movies, none of those other stinkers got anything. This film won every single award and it really deserves it. Clearly having learned nothing from Grown Ups, Adam Sandler plays the twins giving: The Worst performance I have Ever seen from Any actor in Any movie Ever and produces and co-writes Jack And Jill, a disturbing, excruciatingly unfunny, stratospherically inept and utterly horrifying comedy catastrophe that's more painful to watch than funny. The fact that this was even made and that anyone involved still finds work makes me question my faith in humanity. I'm not even going to talk about the positives since there are absolutely none.This is one of those thankfully rare films which has nothing going for it whatsoever. There are no funny moments. I don't mean that I chuckled once or twice, I mean there isn't one solitary funny moment. The acting, especially from the inexplicably popular Adam Sandler playing a boring, unlikable guy and a Bella Swan/Jar Jar Binks hybrid, is abysmal. The direction is rushed and unimaginative. The script uses every single dire joke in the fire joke book and is not only horrifically unfunny and to be perfectly honest, deeply boring since nothing much happens but it's also mean spirited and depressing. What's most outrageous of all is that they actually dare to drag Al Pacino into it. He plays himself and falls in love with Jill. It's worse than it sounds. There are no genuine defenses. There are no rays of sunshine. There are no positives. This is not a comedy. As for one achievement, it is impressive that everyone involved went ahead without realizing that they were making a surreal, harrowing, hideous cinematic nightmare which would make David Lynch green with envy and thinking what they were making was actually a comedy. And it has the worst trailer ever too.0/10",Jack and Jill

I like Adam Sandler and his new and more serious roles, this is not one of them and maybe the lowest point of his films yet.It could have been more and with many good actors it should have been, but it centerers too much on the wrong things and becomes a parody of itself at a very early state.",Jack and Jill
54,willcundallreview,I mean.......come on......,1,7 November 2015,"What the hell can you say about this movie that is good, it may seem like a really simple thing to say but it's the truth that Jack and Jill is horrific. I've seen my fair share of bad comedies, you know the one's where you might laugh slightly once but it has little redeeming factors, well this is one movie that doesn't even have that little laugh. Adam Sandler plays both of the twin siblings of the movies name, Sandler literally creates the offspring of the devil in the form of Jill, not only does he make this high and whiny voice for her but he also just makes her the worst character of the lot.Sandler looks bored in this film and at times it feels like he made this one week when he couldn't be bothered to think of anything at all. Of all the things that happen in this the cameos stick out for me the most with such celebrities as Johnny Depp, John McEnroe and Sandler's old buddy David Spade popping up. Hey I have nothing against cameos in movies but when their in a movie of such low calibre, well you just have to think what the hell did they think this was going to be I mean it's worse than awful, they were just unneeded by Sandler.OK so let's get onto that story, twins meet up, Jill the twin feels bad, wants to fall in love, yada yada yada it's all a mess. You know I could forgive the plot though if this movie actually tried in the comedic department I mean it's just like come on with every joke, whether it's a fart joke or another fart joke, or something to do with faeces this never fails to amaze me in just how poorly a joke can be done. If I had to name my one favourite part it's when anything bad happens to the characters, I just hoped these people in the story would fade away and be replaced by nothing, yes I would rather watch 91 minutes of an empty room than 91 minutes of this garbage can of a movie.I want to add that Sandler has actually gone down in my expectations; I know I know some of his other films have been way below average but to sink to this level, well it feels like an entirely new low for him. The fact that Sandler wrote this just makes it even worse, the direction is one bad thing but the writing is just terrible, the movie lacks any cutting edge material and even then it lacks basic run of the mill stuff in fact it breaks the mill and drowns it completely.So yes Jack and Jill, there isn't really too much to add on this, a really awful movie that should never really have been conceived as an idea let alone a movie. Oh I almost forgot that Al Pacino was in this movie, that's right, an Oscar winning actor was in this movie and literally in one second of his first appearance in this movie threw his entire acting integrity onto a cliff-edge, how he decided this was the right move in his career I will never know, and how Sandler coaxed anyone who appeared in this into it, well it baffles the mind.",Jack and Jill

57,nickmesafilms,Jack and Jill (2011) - Adam Sandler Went Up the Hill Too Far!,1,19 February 2012,"Here's a nursery rhyme: ""Jack and Jill went up the hill to make a crappy movie, Adam Sandler joined in, but broke his crown, and Al Pacino made a fool of himself."" Not really good, right? So, ""Jack and Jill"" stars Adam Sandler as Jack, a rich advertising executive, and Jill, his annoying and obnoxious twin sister (the female version of himself). She decides to stay with Jack for the holidays, but no matter what, she refuses to leave. Now, the torture has commenced. This is not only the worst movie of the previous year, but this is also the worst movie in Adam Sandler's life-time career. This is a surprisingly boring, painfully annoying, and incredibly tasteless, unfunny piece of junk that really tries it's best, really hard. For example, there's a Thanksgiving scene when there is so much dialogue coming out of people's mouths, that it's just not funny. They're repeating dialogue after dialogue, it's completely not funny, and you want them to just shut up. I'm just glad that the homeless person sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner in that scene was embarrassed to be a part of the stupidness, and left at the second. There is so many stupid scenes that involves characters getting hit either in the face or in their private areas, racism involving an obnoxious Indian child, fart jokes, 'crap their pants' jokes, and over-the-top complaining from an annoying twin sister. Who thought this stuff would be funny? Also, Katie Holmes is in the movie as Jack's wife. She's really cute, but she doesn't do anything. Another fine actor that looks embarrassed to be a part of this piece of garbage is Al Pacino playing...well...Al Pacino, who falls in love with Jill, because he thinks she's special. I don't know why! Jack wants Jill to date Al Pacino, so Al can be in Jack's ""Dunkin Donuts"" commercial. Oh, that's hilarious....not! Even if I chuckled at Pacino making references of his only Oscar being destroyed, and reciting old movie lines from his previous films, that didn't help save the movie, though! From the embarrassing cameos of such great actors, a script that's totally useless, to a cast that has no idea why this movie is being made, ""Jack and Jill"" is complete schlock from start to finish. You take a look at Adam Sandler's career, and see the other funnier movies that he has made in the past, such as ""Billy Madison"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Waterboy"", and ""The Wedding Singer"", you start to wonder why the hell is Adam Sandler making such crappy movies these days. From the opening scenes to the end credits, this is one of the worst movies of this or any other decade, generation, or light-year from now. ""Jack and Jill"", in my review, ""Boring, tasteless, embarrassing, unfunny, and a giant piece of crap"".",Jack and Jill
58,TheHonestCritic,Adam Sandler's worst movie?,4,7 September 2021,"""Jack and Jill"" (2011), well, that's 91 minutes I'll never get back. Wow, and I thought I'd seen bad films before. But this one takes bad to a whole new level! As soon as I saw the first trailer for this ""film"", I said to myself: ""this movie is going to suck!"" Sure enough, it did and it still does. This ""film"" is, by far, the worst Adam Sandler movie. ""Jack and Jill"" has an abysmal and cliched storyline, overall horrible acting, and a boring generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, a man named Jack Sadelstein is an ad executive. His sister Jill is coming to visit him and his family. Doesn't that just sound riveting? Yeah, I've seen this boring and overused trope a million times! It's just like hundreds of other films, an annoying family member comes to visit and cliched hijinks ensue. Granted, the majority of movies are recycled plot threads. However, the goal is to take the familiar concept and try to do it better while adding your own unique twist to it. ""Jack and Jill"" has none of that. To add salt to the wound, the character Jill is also played by Adam Sandler! We'll go into more details about that in a minute. Any way, it's about as cliched as you can get, just like most of Adam Sandler's other films. Bad jokes, toilet humor and subplots that go absolutely nowhere. That's right, for this entire 90 minutes, nothing of substance happens. Another thing, the writing is about as lazy as you can get. To ante up the irritation, Jill has a pet parrot that repeats the same phrase over and over again. It keeps screaming: ""where were you?!"" That's it, seriously, that's all it says and nothing else. Really? You couldn't come up with any other catchphrases? If you can't think of more than one thing for a parrot to say, then the stupid parrot shouldn't have been in the story to begin with! None of the characters are likable, even Al Pacino, who plays himself in this ""film"" couldn't save it. Yep, they somehow convinced Al Pacino to be in this ""movie"". I feel sorry for him! How did they get him to do it? Did they threaten him or his family? Any way, the story is cliched, the characters are cliched and the 91 minutes just feels like an eternity. As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad. This ""film"" has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, I'm serious. It's ironic that Al Pacino, who is such a fantastic actor, gives such a horrible performance here! But, the worst acting performance in this ""movie"" comes from Adam Sandler. When he plays Jack, he's boring. When he plays Jill, he's unbearably annoying! The sad thing is, that a lot of the actors and actresses here have acted better in other movies. What happened to them here? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as predictable as you can get. There's nothing in this ""film"" score that's worth writing home about. Now, what do you say we get to the only two good elements in this worthless pile of filth? The only two good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that this ""movie"" came out in 2011. ""Jack and Jill"" is easily the worst Adam Sandler movie, by far. I don't see how his career can possibly recover from this. Yes, I am aware that this ""film"" broke the record for winning the most Razzie awards. I didn't know about that until about a week ago! When I saw that it won those Razzies, I just cracked up. Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't win more than it did! Yes, I do think that this ""movie"" is that bad. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Must I tell you to stay away from this ""movie""? Probably not, because anyone with a brain stem should know how bad it is. When I saw it, I had no choice at all. It was during an airport flight, and I was subjected to watching this piece of garbage. I couldn't avoid it, I was stuck! The tagline on the poster explains it perfectly in one statement; ""it ain't pretty"". At least they're being honest! Any way, for the sake of your decency, avoid ""Jack and Jill"" like the plague. The original nursery rhyme is much more entertaining!",Jack and Jill
59,ginocox-206-336968,A lot of laughs despite a deeply flawed dual-role concept and execution,8,17 November 2015,"I've never been a big Adam Sandler fan. I have difficulty identifying with or empathizing with the characters he portrays and generally don't find the subject matter of his films particularly interesting or compelling. I can't even remember much from the Sandler films I've seen, other than Jessica Biel undressing in ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" and the pineapple gag from ""Little Nicky."" But the good thing about this is that I was able to watch ""Anger Management"" a second time without feeling that I had heard the jokes before. I didn't expect to enjoy ""Jack and Jill"" in the least, but found myself laughing aloud quite often. Al Pacino is hilarious and there are some amusing cameos. Many of the supporting roles are well developed and Sandler is confident enough to work with talented co-stars and allow them to take some of the best lines, even in a bit with an actor complaining that a puppet in a Pepto-Bismol commercial has the better lines. Some of the physical comedy gags are a riot, particularly one in a weight room, one concerning a restroom valet and some of the dance steps. The denouement with Pacino is priceless. This is not really a comedy about a successful man who must endure an annual visit by his uncouth, unsophisticated, uneducated passive-aggressive twin sister. It's a movie about a man who must learn to accept his fraternal twin who is very much alike him physically but very much different emotionally and intellectually, and whom everybody else seems to like despite the flaws that annoy him. The dual Jack/Jill role is good for a couple of laughs and contributes to the theme of the movie, but also gives the movie an underlying creepiness that grated against my deeply ingrained homophobic tendencies. A common movie trope involves a character who cross- dresses and must fend off unwanted advances from suitors of the same sex and/or manage to pursue a love interest of the opposite sex while pretending to be the same sex, all for comedic effect. Here we have a male actor in the role of a female who attracts two ardent suitors. As the audience is acutely aware of the Crying-Game undertone, some of the scenes seem a bit creepy and test the limits of credulity. Jill is abrasive, physically unattractive and about as sexually appealing as the hand puppet seen in the Pepto-Bismol commercial. Personally, I think the movie would have been much better without the dual role and with a female actress playing Jill. Sandler was never convincing as a female and I never believed the interest or fascination of the two suitors.",Jack and Jill
60,rollernerd,DunkaCino needs to be burnt,2,19 October 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy Jack and Jill (2011) where the Sandman plays an advertising executive and his annoying twin sister - yep that's right one of those Van Damme twin flicks. But this is no Van Damme flick. It is a terrible movie. Fart jokes galore and a joke on Atheism people. We do have Sir Al Pacino...why did he make this film playing himself falling in love with Sandler's twin sister character? Like he actually plays a caricature of himself as an oddball who speaks gibberish in order to fool people that he can speak other languages and becomes attracted to Jill due to her being brought up in the Bronx. Other than that, you see him singing and dancing to a Dunkin' Donut ad campaign, which he gives his utmost energetic performance. This movie as Pacino says in the end needs to be burnt. Overall, 2/10",Jack and Jill
61,Chris_Pandolfi,How Exactly Does Sandler's Mind Work?,2,12 November 2011,"How exactly does Adam Sandler's mind work? Has he deluded himself into believing his ideas are actually funny? I'm forced to ask these questions given the disastrous results of most of his recent creative projects. These would include ""The House Bunny,"" ""Grown Ups,"" ""Just Go with It,"" ""Zookeeper,"" ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,"" and now ""Jack and Jill,"" in which Sandler is not only the co-writer and co-producer but also does double duty as the title characters, who are fraternal twins. Imagine the work that must go into making this; Sandler had to be put into makeup for the female role, do all scenes with that character, then do all of the scenes with the male character, and then both versions of himself had to be digitally composited into the shots. In both instances, he had to react to a person who wasn't actually there.But what does all this effort count for in something this unendurably bad? If you can visualize the experience of listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, that's pretty much what watching this movie is like. It's a grating, strained, hopelessly unfunny comedy. It's being geared towards families, and yet every scene shows no indication that it was geared for any potential audience – with the possible exception of die-hard Sandler fans, who are truly devoted if they think seeing this will be worth the time and money. Its basically sound premise is ruined by the decision to have Sandler play both lead roles; as a woman, he could not be less convincing even if he had a neon sign over his head rhythmically blinking, ""I'm really a man!"" His proportions are all wrong. He looks grotesque.The Jill character is shrill, offensive, and annoying. This is exactly why Jack, a successfully Los Angeles commercial producer, dreads having her visit every year for Thanksgiving. She typically stays for just one weekend, which Jack has learned to grin and bear. But this year is different; since their mother died, Jill has no family left in the Bronx, and she now wants to stay with her brother and his family all the way through Hanukah, perhaps even through New Years. Jack is, of course, vehemently opposed to this idea. The same cannot be said of his wife, a perpetual go-between named Erin (Katie Holmes), and their children, Gary and Sofia (Rohan Chand and Elodie Tougne). They like Jill so much, you can't help but wonder if all three of them are either in denial or insane. Perhaps it's a little bit of both. Take Gary, the adopted Indian boy; he has a strange compulsion to tape things to his body, including salt shakers, cooked lobsters, and living birds.In a jaw-dropping subplot, Jack seeks out Al Pacino in the hope that he will endorse a new line of Dunkin' Donuts coffee products. Yes, he finds the Oscar-winning actor, who plays a caricature of himself, but that isn't the joke; Pacino falls head-over-heels in love with Jill, and spends the rest of the film trying to woo her. All eventually leads to him performing a rap solo and dance number. Let me reiterate that this movie features Al Pacino. You know, the ""Godfather"" trilogy? ""Dog Day Afternoon""? ""Scarface""? ""Scent of a Woman""? ""Serpico""? ""...And Justice for All""? ""Author, Author""? The astounding reality that he accepted the offer to be in this movie is second only to the considerable work he puts into his role. My God, he actually took this seriously.Apart from Pacino, we're treated to a host of other cameo appearances. Some are understandable, like Dana Carvey, Norm MacDonald, The Sham-Wow Guy, and David Spade (who, incidentally, also appears in drag). Others are just as unbelievable as Pacino. These would include Regis Philbin, Shaquille O'Neal, and Drew Carrey. Topping the list is Johnny Depp. Yes, Johnny Depp appears in this movie, too. At this point, he no longer has to be ashamed by his years on ""21 Jump Street."" Even though his screen time adds up to less than two minutes, this will be a hard one to live down.The film is bookended by testimonials given by real life identical twins, who bounce biting remarks off each other before professing their love for one another. Did the filmmakers conveniently forget that the main characters are not identical twins, but fraternal, since one is male and the other is female? Never mind. It's more than amazing to me that movies like ""Jack and Jill"" get made. It's actually kind of disturbing. Movies like this are comedic dead zones that play to the lowest common denominator in a desperate attempt for laughs. In the course of this movie, Jill will do all manner of broad slapstick routines, including crushing a horse, getting into a barroom brawl with a rival woman (played by a man), and repeatedly whack an elderly Mexican woman (again, played by a man) in the head. And yes, she will inevitably go to the bathroom with the runs, and we will have to listen as the sounds of explosive diarrhea fill the theater.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Jack and Jill

63,troy-manatunga,Sandlers Worst!,2,1 May 2012,"Jack and Jill Sadelstien are twins with very different lifestyles. While Jack is a wealthy commercial advertising director who runs his own company and has beautiful family with a gorgeous wife (Katie Holmes) Jill is a small town girl who grew up and lived with her mother all her life. Jill has not had any luck in her love life and is in some sorts quite clingy and needy and has very peculiar behavior patterns. Jacks largest client Dunkin Donuts is on the verge of a branding revamp and demands that Jack secure Al Pacino for the upcoming advertising campaign or they will cease all business with Jacks Company. Academy award winner Al Pacino does not do commercials! Meanwhile Jill visits Jack for the holidays and as usual is welcomed by the whole family except her own brother who find her disturbingly annoying. The story quite boringly rolls through until Jill happens to meet Al Pacino at a Lakers game and he falls in love with Jill head over heels. Adam Sandler is a talented Hollywood celebrity who isn't afraid of taking risk with his movies. Maybe that is because it is said that irrespective of the success rate of the movie he is guaranteed a 20 million dollar paycheck for his appearance in a lead role. How true that is I do not know. Even for Sandler JACK & JILL is an all-time new low. Being married to Hollywood's main man Tom Cruise did not save Katie Holmes from this disaster. The script was horrible and what's worse Katie's acting is equally on par. Long gone are the days of her cute smile wins the hearts of viewers like in DAWSONS CREEK. I am still a huge fan and I adore her work, but this is one of the hardest movies I have sat through this summer. The after taste of how bad it is still lingers at its memory.The only saving grace for JACK & JILL are the Nick Swardson appearances, he isn't all that great, but clearly if there is even one chuckle in the movie, it comes from him. It's surprising how Sandler didn't write one good line for him since the screen play is done by himself. The character of Jill can be assumed to have been the big comedy Dennis Dugan focused on. The joke ironically is on director Dugan himself. Sandler's portrayal of Jill is nothing but annoying, it isn't acting but more of shouting. In an attempt to differentiate the male from the female, Sandler stretches his voice a bit too much. Now I agree that there is a thin line between love and hate, JACK & JILL crosses that line! I simply loathe myself for wasting my time on even writing this down. Someone needs to warn you folks.This being said, JACK & JILL won 10 awards overall for this production. Surprising? Not at all!!!!!! For those of you who are not familiar of the Golden Raspberry Awards, it is ceremony held to honor the worst movies of the year. JACK & JILL along with the cast set a record breaking high of securing 10 awards early this April. Don't say I didn't warn you.TITLE: JACK & JILL DIRECTED BY: DENNIS DUGAN STARRING: ADAM SANDLER, KATIE HOLMES, NICK SWARDSON, David SPADE, ROHAN CHAND, ELODIE TOUGNE and AL PACINO RATED: PG RATING: 02/10 91 MINUTES",Jack and Jill
64,Bravesfan17,Not that bad,6,14 November 2011,"Yes, I said it. Jack and Jill is not that bad. It does have a lot of dumb humor, but that what makes it funny. Yes, it does look a lot like a movie George Simmons (Adam Sandler's character from Funny People) would do. But, the reason why Sandler does films like this is because they make a lot of money, and when he does something different, those films don't do so well financially.Sandler stars in both title roles. Jack is a television commercial director-producer, who dreads when his twin sister, Jill, visits for Thanksgiving every year. Jack has only a few weeks to land Al Pacino to do a commercial for Dunkin Donuts when Jill arrives. Jack now has to keep his cool knowing that Jill is not just staying through Thanksgiving, but even longer than that.Sandler proves that he still is a funny guy in playing both parts. As Jack, Sandler has to play it straight and does good at playing the guy who has to keep his cool, yet loses it a few times. As Jill, he goes all out, especially with the ridiculous voice. Katie Holmes plays Jack's wife, Erin. She does okay with an underwritten part, but shows that she is not a great actress at all.Al Pacino is a riot as he appears in the film as himself. He made a character out of himself as a guy who wants Jill, yet trying to stay professional as an actor.Sandler fans, like myself, will enjoy seeing people such as Nick Swardson, Tim Meadows, Norm MacDonald, and David Spade appear in small roles. There are also cameos by Regis Philbin, Jared Fogle (Subway guy), and even Johnny Depp.Something I found to be somewhat entertaining, yet unnecessary was in the beginning and end of the movies where quite a few sets of twins talk about being a twin and what it's like.Fans of traditional Adam Sandler movies may find it entertaining, yet dumb. But that is what Adam Sandler movies are, and they still work.",Jack and Jill
65,joelgodinho,"""Burn this. This must never be seen, by anyone.""",2,28 July 2020,"Jack and Jill is a 2011 comedy directed by Dennis Dugan and starring Adam Sandler, Al Pacino and Katie Holmes.
While I didn't dislike it as much as I thought I would, this is still an utterly awfull film and probably the worst comedy I have ever seen.
The acting is all either bad or bland, except maybe Pacino who is in my opinion the best part of the film, and Adam Sandler as Jill is one of the most annoying performances I have ever seen.
The story is generic, uninteresting and extremely boring, there are a few scenes that did make me chuckle like when the old hispanic lady gets hit in the face but most of the comedy just isn't funny.
This turned out to not be as awfull of an experience as I expected and it's not nearly as bad as other films I've seen like Wrong Turn 6 or The Avengers (the 1998 film not the one from the MCU) however it's still really, REALLY bad.

I laughed hard and often, in fact I laughed more than probably any other Sandler flick except maybe the Waterboy.

It not that kind of humor, its pretty family friendly but man its hilarious to me...Adam is the latest Mel Brooks. I didn't actually think he was that funny as Jill but still there were so many funny moments. Adam will have to add dirty jokes, nudity, and lots of f bombs before he will get his audience back.

You know, some movies are that stupid they are funny? This one is plain stupid. For me it was a torture watching it, I just did it for my gf as she clearly enjoyed it and wanted to watch it with me.

Jack is a successful manager of an advertising firm and his sister Jill is visiting for the Thanksgiving vacation and starts to make his life miserable. Like we haven't seen this story before. At the same time, though, Jack needs to get Al Pacino because Dunkin' Donuts wants him in a commercial. Jack is unable to get him but Pacino starts to fall for his sister Jill. Knowing this, Jack plans to use her to get Pacino into his commercial. It feels like no time was put into this film and that Sandler just got a piece of paper and brainstormed ideas that sounded funny and could be movie material. He relies on all of his old tricks including farting and slapstick comedy in their laziest forms and does not try to formulate one creative joke outside of things that might get shock laughs or appeal to the people who think farting and people falling down are hilarious.It has one of the worst stories I have ever seen in film there is not a single character you can relate to or possibly like.

71,Legendary_Badass,"Sandler put the ""F U"" in 'Failure""",1,10 November 2011,"Jack is a highly successful director of television commercials. For Thanksgiving his outlandish twin sister Jill (Sandler, again) comes to visit. Despite efforts to get her to leave, matters get complicated when Jill catches the eye of famed actor Al Pacino, whom Jack needs to convince to star in a commercial I guess. What Jack and Jill is really all about is Sandler's effort to exact revenge against moviegoers.Drag is not a good look for Sandler, and it should be no surprise that he is unfunny as a woman. The jokes featured in Jack and Jill have the range of an infant golfer. Committing to a viewing of Jack and Jill is almost a misogynist effort. All manners of humiliation beset Jill. She takes damage to the head, gets groped, has her skirt looked up, and if the sound is telling she may even have her bowels destroyed. Pure class, that Adam Sandler.So not only is Jack and Jill an offensive PG comedy, it's structurally broken. Jill appears on the scene way too fast, in under five minutes. No build up to her arrival, no clever use of music from The Cars —from what I can gather Sandler's favorite band—for her reveal. Jill also has a tendency to run off into the woods, which at first is random. Lastly for what is billed as a holiday movie, Chanukah is glossed over through a montage and I'm not even sure how Thanksgiving lasted as long as a dinner scene.It's obvious that Pacino has no business being in this film, but what's really at stake are the remains of Sandler's reputation. If Sandler ever wonders why he can't get an Oscar nomination, all he has to do is look back at the selfish decisions he has made. Jack and Jill is not a script, or even a concept, that deserves a read. It's like a fake movie found within Funny People that was replaced with the more imaginative ""Merman"". Yet, Sandler turned it into a movie that will surely pay him upfront over $20 million. The awesome mess that is Jack and Jill is so wrought with issues that this reviewer can only stand to offer some bullet points for the lesser offenders. Katie Holmes is in this movie. David Spade is a better woman than Sandler. Jack has an adopted son whose entire bit is taping found objects onto his body. The character of Al Pacino has a line that inadvertently summarizes Jack and Jill. After watching his cheesy song and dance number in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial, Pacino turns to Jack and says, ""This needs to be burned.""",Jack and Jill

His family is unlike able his wife seems to disagree with him in every way possible, his daughter seems to take Jill's side over his all the time & his adopted son comes across just weird and doesn't really have a bond with anyone in the family, the film isn't funny and there isn't really a plot to it. He doesn't like his twin which he makes quite clear he thinks by helping her find love she will be out of their hands and in a weird twist of faith Al Pacino ends up liking her which I thought was weird.

73,benjaminweber,Made me feel physically dirty for watching it,3,31 March 2018,"I finally managed to watch the whole thing on my second attempt. The first time was when it came on television. It was switched off fairly promptly. This is the only film where I have felt it necessary to spray myself with deodorant, or to use an air freshener in the room while it played. That's how much this film stinks.The basic premise is that Adam Sandler plays two characters: one who is nails-on-a-chalkboard irritating, and another who we're meant to sympathise with when they have to put up with the other one. This might provide humour for ten minutes in another film, where the protagonist has already been established. However, when it's the entire film it's not funny, it's just Adam Sandler in a dress doing one of his horrible voices. Throw in a bunch of other unfunny and sometimes just offensive jokes and voila, you have the perfect storm of Adam Sandler, because at the end of the day, this is just another bad Adam Sandler film.",Jack and Jill
74,Queen_of_pentacles,Did Pacino act for friendship ?,4,11 July 2012,"Viewers have cried hoarse condemning this crap movie as the worst film of the year, rightly so.But one wonders how come Al Pacino agreed to act in this annoying stint of Sandler ? He must have wanted to help Sandler to redeem his movie, which is so stupid, and except for that scene when Jack and Jill jump on a skipping rope on a cruise.Katie Holmes doesn't have to do much than smiling sweetly all the time, and the kids are more than sympathetic to Jill. why does Jack have adopted kids ? They are sweet any way, but wasted. Indian adopted kid is shown in all kinds of weird get up, God knows why ? With some thoughtful and brilliant direction, and a female actor to play the role of Jill, as some reviewers have suggested, in addition to witty dialogs, this movie, with no good plot line, could have been hilarious.It's Al Pacino, who looks cool, and alluring ,in his role as himself, who manages to entertain us, though for some brief moments, in his rap, his drama on the stage, and with Jill. But his role is also poorly written, and he can not do much to save the movie from disgrace to an actor of Sandler's caliber.An absolute disaster of a movie, watch it out of curiosity at least, as to an experiment in terrible-movie-making !",Jack and Jill

76,MosHr,Terrible. The trailer is the highlights.,1,9 November 2011,"The standard that Adam Sandler movies has set is pretty low, but even with such low expectations going to the movie, the movie still felt terrible. The gag is twins and ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman. And, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman a lot, ridiculously lot and so much so, that Jack Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are just supporting actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.We could say this is just Adam Sandler up to his usual antics but Jill Adam Sandler hogs up the screen time and nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. There is Al Pacino as himself who falls for Jill, a possibility that the writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown of Al Pacino. Then, there is Jill who is loved by the kids and Jack's wife Erin (played by Katie Holmes) for reasons that Jill doesn't portray on screen and we are never shown, all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill. The Jill that Adam Sandler portrays is his own immature rendition of a woman, filled with toilet humor and displays of uncharacteristic skills and strength as positive attributes. Jill is portrayed uninteresting and vacuous though written differently, and that being the center of the movie makes the movie uninteresting and tiresome.The movie would have been an acceptable Sandler movie if Jill had been played by a woman who could actually portray a big heart. The previous Sandler movies were enjoyable movies, but Jack and Jill is a real stinker, barely watchable. The only thing I found interesting was the background opulence of everyone around, thrown around so casually that it really feels like the big guys involved in the movie have severely lost touch with their audience and given way to sloth where they think anything they do is magical.

The script must have been written by 4 year old, and Adams sanders terrible performance is excruciatingly painful to watch. The movie has absolutely no merit to it, besides the fact that you might be able to laugh at its stupidity. The follows a TV Producer(Jack), who's annoying twin sister(Jill) is coming to visit his family. His family consists of his wife( Poorly acted by Katie Holmes), their Daughter(who for some weird reason likes to dress the same as her doll), and their adopted son(who likes to sticky tape things to his back!).

I would've gave it no stars but sadly that's not a option. The film is pointless. Adam Sandler plays the part of two twins Jack and Jill. He doesn't like Jill and isn't looking forward to her visiting. I don't know what Al Pacino was thinking when he decided to star in this film?! He plays himself in the film and he has a crush on 'Jill'. The film has a lot of cameos and the usual suspects that act in Sandler films such as David Spade and Allen Covert. Adam Sandler's humor just isn't funny anymore and this film is just stupid and really lacks in any genuine laughs.

I really enjoyed this and I didn't get bored once. It's got plenty of laugh out loud moments and lots of quirky humor pieces that Sandler normally throws in. The cast is great and the movie is really well put together. Anyone who rates this less than a 5/10 needs to get a sense of humor or be banned from leaving any more reviews on IMDb. This film doesn't take itself seriously, but you can tell that a lot of hard work and thought has been put into it. At one point Al Pacino was really struggling to keep a straight face which made the scene twice as funny. I loved that part.I've seen many films that really deserve a 3/10 rating (unfortunately), but this ain't one of them, and that's why I decided to write this review. Heh heh heh!

82,filmbuff-05706,Let's Just Say Adam Sandler Is No Eddie Murphy.,1,6 August 2020,"I recently wrote a review of God's Not Dead 1 and 2, admitting that I used to like them, but I realized over time how awful they are. Jack and Jill is another one of those movies.Now, let me make this clear- I never LOVED this movie. But I did find it alright. I regret this wholeheartedly now, and let me tell you why, after I give you the plot summary:In the movie, Adam Sandler plays Jack, a commercial director who's twin sister is coming home for Thanksgiving-but refuses to leave. The twin is also played by Sandler.There are so many problems with Jack and Jill that it's kind of hard to know where to start, but here we go:1. Adam Sandler playing a man and his sister? I don't mind cross dressing in movies-Eddie Murphy does this in The Nutty Professor movies and Norbit(Not a perfect movie by the way but still WAY better than this), and movies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, and Some Like It Hot do this quite well, but Sandler just wasn't made for it.2. His voice for Jill is quite annoying, worse than his voice for The Waterboy. I dare you look up a clip of this movie and tolerate Jill's voice. Now consider hearing it for a majority of a 90-ish minute movie!3. There is SO much bathroom humor in this movie! There's literally a scene where Jill gets diarrhea on a date and at home she tells Jack about her horrible night in-between numerous farts and defecation sessions! In another scene, Baby Jill out-gasses Baby Jack in the bathtub!4. It's a pointless movie. What are we supposed to gain from it? Laughs? A Thanksgiving movie? If you want either of those, see Planes, Trains, and Automobiles or Dutch, both great works from John Hughes. But please don't see this!5. It's not that funny. There's a gag where Jill doesn't recall the name of It's A Wonderful Life, and it's predictable and not comedic. Fart jokes replace good jokes, and so much more. There's one decent joke where Jack dresses as Jill and his fake boobs are adjusted by a stranger but that scene doesn't amount to much in the end.6. And if all of this isn't bad enough- AL PACINO, the same one that starred in The Godfather and Scarface, plays himself and becomes a LOVE INTEREST for Jill! That makes me speechless!That's probably not every problem that this movie even has! How this was ever greenlit is beyond me.I actually like Adam Sanlder. I enjoy Anger Management, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Grown Ups, and a few others. This, however, should be collected and burned.If you are blessed to have never seen Jack and Jill, remain that way. At most, see it to mock with your friends. Otherwise, there's no need to see it at all! It would be preferable to fall down a hill with a bucket of water than see this headache of a ""movie"" ever again.Reverse Recommendations: If you want any good movie connected to this garbage, see any other great, good, or alright movie that I mentioned in the review, here they are again:The Nutty Professor, Norbit, Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, Some Like It Hot, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Dutch, It's A Wonderful Life, The Godfather, Scarface, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management, or Grown Ups.These 14 movies are all better, if not perfect, uses of your time!",Jack and Jill

86,amahlanand,The Nadir of Film,1,24 May 2012,"0/5Oh Adam Sandler, how you have degraded. From his glory days of Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and Big Daddy, this is truly the unfortunate trough in his career. Remember when your parents stopped or discouraged you from watching a screen because it apparently eroded your braincells? Well, here's something that validates that particular nag. Being comfortably amongst the worst if not the worst film I have seen, I'm going to do something I've never done and unhesitatingly award this film zero. After becoming the talk of the town following its sweeping of the Razzies, the first time a film has ever done so, it attracted my interest. Ultimately, to genuinely appreciate works of art in cinema, we need to be able to identify and understand the flip side. This represents a pin-up example, one of those ill-fated catastrophes where there is nothing to praise in any way and everything to vilify. There have unquestionably been worse premises for comedies but it was execution that let this down miserably. Execution in every possible facet of cinema. The story was lame, predictable and exceeded the limits of senselessness and brainlessness that an individual can tolerate. The dialogue is unintelligibly stupid and unfunny. I couldn't help but disconnect from it. And in all honesty, even if I was paying rapt attention, I doubt I would have found anything that could be remotely termed as comedy. Adam Sandler is by no stretch of the imagination a poor comedian but this is the nadir of his work. Jack is the bread and butter Sandler character that we just seem to see in every film of his nowadays. Jill, on the other hand, is easily his most calamitous creation yet. She resembles a transvestite and I think that statement conveys my thoughts of the character best. There is just no clear distinction between the two characters Sandler played simultaneously. Playing multiple roles begs the ability to seamlessly absorb yourself into each separate character and forge an identity for each. In a comic context, Mike Myers did this brilliantly in 'Austin Powers'. In this case, without offence intended, all I could see was a cross-dressing Adam Sandler employing a cringeworthy, transsexual sounding voice. Jill eventually does little to dispel these negative perceptions, she's just an annoying, unintelligent pest. I'm unsure as to how I sat through this cinematic disaster but I did so staring blankly at the screen. I can waffle on about the deficits of this forever but take it from me, nothing redeemed it, nothing helped it and every minute made it even worse. The only reason you'll ever need to see this is to understand the lowest quality of cinematic art.",Jack and Jill
87,shominy-491-652355,Fun Comedy!,10,15 November 2015,"We have seen this movie more than once and thoroughly enjoy it! The world desperately needs good comedies and this is definitely what the world needs! Adam is absolutely hilarious as ""Jill"" (his twin) and Al Pacino is great as the love-struck suitor of ""Jill""! (Al Pacino's Dunkin' Donuts commercial/jingle is beyond hilarious!) At times, you'll feel sorry for ""Jill"" and, other times, she drives you nuts! Adam Sandler truly understands human comedy regarding the highs and lows, the happiness and sadness that all great comedians experience in their films (like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Jackie Gleason). The children in the movie are great and enjoyable! Nick Swardson is so funny as Adam's employee! This is a good, fun, enjoyable comedy that we will definitely watch again!",Jack and Jill
88,kailomonkey,Uncomfortable cringing comedy...,7,15 November 2016,"This movie has plenty of laughs but it has some things that you are unlikely to be willing to sit through. The problems are these:1. Adam Sandlers female counterpart is plain offensive to women and I think the Jewish? In a way that is uncomfortable.2. Adam Sandler's acting talking to himself is naturally not fluid. It is uncomfortable.3. A lot of supposed humour comes from horribly prejudice comments made by the characters. Such that even if you thought you'd sit down and watch a bad movie... continuing with the viewing would make you feel wrong and uncomfortable.That said I got through this movie and found some random cut away type jokes quite funny. It doesn't stop it being awkward but I do have one thought about how you could enjoy this film better... Well making a comedy that is just offensive is discomforting but we can all see what archetypal movie we're going for here. What if this film was actually just that movie made as a serious drama with a few jokes thrown in there, but the main characters are really portrayed so badly that the serious story turns to uncomfortable character jokes? If you can view it through these eyes where there is a shallow but sensitive story being told about 2 awful human beings that learn to stop being hateful to each other and everyone else, and try to forgive that it is framed as an all out comedy, enjoying only the side-comedy for laughs... Then you might make it to the end without feeling dirty. Maybe. Good luck though!",Jack and Jill
89,Braindead09,"Should a comedy be funny?, if so this film is a comedy",7,3 February 2012,"It could be argued that this movie is basically crap, and on many levels I could agree. The story is wafer thin, there are too many cameos of unknown entity's, etc etc etc.Adam Sandler in the UK is an actor whose films for the most part use to go straight to VHS or have limited runs at the cinema. I have been the only the person in screenings of The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy, Big Daddy and Little Nicky. The only film I can remember that he appeared in that was popular was Grown Ups and that was easily his worst film, I think people were drawn to the fact it was co starring Kevin James who was popular in Hitch.Look at the long list of lazy American comedians who just read scripts sent and accept the films for the dough paid up front. The foreign/overseas audience have no idea why Chevy Chase Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy etc keep getting work, there names very rarely appear in the list of screenwriters attached to their projects. Adam Sandler at least writes or co-writes the majority of the films he appears which is the case for Jack and Jill. The first ten or so reviews that I have read state this film was not funny. This is where I have to disagree and say that the majority of those reviewers are pompous. Where this film fails with other reviewers is that he consistently and crassly hits the funny bone. There is a certain standard he reaches for and with this one succeeds. If you don't like Happy Madison productions avoid this film, if you found yourself laughing at a Happy Madison production in the past give Jack and Jill a try. The film is funny from the start to the end. Al Pacino is given a chance to play up to the public's preconceived idea of him and thankfully Sandler and Co follows a Ricky Gervais scenario quite well and leads the celebrity into an awkward scenario. There is good use of animals for cheap jokes, ethnicity is used to laugh at WASPS, Jews, Indians and Mexicans and all done with no spite or malice. The picnic scene and the repercussions are funny.The only thing wrong with this Adam Sandler production, is that the viewer knows a chunk of his earnings will endorse Republican causes in this election year",Jack and Jill
90,richy1024,"Sad, sad Sandler.",1,7 October 2012,"Categorically twins have an interesting nature about them. Similarities no single born child will endeavour. Although Adam Sandler continuously pumps out farcical acts, literally playing the same character time and time again, a brief interest rose due to Sandler acting fifty per cent male and fifty per cent female. Back in the 90s Sandler's infantile belligerence was fresh, devilish and entertained the masses, fitting in with the era of bratty youngsters. Regrettably as Sandler has aged this has morphed into an irritable middle aged bore. Therefore we experience no distinctive change in this feature from characters played in Grown Ups and Funny People.Jack and Jill is painfully shoddier than any of his recent attempts at comedy. Sandler's female character is simply a high-pitched version of Jack with the same motives and attitude to characterisation. Jack is poor and dull whilst Jill's squealing is agonisingly uncomfortable to listen to. If we were expecting Sandler to make an adaptation of Robin Williams' splendid Mrs Doubtfire, it would be recommended to stray away from these twins. Finding your father prancing around in your mother's garments would be far more amusing, although in reality this would drive most into a tender mental rehabilitation. The most entertaining spectrum is the temperament of Jack's adopted son who marvellously straps haphazard objects or animals to himself in an attempt to stamp his cultural disparity from the luxurious directorship lifestyle that Jack has built. Katy Holmes is bland and takes a short hit with reference to her late husband attempting to encourage her to follow a cult which is particularly clever and snappy.A short cameo from Johnny Depp can go unrecognised. He seems to spend more time featuring in other people's films rather than prancing around as Jack the pirate. I suppose this is what starring in a lacklustre, pitiful garbage with Angelina Jolie does for you. Al Paccino also stars as himself, rather comically falling for Jill and although only standing at four foot he certainly gives a healthier presentation of himself than Sandler's double act. I beg of you not to expect too much from him though as he characteristically fails to reach the heights The Godfather series and the epic Scarface. Although a change of genre can occasionally bring out the worst in some performers. See Sandler's commercial starring Pacino and you'll want to curl up in a corner and weep.Unless Sandler retires a change of performance is regrettably not on the cards. His inability to adapt to varying types of characters will be remembered more so than his moody and juvenile temperament. He is simply not pragmatic when it comes to variety.",Jack and Jill

94,tyreeewebster,Retrospective Reviews- Jack and Jill (2011),1,24 February 2012,"Okay, let me just clarify, this movie is NOT a perfect comedy. It's just a stupid, stupid movie. It's not 'The Artist', but what it is, is hilarious. I loved this film. It was great, it had its share of good moments and its bad moments, and I'm going to tell you them NOW!PROS: First of all, in my opinion, it's an improvement from 'Just Go With It', it has funnier jokes (and there are plenty, but there are 1 or 2 that are a hit or a miss) Adam Sandler is funny AND likable as Jill, even if she is very annoying, but I think that was the whole point of her character, as Jack, he's just the same old wealthy Adam Sandler character we've seen dozens of times in his other films, but is still likable, even though when he's not supposed to be likable. Katie Holmes as Jack's wife Erin was sweet in the film and really likable, she's also smokin' hot and actually does a pretty good acting job for a film like this, she acts concerned, angry, upset and happy when she needs to and is also quite funny, too! The children were funny also, but they weren't featured too much in the film so I'll leave it at that. We get the small cameos from the Sandler regulars, David Spade, Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran, the director Dennis Dugan, Allen Cover, and John McEnroe and Nick Swardson, and they were ALL funny, but the best part of the film HAS to be Al Pacino, I don't know why he doesn't do more comedies, he was hilarious in this film. The way he plays himself is so good, it's as if he lost his brain and just wondered onto the set so Adam Sandler said; 'Okay! He's in the movie!' He was easily the funniest part about the movie and I think he should actually do more comedies. I can't really say much about the story, it's just a family reunion caught on tape with the Al Pacino thing on the side, but it does all fit in.CONS: Like my other reviews, there's only a few small problems with the movie, there's only a few jokes that I didn't like. And that's it.To summarise, I don't see what's so bad about it, it's not as awful as everybody else is making it out to be, it's just a silly film to watch and laugh at, and that's what I did! It's not THAT bad, in fact, the film is quite sweet, it makes you feel good after watching it. When I mean sweet, I mean Adam Sandler has this brilliant ability to create these stupid movies that don't look very appealing, but once you open up your mind and actually watch it, you end up liking it and actually liking the characters and some of the sweet moments incorporated into the film. It's a sweet,feel good comedy film where you can have fun, and that's what film-goers need to start doing, just have FUN and stop nit- picking!'JACK AND JILL'Directed by: Dennis DuganStarring: Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes and Al Pacino",Jack and Jill

People saying that Adam Sandler is a bad actor, even though there may be SOME truth to that notion, i still choose to disagree with that. Sandler is a great actor, but the only thing pulling him back is the bad writing. Actors follow a script, they don't write that script, they just follow it. But this is a weird situation (for obvious reasons). The comedy is targeted towards the young audience. Sure, i chuckled a few times and the plot was good enough.Honestly, this is a movie for children and not for anyone above the age of 16.",Jack and Jill
100,dalelawson-1,A Joyless Comedy,1,26 February 2012,"I already knew after seeing the trailer for Jack and Jill (Dir. Dennis Dugan, 2012) that this film would not be a successful comedy, or even remotely funny. If you were one of these people, that presumed the same as me, then you were correct.Early on in the film Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) says that Al Pacino would never stoop as low as to star in a doughnut advert to promote a Dunkaccino. This for me was the funniest moment of the film as it was ironic that Pacino wouldn't stoop as low as a cheesy TV ad, but would actually stoop lower and star as himself in another dated and terrible Adam Sandler film. The plot in this film is very basic and follows the classic cause and effect narrative structure, like most comedies do.Not only does Pacino sell himself out by appearing in this film, but he also sells out every other film he has ever made by rapping some of his most famous quotes from films like The Godfather Part II (Dir. Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) and Scarface (Dir. Brian De Palma, 1983) for the Dunkaccino TV advert.Many of the gags in Jack and Jill are slapstick orientated, which is rarely funny in the best of films; especially when it is overused, which it was. Jack's twin sister Jill (Adam Sandler) would fall over so many times, expecting the audience to laugh because a man dressed as a woman tripped up or lifted up weights that even body builders couldn't. However slapstick gags were not the only form of comedy within Jack and Jill. I was also able to experience the ""joy"" of hundreds of fart jokes, which might appeal to the 10 year old target audience, but not to adults. Finally I was disgusted at the amount of Jewish jokes Sandler had incorporated into the film. I don't think anyone laughs at those jokes unless they are actually Jewish, and even then I couldn't be certain. The comedy aspects of the script felt like they were written ten to fifteen years ago and Sandler just thought we have the same expectations for comedy in 2012 as we did then. We don't. Al Pacino is not the only star that appears as himself in Jack and Jill. Johnny Depp was also there with Pacino at a basketball game, and unusually Johnny Depp was probably the funniest part of the film. I will say that this film is seemingly aimed at American audiences rather than a British audience as Jack and Jill does have a lot of US celebrities that are unknown to me, and so the jokes they are involved in were just not funny.I did smile a few times during Jack and Jill but I never laughed out loud, which I would expect to do when watching a comedy film. Unfortunately half the gags I may have laughed at are in the trailer and therefore are no longer funny when seeing them for a second or third time. For a film in the comedy genre, it failed. For a film in general, it failed. Do not watch this unless you love every movie Adam Sandler makes. If you do then this film is probably right up your street with its unintelligent comedy, pathetic attempts for a laugh and tedious narrative. I will leave this review with the simple question of: How does Adam Sandler always get such attractive wives in his movies, when he just isn't that funny?If you enjoyed this review check out others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",Jack and Jill
101,adamlennard,One of the worst film ever made,1,20 May 2020,Let me say I'm not a film snob I'm very easy to please and I love a lot of films considered bad but Jesus this was awful. The face people are giving this 10 worries me. The Gill character is one of the most easy to hate movie characters ever. All Sandler does is screech as Gill. Poor Al Pacino whatever they paid him wasn't enough. I'm sure Sandler took great pleasure in dragging Pacino down. I will say Adam Sandler is a genius he gets a studio to invest in bad movies so he and his friends can go film in beautiful locations and of course always gives himself a beautiful wife. Not even so bad it's good.,Jack and Jill
102,CaptMTS,Jack & Jill is a Mediocre Sandler Movie,5,13 November 2011,"I'm a big Adam Sandler fan, but Jack & Jill was a mediocre effort. The film had some laughs (mostly captured in the trailers), but the movie was stalled by too many somber stretches with Jill (sister played by Adam Sandler) and the forced scenes with Al Pacino.Sandler's regular cast of sidekicks (his cross-eyed friend, the dumb guy, Rob Schneider, David Spade) filled the movie. They provided a few funny moments, but most of their scenes bombed or were pointless.The oddest role was Al Pacino playing a desperate Al Pacino. His scenes seemed to drag on with no purpose. The scenes were difficult to endure, as he tried to romance Jill (female Sandler).The movie had many, many celebrity cameos, which are fun to see and even better if they are funny or add to the movie. Johnny Depp & Shaq were two of the better cameos.Overall, the movie probably isn't worth a movie ticket. Jack & Jill is more of a Netflix rental down the road. Or, better yet, check out a funnier old school Sandler film like Happy Gilmore, or one of his better relationship films like 50 First Dates or Just Go With It.",Jack and Jill

This movie is childish and not in a good way, farting humor, sweating humor, screeching humor, oh my God this movie is awful. Adam Sandler what have you done? Why did you think any of it was even remotely funny? What were you on? Prescription painkillers? Because that is what you 'the viewer' is gonna need for the headache this movie will give you. It is beyond crap - it is worse than crap. It is so pointless and so unfunny it will give you nightmares! LOL Maybe not nightmares .... but maybe Adam SandlerMares... I do not know what was going through his mind when he decided to make this movie. Does he really think he is so funny - that unfunny things when said by him - in a squeaky voice - pretending to be a woman - is going to be funny anyway? What a disaster... How embarrassing would this be to walk down the red carpet and watch the premier of this movie with OTHER PEOPLE in the cinema. How could he hide his redcarpet face?

106,jagsports01,Razzie Awards.. be prepared.,3,9 June 2012,"The Razzie Awards is an award show for terrible movies, and I new from the first minute, this movie was going to have little laughs, and a horrible storyline. Jack and Jill, both played by Adam Sandler is usually good, but in this movie, went beyond the line with horrible acting. It was absolutely horrible, but I rate it a 3 because of the little laughs I had throughout the movie. Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes, Nick Swardson, the famous Al Pacino, David Spade and more, a stacked cast did horrible. About Al Pacino, the most famous and best actor in the world did horrible, the worst in the movie. The writer and directer made Pacino look horrible, they made Pacino look like the worst actor ever. Pacino shouldn't have accepted the role, he is more for thriller, horror, and sci fi movies. Come on Pacino, think! You're losing your mind as you grow older.After all, Jack and Jill was being used with amazing utensils, but turned out to be a horrible drawing with a horrible artist.",Jack and Jill
107,sir-montag,This is the worst film I've seen in my life,1,5 January 2012,"I have never seen a film this bad. Manos: The Hands of Fate, The Star Wars Holiday Special, these are Oscar-nominated films by comparison. I struggle to pare down the list of adjectives for 'horrible' that I'll use here.I'd summarize the plot, but other reviewers have covered that fairly well. Let's get on to the strangeness *behind* this surprisingly horrible film.The interesting thing is that it's horrible by design, in the sense that it isn't bad because the people making it were inexperienced or simply among the worst in the entire film industry. Adam Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison Productions' has produced a fair number of films that have done well, if generally with questionable taste in every aspect.The first thing you'll find puzzling when seeing this film is 'This had a budget of 80 MILLION - where did it go?'. 'Independence Day' cost 5 million less than this and you have much, much, much higher production values. The film's actual cost of production looks to have been closer to about 5 million, if that. The rest went to line the pockets of... Well, I'm sure you can make an educated guess.The commercial product placement alone is beyond the pale - there is a full-blown TV style commercial right in the middle for a cruise line. It looks like a TV commercial, it feels like a TV commercial, then you're back to movie-land. The cruise line was so kind to shoot footage for them!Dunkin Donuts also bears much of the shame for this entire debacle. They have a commercial at the end that is just... Well, it's so bad you have to see it. It will leave you with absolutely no respect for Al Pacino, if you had any left after making it through the majority of the film. I don't know what sort of bills he has to pay, but they must be horrific if he's accepting work like this now.This is one of those movies that will end up in film criticism text books citing how bad things became at this point in history. If it were only so bad that it became unintentionally funny, it would deserve a spot on the wall with Mano: Hands of Fate. But it's deliberately bad, just the bare minimum to pose as a film and get money into the hands of the producer and his friends. The sad thing is, they did nothing illegal. Not even Uwe Boll financially questionable. They just figured out how to game the system, I congratulate them on that. The sales execs at Pepto-Bismol, Coke, Royal Canadian Cruise Lines, Dunkin Donuts and Sony really need to learn when to draw the line on product placement. But this is really a case where no one could say no, to the detriment of all that is good in this world.See this movie at some point, but do not spend any money to do so. See it only to know how bad movies can be.",Jack and Jill
108,sksolomonb,I agree with Setting the Record Straight,8,9 July 2019,"I agree with Setting the Record Straight, who found the movie very funny. Everyone has an ""ugly duckling"" relative who does not fit in with the family, and everyone tries to be nice in an attempt to compensate for what appears to be ""Nature's mistake."" Jack looks OK for a guy, but the same features and athletic body build make Jill a freak or ""loser"" in the eyes of most people. What makes the movie funny for me is the way Jack's movie-star handsome, celebrity friends find Jill fascinating and attractive because she is big and strong enough to participate with them in male-dominated sports and actually wind the games. Could it be men really do not like the sweet and feminine type like Jack's wife? Could it be they really like the opposite, such as Jill? It seems Jack's friends are so smitten with Jill that they cannot get enough of being around her. It is the men's unusual reaction that makes the movie funny in an ironic way.Without giving away too much, I found the jet ski scene incredibly funny. Jill tries too hard in everything she does, and the jet ski overshooting the swimming pool is the most hilarious slapstick bit of humor I have seen in a long time. My husband considered the film too much of a chick flick, but I have recommended the film to my friends, and we hope to see it on DVD on our next ""girls' night out.""",Jack and Jill

But this thing, Jack & Jill, is the worst by far. It's so bad you're left scratching your head and asking yourself two questions. 1) What were they thinking? and 2) Why did I come and see this? The film is boring, unfunny and stupid. Sandler co-wrote this and all that tells me is how he should never write again. If this is his idea of a good script for a comedy he clearly has lost the plot. It feels like it was written by a child. But even saying that would be an insult to children everywhere. This awful film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's budget was a reputed $75m. They might as well have taken that money and set fire to it. This is an insult to writers and filmmakers everywhere.",Jack and Jill

This is a really terrible piece of shame. I was always hesitant to watch Adam Sandler's movies until I saw Punch Drunk Love, when I reconciled with him and gave it a chance. After that nothing seem to be too bad, definitely nothing was too good, but it came to this ""movie"", because I was letting girlfriend decide what movie we would see. I didn't even see the poster, nothing, didn't read reviews (WRONG), just went in the theater. My hipothesis is that Maybe some tech-head approached Adam Sandler and went ""Hey, look this new program, how easy and good a scene with the same actor in two characters can be done""... and in some way, after some drinks and a winding road, this ""movie"" came to light. Low, cheap, tasteless, gross and disgusting humor are all together here along with the worst acting I have seen in years. Then the bold commercial endorsement, it's just disgusting. I just paid $10 for watching a freaking 2 hour long Dunkin Donut commercial.I think the worst of all is the load of famous and respectable people making cameos here.

He writes, produces, stars himself, and hires some of the same directors in each of the films he produces.He has all the money in the world. Can't believe people still support this guy.

114,MrTeenie,The film equivalent of a war crime,1,19 August 2020,"Yet another abysmal effort from Adam Sandler. Does he genuinely not have anyone to tell him 'no'? He really needs someone to tell him when something isn't working, which let's face it is becoming more and more common.
Maybe he just needs to check his massive ego and stop doing vehicles for himself and get some supporting roles, try to learn what funny means again, learn how to make a good film by watching others.
I mean, what's next here, a feature length close-up of Sandler cracking 'jokes' to a hand puppet? Or maybe I shouldn't give him any ideas.
IMDB really needs to add a zero rating, because giving it a '1' seems to indicate that I found something good about this.This review has no spoilers, as the film itself is so rotten it can't be spoiled.",Jack and Jill

The answer is YES, YOU CAN. Provided you have an actor/superstar who listens to his director, an actress/global celebrity who just glows on screen throughout the movie and if the big budget is totally justified.All the credit for this extravagant movie goes to Sandler. The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the American Hollywood movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his, the scale of movie-making grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that.Sandler is magnificent in this movie. In fact, he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Sandler. Sandler does what he does best, looking GORGEOUS.He has some pretty slick dance moves too but these go unfeatured in this particular blockbuster.The Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an American movie. The CGs are spectacular. Sandler shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mind-blowing and totally unique to this movie. Sandler handpicked the locations for backdrops and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining.This movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in the US and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers, distributors and the exhibitors all around the world.Sandler redefines the fart gag.

Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison are my childhood memories. I loved those as a kid. Which is why this hurts. So when I first saw a trailer there where a few chuckles, but I sit in the theater and I started to cry in disbelief that Adam Sandler could fall so hard. When I first saw his family I thought ""oh no, it's the same character he plays in every movie. When we first met his sister she (or he) was so annoying. Then the dinner scene had bad joke after bad joke after bad joke, this scene made me feel so bad for the homeless guy, he left near the end of the scene and I feel like it wasn't in the script. Then the bonding scenes between jack and Jill maybe could be chuckle worthy if most of them where in the trailer. Oh yeah, then there is Al Pacino, and he was the only character that I tolerated.

123,keving4241,Greatest Hollywood Heist,2,4 November 2015,"Jack and Jill is amazing! I've always had a curious interest in heist related things. Like the real life heist at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum where thieves got away with nearly $500 million dollars worth of paintings. So when it comes to movies I really like Ocean's Eleven both the original and remake. That is why I'm so amazed by Jack and Jill. The movie is terrible, absolutely painful to watch and I won't even go into detail cause they didn't bother putting any effort into making it, why should I care to give it a proper review.No the reason I like this is because it's a heist movie. They received 80 million dollars to fund this movie, on top of that they had some painfully obvious product placement mainly for Dunkin Donuts and Pebto Bismol. So add even more money on to that 80 million. Now look at the production quality of the movie... how much do you think this movie actually cost to make? The actors are the most expensive thing in this movie. Not even the NBA scene where they went to a Lakers game... they didn't actually shoot a fake game they CGI the actors into a Laker's game. Why? Cause it was cheap as hell to CGI it.So this movie barely cost anything to make... Adam Sandler doesn't even have convincing female body prosthetics. Jill is always wearing a lot of clothes to hide the fact that he probably just has socks in that bra. Just throw make-up on with a wig and do the nails. So how much did this movie actually cost? We'll never know the truth cause this was a scam. Grossed $150 million, budget $80 million + product placement. You didn't watch a movie you watched a heist, and they got away with it.So the score? Well I'm amazed with this movie. I'm not making this score to get you to read this, I'm scoring this an 8 because as a heist, this was amazing. If you watched this you didn't see a movie, there's no conflict or plot, it's just fat people jokes and even a little racism too.

This is probably a career ender for Adam Sandler. When Jack or Jill was supposedly saying a joke it would be a really bad one and that is the only reason people laughed.

None of the jokes landed, Adam Sandler's acting made him look like an idiot who had no apparent idea of what people actually like, and having Al Pacino in this movie made me want to cry.I actually started to believe that Satan himself went to Adam Sandler as he slept and said that he should be in a movie that will give him an excuse to dress up as a woman like Mrs. Doubtfire, except it will be much worse. This movie annoyed me to the 110th degree and it will always be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. If this movie belongs anywhere at all, it belongs in a trash fire.

People have been saying that this is one of the worst movies Adam Sandler has ever written and starred in, I STRONGLY disagree. My family and I laughed through out the hole movie, and a picnic seen far into the movie had me and my grandmother in tears from laughing so hard. The movie starts off with Adam Sandlers' character Jack trying to make a great commercial for pepto bismal, and with his twin sister Jill arriving soon, more pressure is added to everything. There are many great scenes in this movie that even thinking back on them I burst out laughing. Even if you aren't a fan of twisted comedy that is not for children, the stars that are in this movie are worth seeing, such as Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, Adam Sandler(of course), Regis Philbin, Drew Carrey, and a brief appearance of David Spade at the end of the movie. All and all, Jack and Jill is completely worth your time if you are into this type of comedy, you may just find yourself laughing so hard you cant breathe!",Jack and Jill
131,hellaszer,"I had fun, real one",9,2 November 2012,"Honestly I was afraid....a lot. Being a huge Sandler's fan, I didn't want to witness yet another faliure... I'm so happy I didn't read IMDb reviews before! I was very nicely surprised. C'mon guys, it is soo far from 3,5...Not long ago I watched That's my boy. I didn't like it... I love most of Sandler's stuff, Big Daddy, or even Click (different genre though).Al Pacino was a little weird but not hideous. Time to time he happened to be even funny. Yes, the taping kid was a little overacted (but sorry, I just couldn't help thinking: THIS IS THE KID OF USA, americanized poor Indian kid, doing whatever he wants to do. So I appreciated some self- irony there by Sandler, which he can do so nicely so often). It may have the charms of Spanglish. But overall the dialogues were GOOD, jokes flied here and there - somewhere lower somewhere higher. The biggest compliment I can say is that I forgot MY world around....which is lately my biggest issue, films rarely happen to do the trick, to completely engage me and make me forget about my poor life for 1,5-2 hours. This movie jumped the bar.My biggest criticism though: I can really see that throughout the movie Sandler was struggling when talking ""for himself"", the parts when he was talking with Jill, it was shot alone....I felt those parts artificial and not believable.As a single woman - getting older and older - I could relate to the poor Jill, net dating...feeling lonely....I have been there. That part was really nicely done. What I appreciated, too, as usual the minor characters - as his assistant e.g. - were enjoyable, as well, great lines for them. I gave 9 .... but I admit it was because of my shock - I expected so much worse after seeing the trailer (I have been delaying watching the movie for so long). It is worth probably something like 6-7, but hey, I'm a true fan! Have fun....",Jack and Jill

The celebs just keep on coming but it didn't help - Johnny Depp ,David Spade ,Christie Brinkley - and oh no- Al Pacino at the worst you've ever seen him.How could he have agreed to be in this utter mess ? Not the Godfather.It was like a nightmare that just kept coming.Adam Sandler as male and female twins , unfunny in both.Poor storyline ,not a feeble joke in sight even.

Adam Sandler in drag is such a convincing Jewish New York 80's Barry Manillow fan , and is so warm and attractive in a motherly way. IT IS SO WHACKY IT CANT FAIL TO BE FUNNY. Wonderful performances and such great fun to watch. The kind of movie that used to be made, It is a brave thing to do in this day and age, and so refreshing to see. it is an instant classic and deserves at least a trio of sequels and prequels maybe. 10 out of 10 for the purpose of encouragement to continue. A Inspirational comedy.The supporting cast are good, the lines so terrible they give you belly laughs. Al Pacino is brilliant, his love for Jill so full of pathos and tragedy and is played with such gusto and power it makes you shudder with delight, and impact what impact! Hilarious Hilarious! Hilarious!!!!You want to re watch. I love this place it is a good place to be. More more more.",Jack and Jill

135,chopfigo289,An Adam Sandler Movie,7,24 November 2011,"What I mean by my title is that this is an Adam Sandler movie. The reviews of this movie seem to be based on the fact that they compare this to an intellectual comedy or something very popular like Hangover in terms of laughs. However I saw it as an adam sandler flick and got what i paid for. Adam sandlers very rarely get a good review. I mean on rotten tomatoes, this got a 4% rating while movies I LOVED like Click only got a 33%, movies like Grandmas Boy got only 18%, and Little nicky got 22%. If you like any of these movies a lot, go see it. I found it funny personally. Parts were boring and other parts were hilarious laugh out loud funny. Adam Sandler isn't going down in quality, its that he isn't changing. His movies are always stupid funny and full of slapstick humor which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. He does other movies like Punch Drunk Love, Rain on Me, and Click which are a break from the norm but most of his movies are generally the same. And equally bad in terms of reviews. So again for me i liked it. Funny at parts but don't compare to a critically acclaimed movie because you wont like it then. Compare it to something Adam Sandler has done in the last 5 years and if you liked them then this might be enjoyable.",Jack and Jill

Jill meets Al Pacino, and Pacino falls in love with Jill. Jack wanted to hire Pacino for a commercial, and he asks Jill to date him.In the end, the film is an audiovisual torture that deserves to be erased from the history of cinema, full of bad jokes, with ridiculous scenes that go nowhere, and leave the production company ashamed.",Jack and Jill

It was great entertainment, funny, cleverly done with all aspects of interest for the viewer:- Animal antics, slapstick moments, clever dialogue and a family movie for all to watch together. There was even some moral messages; cant understand the comment about it having racial motives??!!!! The onslaught of negative comments have me entirely confused?! The story of twins, one a success the other not and getting together with all the family dynamics and comedy which follows, makes it a very funny with many moments of big smiles! Adam Sandler pulls off the movie well with Katie Holms doing a great 'straight' part as Adam's wife. The aspects of the children's 'oddities' was just part of the fun. The part of Adam's character twin sister was also played by Adam and was believable albeit she had masculine tendencies!!! Al Pacino was good as the besotted hopeful boyfriend of Adam's twin sister. All in all I feel this movie is well worth the watch, leaves you with a smile on your face and laughter in your heart - cant be bad! p.s. whats wrong with some toilet humour anyway, makes me laugh and much much less offensive than the torrent of foul language other movies expose us too.",Jack and Jill

140,dekkar5,Deserves to be Erased from Film History,1,12 November 2011,"I will start by saying that I have enjoyed many Adam Sandler movies and have found him to be a generally funny guy when I've seen him interviewed and when he was on Saturday Night Live.I laughed gleefully through Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, 50 First Dates, and Happy Gilmore. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.I have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The ""jokes"" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.I don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.This movie is not a flop, its not an ""oops"", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful ""Grown Ups"" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.Sorry Adam, it's over.",Jack and Jill

But I had to think about those films that I had watched because 'others' wanted to see them and I was forced to watch to maintain healthy relations with the rest of my family. Strangely my wife seemed to go through a period of believing in the talent of Adam Sandler - strangely, because I have watched several of his efforts and have yet to recall even getting a smile out of this dolt, but then she has a habit of not understanding the concept of humour and, despite watching both apparent 'funnymen' Sandler and Will Ferrell attempts, does seem to come away very disappointed. The funniest thing about this film was that it got made at all. Does nobody actually read Sandler's scripts or have the guts to ask him if he knows 'funny', or needs it explained to him? Seriously, had I watched this at a cinema I would have led a crowd back to the box office with flaming torches to demand our money back; luckily it was on TV, but it still rankles. 
All involved deserve to never work again.

144,sabretooth91,Still entertaining,5,5 December 2011,"OK. Yes, I agree that there is no incredible plot twist and you pretty much know what is coming. There is no deeper meaning to this movie. The cast is your typical Adam Sandler ""Parade of Friends"" cast. Sandler chooses to shove the fact that he is Jewish down the viewer's throat AGAIN. But honestly, who watches Adam Sandler movies for their depth and originality? There are some good, funny moments. Having Sandler play both male and female twins is funny. I know it's been done before and arguably better. However, with a smarter and more special effects savvy audience, I get the feeling they're just poking fun at the whole situation. He's just having fun with it. (I hope) They whole movie is stupid, anyway. Do I think this is a good movie? Absolutely not. Would I pay to see it in theaters knowing what I know now? No. I could see myself watching this at home with friends, or a significant other. You get your chuckles out of Jack and Jill. That's all it's worth. Nothing more and nothing less. I think this is near the bottom of the Sandler Spectrum of movies. (which isn't really that high in comparison to other movies, to be honest) At least he does try to get some basic points across while providing laughs. I give it a 5. I didn't walk out screaming for my money back. I was smiling, but it was the stupid kind of smirky smile where I didn't grow as a person and wasn't really sucked into the plot or anything deep. I think the average rating here is too low, though.",Jack and Jill

The low ratings are not fair at all and definitively does not mirror the true value of this flick. And this is the main reason why I felt I just had to write a review for this movie. If you like Adam Sandler movies, you will like this one too indeed... but most of all if you like Al Pacino you will love this movie. He is great and so funny. I just love actors who can make fun of his own image and Pacino does it like the master he always is. Also Johnny Depp and other cameos invite you for some nice laughter. if Sandler is your cup of tea, then this one won't disappoint. I loved it!",Jack and Jill
146,Goranjake,A staple in cinematic history of poor comedy,2,5 April 2015,"The ending of Jack and Jill has Al Pacino, played by none other than Al Pacino, telling Adam Sandler's character to burn every copy of the commercial he is filmed in. This may be a simple joke, or it may be Adam Sanlder letting the audience know that he is aware how bad this movie is. He may realize it was an excuse to spend over 90 million dollars on the movie to give some cash to his buddies and get some product placement in.In a way this may be Adam Sandler's masterpiece. He proposes the question whether all film is ""art"". Is a Pepto Bismol commercial art? This movie is at it's core a money-making mechanism. It effortlessly piles on the product placement revolving around Adam Sandler's character who is, you guessed it, in the advertising business.The movie's jokes include the usual fart and physical drivel that most poor comedies have. I enjoy this type of comedy sometimes, when it is done at the right time and situation (Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite movies). Every joke in Jack and Jill falls completely flat. Punch lines are seen from a mile away and the viewer is left filling in the blanks before they appear on the screen.Another way to look at this movie is a ""so bad it's good movie"". I can think about it now and chuckle at how absurd some of the jokes trying to be told were. I laugh at how a ridiculous idea was actually turned into a movie. It almost seems as if Sandler knew he was going to be parodying himself when he produced this movie. The only reason I spared this movie a 1/10 is because of Al Pacino. I think I laughed twice during this movie and both were because of Al Pacino. One more thing to boost the rating to a 2/10 is the ending quote. It's as if the movie suddenly became self- aware when Al Pacino says ""Burn every copy of this."". This last line makes you wonder just how Adam Sandler has been able to make $300 million by churning out movies like this one. The biggest surprise isn't that he managed to do it once, it's that he does it several times and it looks like he will be able to continue doing it into the future.I don't hate Adam Sanlder, I like Happy Gilmore and Anger Management to an extent. I just find it fascinating that he is able to make millions while so easily making a terrible ""movie"". The box office proves Sandler does indeed have an audience, so can you really blame him for making stuff like Jack and Jill?",Jack and Jill

No, it is not.However I gave this movie a 7/10 rating.For starters, I went into this with low expectations.There were a lot of stupid parts to this movie, but it struck a special chord with me. It was the portrayal of a brother who cannot stand his sister. Nobody else can understand his feelings and his frustration. It reminds me of my own sister.

In summary, do not waste your money, time, and life, to sit and watch this garbage, I'd rather watch a raccoon get run over by a bunch of cars, than watch any Adam Sandler ""comedy"" of the 21st century.

Although out of all these movies, Jack And Jill is by far the worst. For starters why did Sandler have to make Jill have the most annoying voice ever? It sounds like someone is dragging their nails down a chalk board, I know he was trying to go way over the top with Jill but come on, really? Also, how could you take a massive cameo from an amazing actor such as Al Pacino, use that cameo for most of the film and make a complete mess of it?

Jill is Jack's ""nocturnal, like a bat"" twin sister, and she keeps prolonging her vacation because she's lonely and she only has her bird to keep her company; henceforth prolonging this god awful film. I thought it was extremely boring, and the plot was stupid. I could count the memorable gags and one-liners on a hand with no fingers. I wanted this film to ""pa-go-go"" away. About as equally bad as Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star. Though, the only good thing about this film is the reappearance of Otto, the homeless caddy from Sandler's classic, Happy Gilmore. Oh Al Pacino, why would you associate yourself with this film? Did you want to play a parody of yourself? Did Sandler hold you hostage and not let you go until you said you'd star in it? I love Sandler's earlier work (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Waterboy), so I hope he can redeem himself soon. Though, this film does not help in his road for redemption.

The storyline is almost non-existent-to be honest,it was pretty hard for me to figure out what exactly was going on in this movie..I realized after watching the trailer that this isn't going to be the movie of the year,and I watched it thinking that it will be the kind of movie that is so bad it's good..Well,it's nothing like that: I couldn't find anything funny about it,on the contrary, it was ridiculous, awkward and quite annoying at some points-I felt really uncomfortable watching this.Although it was supposed to be a comedy, there was no humor in it, the supposedly funny acting turned out to be dull and awkward, and the cheap and flat jokes made it even worse..Don't waste your time and money on this one..",Jack and Jill

Better yet, shame on all of us for allowing this thing to be created and manifest as a product found in our civilization.

161,mr2cool,"Poorly written, acted, and conceived! Should have never been filmed!!!!!",1,16 July 2012,"Adam Sandler should be ashamed of himself for producing this movie. It is an embarrassment to the Happy Gilmore legacy! When I initially saw the trailers for this movie in theaters, I questioned why it was made because it just didn't seem to be believable. Now granted, Al Pacino was great as always and he delivered his lines with the professionalism that he dedicates to every project. However, not even Pacino could save this poorly written, ill-conceived, sad piece of drivel that permanently left a black stain on the Sandler franchise which will never be erased or forgotten.Jack and Jill was lacking in imagination, creativity, humor, spontaneity, and any form of enjoyment that could even remotely entertain the viewer. Accordingly, I'm not sure why one of his friends that he repeatedly casts in his projects didn't quietly pull Adam aside and politely tell him that this movie was shite! With the exception of Sandler himself, it was clear from the promotional interviews that all of those that acted in this movie were aware that it lacked to ability to be a breakout box office success. That just goes to show that his friends are willing to appear in anything Sandler writes, as long as it results in a financial bonanza for them. But if they would have been true friends, they would have told him just exactly how outrageous, flat, and disjointed this movie was w/ the exception of Al Pacino. Jack and Jill clearly shouldn't have been greenlit by the studio since most of us could tell from the outset that it was an outrage! It ranks up there with other epic classics that failed at the box-office miserably including: Howard the Duck; Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000; Waterworld; John Carter; and Death to Smoochy. After seeing the movie trailer I decided to wait until this movie aired on cable to watch it, and that's exactly what I did because I was unwilling to invest any extra finances on it via Redbox or Netflix, and I certainly wasn't going to pay the price of a movie ticket to view it.I hope that Sandler has taken time to reflect on this film failure in order to learn a valuable lesson about writing more enjoyable future films. Also, let's hope that the movie studios will stop green-lighting disappointing movie scripts like this one. After all, people criticize Tyler Perry for his Madea character which they call annoying in some cases, but at least Mr. Perry makes profit with his movies because they are entertaining. Lately Adam Sandler's movies have become a disappointing means to a paycheck! And I hope that getting paid is not what's motivating him to write lately, or it just emphasizes just how sad the entertainment industry has become as an industry!!!!!!!",Jack and Jill

I am an avid fan of B movies but this one doesn't even deserve to be treated as a ""so bad it's good"" kind of movie. Maybe it's because I grew up and found overuse of fart jokes and gag humor to be unfunny. It tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably. It's like Sandler took a dump on the script and said ""write."" Al Pachino's mildly homosexual performance didn't even make me smile. I've seen better movies on YouTube. If you are a fan of Sandler, this is a major pass. Disappointing and truly stupid, this movie puts stupid comedies to shame. Adam Sandler tries way too hard to be funny and truly fails.

I thought that Grown Ups was terrible but it doesn't even come close to this awful movie. Sometimes you watch a terrible movie and it's hilariously bad even laugh out loud funny because of how bad it is. This is not the case with Jack and Jill, it's without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The movie stars Adam Sandler as twins Jack and Jill. I really don't know which performance I hated more. Adam Sandler acting as himself,unfunny as ever, or Adam Sandler acting obnoxious dressed in drag. Either way you look at it this movie is terrible. I couldn't even figure out what exactly the point of this movie even was. I guess to show how you should overcome how much you hate your annoying sibling or whatever. It doesn't matter because this movie is terrible in every single capacity. No jokes even spur a slight chuckle, in fact if anything the jokes in this movie made me angry because of how bad they were. The movie features supporting roles from Katie Holmes and Al Pacino. I can't help but feel bad for them for being in this movie but surprisingly enough Pacino seems to put effort into his role. But it doesn't matter because the movie is terrible. The movie also features David Spade in arguably the worst acting performance I have seen. He has a fight with Adam Sandler or something. I don't even know I wasn't paying much attention to the movie at this point. Everything bad you have heard about this movie is true. It's not funny, the acting terrible and the plot is not interesting. If I could I would give it a - 1 trillion out of 10. I hope Sandler stops making movies for his own sake.",Jack and Jill
165,andy-rainey,Dunckachino,3,22 June 2021,"The movie is so bad but the 3 stars are for the last minute of the movie. The dunkacahino commercial at the end is comedy gold, just YouTube it rather than sit through the drivel.",Jack and Jill
166,maheswarinabila,kinda confused,4,30 March 2017,"I just kinda confused because the film doesn't sell the plot. i mean, the story line is a little bit confusing for me. This is a comedy movie, but i can't feel the humor. the jokes was plain and cannot balance with the story line. Plus, saw Adam Sandler in woman's body just like wow, are you serious? like i've never imagine this before. But, the cast like Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, etc are really helped this movie became better.",Jack and Jill

It's probably better than a lot of the most recent Adam Sandler stuff, definitely better than murder mystery.

170,edrpz,Adams worst movie.,1,31 March 2017,"I was working at a juvenile recovery center and was forced to take some of the clients to see this movie. Since I can't come up with five lines to describe how bad this movie is, I will just say the following: suck, suck. I hope Adam Sanders burns in he'll for this movie. SUCK, SUCK, plays both parts of brother and sister, both should have died at birth. SUCK,SUCK. Please stop making movies like this. Leaving the theater after the movie was over was the only highlight.",Jack and Jill
171,joshuatkinson73,Meh Nothing Special,3,4 December 2011,"Jack and Jill - 5/10I had hoped this movie would exceed to the limits of great Sander movies such as, Big Daddy, Billy Maddison or even Happy Gilmore. But sadly this movie did somewhat disappoint. It was very hard to see Adam as both characters and i don't think he did a very good job at acting on Jills character. It just didn't work. There was some funny bits in the movie and i believe the plot wasn't too bad either. This movie could have been a great movie, but with the bad acting and a few stupid moments in this film it was nowhere near as good as his older more vintage films. Im starting to think that his acting career is in limbo, even though he is one of my favorite actors. I honestly don't recommend this movie unless you want a few cheap laughs.",Jack and Jill
172,sergio_ortega,Not so bad and everybody laughing and laughing,6,13 November 2011,"I went to watch this film with my wife and daughter in Mexico with voices in Spanish language (""Mexican"" exactly) and it's very funny the translation, i think it's for Eugenio Derbez (Felipe the Gardener) a Mexican comedian genius and for the twisted Mexican stereotype showed in the film that all the people in the cinema was laughing with every joke in this movie. I don't know why the critics destroy this funny movie? OK, will not in the 2012 Oscar's but 1:30hr of fun is guaranteed. Depp, Brinkley, McEnroe and others stars appears shortly, ones acting others in cameos. I don't like Pacino's performance and maybe was for the people who made his voice in Spanish.",Jack and Jill
173,bad_beth666,Awful....Beyond reason.,1,13 December 2011,"Seriously, this movie is so bad, even Nostalgia Critic wouldn't touch it.I cannot express the stupidity in words. It began on a sunny afternoon at my local mall Christmas shopping - a tradition between me and my friends. In this tradition, we always saw a movie afterwards. Unable to decide, we let our newcomer friend pick one at random- Jack and Jill. I knew even from the moronic poster it would be a flop- but rumor had it, sweetheart Johnny Depp was in it, so off we went- $11.50 down the drain as we entered the theater.So many things are wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin. I guess the first point would be the totally confusing audience range Sandler tries to aim for. If he was trying for a children's movie- he sadly failed, as there is sexual innuendo, swearing, and all sorts of disastrous adult jokes which screech off the rails. If he was trying for an adults movie- he also failed, with the fact no adult in their right mind set would enjoy Sandler dressing in drag and farting, scratching his genitals, talking in a nails-down-a-chalkboard voice, and just being a frustration for the ninety minutes.The other point that really frustrated me throughout this movie, is the jokes. Nobody laughed in the theater. Actually, there is one humorous part in the beginning, during a montage of twins, talking about their relationship with one another, and one twin claims to talk to his twin in 'whale' language. Kudos, whale man, for the only laugh of the afternoon. The jokes aren't funny. Things are seemingly thrown in at random for laughs, like a hobo joining their Thanksgiving (??!). It is almost insulting to think we would find the humor funny. This frustrating feeling will last with you throughout the movie.Another strange fact is the celebrities. My poor, sweet, Johnny Depp. Perhaps you are a friend of Adam, perhaps you were looking to pay off something, because I can't believe you would appear in such a movie. I know why the movie hired you of course- I went in with the high hope of seeing Depp, unable to believe he would act in such a disaster. So in reality, Depp's five minute role as himself was what lured in most of the movie's profit. Johnny Depp, it's alright, Im sure its not your fault, you may weep on Mr Burton's shoulder, vowing to never leave his side again.Al Pachino is also in this movie (confused yet?) as he is pretty much a big part of the story, because Jack wants him to do a commercial for a new brand of coffee (chino...gettit? Aha..ha) and Pachino is struck by Jill and is in love with her, who does not return his affections.What results is a very predictable and unfunny climax which tries to shadow the climax of Mrs Doubtfire but is so insulting it is hard to watch, and some lovey family stuff is thrown in as well, which confuses me whether this movie was intended for children. Jill gets with the guy we knew from the first moment we saw would end up with her, and everything is happy and gay.THEN we get the most god-awful scene in cinema history. A rapping Al Pachino. Rapping. Yes, you read that correctly. About coffee. Doesn't that just make you feel all dead inside? For the love of god, do not see this movie. Make no attempt to see this movie. Don't even rent it. It is a disaster.",Jack and Jill
174,sawaf_sims2,Really Entertaining !,10,3 December 2011,"OK first let me start by saying, this movie got a lot of hate review on IMDb for no reason who ever watched it I'm 100% sure they laughed ,else they don't really enjoy comedyAdam has been making great movies for years and every single one is better than the other Jack And Jill is a story about twins (brother and sister) which shows that the sister is annoying to the brother, the movie starts a bit slow in comedy to show you the story and what it's aboutbut it all works out as i think this is one of the funniest film i watched and it was really well made, and i was really surprised when i saw a lot of hate comments, while in the cinema everyone was laughingi really recommend everyone to watch it, you wont regret it!.10/10",Jack and Jill
175,SimGunther,Jack and Jill - Worst comedy of all time?,1,18 August 2013,"I have the uncivil duty of reviewing what is considered a universally panned failure of a film as it swept the 2011 Razzies, which celebrates the worst films of the year. After seeing all of the horrible reviews about the film, I am here to inform you that those reviews are sadly correct. I have absolutely no clue as to why abhorrent movies like these still take hundreds of millions of dollars every year from idiots who can't tell the difference between ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Disaster Movie"".This comedy, if you can even call it that, failed to get even a giggle out of me due to the horrendous screenplay that tries to make humor for kids (since it is trying to be a PG movie), but ends up falling flat on its face at every turn. This makes even the laughably short running time of 90 minutes feel like an eternity, though I'm thankful it wasn't any longer or I would have lost all of my sanity watching this horrible excuse of a film. These are some of the most irritating and unlikable characters I have ever seen in any film, except for Katie Holmes, who is severely underdeveloped (again, thanks to the laughable excuse of a screenplay).The only good part about the film is Al Pacino as he gets the only funny line of the film, which turns out to be a meta-joke relating to his impact(or lack thereof) as an actor in the 2000s. What makes the film different from all the other detestable comedies and what also does not make it the worst film in history is that I can see effort put into this film, even if it does jam in product placement constantly. At least it's better than ramming down poorly written movie spoof jokes every second like ""Disaster Movie"". There is at least some comprehensible story, even if it is a horrible story.The only excuse that you should have for watching this cringe-inducing film is if you have some friends over on a Friday night with nothing to do and you want to have a drinking game about all of the unfunny jokes in this film. Otherwise, avoid this at all costs.This movie doesn't deserve a rating, period.",Jack and Jill
176,crazygirl2014-66-130250,Good laugh,7,20 February 2017,"Whilst its not the best film I've seen, its certainly not the worst by a long way. Children and those with a childish sense of humour will love this. I found parts of it hilarious. Especially during the ball game she's been invited to then later having a side effect of Mexican food, letting rip in the bathroom, then having to open the windows and light a candle. I found it has a nice ending where she finds the man who wants to be with her.",Jack and Jill
177,cocoarad-1,weak comedy effort..disappointing,2,25 March 2012,"There are movies (one of them being ""Don't mess with the Zohan"") that are so bad they're actually generating some kind of cult following because they're simply over-the-top. ""Jack and Jill"" is a very sad example of a movie being flat-out boring, unfunny and inspiring nothing but a bad overall feeling. Adam Sandler seems to have finally broken any connection with reality and positive criticism from his peers, and keeps on making supposedly funny movies when, in fact, all the fun has gone out of him. This ego trip that generates breaking the basic rule of comedies with guys in drag, rule that states that the audience is in on the joke, some of the characters in the movie are not, thus it creates a funny setup, is not observed by Sandler who is utterly unconvincing as a female character, being obviously Adam Sandler, and when the audience realizes that both the characters in the movie as well as the audience itself are the dumb ones that don't realize this character is obviously a guy in drag, then you get this extremely unpleasant vibe. What i felt bad about is that a couple of great actors joined this project, based, probably, on Sandler's reputation of creating those kind-of-stupid but funny movies. This one is the first I actually chose to watch, that I couldn't bear watching for more than thirty minutes, and it was a difficult time span. So disappointed...",Jack and Jill

Time to pack it up and retire!,1,18 February 2012,"We went to Blockbuster to find something for the kids for the weekend - and just seeing Adam's face on a DVD cover makes me throw up even without any food in the stomach. However I had to give in as the kids picked this movie.I watched it between the house chores and cleaning up after the Sunday dinner and sat down with a beer halfway through the movie. The kids looked dull and I had not heard any laughters yet - just to confirm that they made a bad choice.Adam should get the #1 goofiest movie award and get out of Hollywood. Seriously all his movies are just nerdy and this time he is playing a double role of his ""twin sister"".It's a shame that someone dragged in Al Pachino into this dumb and dull movie - such a great actor has really sunk low in his old days. Why on earth does he waste his time on such crap? Then we have loser #3; Katie Holmes. She is probably still trying to convince her husband that she still can act. Cute as she is, she does not need to waste her time in Hollywood with Tom's millions of dollars that he is throwing around. She should stay home and raise the kids. That Tom Cruise is still flushing out money to the Scientology sect is just a shame. One day he will wake up and find out that he wasted half his life and millions of dollars to support the cult leader David Miscavige who is living a luxury life on his accounts.Katie! Last thing we heard in the gossip magazines was that you are leaving Tom because of Scientology? GOOD! Make him chose! Your acting might give you better roles and chances with him out of the picture.This is a seriously dumb and dull movie. The kids didn't even enjoy it and next time I will remind them about Adam and his goofy escapades.No wonder we never saw it in the theaters and it will probably also be very short lived in the RedBox stands. Barf!",Jack and Jill
180,missionbegins2011,writing brings the fun down...,6,29 November 2011,"I had to see this being a huge sandler fan, despite the universal dismal reviews, below are the FAQ's that i will try to answer about jack and jill1. Does it deserve IMDb 2.8 rating? No, it is not that bad, unfortunately it became the object of hatred for critics and public for no reason2. Is it better than average sandler fares? Not as good as any sandler film till 2008, better than 'just go with it' (which i thought was the lamest sandler movie till date), as good as 'grown ups' may be3. what doesn't work about this movie? the writing, the dialogues should have been more funnier, although its not totally lame, there are some funny lines in between and some physical comedy which saves the movie from a total fiasco.4. How are the performances? Sandler is usual, shouting and screaming which will please his fans as usual, he looks pretty funny as jill and pulls out good physical comedy, Al pacino is a great actor make no mistake, but i felt that he was a miscast, he is too serious an actor to mock himself and because of that in his screen time the movie loses momentum over the humour, i felt that an actor of sandler brand like rob schnieder would have done justice to that role, Katie holmes is there for 15 minutes which is as good as a special appearance.5. Is it going to be detrimental to sandler's career? Nooverall i did not find this movie bad, it was entertaining in parts and sandler fans can watch it, The strength of the movie was its premise which i felt was one of the best ideas, i mean sandler playing his own twin sister made me laugh from the first go, but the ordinary writing stopped it from becoming a happy gilmore or a billy madison...6/10...",Jack and Jill
181,jamie-crump,Jack and Jill went up the hill and made an awful movie,1,15 March 2012,"Adam ""facking"" Sandler makes me want to go out and start an only sexual relationship with a homeless person because you know what that's better then watching anything with the Sandman in it. I would prefer to have Danny Dyer in the film because every couple of minutes you would hear, ""Hi i'm Danny Dyer"" (in a cockney accent), this would probably bring more laughs then the Sandman and the whole of Jack and Jill. Going off the Sandman for a minute I thought I would comment on the other acting atrocities in this film, Al Pacino a 7 time academy award nominee and a one time winner decided to be in this film I can only assume he did this because he wasn't quite good enough to get in Danny Dyer's latest film. Katie Holmes is reasonably fit, I mean she's no 9 or 10 but she's at least a 7 and a half so she can't have been sleeping with Sandler, maybe she was emotionally distraught after not getting in the latest Danny Dyer film as well. Maybe Tom Cruise her hubby was too busy saving the world again in the stupidly named mission impossible to advise her not to do it. It is stupidly named as he always makes it, perhaps they should rename it mission improbable or mission unlikely but we've got a chance.Adam ""facking"" Sandler aka the Sandman is the white Eddie Murphy,(This makes sense if your familiar with my reviews)he really makes me as angry as a fat man walking past a closed Greggs.

So take my review with a grain of salt if you loved that flick.This movie is fun, and funny. If you loved any of Sandler's CD's from back in the day Jill's voice won't sound unfamiliar. It's actually quite comforting to be reminded of the 90's Sandler again.I am not sure what other reviewers were expecting for this flick, but it's a pretty typical Sandler flick to me. I swear I feel like sometimes online something catches fire (like hating this flick), and everyone just runs with it.Anyway, if you have the time in your life to waste on any Adam Sandler flick this one doesn't disappoint if you aren't expecting Shakespeare or something utterly intellectual.",Jack and Jill

There were no laughs, or giggling, not even scoffing. This movie was just plain boring.Imagine this: You're at a social event and you hear two people bickering, it's not endearing, you don't care about them, you just watch them hoping it will stop, since you also don't give a rat's ass about what they're bickering over.That's this movie.Or Imagine this: You're watching paint dry.That's this movie. Just imagine Adam Sandler arguing against Adam Sandler. I can't imagine anything worse. A double dose of Adam Sandler. Actually, Jill was more endearing than the man himself and she's an annoying character on purpose, who we are supposed to dislike. But to be honest, Sandler's character was the lamest out of all. Once again, Sandler tries to big himself up 'the righteous family man,with a hot wife, who is plagued by his annoying sister! He tries to keep calm and have a nice relationship with her, but alas, she's just too much!"" His character was exactly the same type he has played for the last ten years and that's why I say Jill is actually a tiny bit likable. But even so I would not recommend this Adam Sandler show to anybody. Fart jokes, awful CG gags, distasteful jokes about Mexicans being gardeners and crossing the border (how is Hollywood still not sick of these? Do we still find it funny?), jokes about Jews, product placement, hysterical screaming.... Oh, Jhonny Depp makes a cameo for some reason... Not even a smile.

It's not funny. Not funny. If you see it in a shop and say "" hey that looks good"" your lying to yourself don't waste the 10p that its worth. Im serious. I bet the director thought this film is so good it will replace the shaw shank redemption on IMDBs top 250 films of all time. It's actually at the top of the worst films of all time.

It's either because I can't recall any movie of his that I've actually liked or maybe because I simply haven't seen any. Anyways, it's time to review this spectacularly, blatantly and uncannily unfunny comedy that brings to the table an entirely new approach to the genre of comedy: having the two main protagonists played by the same actor.It really did seem like the trailer was a wild assembly of all of the remotely funny bits of the movie. While the trailer produced maybe the appearance of a faint smile, the movie produced heavy eyelids. Some movies leave you with the feeling ''Why the F*** did I just watch this piece of?''

I knew going in that it was not going to be an excellent film. But, I thought, there would be a few laughs and some funny moments in it. I was terribly mistaken. Adam Sandler was terrible as 'Jill'. We were supposed to believe that the character was actually a woman. All I saw was Adam Sandler in a dress with a stupid voice.The character of Jack is unlikeable and mean, almost to the point where you wonder how he has any family or friends.Katie Holmes, which I usually enjoy watching in films, was a non entity in it. Her character was one dimensional and boring. She might as well have not been there at all.Al Pacino, why did you do this movie? He is an amazing actor with amazing credits to his name. But this? Really?The jokes were pointless and not funny. I'm really tired of 'fart' jokes. Been there, done that. Not funny. The only funny part of the film was Jack's son, he had a couple of funny lines. Basically the only time I laughed was when he was on screen doing something.If I had paid for this movie, I would have walked out to get my money back.

The film try's to be something more than it is creating awkward and very stupid situations throughout the film. Al Pacino stars as himself and some of the parts he is in made me smile, and that was about it. But the movie is just unfunny, providing lame jokes, slapstick comedy which only really works if used properly. If i was you, i will completely avoid this one.

I regret the decision to let my seven year old pick the flick tonight-- I hope other parents don't make the same mistake I did. It should have been rated PG-13.

196,joshjmuir,Al Pacino underrated,6,18 March 2013,"May contain ""spoilers"" To be honest it wasn't the best Adam Sandler offering however the product had some memorable moments. Standout performances include Al Pacino who brought a manic presence to the film, and it was nice to see him do something perhaps out of his comfort zone. He was probably the funniest aspect of this film. He played a very much over the top version of himself much like Neil Patrick Harris did in the Harold and Kumar films. Their were plenty of other celebrity appearances within this film and they where involved in some memorable moments, notably Johnny Depp, Shaquille O'Neil and David Spade and many more. I thought Adam Sandler's Jill was very annoying and hard to relate to, she was cringe worthy to say the least. Still the contrast with the character Jack was not that far removed he too was a major ass.Regardless of this, the film managed to keep me interested with the performances of the rest of the cast, the unsung heroes of this film. Actors like Allen Covert, who played Otto a homeless man that seems to live in Jack's backyard. Even a shout out for the actor that played Jack's son, as he managed to keep things light and played his character more realistically than a lot of the other actors. Watch out for Dana Carvey who plays a puppeteer, it was nice to see him on the big screen again, even if it was brief.To be honest at times Katie Holmes seemed out of place in this film but eventually that stopped being an issue and she blended into the mix. Eugenio Derbez played Felipe the gardener I guess sort of standing in for Rob Schneider who was visibly absent in this film although he was mentioned. Whilst his performance wasn't terrible it just lacked the schneider touch.Overall the film was misguided and lacked direction but was redeemed by the actors, who managed to make something out this confused endeavour. I guess for me this film is a guilty pleasure, so bad that it is good. I like the fact that it awkward at times because real life is like this as well. I like films that provoke mixed emotions. This might not be for everyone but if your an Adam Sandler fan you should at least watch it.",Jack and Jill

This movie was not only cleaner than a lot of the trash that's out there but funnier. I don't get the low reviews. I really like this movie.

198,beccahabig,Funny. Sandler delivers his usual brand of comedy.,10,22 August 2016,"Personally, I loved this movie. The undertones are that of close family ties and of one person wanting to be recognized and loved as her own person. Yes, there's a lot of silliness to this movie and no, Sandler doesn't look good in drag, but what do you expect? Adam Sandler isn't known for making Oscar-winning movies. His shtick is making silly, funny, loaded-with-innuendos comedies. My only complaint about this movie would be the overdone and paranoid references to anti- semitism. He overdid it when it came to that but otherwise, I thought the movie was great. The character of Jill is funny, vulnerable and yes...kind of creepy but she's supposed to be! I did think Katie Holme's considerable acting talent could have been to more use but I enjoyed watching her in this film. She's a solid actress.",Jack and Jill

How did Sandler feel after filming this 'yeah that was great lets do another one'. Please do not waste your time in seeing this, read a book, fly a kite, spend time with the family doing anything other than watching this rubbish. Surely nothing good can come from this? Mr Pacino, what on earth were you thinking of agreeing to play a role in this? How will Sandler come back from this, can he recover from this, time will tell?",Jack and Jill
203,Rikamortisk9,"Seriously, WTF?",1,18 February 2012,"First off, I want to say this film deserves 0 out of 10. I've been a big Adam Sandler fan for a long time, and I was really looking forward to see his newest film when I first heard about it, but what a load of crap. I don't know even where to begin to describe the faults with this ""movie"". Sandler has managed to somehow kill everything that should have worked for this film. I mean, he has Al Pacino in it FFS, and he has managed to turn the Godfather into a whiny, boring weirdo. You get the impression from very early on that Al Pacino didn't want to be there, and the only reason he agreed to do it is because he either lost a bet or is in really bad need of a pay check. It's nice to see Sandler brought his usual crew with him, but they were all added as a side thought after he wrote a film that he could be on screen in for the entire 90 minutes that it dragged on for. Both characters he plays are awful to watch and a pain to listen to as he seems to think he has to be screaming to try and get a chuckle from the audience. The whole trailer can be seen in the first 15 minutes of the film, and that never bodes well for the rest of a movie. Katie Holmes seems to be the only actor who enjoyed being there and you never get to feel a connection with her as anytime she has a line either version of Sandler jumps in and kills the moment. The only characters that deserve a chuckle are the son and the bird, and even they only get a chuckle because of how awful everything else that's happening is. To sum up, if you want a laugh while watching Adam Sandler, watch ANY of his other films, because this one SUCKS!!!",Jack and Jill
204,bootucci,One of the best films this year!,10,12 November 2011,"This movie is so amazing and funny, I nearly cried because it was so funny. Dennis Dugan has made a work making this film. I feel amazed and astonished because I haven't seen so many great films this year.I love how Adam Sandler plays both his roles, man and women. He really takes it funny with the role of Jill, and Jack (how he gets so annoyed with Jill). I sat there in the theater (when it was finished), hoping there would be more to it. This was so much better than any of these movies: Abduction, The Big Year, Harry PotterVII, and The Smurfs. I recommend you watch this movie, even if you're not into comedy films. It is a good use of money because the whole family will laugh. I hope they make a remake to this, because I would be first in line to see it.",Jack and Jill

While not every joke hit home for me, there were a few that made me laugh every now and again. Adam Sandler may not be great in drag, but he gave an alright duel performance. The story and characters were not too strong, but that's not why we watch Adam Sandler films.My biggest problem is how over hated this movie is. I hear so many people calling it both one of the worst comedies and one of the worst overall movies ever made. I say, is it really ""one of the worst"" bad? I would understand some hate, but ""one of the worst ever""? I don't think that's warranted at all.",Jack and Jill

There , one can see the brilliance of Al Pacino's comedy value as he parodies himself. I think Pacino should have been involved in comedy more, much like R.De Niro, but it seems writers didn't want to spoil his mafia profile all these years. Also this movie could be seen as a Pacino play throughout. I think Sandler's strength in comedy lies elsewhere. He should have left this cross-dressing slapstick to some English actor, they are far more versatile and able on that kind of play. Anyway, his is a MUST see scene.",Jack and Jill

I love Adam Sandler movies and to have one I could share with the kids was great. I'm guessing most of the bad reviews came from peops without kids. We all laughed and enjoyed it. Good family fun movie. I think some people expect so much from movies that they forget the fun aspect. I have an image of people sitting in front of their TV with a whip saying "" make me happy now!"" or ""entertain me"".

Why does Adam Sandler insist on releasing this utter pile of tripe upon the world?, oh yeah of course, it's obvious, money. This isn't a film, it's a RIP OFF! Anyone who went to see this film and likes it or believes that spending time and money on it is a good thing, are clearly far too stupid to understand that Adam Sandler has them by the wallet, or they just live in this sweet illusion of a world where there's no such thing as independent thought and intelligence. NEVER have I seen a film (I say seen, watched about half of it, couldn't watch any more it was like torture) more blatant about ticking boxes to suit a lowest common denominator demographic, sure I've seen films like that, but this is on a completely new level, the 'humour' is completely phoned in and contrived in every single way, no thought or care has been put into it, no matter what fans of Sandler will say, I recommend this film to anyone with a brain cell count lower than 3, I'm sure they'll love it.And don't get me started on the big names in this film, it's obvious Sandler threw a tonne of money at some actual talent to give his film just a shred of credibility in order to try and make this legit entertainment, if this is seen in any way as legit entertainment, then I'm the Pope.

217,BenRittenhouse674,"Not one of his best, but definitely an entertaining guilty pleasure",7,23 November 2011,"I never thought I would enjoy Adam Sandler in drag as much as I did. In 2011's Jack and Jill, Adam plays two characters, twins Jack and Jill Sadlestein. Jack is the relatively normal one, with a beautiful wife (Katie Holmes, in an average phoned-in performance), kids, and a good job as an ad executive. He's trying to get Al Pacino (played by himself) for a hilarious commercial you just have to see. His lonely, stereotypical middle-aged Bronx Jewish sister Jill has no family where she lives so she comes for an extended visit that begins with Thanksgiving and goes into the New Year. Jack and Jill tolerate each other, and Jill tries to find love through online dating, leading to good old Norm MacDonald appearing. Yet, Al Pacino falls in love with Jill and asks Jack to get her to date him. They go on a cruise, and it ends like most Adam Sandler movies.The jokes are highly juvenile (expected from a PG-rated Adam Sandler movie), yet you still want to laugh at them. There's many cameos that I honestly didn't expect, including one from a major superstar. I recommend it as a good movie to show your kids to get them into Adam Sandler, maybe after Bedtime Stories. It has some inappropriateness, mainly suggestiveness due to the cross-dressing, and Al Pacino.Overall, I recommend it as a nice matinée, or a Redbox rental, if you want a good chuckle.

Jack and Jill does a superb job of providing a good laugh for all age audiences, the way this is done is much like ""Shrek"" or ""puss in boots"" giving adults non-graphic, non explicit ADULT humor in ways only older audiences can perceive. the movie does drag here and there, but somehow a pivotal scene moves the plot forward when things seem they have dug to deep into trying with this film. nevertheless, I do not know if reviewers on IMDb have even watched this film completely; to me, it seems as if a person reads a few reviews about a particular film and decides to ""go with"" other peoples opinions without having ever watched it. Bottom line, this film is at least worth a rent or a buy for a 5.00 bin DVD. and that's coming from a person who is not very drawn to comedy's.",Jack and Jill

Adam Sandler crapped out a spectacularly disastrous title in which the look of constipation on his face sums it all up into ""Are you kidding me?!"" I think picking my nose would be more entertaining than watching this movie.

The amount of products being advertised - literally advertised - is unbearable, and made me sad.

I had no idea just how much I'd hate it. Even my family who fall in the typical Adam Sandler fan base, a.k.a. they laugh at fart jokes, hated it. I don't even consider this a movie.

It is an obnoxious, lazy, pandering, insulting schlock-fest filled to the brim with shameless advertising and pointless scenes featuring juvenile gags about Mexicans and people falling over. Try to think of the worst, bottom of the barrel comedies you know. You may think of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, The Zookeeper, or other atrocious Sandler vehicles such as Grown Ups 2 or Pixels. However, those awful movies are all incredible compared to the vile stench that is Jack and Jill.

Oh, and there is a lot of product placement. Well, I saw this movie with my two tween girls, and they laughed themselves silly. Yes, the humor was slapstick and silly, just like most Adam Sandler movies. Yes, the premise is ridiculous, since identical twins (those with ""twin powers"" can't be different sexes. Yes, it is crazy to think the Al Pacino would be interested in Adam Sandler in drag and perform a rap in a donut commercial (""Burn this. This must never be seen"" - very funny scene). If you thought you were coming to see high art, you must have missed the trailers (or the movie poster). There were some laugh-out-loud moments, and there were some underwhelming attempts at low-brow humor that did not even make my kids laugh. Overall, however, I think tweens and early teens would like it. I did not quite understand Sandler's annoyance at his sister - most of the sibling rivalry must have taken place before the movie. Most of the movie, the male twin just seems to be self serving and mean. However, the New Year's party seen did seem genuine and sweet (even though he is being sweet to himself, which is a lot of disbelief to suspend).

234,drownbunny,It really is that bad,1,21 January 2013,"I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen. There are some films that can get by because it falls into a certain category such as a bad horror movie can be good because its bad. Adam Sandler has fallen into this category as of late the phrase ""Its bad but its Sandler."" is used more than often to describe his movies but I promise you this is just as bad as everyone has said. Sandler plays duel roles as Jack and Jill twin siblings which is a excuse for Sandler to dress in drag and do his high pitch Jewish voice, that's the joke and it goes on for about 90 dull minuets.Jack is a rich guy working in advertising and his new goal is to land Al Pacino in a coffee commercial (who turns in the only funny moments in the film) His twin sister Jill comes to visit for the holidays and she is the most annoying person in the world. She is disgusting and knows nothing about the modern world, she proceeds to pick a fight with about every character in the film and then begins to cry after she does it, this goes on for the whole movie. I honestly don't understand this plot. Jack is played like a job obsessed jerk but he does everything to make his family happy. He takes Jill around so she can complete her to do list, setting her up on dates and letting her extend her stay longer and longer because you guessed it Al Pacino has fallen in love with Jill but she wants nothing to do with him but its the only way Jack can land him for his commercial.There is no redeeming quality to this film and the only amusing parts come not from Sandler but the multiple celebrity cameos like Johnny Depp and Shaq. The first thirty minuets of the film contains so many jump cuts to different scenes that I thought something was wrong with the movie, conversations seem to end in the middle and we just move on to the next.I watched this movie with my 14 year old twin nieces and there 8 year old sister, no one laughed. After awhile the older ones stuck there heads in there Ipads and zoned out for the rest of the film leaving me to watch the rest.There is a reason this won so many Razzies and it deserved everyone of them.

And another thing, it's Adam Sandler. Not 4-letter words or sexual innuendo. He's saved comedy. If it weren't for him, where would comedy be? Research that!

Took me half an hour to work that out. But once I did, I realised that this was a fantastic film, the high-brow sort of comedy we have all come to expect from Adam Sandler.The man has set the bar extremely high this time, might be hard to top this one. But I do hope he does. My only real concern is for Al Pacinos mental health. This man is deeply disturbed, I mean he played a bizarre parody of himself. It was almost as if he were portraying an amalgamation of every single character he has ever played on screen in his long and illustrious career.All in all a quality film, marred somewhat by the casting of Katie Holmes as Jacks wife Erin. I say this only because she is not a high quality actress, certainly not in the same echelon of say, a Bridgette Wilson or a Fairuza Balk. These are capable actresses of a high calibre. I actually believe that Adam Sandler would have been able to play a third character. Why stop at two? He could play Jack, Jill and Erin. Any more than that is ridiculous, Eddie Murphy territory.Katie Holmes incompetence as an actress is almost as deplorable as her incompetence as a wife. Perhaps this film was the catalyst for her divorce from the great Tom Cruise. Did she not ask him permission? Did he feel threatened by her amazing chemistry with Adam Sandler? Or was Adam Sandlers superiorority the only thing threatening Tom?In summary, a feel good romp the whole family will enjoy. Unless your family supports terrorism.",Jack and Jill

239,uspattys2,Who told Sandler he was good as a woman?,1,4 April 2012,"How on earth was this film financed and put together? Does Sandler have that much clout in Hollywood? It was badly directed, badly lit and photographed and awkward to watch. D Dugan the director has to be responsible for letting Sandler make such a fool of himself. As for Pacino thats a complete mystery but he is clearly becoming a bigger egocentric as the years pass, his agent must carry some of the responsibility here. Adam Sandler is such a one trick pony (as are many of the so called comedy actors in Hollywood) Surely a revolution is just around the corner with strong original plot lines, passionate acting and a modicum of integrity as I feel we are being blatantly ripped off.",Jack and Jill
240,elyar_z,Awful ! Total Wate of time !,1,7 August 2012,"This is the worst Adam Sandler movie I have ever seen , Ridiculous story and very disgusting jokes ! this may be a funny film for a 10 years old kid ! I was so surprised to see Al Pacino and Johnny Depp in the movie !!! I wish Al Pacino had not done this! Although they both play their own real characters but I really do not understand why on earth a great actor like Al Pacino would play in such a lame movie ... The Only good part of this movie is it's beginning and endings where real twins talk about themselves and their stories which is not part of the story at all !! Adam Sandler is a very talented comedian but I believe he still stands second to Jim Carrey !! ... but He could have done much much better !",Jack and Jill
241,importuner923,Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!,1,12 November 2011,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend and to be honest wasn't expecting much. But man is this movie awful. None of the ""jokes"" if you can call it that were funny at all. Some actually cringe worthy. If you want a quick answer then here it is: don't waste your money don't see this movie! To elaborate The character Jill should have been played by a female actress for one thing. I realized that was part of the gag that Adam Sandler played both parts so they would be identical but really it just makes the movie worse. Sandler's interpretation of a female voice is so bad and annoying it makes you want to punch him in the face to shut him up. This is one of those rare movies where I actually wanted to get up and leave the theater. And I haven't seen a movie like that for a while.",Jack and Jill

Why so much hating to this movie.I watched it today & It was Fun. I never got bored.. I watched lots of movies of Sandler & he is a really fun guy.. Sandler did great job in this movie & Katie Holmes did a great job too. She is still hot.. I really laughed when i was Watching this movie. Need to say About Al pacino too. I never thought Him as funny character. But in this movie he did good. Love Al pacino.I Loved the movie.. I Enjoyed the movie.

I am so sad that I wasted an hour plus of my life, when I had toilets to clean, ironing to do and there was a perfectly good episode of 'Neighbours' I could have watched.Questions I have regarding this movie: 1: Did Katie really want to be out of the house that bad? 2: Did Al do something bad that Adam has a video or photos of? 3: Does Adam have some kind of problem with script reading staff? 4: How much extra Co2 has been needlessly added to the planet in production of plastics etc. used in the DVD/Bluray issue of this steaming pile?Sorry Adam, this is an all time low, take a break, start reading the scripts, invest in quality not quantity.

244,fcardamone,Jack and Jill was not that bad,5,9 April 2012,"I watched Jack and Jill with my husband's family after Good Friday lunch. Now I must admit, this sort of film is not my cup of tea but I thought it was not at all that bad. We all had a good laugh and it kept us entertained for an hour and a half. I don't think it's meant to be taken seriously, it is a comedy after all and the fact that we saw Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and David Spade in it was well worth the effort. It had the usual toilet humor, farts, diarrhea and a sweaty bed but the cockatoo almost stole the show. I have seen films worse than this and I don't think it deserved the harsh criticism it has received. We all have someone in the family that we are embarrassed about and want to get rid of at times and this exaggerated the fact. I think Adam Sandler has a lot of talent and I don't think we've seen the best of him yet. I would love it if he tackled a really serious role, just to see what he is really made of.",Jack and Jill
245,Aaron-67-987993,You have to be a true Sandler snl fan to like this movie,8,11 March 2012,"I wrote this huge review, and now I can't paste it in, so here is the short and sweet. If you are a true Sandler fan. If you loved snl skits like opera man and canteen boy. If you loved his movies like Happy Gilmore and billy Madison, or movies his crew are in like grandma's boy, the likes of Covert, Swardson. Well then you will sit back and laugh and enjoy it for the silly concept it is.It's funny because exactly what I hear on the ""on demand"" promo is exactly what you get. All this slap stick crazy stuff going on yet the wife in the movie keeps you grounded and makes your mind think its believable.I read all the reviews and then went with my gut to decide to watch it. It was a good laugh with the family. To me you have to embrace it all for what it is and take to heart the meaning. Sandler opens with many real sets of twins discussing likes and dislikes of being a twin. To me that sets you up to say here is a guy showing you that this is a heartwarming topic, now let me make 90 minutes of slapstick comedy about it. Covert all though a small roll is funny when in it. Al Pachino gave me a new respect for his range. He was good at being a slapstick version of what media makes us think his real life is. If you liked the silliness of happy Gilmore or Madison this right there with it. The difference is those where both about a young man's journey growing up, this is in a family setting so the humor is structured different and has to be. The kids are great in the movie, the subtle and not much discussed issues the kids have bring underlying humor. His adopted son tapes everything to himself, his daughter dresses her doll exactly like her no matter what activity.I just feel that you may not like it to an 8 like me, but I would give happy Gilmore or billy Madison the same, but anyone that goes less than a 5 doesn't like Sandler's comedy or his movies in the first place as a whole. If you are a true Sandler fan you will enjoy this.",Jack and Jill
246,Josh-hodgetts,Jack and Jill went up the hill; why did they have to come down?,1,21 March 2012,"Well well well, what do we have here? Another Adam Sandler film that fails to be funny? One that only further pushes he career down the toilet like a stubborn turd? Adam Sandler USED to create some funny films guys, Waterboy has to be one of the funniest films i watched when i was small.So here we are, faced with a NEW film, where Adam dresses up as a woman and pretends to be his own twin. EVERYTHING. and i mean, EVERYTHING about the characters in this film is freakin' annoying, i truly did hate all of them before the film ended. We have, Jill, a lonely woman that looks like a UFC Heavyweight, thats just so annoying, i began searching OTHER FILMS whilst watching. Jack (Adam Sandler) plays a well established person that has made it in life. (and is just me, or is he getting a bit familiar with this, see Grown Ups)I don't really wanna ruin this for y.. just kidding, of course i will. DON'T watch this film, the studio has already earned their money back from this film, so anyone else that rents/buys is just going to add more money to that repetitive, dull, annoying film producing machine known as Adam Sandler. Sorry to say this, but i will NOT be renewing my Adam Sandler's Fanclub Magazine. Also, Al Pachino, really? Were you that desperate for money? You were SCARFACE. SCARFACE.Jack and Jill is the very bottom of the comedy barrel, Jack and Jill is so bad, its below the barrel. Actually, Jack and Jill is that awful, it shouldn't even be said in the same sentence as barrel.",Jack and Jill

Thankfully I didn't chose the movie but hey you can't always go see a great movie!Don't waste your money. Honestly, what a waste of time. I like Adam Sandler but what was he thinking? I did laugh but I was laughing at the stupidity of some of the gags.Al Pacino was in it and he is an actor I hold immense respect for. He was either on drugs when he said yes to this or is broke.I know I'm really ripping into the film but it was just the worst movie I have ever watched.",Jack and Jill
248,Ashleyartsy,Brilliant Masterpiece,10,13 March 2012,"The reviews for this artwork are very inaccurate. 'Jack and Jill' has a perfect amount of hilarity and composure of characters it's like you could live their life. They have the greatest balance of love and affection with a side of crazy antics that make you want to laugh your way home in the middle of the film. Of course, you wouldn't want to leave, for this is a brilliant masterpiece. The jokes are very cunning and fresh. This will keep you laughing all the way through and have that feeling of gratitude when you're finished. It'll last in your mind for days and make you want to see it again and again. Adam Sandler did a better job on this than 'Big Daddy'. I think 'Jack and Jill' might even reign over 'Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star'. This is a must-see and absolute joyous occasion. My rate: 10 STARS!! Bravo.",Jack and Jill

Please avoid at all costs and save your money!!Comedy has changed since Adam sandlers early days with the likes of Happy Gilmore, films have changed but Adam sandler clearly hasn't if he is still turning out this rubbish.Al Pacino shouldn't be within a hundred miles of this film I don't know what he was thinking.

Just because it was decent to watch that doesn't mean its not funny. Me and my friends we loved it.Some scenes made me laugh so much that i got tears in my eyes. If you are free and you just wanna laugh then this is a cool one.If you liked (Grown Ups) and (Just Go With It) then you have to watch this!!!

I am a die hard Sandler fan, honestly you should know what to expect when you go to see his movies, fart jokes pretty much, and these are abundant. Because I enjoy Sandler I found this movie laugh out loud funny, as did my family. Plenty of cringe worthy acting moments, mistimed lines, inappropriate outbursts from Jack. But it's bearable, there is nothing intelligent about the comedy, just an easy going, funny, immature movie. Not award winning but a decent escape. If you get Sandler, see it.

Jack was not funny and Jill made me fell uncomfortable. When I heard that some people at school thought this movie was funny,I really wanted to tell them they were idiots and need to watch real Adam Sandler movies!

Who cares? :) Anyways, this film is NOT as bad as the critics make out. I went to go see it thinking it was the worst movie ever, and came out with a smile on my face. Sure, some of it was pretty immature but the rest was quite funny. I might have a weird sense of humour, but then apparently so does my friend. She enjoyed it and she's not a huge Adam Sandler film. It was pretty crazy seeing Adam playing Jack AND Jill but amusing as well. The story line kinda sucks, but the lines were funny and I liked it how it made a reference to the fairy tale (is Jack and Jill a fairy tale?!). I loved this film. 10/10.

It's Jill's bizarre and kooky personality that made me laugh. Something like 2017's Truth or Dare scary movie was the worst to me, lame, boring and ineffective in pulling out the hairs on my back out of terror IS the worst. At least, this movie teaches you to be more loving towards your relatives, not to be so hard on each other and the ones you love, in a humorous way. Do you think that one of the best actors out there, Al Pacino, would've accepted to play in the worst movie if he didn't think it would've been a hilarious movie to watch with the kids and laugh? Plus, it's full of multiple great actors all united, not just an indie film. So watch it if you're in a mood for goofy.",Jack and Jill

I love it shows how girls can be more rude than boys for instead.And I found it funny the boy who tapes things on him. Especially the pepper.I loved also to see Pacino.And I think this movie subtly, maybe too subtly, was showing how stupid it is to criticize a celebrity for showing some emotion. It made me think of the big scandal made of Tom Cruise's couch event, which was certainly a natural demonstration of emotion, and that many many people mocked, apparently without any consideration of hurting the feelings of Tom Cruise.There are many things that make me think that this movie speaks a bit about the Cruise life : the word ""cruise"" used, the conversion of Erin - Katie Holmes in the movie - to the religion of Jack, ...Bye. And why be so harsh? Oh and also I loved the little scenes in the beginning and the end of the movie. At the end, I especially loved when it was a little girl speaking about how her brother could put her back on her feet when she'd fall and feel bad.Very kind.Love, Leila",Jack and Jill

Twin that don't get along with each other. the Jill's voice (female sandler) is really annoying. I'ts a comedy movie that tried hard to be funny but unfortunately did not succeed. I can't help but wonder what's going on thru Sandler's mind when he made this. It's like watching Dexter and Dee Dee but as humans with the same exaggerations and comic antics. i guess it's only funny when it's cartoons. it's just plain bad. I gave it a chance, but halfway thru the movie i must admit the painful truth that i wasted my money on such a movie. it can even top my list of worst movies ever.",Jack and Jill

Al Pacinos performance in this movie makes me want do die in a hole and don't even get me started on adam sandlers performance watching him in this movie was like listening to fingernails against a chalkboard.

I remember watching you 1990 underrated classics suck as Happy Gilmore and the Waterboy but since the 2000s have come you have started to pull your self down from one of the all time most underrated comic actors to not just one of the worst actors In cinema history to one on the worst human beings in the last 25 years.First of all this film is just plain unwatchable. Their is literally a whole scene where the two main characters both played by Adam Sandler are both talking in what they call twin language, which is just them speaking complete gibberish. The acting is awful, the jokes are never funny and every time Jill speaks I cringed and thought ""why!? Just why would a human being make a film which no one who has even a bit of common scene would say is a good film"" I mean for f***s sake Al Pachino is in this film. AL PACHINO!!! One of my all time favourite actors is in this piece of s***. If Adam Sandler ever see's this review (which I very much doubt) I have one thing to say to him. ""DON'T PULL GREAT ACTORS DOWN WITH YOU"" Overall I can say this is the worst movie I have seen in my life and hope to never see it again.

Boy did I regret that decision. If you're lucky enough not to know this film's plot, let me tell you: Picture a workaholic businessman named Jack, played by Sandler. Now imagine his twin sister, also played by Sandler. Now imagine Sandler in drag won't leave. Next imagine Al bleeping Pacino is in love with Sandler in drag. Yes it's that type of movie.

It speaks to the basic tenets in our heart, that despite our family members, we will always in the end love them. This brilliant film highlights this idea in quality dialogue, with great directing and writing. All of our world's social situations, whether they are troubling or beneficiary, are displayed in this film, all the while having witty humor that can make the sternest of the stern chuckle with glee. The comedic factor of this statement about the human psyche really does a great job of not keeping the overall statement drown the audience in boredom.

The movie simply isn't funny, Adam Sandler did not need to play both Jack and Jill, the gimmicky setup did not work in Norbit and does even less so here. I wish I could say that the supporting cast had helped but it seemed to me hat every line fell flat, that most of the dialogue was punchline after punchline with never any setup, if there is no windup you're punch isn't going to have any force to it. The only reason I found myself able to give this movie more than one star is from one line by Al Pacino nearing the end of the movie. ""Burn this. It must never be seen, by anyone."" the only part of the movie that managed to make me laugh as it honestly seemed the only self awareness it had.

Oh yeah, he's an ""ad executive,"" which gives them convenient opportunities to show actual full length commercials. This includes a massive commercial for Dunkin Donuts that is even longer than a normal commercial you would see on TV. They even incorporate Dunkin Donuts into the main plot.So, somehow this....movie....has a budget of $79,000,000. This is a huge budget, and many fantastic movies have been made on similar or lower budgets. Yet this movie looks like it was made on a budget of under $1,000,000.

At first, we were concerned about the television commercials showing the entire flick, but then we were pleasantly surprised. I personally found myself laughing throughout the movie. While Adam Sandler had a great performance, for me it was Al Pacino who stole the show with his over the top antics. Sadly to say there were some things that were very implausible, but even these items did not distract too much from the movie itself. Jack and Jill is a feel-good movie that is supposed to make you laugh and have a great time. It delivers in that area. Of course if you are looking for something deep and moving with Oscar-winning performances, then you should be looking for something more like J. Edgar.",Jack and Jill

I am currently on a quest to watch all of his films but this one really pushed me to my limits.Usually Sandler films are enjoyable but forgettable, fluff to watch once, with a few gems here and there. Jack and Jill however feels as if it should be shown 24/7 in Guantanamo. Jill is written to be intentionally annoying, but not in the awkward Paul Blart way, more like that kid who wouldn't shut up in school. From trans jokes to Holocaust jokes, most of the comedy was of the extremely low hanging fruit variety. Even if you are high, stay away.",Jack and Jill

So, whenever I see a film, I like the references like ""You can do it"" (by Rob Schneider) and others. I had not read anything about this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that Al Pacino was in it, not only him but other celebrities such as Johnny Depp .. and this was awesome because actors playing themselves in ridiculous situations. Al Pacino did an amazing job, because he was able to make fun of himself, I laughed SO hard many times. ""This is L.A. we have Bruce Jenner playing whoever..."" LOL, or.. about his Oscar statue being broken.. ""Surprisingly I don't have others..."" hahahahaha. Very good! very funny movie, with great jokes! but don't expect a LIFE LESSON out of it, it's a no-brainer (as many other people have described it. It is very underrated here on IMDb, and I was impressed with that, I personally thought ""Grown Ups"" was really boring and it has higher rates than this one.. Go figure! Anyways, it's a good silly movie, with great actors! of course if you are one of these wanna-bes pretentious movie critics don't even bother going. Go see The Artist and be pleased with that!

Billy Madison and Big Daddy were cute films and huge hits. Each and every movie since, has been worse than the last. This movie is cringe worthy. He plays the same character in every film. What was cute in his first films is now fingernails-running-down-a-chalkboard bad. He obviously has a following that is very loyal and he is wildly successful with his production company. He churns out movie after movie with former Saturday Night Live alumni with his production company. He has played it very smart in that respect. But, with the exception of Kevin James, his movies continue to do less and less at the box office. But, because of his early success, he is a bankable actor and producer, so he gets the last laugh. That doesn't change the fact that this is a squirm-in-your-seat bad film. It is surprising that his films continue to get green lit without question. Sooner or later you would think they would want a hit from him to justify financing. All of his films aren't terrible. And I would love to be in his shoes. I just wish he would quit taking the easy way out and make a good film with good writing again.",Jack and Jill

I relish the actual hatred I can achieve at ruining 2 hours of my time. I look forward to blaming others for my choice at being gullible enough to waste money with some kind of mindless irrelevance. I love to hate meaningless (and worthless) productivity.I screwed up on this one.I was so ready to eat this movie alive. Chew, spit, chew, chew, spit and spit. But it became clear that this movie was meant to be bad. Not as bad as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"". That was inadvertently bad. J and J is worse. Worse in a good way. ""PNFOS"" had no A-List stars. This is full of stars. Full of stars in a ""Mad,Mad,Mad,Mad,World"" kind of way.

Not award-fine but fine. Sandler acted better than he had acted in other movies with better ratings. And if you prefer more ""classical"" actors, you have Al Pacino. Well, most people will go and watch the movie for Pacino's shake and only. This is the only movie to have him play himself. It's a rare thing to watch an actor like him doing that.

This movie is riddled with deviant sexual jokes that weren't even funny to the adults in the cinema because they are too cheap and disgusting. No one laughed at them at all.***spoiler!*** An example - A grown man licking a large ham in an extremely sexual way. It wasn't funny even a little bit. Also sick jokes about prostitutes and other sexual jokes and references that are HIGHLY inappropriate for children. I felt sorry for all the kids in the audience and I can tell you now there were very few laughs from them and none of them were drawn from Adamn Sandler.How can anyone in the process of making this movie think that the character of Jill was funny? She was unwatchable. I walk out of very few movies and I gave this one a lot longer than I should have for Adam to turn it around but the last straw was when Adam was trying to grab some cheap laughs from snot on a stick. That sums this movie up. I walked out and to be honest I judge those parents for not taking their kids out as well.,Jack and Jill

Even though she enjoyed the movie I was counting the minutes until it ended. Every scene, every line every moment of this 'movie' was unfunny, awkward, unrealistic (even for an unrealistic movie) and seriously unentertaining (not a word I know).

To me, the plot got lost in all the product placement and dazzle of Adam Sandler's friends list. (How many a-list celebs were in this movie, did they all lose a bet or something?) There were so many deliberate shots of famous people and of Sony logos and electronic devices, along with Cadillac automobiles, 5-star restaurants, lavish cruise lines and background scenery we missed the point of the story.Too bad, because twins are a special thing even if they are CGI, this movie absolutely missed that mark entirely.",Jack and Jill
291,thoughtlessconcept,2 Big Problems.,1,22 August 2012,"Let me start by saying that Allen Covert as a ""Homless Guy"" is probably the best part of this film. Now this movie right from the get go, seemed to have potential and this later shines through in some great laughs along the way, though two big problems rear their ugly heads early on.The first being that Adam Sandler is not really the most attractive man in the world and it seems like the makeup department failed to realizes this, because they put forward no effort to make him actually look like a woman. There is a point in the movie where you actually get to see how much work he goes through in his gender change, lets just say I'm not impressed. The other actors that play opposite genders in there movie tend to do it about a 100X more convincingly, when I see Madea I don't think ""Hey that's just Tyler Perry in drag"" I look at Madea and see a hilarious black woman, that if nobody had told me was a man I would have never figured out on my own. This is not the case with Jill, who you think of as a woman, but every time you see her breaks this illusion by simply being Adam Sandler in a wig.The second big problem with this movie is Katie Holmes, whether you love her or you hate her it just seems glaringly obvious that she didn't belong in this movie. I've never looked at Katie Holmes as a comedy actress and that is probably because she has never made me laugh and after watching this movie that record has continued. I don't think she's a bad actress by any means, but there were probably about a thousand better options for the role. She doesn't play off of Sandler very well and they really just seem like 2 people pretending to be married, this is probably the weakest paring that Sandler has ever been a part of on the big screen. By the time this movie ends if have anything at all to say about Katie Holmes character, I highly doubt it anything good. All-in-all my opinion is that this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place, the weak pointless storyline, the shallow and mildly upsetting characters, and the fact that the estimated budget for this ridicules film was almost $80 million, all add up to disaster in my book, a disaster that you should probably avoid.",Jack and Jill
292,davewitt3,"Sophomoric, Predictable, Low Brow, Hilarious",7,13 November 2011,"Don't believe the critics, see it for yourself and decide. Despite being warned I went to see this movie. Very typical Sandler Humor along the lines of Dumb and Dumber, but a little higher on the scatological scale. Not belly laughs, very predictable, clever at best, slapstick at worst. Most bits are funny.What takes this to the next level is the performance of Al Pacino. The ongoing gag works and although a little redundant, it is over the top enough to make the movie worthwhile. While it is certainly not in the same league as Animal House, Superbad, or Monty Python, it does not deserve the universal bashing it has received.",Jack and Jill

One bonus the movie has is that there are a TON of celebrities in it, including: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, John McEnroe, David Spade, the Sham-Wow guy, Jared from Subway and many more. It is more of a family Adam Sandler movie so don't expect the same humor as in 'Happy Gilmore' or 'Billy Madison' if you do you will be disappointed.

I laughed through out the whole entire film. From beginning to end! I didn't think this was going to be a funny movie at all. Adam as a woman? But it worked and he made a pretty woman at that. Scary. It reminded me a lot of Robin Williams comedy. The cameo's the stars it was a very well done movie.

What he finds funny, just doesn't do it for me and I have avoided most of his films.

Not even the presence of Al Pacino (why, Al, why?) can do anything with the steaming pile of putrescent dog vomit that it resembles.How it cost an estimate $79,000,000 to make is astounding but even more astounding is how it managed to earn nearly $75,000,000 of that back at the US box office, and that's really, really sad, because it will make money, and the investors will get paid but if it had completely tanked at the box office, as it, by all that is sane, should have, then the investors would have been burned, Sandler would end up taking celebrity cameos in other people's terrible films and we'd never have to suffer his talentless rubbish ever again.If you have children, spare them from this muck, seriously, it should come with a health warning...""Avoid - May Make Your Children Stupid""",Jack and Jill

I just love his personality, and him as a person, so it's hard to hate on any of his movies, and I gotta say even though it's scores under most his other movies, I still enjoyed watching it.Although it's not a movie I would put in the blu ray player to watch, when deciding on a movie, but if it's on TV like one of the movie channels, I'd leave it on, just cuz I love Sandler, and the way his films look, aesthetically, are nice.

299,yankovicfarley,"A Robot's Analysis of ""Jack & Jill""",1,10 November 2011,"Hello, I am Bloop the robot, and today I will be reviewing Adam Sandler's latest raping of comedy called ""Jack & Jill."" Made by Happy Madison productions, which would be much more accurate if called . . .Un-happy Madison productions.So the movie starts off with lots of video clips of twins. Twins making fun of one another. Then we are introduced to Adam Sandler and Adam Sandler playing a woman who looks nothing like Adam Sandler, but looks more like Adam Sandler in drag.The Adam Sandler in drag was referred to as Jill in the movie, and the Adam Sandler playing a man was named Jack. Just like the children's books. Isn't that funny? But Jack and Jill never go up the hill to fetch a pale of water. Therefore it is an inaccurate portrayal of Jack and Jill.Instead, the movie goes downhill from this point. Much like the careers of everyone involved in this movie. Including Al Pacino, but I will get to that later. That was a teaser.So Jill comes to visit Jack for Thanksgiving. But Jack is very angry because he doesn't like Jill, and neither does the audience.Even though Jill is only supposed to visit for 4 days, she overstays her welcome much like the movie overstays its welcome after the first minute. It is terrible.Then, one day Jack goes into the office and he is told he has to make a commercial for Dunkin Donuts. And he has to cast Al Pacino. And the commercial is specifically about Dunk-a-cinos, which rhymes with Al Pacino's last name. Very funny.Because Jill admits to not knowing how to use technology, like robots, Jack creates a human dating Website profile for his horribly disgusting and strangely manly sister. Logically, because she is undesirable in every way, she is not contacted by a single man. But then Jack comes and feels bad and creates a profile on Craigslist in which he is misleading because he calls Jill a hot, crazy, masseuse with knock out looks because she knocked herself out with the wheel on the Price Is Right, but not the old Price is Right hosted by Bob Barker who was in Happy Gilmore, but the Price is Right hosted by Drew Carey, but not the fat and funny Drew Carey because this is the insanely skinny and sickly Drew Carey.So then a lot of guys contact Jill because they think she is hot and based off of this fake description, even though it is linked back to her dating profile featuring a real picture of her eating some kind of sandwich. And through a careful human female selection process, she chooses to go on a date with a guy named Funbucket, who is neither Fun, nor a bucket.Then Jill comes home crying from her date with Funbucket, and Jack is guilt tripped into feeling bad for her, and realizes that she has feelings. Stupid worthless human feelings. At this point, Jack's boss tells him to go to a Laker's Game because Al Pacino will be there. How did he know that? It is a comedy so that is irrelevant.At the Laker's human basketball game, Al Pacino sits next to Johnny Depp who apparently was bored that day and Adam Sandler said, ""Hey Johnny Depp, are you doing anything? And if not, please be in my stupid movie."" Then Jack talked to Al Pacino, but Al Pacino likes Jill instead, even though we've already established that Adam Sandler is playing both of the main characters. Very funny.This is where the complex romance comes into the picture, where Al Pacino stalks Jill, but Jill does not like Al Pacino eve though he is rich . . . and Al Pacino. She is stupid. Just like this movie.Sadly, I am only 30 minutes into this movie, so I will summarize the movie in short sentences: Overt racism of Jews, Mexicans, Black People, and 10 year old Indian children.Jokes about poop, farts, diarrhea, and eating bad Mexican food.Cameo appearances by Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Shaquille O'Neil, and the Shamwow guy.We definitely weren't """"Wowed,"" but this movie definitely was a sham. That is a pun.In conclusion, ""Jack and Jill"" is not a comedy but rather a tragedy. It was not even funny and did not have enough robots. It was terrible.*This review is taken from the YouTube Channel called RantingRobots*",Jack and Jill

In my theater it was full and everyone was enjoying it and laughing. To the critics who think it sucked because of Adam Sandler as his sister and he wasn't anything like a girl, THAT WAS THE POINT! Common it doesn't take common since to see that. Did you want them to hire someone that looks nothing like him. That would be stupid. Not only is the movie family friendly, it is also funny for adults. People say the jokes were not funny. Just because someone can make a movie without sex and dirty jokes doesn't mean it isn't funny.

No kidding. Dad didn't have to bring a shotgun. Didn't need it. Mom was a rifle type of gal.) – That being neither here nor there: this movie goer' was actually very impressed with Jack and Jill.My husband and I took our 13 year old twin sons, who laughed the entire show. It does take a few moments to forget that Jill is actually Adam Sandler, but all of us agreed that we soon saw Jack and Jill as two different characters, and as twins. Grown twins do fight and no one knows better which buttons to push. When my grown boys disagree (as they often do) the rest of us just stay out of the way.I'm beginning to wonder if some of the online reviewers didn't see a different movie than we? And different not only than we -but different than the others in the theater with us. EVERYONE was laughing. Some hysterically.We went expecting a zany, light hearted comedy. We actually came away with more than that. Not only was the interaction of the twins hilarious, but interjected moments of the unique sense of loss that Jill felt, as the caretaker of their mother, were very insightful. I lost my own mother two years ago. We had our own special holiday traditions, and life has been very different without her. There was more to this little movie than first meets the eye, and our family was very pleased.Every actor, down to the smallest child with the lobster taped to his back, was absolutely wonderful! Al Pacino as Al Pacino was genius! Katie Holmes and the dish of chocolate ice-cream! That was not only funny, it was just right! Not too much, not too little. Every move she made in the entire movie was totally believable. And guess what? I'm not a huge Katie Holmes OR even an Adam Sandler fan; however he was quite a bit of a genius himself, keeping in character for TWO characters! (And NO, I'm not the mother of any of these people. Trust me, out of SIX kids, only one's in California. And he is not an actor. Can't tell you what he does, or he'd have to kill you ;-)Just see the movie. Decide for yourself. Take twins of any age.

It is, however, light-years from the best film ever. Yet, there is one scene that makes this movie worth watching (up until that scene, at least). In the movie the son of Jack keeps scotch-taping items to himself. Even this semi-humorous aspect of the film wears out fairly quickly, BUT, BUT, BUT, before the humor is gone there is the scene with the mythical beast, the ""Peppercorn.""The Peppercorn is easily a painful belly laugh--an intense focal point of funny that makes me give the film a five-star rating even if every other scene in the film warrants a zero. (And it just about does,...)Sure we should expect low-brow from Sandler, but do we have to settle for encephalitis? Come on, Adam, you can do way better.Rent this movie for a dollar from Redbox, watch the first fifteen minutes until the Peppercorn scene, laugh really hard, and then turn the film off. Thank me later.",Jack and Jill
309,transformersfan69,i didn't think it,10,21 December 2011,was that bad not as bad as every body says it is. me and my friend thought it was pretty good we where lagging and stuff. not his best work but its better than funny peopled. i at often times felt it was a bit gimmickry but it had its moments. Sander isn't that convening as a girl but thats only because his kind of character doesn't really work as a girl. the other cast are also good but there not really that importunate compared to Adam Sander. i have given it a 10 out of 10 only because i couldn't bring mys to give it any less. if their was a choice of like 9.5 i would give it that but seeing as there is only 9 and 10 then i would rather give it a 10 then a 9. BTW the linkage in the film can became a bit unappropriated but its not to the point that it cloud be considered bad for kids. in conclusion its an OK movie thats not as bad as people say.,Jack and Jill
310,alexisthesweetest,I laughed! But boy was Al Pacino horrible,7,5 January 2012,I don't know if it's just me but I thought this movie was pretty good. Adam Sandler did a great job with this film. Katie Holmes wasn't to bad and the kids were cute. Many cameos from many celebrities but other than that there was one horrible performance. Al Pacino. Someone had to say it. The plot was heart warming and I think that this is a movie that is fun for the whole family. I laughed a bit. But there is only one thing that doesn't make this movie all that great. Everyline that Al Pacino spoke had no sense of comedy. You could tell that he was trying to act but didn't succeed. I say that he is better for the original genre that he acts best with. Drama. I'm sorry but this is Pacino's all time low. All in all this was a cute family comedy that I would recommend to see.,Jack and Jill
311,StrobeThat,Small laughs littered abundantly but an overall forgettable popcorn flick.,5,29 July 2012,"Jack & Jill, while slapshtick - literally, shtick - it still offered enough genuine laughs to be a funny, of the genre flick. It appears that Happy Madison, namely Adam Sandler really knows his comedy. If you're not a fan of his Mr. Deeds and his antics then you likely won't enjoy Sandler playing both titular roles, both male and female identical twins; but if you could manage to sit through 50 First Dates then you'll be in for a treat; Sandler reuses about 50 of his previous jokes to above average results. Overall, Jack & Jill is a solid big budget comedy headed up by a talented production team featuring a slew of winning cameos that you won't have to look hard to spot. Rent it, don't buy it. 5/10",Jack and Jill
312,pirateguyvtcta,It was alright.,7,4 January 2012,"Went to go see this for one reason: Adam Sandler was in it. Being a fan of his, I knew this movie would be worth going to see. However, the movie wasn't what I had expected. Sure there were some rather comical parts but the movie had several flaws. First of all, Al Pacino was a HUGE mistake by the casting crew. I practically felt like shooting him every time his face was on the screen. I have nothing against him but I found his presence to be unnecessary. Second, I would just like to say that farting is only funny maybe the first couple of times. Over use of flatulence just gets annoying. Third, well, all I can say is that this movie was no 50 First Dates.",Jack and Jill
313,kirk-thompson,Another feel good film from Happy,10,15 April 2012,"Does this deserve a 10/10 No but it certainly does not deserve a 1 either. This is a movie i almost didn't watch based purely on the reviews I read. How glad I am that I chose to ignore the reviews and follow my instincts. Admitingly not one of his best but As always Sandler delivers on the light hearted comedy with some great laugh out loud moments and all in all provides another feel good film. If your looking for a film with a deep intellectual background go pick up something else with subtitles, If you want a giggle look no further!! as the gags fly often enough to keep you captivated. True rating would have to be at least a 6/10",Jack and Jill
314,Caber5,Truly the Worst Half a Film I have Ever Seen - Desperate Rubbish,1,9 February 2012,i cannot believe that with the amount of talent around in the arts in general that something this bad could ever have been made. i went with a friend in a wheelchair who has learning difficulties. He rarely gets out and would pretty much sit through anything vaguely funny or entertaining. The cinema was pretty much empty and half way through he said in a loud voice THIS IS TERRIBLE - LETS GET OUT OF HERE! i only wish i could have been that honest that loudly. We left with relief - i have no idea what happened in the rest of the film and have no wish to know. It must have cost a lot of money to make any film like this - what were they thinking? did anyone preview it? . i cant even believe it will up as cult badness its just terrible,Jack and Jill

Pacino appearance i think is one star of the 3 i gave to this movie. I don't understand why he is in this movie...same as i don't understand DeNiro on Machete (another Disappointment) but anyway...whatever Is too much 90 minutes of this movie, i was ready to leave after the first 20 min, but the only way to rate something is seeing all of it... I recommend don't waste time seeing it and better wait until another good job of Adam Sandler.....",Jack and Jill

In the beginning of the movie I was afraid the this movie is not going to be good when I saw Jill played by Adam Sandler. But then Al Paciono comes in and that just made the movie so funny! The youtube clip when Pacino lost it and then again when his cell phone rings in the middle of the play and he picks the phone up. I don't know why but it was it all was just so funny to me! Allso there was nice cameo by Johnny Depp. Maybe because Grown Ups was not that great, people are afraid that the next Adam Sandler movie will be worse and they start and their own fears make the movie bad or maybe people are starting to loose good sense of humor whit all this bad economy, i don't know. Anyway I did enjoy the movie a lot. Give it a try. And the Pacinos commercial clip at the end was also very funny!",Jack and Jill
317,pbt_u,Awful Judaism propaganda 'comedy'.,1,19 February 2012,"Every now and then I log on to IMDb and read a review that starts with 'the reason I joined IMDb was this film was so bad I had to tell everyone'. Well here I am saying the same thing. This film was so bad I joined IMDb so I could tell everybody. My main dislike regarding this films 'sheer awfulness', was the constant references to Judaism. Adam Sadler likes to remind us (every 3rd movie he releases)he is both Jewish and pro Israeli,Don't Mess With Zohan etc. Which is his business. But if the references in Jack And Jill were Christan or Muslim, the film would have rightly been sold as a Christian or Muslim 'comedy',instead Jack And Jill is trotted out as an Adam Sadler comedy. So disingenuous. Thank god I,unlike some unfortunate reviewers, downloaded it for free and watched it at home. Thank god for Bitcomet!",Jack and Jill
318,davidcomora,"Sandler must be surrounding himself with ""Yes"" Men and Women",1,11 March 2012,"Like other reviewers, I am a fan of Adam Sandler's. I enjoyed most of his other films, but this movie was a mistake. I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with ""Yes"" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. This isn't Tootsie, nor Mrs Doubtfire, its just Sandler playing an annoying and mostly unfunny and unbalanced character. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career.I made the mistake of watching this on Vudu as a Pay-Per-View film...the best thing I can say is that I fell asleep halfway through it. If you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes.",Jack and Jill
319,brendan1454,Jack and Jill wasn't good,2,26 June 2012,"Some parts of the movie were funny but it had a bad plot, also the character Jill whines to much which gets annoying and repetitive. I'd have to say I've seen better Adam Sadler movies then this. As the movie kept going you'd be wondering when this movie would end. And at some points of the movie you would just get bored and start multitasking. I've been a fan of almost every Adam Sander movie but this one just wasn't worth the time and money to go see. I enjoyed the funny parts, but let's face it wasn't that great. Warning spoiler-The key plot was supposed to be that jack was a Successful business man and that Jill was his annoying sister who lives by herself and and doesn't have a special someone in her life. So when jack has her go on a dating website called find findmysoulmate.com the next day she gets zero likes so they show a scene of her crying again jack goes and types to see if anybody's looking for a hot masseuse. And the next day she gets 30 likes and meets this guy who you find out later gets completely creeped out by her so he hides in the bathroom of course this date was at a restaurant. Jill goes home crying again and jack gets angry. Jack meets al pacino at a basketball game and asks for him to do a dunkinchino commercial for dunkin donuts but he likes Jill and you also find out that Jill doesn't like al Pacino she likes Felipe a gardener. And at the end of the movie al Pacino let Jill be with Felipe. Id have to rate it a 2 for making me laugh at the stupid parts.",Jack and Jill
320,brb-mrk,i signed into IMDb just to write this review,1,31 March 2012,"i must say that Adam Sander has simply lost his footing-in my opinion he was never one of the top comedians to begin with, now the crap that he starred in is just.......The first few minutes of the film was kinda OK where you have twin people discussing what they used to do/do in real life etc etc, as an introduction to the film. well that ended and Sander came into the picture and his annoying female doppelganger. he was just so irritating and whiny all the time i could not stand him-After 30 mins i could not care less- The only chuckle i let out where female Sander was doing doughnuts with the jetski in the pool.What about the other actors? Holmes and....Al Pacino? WTF? where they such in need of money?i think i won't see any films made/starred by Sander cos this film just scarred my humour nerve!

321,JonathanMase,Jack and Jill (2011),1,21 July 2015,"Jack and Jill (2011) is quite possibly the worst film of this century, and I'd be surprised if this status will be surpassed over the next ninety years. Adam Sandler happens to be a funny and talented actor, yet his movies continue to get worse and worse. His agent should be arrested. Many of his better movies, such as Click and 50 First Dates, haven't received adequate praise as a result of garbage like this. It was a struggle to make it through the entire movie, and an even greater struggle to make it out of the theater as the audience charged the doors.Jonathan A.

Happy Gilmore was enjoyable and Little Nicky made me laugh, so I thought ""How bad can his latest flick possibly be?"".Well, the answer is: very bad. I'm sure there were supposed to be jokes in this movie but I failed to locate a single one - and so did the entire audience in the cinema, going by the utter silence filing the place (only disrupted by Jill squeaking on screen).Positively not funny and not worth watching. Punching yourself in the face repeatedly is more fun than watching this and I really hope his next movie (should this one not end his career - it certainly has the potential to) will be better written and at least contain a couple of genuine jokes and funny bits.",Jack and Jill

I have probably watched it 15 times and it still isn't even remotely old yet. I can't wait until Sandler man's up and makes a sequel. I know I will definitely be the first in line to get tickets.

I should never have put others opinions of this movie first, it was absolutely hilarious! I laughed so much, i can not wait to watch it again. To people who do not like this movie based on the fact they do not like the actors etc. this is not a good reason to bag the movie out.

The first half an hour was painful but when I had realised how bad it was going to be I found myself starting to enjoy parts. The Al Pacino love interest became so bad it was funny, and my son found Al Pacino so hilarious he now sees him as an accomplished children's performer! There was slap stick a plenty and I found myself starting to laugh at Jill's one liners and mannerisms. Jack on the other hand is a thoroughly despicable rogue who I never really warmed to. The ending was reasonable enough and was pleasingly brought to new heights of stupidity by the appearance of Al Pacino dressed in medieval garb wielding a wooden sword with which he assailed the ceiling fan.

I am irritated that half of these reviews are probably from people who don't understand his humor, and see his films, then write a review that they hated the film. I just wish these people would just realize that they don't get the humor, and move on. The film is funny, and yes, at times, it can be stupid humor, but it is funny.

If you have a sense of humor and want to watch a film with good old fashioned clean fun, this one is for you. We watched with a group of people, all ages, and roared in laughter. Sandler did a fantastic job with this one. I thought it was odd that Pacino was in this and the part he played was out of his ordinary character, but ""Jill"" was a scream! We rewound parts and watched over and over as we rolled on the floor in laughter. This movie was not crude humor, sexual, nor did it have drugs or alcohol in it. Just a great film, funny.....funny.....funny! I would recommend this one for any family who just wants to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and laugh.

Great for watching at home with the family.I'd imagine people feel the peer pressure more in the cinema, and feel less inclined to laugh at some of the gags.If you liked Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy,Water Boy, Click, Wedding Singer etc...

Surely a man of his qualities saw and read the script before agreeing to this dog-fart of a film. I'm not going to go over the plot as too many others have before me.

Now I've seen Adam Sandler - so I thought I knew what I was in for. I actually quite like Happy Gilmore and a few of his others. Sure, being a little drunk helps make them better, but they're moderately watchable anyway. This one, however, is not.

340,s_plamondon,I can understand those who couldn't sit through it 100%,3,24 October 2014,"Look, it was really bad. There's absolutely no doubting or denying that. That being said, it wasn't so bad I couldn't sit through it, mainly due to the fact that the actors are inexplicable invested in the material. The acting never gets so dreadful or cringe worthy that you need to turn it off, if you can tolerate Sandler's nasally whining that is. I can definitely understand why so many couldn't though, and if the voice happens to be like nails on a chalk board for you there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to make it worth sitting through.I happened to have the variable effect of watching it after nearly 4 years of awful reviews from critics and us regular folk alike, then hearing from a credible friend that it wasn't AS bad as advertised. So I went in with a weighted approach, expecting it to be horrendous but allowing for a little more leeway before deciding to turn it off. Lo and behold I survived. IMDb has it at 3.5 at the moment and that's pretty apt. I guess if there's anything to take from reading this is it's tolerably bad for those who can get through a series of annoying character traits and those awful low brow Happy Madison gags that have sadly become a trademark of theirs, exposing an unfortunate side of Sandler's sense of humor that is painfully unfunny.",Jack and Jill

Adam Sandler is great actor I would bang Adam Sandler when he is dressed as Jill. I mean come on that is one of the reasons why I rated a 10/10. I love Adam Sandler this movie is amazing he is such a good actor in this movie. I give it a review of 10/10 I think a sequel would be a great idea. Maybe switch the main character around. I think it should have a spin off TV series about Jack and Jill since they're 2 lovable characters I mean come on who didn't love Adam Sandler dressed as a woman I mean damn. Maybe they could get a dog that talks and another thing why does he has a Indian kid I mean I hated that kid I liked the Mexican who goes I'm kidding he was like able and relate able because he was kidding about the jokes he made I thought it was really funny I loved everything about this movie it was amazing my friend liked the movie I liked the movie you should like the movie too it was a good movie I would watch it again with Las.,Jack and Jill

This is definitely one to skip. I couldn't believe Sandler would go this low. He is a decent actor in certain scenarios but as a woman? Absolutely not. Was he trying to replicate Tyler Perry? Or just trying to look as stupid as possible? It was almost as if the entire movie was just one big joke. I have yet to hear any good things from any other people and most people I've talked to about this movie didn't make through the whole thing.

Hysterical!As a feminist, I am so appreciative of this film. Jill is a huge woman with a huger personality and the men love her! Do you have any idea how rare it is to see that in film? It makes me so happy that this ""disaster"" of a woman is such an incredible person. The story plays on gender stereotypes in the best of ways. I want to see more Jills in the world! You go, girl!The other standout performance is by Al Pacino. God bless him. He plays an insano so well. His eyes and all around creepiness are perfect.

They were much worse and yet Bedtime stories got more credit.The point is that Sandler's movies are all the same and why should we expect any different? It's his style, as cancerous as it is to watch, he's made some good money off of it.Now I'm not saying I like this movie but I think he's done worse. Al Paccino was in it.

345,espurlock0921,Come on Sandler,2,6 November 2013,"Jack and Jill tells the story of Jack's sister, Jill, coming to visit his family for Thanksgiving. She's only supposed to be there for a few days, but she extends her vacation time, and winds up staying almost to New Years. During her stay you are going to see a lot of bad from a lot of great actors. This film is one of the worst films Adam Sandler has ever done. The only thing that does makes it funny is its stupidity, and the fact that Adam Sandler is playing a woman. However, Adam does not make a very pretty woman. It seems like each new movie Adam is in gets worse ans worse. He used to make great films like Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy. Great films are supposed to keep you laughing the entire time, and have a great story behind it. Sadly, this film has neither. This film also has Al Pacino in it. In my opinion, he makes a complete fool of himself. Adam Sandler puts him in a commercial at the end of the film where he sings a terrible Dunkin Donuts song. Pacino is mostly recognized as a feared man in his films. I honestly can't believe he agreed to this film. Although everything I have stated above is bad, I am still a huge Adam Sandler fan. He is the only reason I wanted to see the film. It's certainly not the worst film of the century, but it is pretty annoying. If you are a huge fan like myself, I would recommend this to a friend. My review is just an opinion, and I am sure there are people out there that loved this film. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. There are a few funny parts in the film, but it is mostly just bad acting. The jokes in the film aren't jokes that would make adults laugh. Let's just say if there is a showing for Jack and Jill 2, I won't be watching it.",Jack and Jill
346,hf6465,Refreshingly enjoyable comedy,10,8 November 2013,"Finally a comedy that didn't offend me with bad language, or crude/stupid humor. I like Adam Sandler as a comedian and the cast from SNL but I haven't enjoy many of their movies because of bad language or offensive humor. However, this one, is absolutely an enjoyable comedy. Adam Sandler gained many points in my books with this movie. Clean, safe for the whole family, and pure humor. I watched it alone and it's hard for me to laugh or be excited when I am alone and yet I laughed loud and was very into the movie. Thumbs up.",Jack and Jill
347,omatthews2247,Jack and Jill should be pushed down the hill!,1,8 May 2014,"Jack and Jill should be pushed down the hill! This movie is terrible, that's the truth, which is sad because Adam Sandler used to be funny, with some great films such as happy Gilmore and the wedding singer but this is just sad, an attempt from Adam Sandler to be funny once again but failing.The movie is about Adam Sandler playing two twins, one being a boy and one being a girl, watch the trailer, you'll think that this is all some weird joke but believe me, there is NOTHING funny about it. The characters are unlikeable, the story is forgettable and overall it is just a waste of time! If you want to watch a good Adam Sandler film they do exist (The wedding singer, happy Gilmore or even 50 first dates) but lately, I avoid any new Adam Sandler film like the plague, so PLEASE do yourself a favor and listen to this warning, AVOID THIS MOVIE.",Jack and Jill
348,allergictohumans,Painful.,4,12 October 2020,I really do love Adam Sandler. I grew up listening to his albums and really enjoyed his early movies. I even liked some of his dramatic roles. But this thing is just bad. Painfully so.,Jack and Jill
349,pistner55,Adams sandler rise to fame,1,20 May 2019,"Honestly, i don't get all he hate, Adam Sandler just proved he can play 2 characters at once and did amazingly well at it.

350,sabrale000,Best Movie Ever,10,4 December 2014,"I know what your thinking, Really? BUT if you knew my mother and how dead on this movie is you'd love it too. I am not sure who Adam Sandler wrote the part of Jill based on because it IS MY MOM. My Mom was just visiting for Thanksgiving, Jill wears the same clothes, says the same things and also travels with enough luggage to supply a small army. Just replace her pet with a small dog she HAS to travel with.This movie is what get me through the Holiday and what makes me be able to laugh at all the crazy stuff my Mom does without losing it.Thank you to the writers! I just wish this would have done better at the box office. My children laugh like crazy when they watch it!",Jack and Jill
351,nickreyes,The Next Citizen Kane,10,24 December 2019,"Probably the best film ever made , laughed my whole way through with the wife and kids. Adam Sandler kills it and Al Pacino is definitely getting Best Supporting Actor.Only complaint is there was not enough poop jokes.",Jack and Jill
352,fgpacini-75955,Adam Sandler at his worst.,1,21 August 2016,"For an actor, screenwriter and producer with over 30 movies under his belt, you'd think Adam Sandler would've learned you can only disappoint an audience so many times, and there comes a point where effort actually has to be put into the movie for it to succeed.This is what I would've said if this movie had failed. But it actually made money. People went to see a movie where Adam Sandler played in drag for 90 minutes.The fact we as an audience keep giving this man money to make more movies, when other truly great actors and writers struggle to get the attention they deserve is insulting.Let me explain why this movie is so awful. Adam Sandler graduated from making movies that don't really work and aren't interesting to a movie that punishes the audience for seeing it.This movie begins with at least 3 product placements. Dunkin Donuts and Pepto-Bismol, both of which are somewhat important to the ""plot"" and then an incredibly obvious Coke advertisement. Great first impression for your audience which you clearly treat as intelligent consumers.Stuff kind of just happens in this movie, like most of Adam Sandler's movies. All the characters are boring except for Jack and Jill mainly because they cause an actually feeling for the viewer.Pain. This movie manages to make you dislike both of the main characters in a set-up where that should be virtually impossible. Jack is a total jerk to his sister and doesn't handle the situation well by not telling her how he feels in an adult manner. The reasoning for this is probably supposed to be that she is messing with his career, although there isn't one scene that shows this. A main character who has his name in the movie title being unlikable would be bad enough in any normal film, but for this one, that isn't even a primary concern.I'm sure they'll make up for this. I'm sure Jill is the one you understand and empathize with despite her obnoxiousness.Nope.Jill is incredibly annoying and the viewer is given no explanation as to why she is this way. For all I know Jill could be a sadist and is pretending to be stupid in order to annoy everyone she knows.The jokes are also even less funny than most Adam Sandler comedies. There was only one joke I smiled at in this whole film, and of course this was ironically. This was Al Pacino's utterly pointless disguise during the basketball game. Oh did I mention he was in this movie? I think he win's the award for farthest fall from grace. He is identified during the game, which is unintentionally funny because he literally has a first row seat and is sitting next to Johnny Depp, who has even less of a reason to be in this film.Speaking of unfunny jokes there is of course an insultingly racist character and scene in this film. There's a Mexican guy who is of course Jack's gardener. He bring's Jill to his family's party, in a scene which is difficult to describe due to awfulness.Here's a one sentence summary: He tells Jill not to eat the hot peppers and Jill plays soccer and keeps knocking over an old lady who doesn't like her for some reason with the ball and they revive her with the hot peppers and they keep feeding her the peppers ha ha get it guys because she's Mexican and she can eats the hot peppers but white people can't do you get it guys i don't think you get it why aren't you laughingAt this point I would not be surprised if half the people left the theater. But Adam Sandler knew that if one single person had a shred of investment in this film he hadn't done his job right.If you thought it couldn't get any worse, I'm afraid you haven't seen the last 3rd of the movie. In a stupid series of events that are honestly not worth your time because they make no sense Jack has to pretend to be Jill in order to make Al Pacino do an ad for him. Don't ask. So let me explain this.In the movie, Adam Sandler's character Jack, has to dress up in drag as Jill, a character Adam Sandler plays in drag. It's like the inception of stupidity. This is an example of breaking the fourth wall which I'm sure you would be instructed not to do in any starter level screen writing class. This is effectively the same as the movie stopping in the middle to show you a behind the scenes of the movie you are watching. It completely removes any investment in the film.Breaking the fourth wall only works in movies you are not supposed to take seriously or are supposed to break the fourth wall. This includes:Parodies (Ones that are actually funny i.e. Monty Python, Mel brooks, airplane, austin powers, etc) DeadpoolYou could say this movie fits into the not to take seriously category, but the reason it doesn't work much like most parodies is this requires that the movie is actually funny and lovable.",Jack and Jill

The first time i saw jill (Played by Adam Sandler) i didn't realise that it was him!! it took me some time to figure out the true character of this brilliant movie. Despite both character being played by Adam Sandler they got each a unique personality, adding real depth to the story. I really do think that people who disliked the movie didn't realise that it was Sandler on both parts all the time!!!! omfg that was genius!!.Jack is a unique character that Sandler portrayed perfectly,giving the character the perfect mix between deep and mysterious and a comicality funny character,i was gobsmacked by his performance.",Jack and Jill
355,RachCat,:-O OMG - Waste of time & money!,1,26 June 2012,"This is the worst film I've seen for a long time. ""Jill""'s voice is constantly annoying. The storyline is unoriginal, limited, predictable & oh so incredibly boring. Most of the film made me cringe (especially for Al Pacino-who can obviously laugh at himself, but must regret doing this). Too many clichés & too much effort for laughs resulting in an un-funny film. The best actor was the cockatoo. In fact, if the bird had written the screenplay it could only have improved it. 1 out of 10 is too high a score, but apparently you can't give less, so I'm giving the one (for the cockatoo ;-)) I hope Adam Sandler quickly does something really good very soon, as I fear that ""Jack and Jill"" may possibly be professional suicide.",Jack and Jill

361,imdb-11774,"An entertaining, cheesy, enjoyable comedy",7,18 March 2012,"This movie is pretty decent, and I enjoyed it a lot. I really don't understand the consistently negative reviews. You know what to expect with Adam Sandler, so there's no point pretending.But this film actually made me laugh a lot, and I also empathised with the characters. The chemistry between the actors, the energy of the film, and the story flow were all excellent. The plot does not hold any surprises, but I don't hold that against it -- it's a classic movie plot.There are some really cheesy and cringe-worthy moments that I remember with a smile on my face. Think about it: There must be something to this movie that inspires such strength of feeling in so many reviewers... And it's not that it's ""so bad it's good"" -- it actually is good! I think some reviewers are in denial, feeling ashamed of themselves for secretly enjoying the cheesy humour.It's actually better than some of his other movies, for example the acting in ""Just Go With It"" was much more stilted and awkward.Jack and Jill is definitely worth a watch, if you enjoy Adam Sandler's humour.",Jack and Jill
362,quinnfalk,The Literal Worst Movie We Have Ever Seen,1,7 June 2018,"Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill is a joke. A gag. Sandler has sunk to his absolute lowest, playing both Jack and Jill poorly. Both main characters are not only unlikable, but also Adam Sandler. It made us want to rip our eyes out just to end the film. The Jared joke aged incredibly poorly, especially with the child audience that this film shoots for. I am embarrassed not only for Adam Sandler, but also every single member on this production. They should all be ashamed of what they created, as well as curious as to why they would even release this. It almost seems like a practical gag and yet no one is laughing or winning in the joke. Al Pacino probably plays his worst role ever, and he plays himself just like every other actor in this movie. INCLUDING David Spade. However, David Spade not only had nice tits but also a killer belly button ring. He was hotter than Rob Schneider in Hot Chick. In conclusion, Happy Madison has disappointed us yet again. I'm questioning why we keep giving Adam so many god damn chances to redeem his name, when it is clearly not ever going to work. Except for maybe in Pixels?",Jack and Jill

A lot of people hate this film, but it's simply a masterpiece. I have seen this film at least 25 times. The story is genius levels of mastery, totally original, and never been done before. It's hilarious, relatable, and sad. No other film in the history of films, has been done so well as this one. Al Pacino's best performance on film, same with Adam Sandler. The acting will be studied for years to come. The cinematography is of course beautiful, like any another Sandler flick. The brother and sister relationship between Jack and Jill are as good as it gets. I can't find the actress who played Jill, sorry about that. Dialogue is hilarious, Its really clever and original. The dunkaccino scene almost made me die from laughter, WHO EVER CAME UP WITH THAT IS A GENIUS. Too bad the film never won any Oscars, it just shows the Academy can never recognize true art, even if it hits them in the face. So....that's that.

It's quite beautiful how he managed to come up with an idea so unique and breathtaking that it just rocks my entire world.Jill's character is so deeply well written and emotionally intuned with the rest of the cast, that the watcher of this movie connects with her character on a spiritual level. Her dialogue is so deftly woven into the screenplay, we can't help but want MORE JILL!!!The child actors in this movie are TYGHT! 👌 They are beautiful, and lovable, and even the GREEK GODS envy them. I mean, who doesn't?Haters of this movie are blind to the society we live in. The political background of this movie is what truly makes it genius, and anyone who cant understand the references to our government are lower than a rattlesnakes belly.Adam Sandler has proven once again that he is a force to be reckoned with in this biz, and he absolutely will be nominated for an Oscar for this masterpiece.

No witty dialogue. Nothing. This movie was built on a garbage script, if, indeed, it had a script at all.In the first 30 minutes, the film went absolutely nowhere. It immediately jumps into the fact that the main character hates the sister, and does not have any more depth beyond him.If you have a chance to watch this movie, spend that time working on a cure for cancer or cold fusion.
