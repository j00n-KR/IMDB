0,MartinHafer,Not up to all the hype,5,14 July 2006,"When I read reviews for this film when it first came out, I was pretty interested in seeing it. Phrases like ""sleeper hit"" and ""funny and quirky"" seemed to do most reviews I read. But, when I finally saw the film, I was amazed at how unfunny the film was. Considering the plot, a lot more could have been done to make Muriel funnier as well as have the audience care more about this moronic and selfish lady.Muriel is an overweight loser who desperately wants to get married in a big and beautiful church wedding. The only problem is she hasn't had a date in years. So, given that she's pretty flaky and selfish, she pretends to have a fiancé and announces she's getting married. Most of the film consists of showing her and her best friend as they whoop it up in preparation for the big day.None of this really makes sense as the wedding cannot be. Plus, instead of having the story be about a nice girl who gets in over her head, I just found myself disliking Muriel and thinking she was an idiot. If the film garnered more empathy for her, it could have been a much better and interesting movie.",Muriel's Wedding
1,Leofwine_draca,Wrong target audience,3,18 September 2021,I think I saw this at the cinema back in the day although it's hard to remember. I had some mild interest in it as as huge ABBA fan at the time (no shame in me saying that) but this turned out to be an overly sentimental Australian romantic comedy which used ABBA as a crutch. Certainly not the kind of thing a teenage boy was interested in...,Muriel's Wedding
2,SnoopyStyle,great wacky black comedy,8,13 January 2015,"Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette) is the fat ridiculed girl. She catches the wedding bouquet and all the girls pressure her to give it up. Her family is a bunch of lay-abouts. Her father Bill is a bully and her mother is a pushover. Bill is a corrupt local politician in Porpoise Spit, Australia. Muriel daydreams, lies and steals. Deidre Chambers offers a job and her mother gives her a blank cheque to be paid to Deidre. Instead Muriel uses it for a vacation and finding a husband. She is spotted by Rhonda Epinstalk (Rachel Griffiths) from her childhood. She decides to run away to Syndey where she lives with Rhonda. Bill walks out on the family and is under investigation. Rhonda becomes a paraplegic from a tumor.This is such a quirky funny Australian indie filled with dark wacky characters. It is such an odd unique movie. The humor comes from anger and mostly unlikeable characters. Muriel is not a normal character. She's insanely clingy, secretly bitter and outwardly delusional. The only normal character is Epinstalk and she faces some real darkness. The whole movie has a lot of darkness. There is a good deal of both laughing at Muriel and along with Muriel. There is also something ABBA that fits the craziness. It is both cheesy and upbeat. It keeps the movie from crumbling under the weight of Muriel's behavior and the small mindedness. Things get quite dark but it never succumbs to it. The last half's tone turn dark and ends in a very uplifting feel.",Muriel's Wedding
3,lee_eisenberg,revenge...revenge,10,5 October 2005,"Some people just live their lives in agony, but few can compare to bored, abused Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette). Things just plain suck for her. But that's all about to change. You see, she's getting married...and then some.I saw ""Muriel's Wedding"" in an Australian Cinema class. It's the sort of movie that you just have to see wherever you can. I don't just mean that it's interesting to see Toni Collette before she became famous in the States through ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Shaft""; everything about this movie is great. Muriel is the type of woman who seems delicate, but she can get nasty if needs be. 10/10.",Muriel's Wedding
4,jboothmillard,Muriel's Wedding,7,13 September 2005,"I have to admit I saw this film twice and both times thought it was awful, I guess that's because I didn't understand what was going on, I didn't notice it was Australia, I didn't realise I knew the leading actress, and I didn't notice the director P.J. Hogan (My Best Friend's Wedding). Seeing it a third time, I can at last see why it is a good comedy film. Basically Muriel Heslop (Golden Globe nominated Toni Collette) is the mousy, not-too-attractive girl who is bored of life in Porpoise Spit, Australia, and spends most of her time listening to Abba and dreaming of her wedding day, but she has never had a date. So she steals some money to go on a tropical vacation in Sydney, and there she meets not only her ex-friends (thye dumped her because she didn't fit in), but her wacky friend Rhonda Epinstalk (Rachel Griffiths). Muriel also changes her name to Mariel, and tries everything she can to be noticed by a man or married. Eventually though she finds an advertisement for someone looking for a wife, it doesn't say anything about love, but she seems attracted to David Van Arckle (Daniel Lapaine). So the wedding day comes, and secretly, both Rhonda in a wheelchair (from cancer) and her mother Betty (Jeanie Drynan) show up. In the end though, Mariel, or rather Muriel (she changes back) realises her mistake of marrying someone she cant love and breaks up with him, she also loses her mother, and in the end, she and Rhonda go back to Sydney. Not exactly a happy ending, and no real love wedding for Muriel, but never mind. Also starring Bill Hunter as Bill Heslop, Gennie Nevinson as Deidre Chambers, Matt Day as Brice Nobes, Sophie Lee as Tania Degano, Belinda Jarrett as Janine and Rosalind 'Roz' Hammond as Cheryl. The Abba songs (including ""Dancing Queen"", ""Waterloo"" and ""Mamma Mia"") are fun to listen to, Collette (then chubby, now thinner and recognised in The Sixth Sense and In Her Shoes) gives a good performance, and there are some good gags, I'm glad I gave it another chance. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Very good!",Muriel's Wedding
5,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Murel's Wedding',6,2 November 2006,"This is another kind of strange Australian movie out about this time, like ""Strictly Ballroom,"" with good color, colorful characters and a different type of story. I believe women would like this story more than men, but it has an odd fascination to it that should attract anyone.The major negative to the story, for me, was that the characters were not very appealing. The lead character in this ""Cinderella"" story is a big liar and has a stupid, immature laugh that gets grating. Her best friend turns foul-mouthed and bitter.The movie has a good mix of comedy and drama and there are some very strong moments in here, so very dramatic ones. The soundtrack is comprised of old ABBA songs, and they sound pretty good. This is a story that makes you reflect on it. If they had nicer characters, I would have bought the VHS.",Muriel's Wedding
6,Tweekums,An impressive Australian film that avoids many rom-com clichés,9,17 May 2020,"Muriel Heslop dreams of her wedding day as she listens to ABBA at her home in Porpoise Spit... unfortunately for her she has never had a boyfriend let alone got engaged. Muriel is fairly awkward, her 'friends' barely tolerate her and her father finds her, and her siblings, an embarrassment. One day Muriel takes advantage of a blank cheque, given to fund preparations for a new job, to have a luxury holiday. Here she meets Rhonda, a woman who got out of Porpoise Spit. She tells Rhonda that she is engaged and is unable to end that lie when she follows her to Sydney and gets a job. She doesn't give up on her dream of marriage.On the surface this film looks as if it will be a fairly standard rom-com. It may play with some of the genre clichés but generally avoids fully giving into them. It has plenty of downbeat moments as well as some cringe inducing scenes. There are also some good laughs... sometimes during those more embarrassing scenes. Toni Collette is really impressive as Muriel and Rachael Griffiths shines as Rhonda; the rest of the cast is solid too. I liked how the film avoided many of the expected outcomes; sometimes in uplifting ways but in one case with a tragedy. The use of music, particularly ABBA songs is effective and likely to have viewers wanting to sing along. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; it is a modern Australian classic.",Muriel's Wedding
7,moonspinner55,Sweet and sour fairy tale,5,11 March 2006,"Cinderella-styled Australian comedy-drama has echoes of the British class comedies of the mid-to-late 1960s (""Georgy Girl"" in particular). Overweight, unloved young woman strikes out on her own, dreaming about having the proverbial big fancy wedding despite the fact she has no boyfriend. From writer-director P.J. Hogan, who's ultimately too fond of nasty put-downs and ugly-acting supporting characters (Muriel's family members are beyond dysfunctional). However, when the writing is focused, the film is rather savvy and has some snap. Toni Collette's lead performance is warmly astute; she helps the narrative over some uncomfortable bumps, and almost makes the end result more than just another pity party. ** from ****",Muriel's Wedding
8,blanche-2,Dancing Queen,10,6 August 2008,"Toni Collette wants to have ""Muriel's Wedding"" in this 1994 Australian film, directed and written by P.J. Hogan. Muriel is a social outcast living with her dysfunctional family and fantasizing about a better life for herself, as exemplified in Abba music. She wants the excitement the music has, the fun, the prettiness, the glamor. Most of all, she wants a fabulous wedding. Her dreadful father (Bill Hunter) constantly puts her down and constantly elevates himself. He's a councilman. He asks a friend, Deirdre, who has a cosmetics company like Mary Kay, to give Muriel work. He gives Muriel a blank check so she can buy what she needs and start selling. Muriel takes the blank check to the bank, cleans out her father's bank account and heads for a resort where four girls from the ""in crowd"" - who don't want Muriel around - have gone. There she meets Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and starts to have some of the fun she's dreamed about. From there, she moves to Sydney and takes a job in a video store, rooming with Rhonda.All of Muriel's dreams eventually come true, but she loses what makes her special and what she has always devalued - herself.This is such a splendid film, made all the more magnificent by the performance of one of the truly great actresses of this century, Toni Collette. Collette belongs right up there with Streep, Helen Mirren and Cate Blanchette. She's not there because she's a character actress who disappears into her roles so that she's unrecognizable from film to film. Here she embodies Muriel - overweight, badly dressed, with low self-esteem who, in the process of finding out who she is, emerges as an attractive person who knows what's important and what it is she really wants.""Muriel's Wedding"" is not a raucous comedy. It has many layers - ridiculous characters, such as her supposed vain friends, and then it turns around and gives you a complicated character like Rhonda, who loves life and lives it with complete abandon until tragedy strikes. Griffiths gives a beautiful performance. Hunter, the man we loved to hate in ""Strictly Ballroom,"" is even more hateful here, but in the end, seems to have learned his lessons too.Muriel learns what we all learn - life isn't what goes on on the outside, it's what happens inside. What's valuable isn't the wedding dress and all the pomp, but the souls and love involved and the real meaning of marriage. Then you're a Dancing Queen and you can really feel joy.Such a great film, made possible by Collette and Hogan's excellent script and direction. Don't miss it.",Muriel's Wedding
9,tavm,Muriel's Wedding was a fine early showcase of Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths,8,17 January 2008,"Just saw this Australian dramady, about a heavyset woman dreaming of a wedding in order to improve her self-esteem, for the second time with my parents. My mom, a big ABBA fan, loved the music but wasn't too crazy about the movie which possibly had a little too much sex talk for her tastes. Dad was amused by many of those scenes and half-quoted some of those lines. Besides the wonderful songs from the international Swedish quartet, there's the very compelling performances of Toni Collette in the title role and Rachel Griffiths as her best friend Rhonda. Their seriously flawed characters (Muriel steals things and lies constantly, Rhonda frequently smokes even after being diagnosed with cancer) nevertheless compel empathy because of their mix of stubbornness, honesty-when chips are down, and loyalty to each other. Many of the supporting characters, mainly Muriel's siblings and other ""friends"", seem one-sided but others, like Muriel's no longer happy parents and the South African athlete she marries for convenience, have some depth to them. P.J. Hogan, later to helm the Julia Roberts hit My Best Friends Wedding, wrote and directed a pretty humorous and unsentimental depiction of being single and trying to grow up despite your surroundings. So on that note, I highly recommend Muriel's Wedding.",Muriel's Wedding

11,preppy-3,Dark and depressing. People LIKE this????,2,9 November 2009,"Muriel (Toni Collette) is an overweight unattractive Australian girl who loves ABBA music. She hangs around with a bunch of attractive but vicious women who tell her off every chance they get. She then meets easy-going, friendly Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and her life begins to change.SPOILERS!!!!! Sounds like a feel-good movie--right? WRONG! This has Muriel and some likable characters go through some incredibly horrible things again and again. For instance: Rhonda is very sexually active and (for no good reason) is crippled accidentally halfway through. Why? Because she happens to enjoy sex? Muriel's mother is treated by her husband like dirt...and she takes it. Muriel's friends have got to be the most vicious group of women I've EVER seen in any movie. Muriel meets a sweet guy who really likes her--but she dumps him to marry an attractive but empty-headed jock. That's only a few things. Again and again we're hit over the head with these depressing story turns. Seriously--what's the reason? The few good moments were blotted out by the negativity. After this was over I was utterly depressed and hated the movie. This only gets a two for the acting (Collette and Griffiths are great) and the ABBA music. But this is a seriously depressing, negative film.",Muriel's Wedding
12,Boba_Fett1138,"Still has some value to it as a chick-flick but other than that, it's not a great movie at all.",6,26 February 2012,"First of all, this is obviously a chick-flick (I mean, it's a movie in which the main character is obsessed with getting married, so how could it not be one?) and if you purely take it as such, this movie still serves its purpose well and is also maintaining enough. However as a movie itself it is far too uneven and does just too much wrong to consider this a great movie in its sort.It's one of those movies that tries to combine humor with drama. And it's not very successful or effective at that, in my opinion. The movie never finds the right balance, since its comedy and characters themselves are being far too over-the-top, which never blends in very well with the movie its, supposedly, dramatic moments.But also a big problem of the movie lays with the movie its main character, played by Toni Collette. She lies to her best friends and own family, she steals and runs of with people's money and also doesn't always comes across as too bright. Somethings obviously wrong with her but in this movie you obviously are supposed to care for her and her naivety is supposed to be something sweet. Needless to say this did not always worked out that way for me at all.But it remains a movie with a sort of charm to it still. I mean, despite everything it remains a pleasant movie to watch, even while it still annoyed me at certain moments. But perhaps that is also because this is obviously supposed to be a chick-flick and I am clearly no chick last time I checked. So it's fair to say this movie is not really for me and women will be more capable of appreciating this movie for what it is.The story is also really lacking some focus at times. Sometimes certain plot lines are simply getting dropped and it often makes some sudden jumps with its story, that don't always connect too well. This also definitely goes at the expense of certain characters in this movie, which I was often more interested in.You can still see how this movie partly inspired 'Mamma Mia!' the musical and later also movie. The ABBA music often plays a central role in the movie and it often has the same sort of happy-go-lucky, colorful, type of atmosphere to it. Good and straightforward enough as a chick-flick but other than that, far too flawed to consider this a great movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Muriel's Wedding
13,zetes,I loved this movie! 9/10,9,1 April 2000,"I rented this movie because I loved Toni Collette in The Sixth Sense and expected it to be a pretty good Australian flick, but it was much, much better than I had ever expected. One thing I have to complain about, though, has nothing to do with the actual movie: I have to make a complaint about the box. Miramax made this film look like a goofy Aussie romantic comedy. Every critical comment on the box lauded its humor. I even think they made Collette look skinnier on the cover. These people are utter thugs! This is a drama with some funny moments. I cried more than I laughed. There are so many beautifully drawn characters here. I never wanted this film to end. And it was wonderfully written. I have only some small complaints about the actual film. This is why I didn't give it a 10: the annoying friend characters who pretend to like Muriel and Rhonda when it's convenient are used way too often. They should not have been brought back near the end. The third act is also kind of long. There are three separate conflicts that have to be solved, and it just takes a bit too long.",Muriel's Wedding

15,JamesHitchcock,Coming-of-age story that is both comic and touching,7,30 October 2009,"One of the hallmarks, and one of the strengths, of the Australian cinema, is originality, the ability to produce films quite different from anything in the Hollywood or British mainstream. This ability dates back to the days of ""Walkabout"", ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""Crocodile Dundee"", and the offbeat comedy ""Muriel's Wedding"" from 1994 falls within the same tradition. It also falls within the recent Australian tradition of films satirising life in the provinces while retaining a certain affection for those that live there. (""Sweetie"" and ""Opal Dreams"" are other examples). The film was written and directed by Paul J. Hogan, not to be confused with his namesake Paul Hogan of ""Crocodile Dundee"" fame.The main character, Muriel Heslop, is a young woman in her early twenties from the fictitious Queensland seaside town of Porpoise Spit. Her life is dominated by her tyrannical father Bill, an ambitious and corrupt local politician, whose family seem crushed by the weight of his expectations. Muriel's mother Betty is a downtrodden, subservient wife and her siblings are lazy, unambitious and permanently unemployed, with no interests in life other than watching television. She herself is overweight, naïve and socially gauche; she is mocked by her contemporaries, even those she considers her friends, for her weight, her lack of social graces, her lack of fashion sense, and her obsession with the music of ABBA, regarded as hopelessly untrendy by the mid-nineties. (Several ABBA songs feature on the soundtrack). Although she has never had a serious boyfriend, her one great ambition is for a glamorous wedding.Muriel's life changes when, while on holiday, she makes a friend named Rhonda who, unlike her Porpoise Spit contemporaries, is prepared to accept Muriel for what she is. Muriel leaves her family to set up house in Sydney with Rhonda and eventually achieves her dream of a big white wedding, although the circumstances are rather unusual. Muriel's husband is David, a handsome young South African swimmer, whom she hardly knows but who needs an Australian passport in order to swim for his adopted country in the Olympics. (This plot line suggests that the film was originally conceived several years earlier, when South Africa was banned from international sport because of apartheid).Toni Collette was relatively unknown in 1994, but this was the part that first brought her to international attention, and she gives an excellent performance, making Muriel an appealing heroine despite her social awkwardness. There are some other good performances, such as from Bill Hunter as Muriel's autocratic father, but I was less taken by Rachel Griffiths as Rhonda, even though I have admired Griffiths in other films such as ""Hilary and Jackie"". Although she is supposed to be a likable character, Muriel's one true friend who loves her for what she is and who copes bravely with illness and disability, I found the foul-mouthed, promiscuous Rhonda a bit too abrasive to be sympathetic.Although ""Muriel's Wedding"" is a comedy, and in places a very funny one, it also deals with some serious themes, and avoids Hollywood sentiment. (Hollywood would doubtless have made Muriel slimmer and prettier, would given greater prominence to David and would have turned the film into a rom-com in which the two young people end up falling madly in love). It is essentially a coming-of-age story, what in German would be called a ""Bildungsroman"". It is the story of the heroine's discovery of self-confidence rather than self-loathing, of how she learns to accept herself for what she is. It is notable that for much of the film she insists on being called ""Mariel"", only to revert to ""Muriel"" by the end. Behind the humour and the satire the film is often touching and poignant. 7/10",Muriel's Wedding
16,=G=,A fun Aussie comedy with a message,8,30 September 2002,"""Muriel's Wedding"" is all about a young Aussie woman who bears the scars of a dysfunctional family as she sets out in life in search of happiness. Very much an Aussie film, rough as a day old beard but with a heart of gold and a visceral sense of humor, ""MW"" is one of those few movies which can accurately be called a ""gem"". Buoyant, coarse, and poignant, ""MW"" tells a story of personal conquest as we watch a courageous Muriel struggle with low self esteem from patriarchal abuse while looking for love in all the wrong places. A roller coaster ride with a feel good ending for anyone into movies with morals and/or Aussie films. (B+)",Muriel's Wedding
17,lasttimeisaw,Muriel's Wedding － interesting film,7,27 March 2007,"This little comedy is starred by then unknown actress Toni Collette, it's a brave and interesting character, so is Toni, She gained quite a lot weights for this role, She's really great as this fat, naive girl who is also virtuous and strong.In this film, it's like a Cinderella story, but in the end Cinderella does not become a princess, she's still a poor Cinderella, but she has eventually known the right path to choose for her own life. Not everyone can be beautiful swan, even if you are an ugly duck, you can still enjoy your life as a duck. That's the right attitude to life.The story is quite funny and sad too, Toni Collette again really is worth praising for her performance, you can taste her bitterness, happiness and facetiosity vividly, and Rachel Griffiths also gives a very powerful performance as Toni's best friends! And I feel really sorry for her mother's suicide, this poor woman is betrayed by her husband, ignored by her daughter, disrespected by her son one after another, at last she chose to kill herself, not wise but still shocking, I didn't expect this happening! We always tend to hurt the closest people usually our families to release ourselves, but sometimes we just need to think it over, although families usually are united firmly, but it doesn't mean then we can try to challenge this unity. So no matter what happened, never take out your anger upon your families.Also don't forget ABBA's songs, I love them very much, it's the most interesting part when Toni & Rachel sing ""Dancing Queen"" in this film!",Muriel's Wedding

But these lifestyle changes don't keep her life from falling apart. And as her parents split, her friend gets ill and she drowns in debt, Muriel must grow up in order to stay afloat.More depressing drama than laugh-out-loud comedy, this 1994 sleeper hit from Down Under deals with the harsh realities of becoming an adult, but manages to soften their edges with dark-humor and an up-tempo soundtrack dominated by the aforementioned Swedish pop group.Incidentally, always seat your Australian wedding guests as far from the gift table as possible.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Muriel's Wedding

It starts off as a rather clichéd comedy with cardboard characters, but gets better as it goes along. Murial's family members are so blandly drawn that they may as well be cartoon characters. Playing the father, Hunter's accent is so thick that it's hard for those with non-Australian ears to make out 90 percent of what he is saying. Fortunately, most of the focus is on Murial and she makes the film worth watching.

20,gcd70,Reflects everything that's Aussie,6,26 January 2008,"Wonderfully Australian from start to finish is P.J. Hogan's ""Muriel's Wedding"". Muriel Heslop is a frumpy, be-freckled young girl with no true friends and no job prospects. Cursed too with a dead-beat family and a politician father who tells everybody she's useless, life doesn't hold much hope for Muriel, until she steals $10 000 from her parents, and takes off.Toni Collette escorts us delightfully through the excitement and the heartbreak of Muriel's misadventures in life from her meeting with Rhonda (a strong performance from Rachel Griffiths) to her ""big day"". In fine support are Sophie Lee, most effective as bitchy school ""friend"" Tania, Jeanie Drynan, spot on as Muriel's dotty, non-plused mother, Gennie Nevison, Matt Day, Daniel LaPaine, Chris Haywood and a marvellous Bill Hunter, whose ""Bill the Battler"" is both politically hard nosed and brilliantly ocker. His response to his daughter's offer of a beer is a great example : ""That'd be lovely Joanie. Be with ya in a sec."" Director P.J. Hogan handles his very humorous script most assuredly, and he mixes in the drama with surprising effect. On the soundtrack side there is some great music from the 70's super group ""ABBA"", whose recent revival is at a definite crescendo (they never went out of style if you ask me). In fact Muriel's obsession with ABBA is almost as strong as her fixation with marriage.Even though some harsh language and adult themes make ""Muriel's Wedding"" a show that shouldn't be recommended for children, it does come recommended for all other Australian audiences who appreciate home grown cinema which reflects everything that's Aussie through and through.Tuesday, November 1, 1994 - Balwyn Cinema",Muriel's Wedding
21,rbverhoef,Funny and annoying,8,13 June 2003,"I liked the movie 'Muriel's Wedding'. I didn't like Muriel very much, she was a little annoying, although in the end she gets a bit better. I think this means the performance by Toni Collette is very good because I did like her in other movies.The whole movie is filled with terrible people. I felt pity for Muriel's mother. She is not completely right in the head and everyone is taking advantage of her. Her father (Bill Hunter) is a terrible man, her friends who are only friends when they feel like it are the worst friend there are, her brothers and sister ""are useless"" as their father says. The only likeable person, and you will like her, is Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths). With her Muriel goes away to start a real life in Sydney. The only thing she really wants is getting married because she thinks that means happiness.The performances are all pretty good but like I said the only person I could care for was Rhonda. Of course you hope things will be better for Muriel but sometimes she just is annoying. The reason you will still like her is because other people are even more annoying. Because all those characters a lot of funny moments are easily created. The first sexual experience Muriel has is hilarious. After a while you are used with the characters and you can fully enjoy the jokes.",Muriel's Wedding

I was coaxed into watching it by a friend, the one positive I have for this movie is that Abba is a wonderful band.Other then that, sadly this isn't a movie that I really cared about. I did care about some of the characters , but have no interest in watching some people be tormented and some do nasty things to each other, which starts immediately into this movie, and at times, seems the major plot point of Murial's Wedding. The movie was very depressing and it also moves at a snail's pace. That really bothered me. Most of the people I watch movies with feel the same with this one and yet so many people seem to like it. It's hard to know why.Not only was the story completely depressing but the movie dragged as well-and not just in one area. The story movies remarkably slow and the whole movie seemed overlong and quite dull at times. I had a very difficult time with this movie although Abba sure helped.

24,Spleen,An if-you-only-see-one-Australian-film film,10,24 September 1999,"P.J. Hogan has said that he made his main protagonist a woman simply to disguise the fact that her story was based on his own.  Does this mean that he -I don't want to know.Hogan's simple trick was an inspired one, for it makes Muriel accessible and human while showing us her life entirely from the outside - what we see is NOT some self-obsessed teenager's diary.  This is more remarkable when we consider that Muriel is, objectively speaking, a deeply unattractive person. Hogan even has to remind us of this every so often, since it's impossible not to like her - even before she reveals herself to be physically very beautiful.  And, of course, Muriel ends up learning from some of her mistakes.  As the film ends she's much the same doofus she's always been, but it's obvious that she's changed just enough for her life to be on a steady course.  I must class myself among her admirers.  She's one of the most intriguing and lovable characters I've ever encountered in a cinema.Apart from Muriel the characters are cartoons, but they're only JUST cartoons - and moreover, like Hogarth's drawings, they're serious cartoons. I defy anyone to put a finger on any one detail and call it inaccurate. (Porpoise Spit, for instance, although probably meant to be in New South Wales, is the scarcely at all exaggerated image of a hideous, corrupt, Queensland coastal shire.  The very name is just right.  It sounds like the kind of name a Queensland tourist trap might have, but examine the words closely and one gets the image of a dolphin being roasted over a fire.)Like most people under the age of thirty I have no exposure to any Australian film made before the date of my birth, so if I were to say that `Muriel's Wedding' represents Australian cinema's finest hour, my claim would ring hollow.  But it's not a ridiculous claim.  I was surprised at how well the film held up, revisited a few years later after all the fuss had died down.  It has already acquired indefinable magic halo, and it's becoming apparent that no-one at the time of its release - not critics, not audiences, and least of all the people who created it - realised just how good it was.",Muriel's Wedding
25,aimless-46,On My Short List of All-Time Classics,10,8 October 2005,"A great movie, so good that I was shocked to actually find even a few negative comments. Apparently there is a small segment of the population that watches movies, has no sense of humor, and are clueless about the concept of a theme. Or maybe they just missed all the great details, little things like Rhonda calling Tania's husband Turkey instead of Chook (Aussie slang for chicken). Muriel's little sister Penelope constantly scratching herself in the background and the Japanese interpreter choking when Diedre speculates that their wives must be geisha's. Like its obvious predecessor ""Georgy Girl (1966), the film is nicely bookended. Early on a there is a tight shot of Muriel in her room after being brought home by the police for shoplifting. The walls are covered with Abba posters and photos of brides, ""Dancing Queen"" is playing. The closing sequence has an identical shot (also to ""Dancing Queen"") inside the taxi taking Muriel and Rhonda away from Porpoise Spit, but first the editor cuts back and forth between the two friends before holding on a close up of Muriel's face. That is because Muriel has grown since the beginning of the film, discovering what's actually important to her vs what she thought was important to her. Pretty basic stuff but sadly absent in most stories.The Bridal Shop scene with the instrumental version of Dancing Queen was simply one of the best movie scenes of all time. The cuts to the cymbal were absolutely perfect.""Why, that's Deirdre Chambers, what a coincidence"".",Muriel's Wedding
26,rosscinema,Collette shines in fine film,8,15 April 2003,"I've always been a fan of Australian films and I love the unconventional way Australian filmmakers tell their quirky stories. Here's the story of a fat and lonely young woman named Muriel (Toni Collette) who dreams of getting married and thinks she'll be a real somebody when that happens. Her father is a local politician who criticizes his family as worthless at every turn. Muriel's friends are very shallow and finally tell her that they don't want to be friends with her anymore. Muriel steals money from her father and follows her former friends to a resort and runs into Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) who use to go to high school with Muriel and soon become fast friends. They both end up in Sydney living together and talking about never going back to Porpoise Spit, the city where they are from. The story is both funny and sad and even the humor sometimes rides a very thin edge of seriousness. Muriel decides to marry a South African athlete who is competing for the Olympics and wants a visa. Muriel thinks this is her time to change and be a different person. Overall message is pretty clear but the writing and directing are presented in a fresh manner by P.J. Hogan who despite some very serious character flaws in all her characters maintains a sense that she likes and cares for them all. This makes the film more absorbing and the personality flaws allow for each character to have they're own special moments. Griffiths exudes pure energy on the screen and she has that special quality that just cannot be taught in acting classes. She's interesting and exciting and you just can't take your eyes off her when she's on screen. Seeing Toni Collette now makes her practically unrecognizable in this film. She really is overweight! Collette is terrific as Muriel and her performance is the core of the film. As good of a script as this is and as exciting as Griffiths is its still Collette's picture. Her casting was pivotal to the film. Collette has never been better and that includes her performance in ""The Sixth Sense"". Collette adds just the right blend of pathos and unusual charm that Lynn Redgrave gave in ""Georgy Girl"". Her performance resonates both pity and smiles all  during the course of the film and thats not an easy feat. Message is simple but the characters and the performances really lift this fine film to a must see!",Muriel's Wedding
27,Christmas-Reviewer,I love this movie one of my all time favorites.,10,13 February 2006,"This is the story of a 'Cinderella"" story but instead this ""Cinderella"" lies & steals and we still love her. Toni Collette first movie role and boy she is just great. (She Was later in The Sixth Sense). The story in this movie is that our heroin is an overweight nobody. The only real fun she has is going into her room and listens to ""Abba"" music. Now Now ""Muriel"" feels like ""nothing"". She is that ""inner nerd in all of us"". Muriel is a little immature.. She hangs out with a group of girls (the popular girls from her high school but now they are all in there 20's). One day they demand that Muriel stop hanging around them. Muriel is crushed. Muriel also knows that one member of the group has slept with the other girls husband on their wedding day. To make a long story short all the girls end up at a resort and then Muriel runs into Rhonda an old high school sort-of friend. To give away more would be a MAJOR crime! If you have to buy this to see it then do so.",Muriel's Wedding
28,martimusross,A Total Joy From Start To Finish,9,20 January 2021,"Muriel's WeddingThis delightful movie is the everyday story of the caterpillar becoming a butterfly by right of passage.Whilst it may not seem obvious this is truly what female empowerment looks like. Muriel decides she is ""nothing"" and only by being married will she be redefined as ""something"", of course this delusion comes from her patriarchal unbringing and her perceived ""ordinaryness"". As the movie progresses she asserts her growing confidence and world becomes the ""right side up"".Wanda is an allegory of brokenness and perhaps the physical manifestation of inner Muriel. Either way life is for the living and needs to be self-defined and lived on your own terms. If only Hollywood could understand that female empowerment does not lay competing with men but being a better woman.10/10",Muriel's Wedding
29,rivertam26,One of the best movies ever,10,7 September 2012,"I'm so happy I was lucky enough to revisit this splendid film. i remember seeing it when I was younger. But now it feels like a different movie. it's even better than I remember it and that may be because I can truly appreciate the films message more prominently. The film centers on a young woman named Muriel played by a young Toni Collette who gained 40 lbs. for the role. She's sort of an odd duckling whose friends don't appreciate her and constantly put her down. And that goes the same for her verbally abusive father as well. After her friends decide to ""break up"" with her she finds an old acquaintance from high school while on a vacation and they become best friends. She tells a lie and than it leads to another and another. Her dreams of getting married consume her completely and I'm sure you can guess what ultimately happens. Let me say that this movie is hysterically funny but it does move into a very depressing stage but really has some very important things to say. About self worth, following your dreams, society's impressions on how we should live our lives, friendship and finding a way to truly be happy. I'm sure it sounds a bit corny but it's all handled with an unexpected grace which really make it the one of a kind film it is and one of the best movies I've ever seen!",Muriel's Wedding

31,sharky_55,"You're terrible, Muriel.",7,16 March 2016,"Muriel's Wedding is one of those films for the downtrodden, the rejects, the less than attractive members of the student body, the ones who never amount to anything. It is for the Muriels who would rather be Mariel, pretty and famous and successful. Do we know how much of Muriel's failures are a result of her neglectful and emotionally abusive upbringing at the hands of her prideful father? P.J. Hogan never gives us a straight answer - it isn't nearly as easy or simple in real life. What is rather wonderful is an early Toni Collete's blossoming performance. She is one of those people where you can almost make out the scars of acne (not quite literally), braces and bullying of high school. Before the glamour and acclaim there was this girl, the slightly chubby underachiever who sloppily applies too much red lipstick and has carved out a happy place comprised entirely of ABBA songs. And Collete's performance is so painfully naive and oblivious that even as she gets soullessly married for money and prestige she has a huge grin on her face. It's big enough to ignore her mother. The great thing about Muriel's Wedding is that it takes its story to that expected end - the high powered couple, the glamour wedding, the middle finger to the high school bullies. But it also realises and accepts that this isn't something that Muriel is fit for at all. There is the crazy, pixie-haired punk Rhonda whom has actually broken out of the mould in a much more natural and independent way - she has the intelligence to know that high school doesn't really matter anyway, and that long held grudges and deep-seated desires to one-up those bullies and prove you are better than them are silly in the end. She mouths them off in the reunion, but it's not some defining, cathartic moment it would be for Muriel. It is billed first as an offbeat comedy - and it is funny too, maybe funnier for the non-Australian audiences who will relish the way these characters cruelly and frankly cut straight to the chase, and the heavy, outrageous accents which do not give away a hint of sympathy or false pretense. But it is also dark in some spots, and painfully real. Muriel's father has long aspired to run for government, and bullied his children for never ever reaching his (rather mediocre high) achievements. We see how this has been internalised and normalised; after cruelly announcing his divorce and lamenting his shambles of a family, Betty lets off an agonising ""STOP DISAPPOINTING YOUR FATHER"" because she has been trained so diligently to deflect the blame away from her husband. Admittedly it does take a few wrong turns in getting there. The whole Van Arkle Olympics plot is pretty ludicrous and it takes a horrid sex scene for Muriel to actually come to her senses and for him to... fall in love with her? The whole tone of broaching that physical barrier is pretty ridiculous in fact; Muriel doesn't really know how to react when a boy actually shows her attention, so she bursts out in laughter while making out and in a rather crass bit of comedy, shrieks at her first sighting of a penis. But of course this sort of stuff comes with the package. You reap what you sow. And Muriel's Wedding recognises that a big, lavish wedding may indeed not always be the solution or the path to the happy ending.",Muriel's Wedding
32,jhclues,Incredibly Moving Performance by Toni Collette,10,13 June 2001,"Where do you go and to whom do you turn, when it's time to emerge from adolescence and get on with your life, but you find yourself incapacitated from having had your self esteem methodically peeled away year after miserable year by a brutal father who has convinced you that you're worth less than a piece of garbage a dog wouldn't touch?  That's the story of Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), a young woman who, along with her brothers and sisters, has been mercilessly and ceaselessly denigrated and publicly humiliated by her father, Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter), seemingly since the day she was born, in `Muriel's Wedding,' directed by P.J. Hogan.  Bill Heslop is a local councilman in the less-than-thriving city of Porpoise Point, Australia.  In the eyes of those who don't know him, he's a great man, a hero even; and he's definitely a legend in his own mind.  But in his own home he doles out psychological abuse relentlessly-- and the sad thing is, he does it seemingly without realizing what he's doing.  Muriel, out of school, but so unsure of herself that she's unable to wrench herself free of the dominating Mr. Heslop, escapes into a world of ABBA songs and daydreams of her own wedding, which she perceives as being the ultimate reward-- the thing that will finally bring her happiness and give her life meaning.Not surprisingly, Muriel has some problems to work out before she can even think of making a change that will turn her life around.  Her lack of self esteem has rendered her socially inept, overweight, slow witted and incapable of making a decision.  And as far as the wedding that will change everything-- well, Muriel has no boyfriend, never has had one, and there are certainly no prospects on the horizon.  Her dream of being ABBA's `Dancing Queen,' is about as remote as pigs that can fly.  Muriel does have friends, however; four girls she knows from school, one of whom just got married, into whose lives she basically imposes herself in a last ditch effort to find acceptance any way she can.  Then one night, even they tell her not to come around them anymore, that she is an embarrassment.  And for Muriel, it's the final straw that drives her to do something desperate.  Something that will ultimately change her life forever.That it is billed as an `Hilarious comedy about friends, fun and unexpected surprises' and `Hysterically funny,' makes you wonder about the marketing machinery of the entertainment industry.  Is it a funny movie?  Yes, it is; just as life is often funny, even when it's at it's worst.  Hilarious?  Yes. All of which seems contradictory to the story that is at the heart of the film.  And yet, it's those very contradictions, those same multi-layered complexities of which life is made, that makes this such a wonderful movie. On one hand, Bill Heslop is one of the most despicable characters you'll ever encounter in a film; and on the other, Muriel is one of the most sympathetic.  The humor of this film is derived from the natural and very real situations in which the characters find themselves.  And just as there is something within us all that at times allows us to laugh at the misfortunes of others (perhaps occasionally born of a `better you than me' mentality), there are things you're going to laugh at in this film.  But as you sit back and watch as one misery upon another is heaped upon Muriel, you'd have to be either an unfeeling person or a sociopath not to be crying at least on the inside, even if you're laughing on the outside.  There are times when you just want to reach out to Muriel and let her know that one way or another, everything is going to be okay.Toni Collette (in her second film) gives an incredibly moving performance as Muriel, making her about as real as a character can get.  She conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions alone, that you can feel the torment and the turmoil she keeps bottled up and buried deep within herself, without ever having to hear her speak a word.  Anyone who's ever known even a moment of misfortune in their life will be able to relate to her.  Unwittingly, she wears her feelings on her sleeve; not that she wants to, but when your cup of adversity finally overflows, it's going to show. And it takes a special actor to play a character like this and make her so convincing, without taking it over the top or into the gray planes of melodrama.  And Collette is that actor.  She's perfect in this role, and she had to be for this film to work.  Anything less than a perfect counterpoint to the character of Bill Heslop would've quickly derailed this project, and the humor alone wouldn't have done the job.  All of the tricks, jokes and funny lines in the world wouldn't have been enough to overcome that very real sense of loathing Bill Hunter brings to the role of Heslop.The supporting cast includes Rachel Griffiths (Rhonda), Sophie Lee (Tania), Rosalind Hammond (Cheryl), Belinda Jarrett (Janine), Pippa Grandison (Nicole), Jeanie Drynan (exceptionally effective as Betty, Muriel's mother) and Daniel Lapaine (David).  In one of the most uplifting scenes you're ever likely to see in a movie, Muriel and Rhonda lip-sync to ABBA's `Waterloo,' which in the screenplay probably came across as something fun but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  But on the screen, it becomes a moment that is absolutely transporting.  And that's the magic of `Muriel's Wedding.'  It takes you into the dark, but never allows you to languish there; ultimately, it takes you into the light, and when it does, it's brighter than anything you could imagine.  I rate this one 10/10.",Muriel's Wedding
33,johno-21,Intelligent comedy from Oz,8,2 May 2006,"This is a quirky comedy from Austrailian director/writer PJ Hogan that makes for a pretty good movie. Muriel comes from a dysfunctional family and tries to fit in with a group of friends who really aren't her friends. Overweight, plain and dowdy and seemingly simplistic she doesn't seem to fit in anywhere so she spends a lot of time in her room fantasizing about getting married and listening to her favorite group ABBA surrounded by pictures of brides and pictures of ABBA. Problem is she doesn't even have a boyfriend let alone a fiancé so her wedding day seems nowhere in sight and her favorite band is long broken up and their music hopelessly dated so she seems forever stuck alone in this escapism world she has created for herself. She gains a friend and ally in Rhonda and things began to change. Toni Collette gives a Golden Globe nominated performance as Muriel in her third film and second leading role and Rachell Griffiths is great as Rhonda in her film debut. Among the all-Austrialian cast are Bill Hunter, Jeanie Drynan and Chris Haywood. The release of the greatest hits album ABBA Gold in 1992 sold a lot of copies as people scooped them up and listened in guilty pleasure to the defunct 70's Swedish pop group which set the stage for an ABBA revival of interest in their music and this film solidified and helped launch that revival and the renewed interest in ABBA hasn't waned since. This is an intelligent comedy and one of those small but odd and quirky films that you end up liking. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.",Muriel's Wedding

Fortunately, things improved considerably, but not quite enough to erase the memory of the abysmal start. In general, this film was entertaining enough, with a few laughs and some decent dramatic moments, but I was still left disappointed.  Perhaps a few more fun ABBA songs would have helped to brighten the movie up, since it occasionally was uncomfortably dark, and these darker scenes seemed a little out of place.  I think that I really would have liked this film if it had been light-hearted throughout, but instead I was left with the memory of a brutal beginning and a film that fell short of what it could have been.",Muriel's Wedding

Unfortunately, the bouquet along with the brief joy it brings are quickly snatched from her. Muriel's mean girl frenemies are quick to point out that Muriel lives at home with a dysfunctional family and has never even been asked out on a date. ""No one is ever going to marry you,"" they add. Sadly, they aren't the only bullies in Muriel's life. Her dad frequently insists that Muriel is useless, a failure and embarrassment. But Muriel's fortunes brighten with a blank check, tropical vacation, new friend and change of heart. Even Husband material appears. However these welcome developments are threatened when old fears and bad habits surface again.25 years ago in Minneapolis this truly unique, funny and touching story was the beginning of my love affair with foreign films. Muriel's Wedding is brilliantly written and full of fantastic insights. The characters are remarkably human and multi-dimensional. The story is irreverent and full of ups and downs, surprises, and twists and turns. Young Toni Collette is the perfect Muriel. An Abba infused soundtrack melds well to the wacky scenes. There are many wonderful themes that revolve around self-discovery, family, friendships, politics and finding true love.",Muriel's Wedding

39,mnpollio,Some highlight offset by a dull central character,5,14 February 2011,"Uneven comedy-drama from writer-director P.J. Hogan offers some proof of Hogan's emerging talent, but never really reaches its potential due to the flat central character. Toni Collette plays Muriel, a bored dishrag from Porpoise Spit, Australia. She aimlessly spends her time listening to ABBA music and fantasizing about a wedding day that may never be, while enduring the company of her undisciplined siblings and a gaggle of catty female friends who keep her around as a verbal punching bag. Her father is an obnoxious philandering local politician who takes his family for granted and her mother is a zoned out manic depressive, who only barely seems to realize that the glamour puss cosmetic saleswoman that keeps crashing family night is her husband's mistress. After Muriel steals money from her parents to go on a vacation, she hooks up with a free-spirited old acquaintance and embarks on a journey of discovery that changes her life and might bring her the wedding day she longs for. Marketed as a comedy, the film has some funny moments, but a lot of what goes on is surprisingly somber. Many of the people that inhabit the landscape of Muriel's life are either mean-spirited and nasty or colorless victims worn down by the ordeals. The film perks up substantially with the arrival of Rachel Griffiths as the free-spirited friend, but then her character is somewhat sidelined by being stricken as a paraplegic. Director Hogan keeps things moving along and gets lots of mileage out of the ABBA soundtrack, but his shifts between drama and comedy are clumsy. Worse, the film can do nothing about the fact that its central character of Muriel is just not that interesting or worthwhile an individual. We initially have empathy for Muriel in the opening moments having to cope with her monstrous family and frenemies. Unfortunately, she spends the majority of the film floating from one misadventure to another without really gleaning much in the way of knowledge or wisdom. Following the crippling of her friend, Muriel moves on with barely a look back, leaving behind both the woman who enabled her to strike out on a new life and a nice guy who genuinely loves her. She changes her name to Mariel and finds herself the recipient of a deal to marry a hunky Olympic diver Daniel Lapaine, who needs to solidify his Australian citizenship, and gets her wedding day. Collette is normally a fine actress, but she does very little with Muriel here. She spends much of the film blank of face, as though shell-shocked at life. She does better with some of the comical moments – the scene where she bursts into joyous laughter when she gets her first glimpse of her fiancé of convenience emerging from the pool in a tiny Speedo is funny both because of her uncharacteristic reaction and Lapaine's look of terror when he realizes this is his future wife. Unfortunately, Muriel never seems to become very decisive and even the film's closing moments have her seem like a drifter. We are apparently supposed to be content that Muriel has grown as a person because she changes her name back to Muriel, tells her dad to be a better father to her siblings after her mother's suicide and returns to help Griffiths. While the latter particularly shows some promise, one cannot overlook how Muriel has treated Lapaine in this process. When Muriel's mother dies, Lapaine reveals himself to be a genuinely nice guy and stands by her in her hour of need and even starts a physical relationship with her. But when Muriel decides that she needs to change her life again, she reneges on their business deal, keeps the money and cavalierly leaves him much as she did her supporters earlier in the film. She never does re-establish contact with the other guy whose heart she broke and who keeps lingering around the edges of the film, and one cannot help but think that in another month she will decide to change her life again and abandon Griffiths for a second time. The film launched the international career of Colette and has a staunch following, but while there are highlights, some directorial promise from Hogan and some good supporting acting, the average viewer may wisely wonder why Muriel is worth much consideration.",Muriel's Wedding
40,higherall7,Dreams of Wedded Bliss...,8,14 May 2021,"This is a wacky family comedy/drama about a young lady harboring low self esteem. We discover her fantasy is that once she finally makes come true her Hollywood style wedding, it will cure whatever ails her and all will be right with the world. This not so impossible dream is the brain child and hobbyhorse of Muriel Heslop, whose father, Bill Heslop as played by Bill Hunter, constantly belittles her and her other siblings. She's a high school dropout with not much going for her; what with no job or boy friend or viable prospects for either. She spends much of her time listening to ABBA music, to cope with her desperation to find a way out of her hometown of Porpoise Spit.She hangs around Tania, Cheryl, Janine, and Nicole, a group of shallow and egotistical 'friends' to whom she is an object of ridicule. While attending the wedding of Tania and her groom Chook in an inappropriate leopard print dress she has shoplifted from a department store, she finds herself escorted out of the reception by the police after the store detective, who is curiously also attending the wedding, identifies her. But this is not before she witnesses the groom Chook and Nicole having sex with each other in the laundry room. After her somewhat embarrassing departure from Tania's big day, her so-called friends decide to shun
her despite Muriel's tearful pleading to be one of them. Nonetheless, she resolves to doggedly follow them to Hibiscus Island, where they are planning to spend a Holiday retreat.This is only the beginning to the twists and turns that develop from this complicated mess. Muriel clutches at every straw, and this includes defrauding her parents and draining her father's bank account to make it to her friends Island Holiday. But once she arrives, Muriel discovers that her so-called social group considers she is stalking them. Collectively they lay down the law and insist that she leave them alone. At this point, she runs into Rhonda Epinstall as played by Rachel Griffiths, who becomes a new source of companionship and an effective balm for her sense of worthlessness. Rhonda confronts Muriel's bullying friends and berates them for the superficial display they call their lives.But complications and problems continue to develop and arise for all the quirky characters involved. One of the highlights of the film is the hilariously outrageous lip synching that Muriel and Rhonda do to an ABBA song during a talent contest on the island while elaborately costumed. Through all the fraud and infidelity and celebrations of promiscuity and unexpected accidents and operations for life threatening conditions, Muriel finds time to desert her friend Rhonda when she needs her the most and enter into a criminal conspiracy to commit visa fraud by marrying Olympic Swimming contender David Van Arkle. He's a sexy, attractive catch and it looks like Muriel has finally gotten what she wanted albeit by devious and fraudulent means. But no one can doubt that she has turned out to be quite a beauty in a white wedding dress and it even reconciles her enough with her former 'friends' to have them act as her bridesmaids. Because of the Olympic fame of her husband-to-be, Muriel suddenly finds herself on the covers of National magazines in Australia and it's all too good to be true.Now it is at this point that the dysfunctionality of her family background loops back on her and begins to unravel her illusion of wedded bliss. David Van Arkle as her newly minted husband can barely conceal his contempt for her and when they return home introduces her to what will for all intents and purposes be a platonic relationship between them. But when Muriel's mother Betty discovers that her husband Bill intends to divorce her in order to marry his mistress, Deidre Chambers, this soap opera on speed goes into high gear. Suffice to say, that Muriel gets a true wedding night with David under somewhat tragic circumstances and afterwards decides to end this strangest of Cinderella stories by divorcing him. If I have left anything out, it is with good reason. The ending affirms true friendship over love obtained through fraud and deception, but what happens after that is probably best for you to find out for yourself. Directed by P. J. Hogan and produced by Lynda House and Jocelyn Moorhouse, you will find Toni Collette's award winning performance a keeper even if you didn't get an invite to the after party.",Muriel's Wedding

42,HenryHextonEsq,Merely a hedged bet.,6,10 July 2002,"""Muriel's Wedding"" is much a film that cannot decide what it is about. Different strands are developed and dropped just as easily. It doesn't settle into a truly explorative character study, but then the main character is somewhat limited. The makers are clearly going for the ""feelgood"" approach, slanted very slightly off-centre, in a bid to get a hit film. It is a shame there is not more depth here, perhaps, or better comedy. The lack of a more ironic narrative commentary too often leads to the audience being asked to take at face value fairly unremarkable events and behaviour. This is an embossed, shrewd soap opera of a film; one that avoids too many complexities. This is really crystallized by the ending; jarring with the sense I got of the ongoing drama, and merely providing a ""happy ending"". While, yes, Rachel Griffiths instills her character with credibility and an easy to overlook charm,  the film really does not afford her that much time. We get the perfunctory, indifferent family drama aspect given undue emphasis; while Bill Hunter is good there is not much of real interest there. Yes, it provides a contrasting picture of what Muriel is ""rebelling"" against, but it is ponderously lingered over for far too long to little end.There are no embarrassing features really about the film; it is competent to the letter, but tellingly uninspired. Rachel Griffiths is really the main plus here, coming across as wonderfully natural on screen, and making her character that bit more wry and questioning than any other in the film. Toni Collette seems to be much-lauded for her turn her, but I do not think it is warranted. She does what the script and character demand, but no more really. At times, sympathetic indeed, but it's a shame the director/writer cops out of really criticising the character, particularly in the later parts of the film. This Muriel is something of a deluded, gauche girl; an outsider that when set alongside a considerable gallery of film outsiders and neurotics, comes across as too sketchy a character. The script limits her to virtually one main character aspect; an obsession with the trappings and trinketry of marriage as a substitute for self-contentment. This substitution however, is only ambiguously made out to be highly misguided. We do not learn enough really about the film's central character, and she gets a soap style ""easy ride"". Collette can be said to be convincingly cloying and if it is the authorial intention, a mite irritating. She does manage pathos, but it is only at fleeting moments, as the character is largely too self-absorbed in quite an uninteresting way. It is perhaps all too typical that this awkward misfit is overweight, and the fact dwelt upon; all perhaps negated by Collette actually looking quite alluring, in spite of the ""quirky"" mannerisms.Too much of a demographic-tilted effort in all; a superior screen soap, definitely, but little grounds for praise dramatically or comedically. It is offbeat and subversive only in quite a superficial and fleeting way. Rachel Griffiths was definitely a find, and is quite a joy here. But, it is a shame that the film is too often pitched at the level of the shallow trio of girls mocked in the actual film. There really is less here than meets the eye; resulting in a merely passable, convoluted picture.Rating:- ***/*****",Muriel's Wedding
43,budikavlan,3 or 4 terrific movies rolled into one,10,3 June 2002,"Amazingly self-assured combination of satire, personal drama, and gentle comedy that marks the emergence of several great talents.  Viewers who particularly identify with the main character view this as almost a religious experience.  I think of it more as a comedy; the dramatic elements are emotionally compelling as well, however.  The virtuoso performance of Toni Collette cements the disparate elements into a unified whole.  The joy with which ""Dancing Queen"" plays at the end is infectious and well-earned--this is a film for everyone.",Muriel's Wedding
44,malvernp,Comedy Plus Drama Equals Difficulty,6,6 May 2021,"Freely mixing comedy and drama invariably presents a serious challenge to developing a successful film narrative. Comedy is hard in itself--so the experts always tell us--and introducing dramatic elements in the story tends to complicate it often with negative results. Whether calling these efforts black comedy, comedy-drama or comic melodrama--the effect is generally the same. The comedy is often undermined by the shift to more serious plot developments, and audiences can be unsettled when good comedic ideas are weakened by unexpected (and often unwanted) dramatic intrusions.There are many examples of this film genre. Quite a few of them have proved to be only modestly successful at best. See, e.g. Eating Raoul (1982), Little Murders (1971), Something Wild (1986), and Penny Serenade (1941). It is particularly difficult to pull off this marriage of diverse plot elements well when the drama turns unexpectedly violent or tragic, or when the characters are unappealing or off-putting. However, if the film enters the realm of comic drama and then allows the comedic aspect to dominate the dramatic, the results can be very satisfying. See, e.g. A Slight Case Of Murder (1938), The Whole Town's Talking (1936)--both starring Edward G. Robinson--and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948-probably more of a spoof, but the monsters are playing it straight!).This brings us to Muriel's Wedding. This film presents us with a group of mostly unpleasant characters. The leading female role played by Toni Collette is a congenital liar and a habitual thief. Her father is a domineering bully. Her mother is almost a doormat-like person. Only her best friend (played by Rachel Griffiths) demonstrates attractive qualities that make the viewer want to root for her. The film's comedy is modest, but its negative dramatic moments are many and significant. What could have been a highly successful comedic ""buddy"" picture moves in starts and spurts--often undone by its unrelenting sea of negative dramatic incidents. Too bad--because most of the actors were quite good at what they did.The people who made Muriel's Wedding should be commended for their effort to venture into this genre's troubled waters. But based upon past experience, the odds may have been stacked against them. The fact that so many people seem to like this film suggests that they developed an emotional connection with the story notwithstanding its dual message. That is certainly one of its positive accomplishments.If viewers want to see how such a film can be made more successfully, l respectfully recommend that they start by taking a look at the two Robinson movies. It definitely can be done.",Muriel's Wedding
45,bcheng93,...it's important to know who we are as individuals and try to have confidence in ourselves,8,3 March 2014,"priceless movie magic: the end of the movie with Muriel and Rhonda in the taxi on the way to Sydney. the look on Muriel's face...ahh, only a great actress can accomplish that, there was so much emotion running through that look, to me it was so bittersweet and that look summed up the whole movie. finally got to see this movie 20 years after its release, and i'm a big fan of Toni Collete. i gave this movie an 8 out of 10 and it is probably a little underrated at 7.2 although that is not shabby at all. the movie feels like it was made on a micro-budget(for sure under a million dollars) and it just shows you that you can still create movie magic with-out a big budget. the movie feels so real, i know families like that and it takes a major effort to break out of surroundings like that and at the end of the movie i think Muriel did accomplish that and was able to feel confident in her own skin. this was by no small feat accomplished by her far-out there real friend Rhonda. these 2 characters made up the whole movie for me. what happened to Muriel's mom was so heartbreaking. not counting what she did to herself at the end, plenty of women live through what she lived through and in a blink you are old and unfulfilled wondering what happened?great movies take you on a trip without you even noticing it and this movie certainly did it for me...a well spent 100 minutes of my life. Toni Collete has got some serious acting chops and is one of my favorite actresses.again to me it is not a feel-good movie, it is really bittersweet and oh that look on Muriel's face at the end...this is going to be one of those timeless classics and if call yourself a fan of movies this is a must see...Enjoy!",Muriel's Wedding
46,catfanatic888,PERFECT FILM! Flawless performance by Toni Collette!,10,9 June 2020,"I saw this fantastic film back in the 90s and it made a deep impression on me. It made me laugh and cry. If you don't feel compassion and empathy for Muriel, you are a sociopathic monster. Toni Collette just kills it with her phenomenal acting. But this is no sappy rom-com. It's much deeper and more substantive than that. I shared this brilliant film with my husband today . He loved it too. How could anyone Not?",Muriel's Wedding
47,The-Last-Prydonian,A neat balancing act of comedy and bitter-sweet drama from P.J. Hogan,8,9 January 2018,"Muriel's Wedding focus's on young Muriel Helop (Toni Colette) who resides in the small out of the way town of Porpoise Spit; she sits alone in her room listening to the songs of Abba, and dreaming of a better life when she is married. The problem is however that she has never had a boyfriend; and her social standing isn't the greatest among her so called bitchy friends.
Eventually she finds herself cruelly shunned by them; and her dysfunctional home life with her domineering father (Bill Hunter) doesn't help matters. Stealing some money she runs way, with fate bringing her together with former classmate and fellow outcast Rhonda Epinstalk; (Rachel Griffith) which proves to be a life changing encounter.An unexpected sleeper hit on it's 1994 theatrical release; raking $15.7 million at the domestic box office, and $57.5 million on a modest $9 million budget; Muriel's Wedding was the archetypal; Ugly Duckling story which had been told many times before. This is figuratively speaking really, for when it's all said and done the titular Muriel as portrayed by the then hitherto unknown Toni Collette was, and still is far from unattractive to this day. Having gained 40lb in just 7 weeks which marked her dedication to the role which brought her to international attention; it did nothing to rob her of the radiance that would occasionally seep through her dowdy facade. It's hardly revelatory that she should be so, given the clear genetic weight gain from her even more frumpy overweight sister; (Gabby Millgate) and to her emotionally troubled mother who has the seemingly burdensome task of also having to take care of the rest Muriel's male and female siblings. It would be a lie say that her family is not dysfunctional; and it's not made any easier by her overbearing father; Bill Heslop with veteran actor; Bill Hunter stepping effectively in to the role of a boorish local counsel-man with political ambitions beyond his meagre talents. A man who routinely passes the buck for his shortcomings onto his put upon family; it's difficult not to have any sympathy for them.However; in terms of Muriel's personal issues, they're compounded even further by the clique of mean-spirited, self-centred ""popular girls. Vain and egocentric to the point of toxicity; they grind poor Muriel to emotional breaking point when (and it's no real spoiler) they pitilessly cast her aside. It' a a genuinely heartbreaking moment and Director; P.J. Hogan (who would inevitably cross the Atlantic to direct the exceedingly unremarkable, 2003 cinematic version of; Peter Pan) who also scripted the film, showcases his aptitude for characterization and setting a scene; brings them and the scenario marvelously to life, as he does the rest of the supporting players.It all of course serves as the impetus behind our disheartened heroine and is the key driving force by her irrevocable quest for change and acceptance. And in comes Rachel Griffith's as the sassy, unconstrained Rhonda Epinstack, a former classmate who fate should deem it necessary to cross her figurative path. This marked another breakout performance which would eventually see Griffith like her leading lady head for the bright lights of Hollywood, featuring in movies like; My Best Friends Wedding, Blow and the hit cable TV series; Six Feet Under. Somewhat in your face she may be as a character; but it's a quality that serves her well as there is a genuine, bona fide person behind the brassy exterior. What you see is what you get and her no nonsense, forthright nature is what necessitates anchoring the misguided Muriel in reality. Most of her scenes with Rhonda showcase some of the highlights of the movie; whether it be from them performing an Abba tribute act together at the sunny holiday resort where they met, to a night out on the town where the two; with Muriel dragging along her date; the shy, unassuming Brice Nobes (Matt Day). A young parking inspector with whom Muriel caught his eye in the video store she is now employed in. It culminates with an amusing romantic tryst back at her and Rhonda's flat which the bashful young man won't forget in a hurry. But for all the comedy; there is a significant dose of bitter-sweet drama which underpins the lighter moments. There's Muriel's predilection for being economical with the truth and the fact and her defrauding her own parents, the latter knack for theft being something she inherited all too well from her troubled mother; and the lengths she goes to for acceptance from her bitchy former ""friends""; as well as her father's self absorbed pretensions, and an unavoidable test of friendship for her that comes right out of left field; all make for a mostly sublime tonal balancing act which writer/director Hogan skillfully pulls off. Admittedly it's a movie with themes that haven't been tackled before; and the cynic in me might think that certain aspects as it comes in to it's final act may descend a bit too much in to the absurd as with our young heroine exhibiting her love for Abba in a comically theatrical moment of tawdry showiness. But it does work for the most part and when it needs to it does really pull at the heartstrings with profound effectiveness. Boasting some superb performances with nary a foot being put wrong it stands up against the similarly themed; Australian hit Strictly Ballroom although it would never be a patch on the wonderful; Priscilla Queen of the Desert.",Muriel's Wedding

Though, most might find her character annoying she's just so lovely.This movie follows Muriel a lower than average girl who believes that getting married will complete her life. She takes her family's saving to start her life in Sydney while living with her friend. There's a lot of mishaps among a variety of things that happens when her dreams come true. But Muriel is smarter than we give her credit from in the beginning.For the outcast in all of us who do not have a hidden talent, who are just the way we are I believe that this takes a semi-realistic look at how life goes, even when you get hit with the strike of lightening.

This movie manages to convey silly moments, funny moments and tender moments very cleverly to where I was crying with laughter and sadness at the same time. I am proud that this movie came from Australia. Before I end I would like to establish this is not just a chick-flick. I am a guy and I loved this movies and all my friends love the movie.

It was truly a feel good movie, and a true classic. Definitely one of my new favorites!",Muriel's Wedding
51,JamieWJackson,exceptionally good,8,10 June 2003,"Collette and Griffiths won awards for this, I hear.  I'm not surprised! They are quite substantial here (in Collette's case, of course, physically as well as thespianically -- is that a word?!).  I knew nothing about the movie when I saw it; I'd heard the title before, but that's about it.  I never knew where the story was headed, or how any particular character would turn out.  (Gee, about like real life....)  The other reviews here that I just read did a good job of covering most of the main points I would make about the film so I'll only mention two I didn't see in those reviews.1. The events in this film are not slathered over in a ""stirring"" soundtrack (the occasional Abba tune is almost tongue-in-cheek).  The significance of each event, both for the story and for the characters, is allowed to simply be whatever it might happen to be for the viewer; we're not hand-held to like or dislike or laugh or cry.  I really, really appreciated that. Combined with the way almost every character had their good moments and bad moments, the effect for me was to make this fictional ""world"" very believable.  Even a few obviously over-the-top moments couldn't break the spell.2. The title led me to think of this as a light-hearted, feel-good movie. It's not, really, though neither does it try to play up the emotionally vivid elements of the plot.  In retrospect, I suppose the title fits; the problem is, it's titled in a spirit unlike most movies are titled, which is why I was expecting something else.This is a really, really good movie.  Not quite perfect, but I give it 8/10. It would have been 9 with a better ending.  Some of the flaws it does have seem to me to be such that correcting them would alter the feel of the movie unacceptably, so, while I might agree, for instance, that the consequences of Muriel's lifestyle aren't entirely dealt with, I'm not sure I would want them to be entirely dealt with within this movie.  I like this one a lot.",Muriel's Wedding

54,cleary-joshua,I don't think any actor/actress has come as far as Toni Collette...,7,25 October 2013,"I always find it fascinating to see the early performances of well-known actors, like Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"". However I don't think any actor/actress has come as far as Toni Collette has since ""Muriel's Wedding"". It is almost impossible to see the same actor in both this and something recent, like ""The Way, Way Back"", but both performances are demonstrations of how great an actress she is. Collette, playing the title character, leads this movie effortlessly, with a hilarious and heart-breaking performance. It's a film about love, being the odd-one-out, and Australia.The film gives a strange view of Australia, similar to the one Baz Luhrmann presents in ""Strictly Ballroom"", with a lot of wacky characters and odd places. The town which Muriel grew up in and eventually deserts is called ""Porpoise Spit"", and the view of the country is a very unromantic one. It is almost fitting then that the main character is desperately seeking a husband, having been ousted from her group of friends for being a loser. She runs into an old school friend and moves to Sydney with her. Both are looking for love, and Muriel eventually finds it through David Van Arkle, a South African swimmer in need of Australian citizenship to compete in the Olympics. Her love is unrequited, but she doesn't realise this as she is too focused on finally getting married.Apart from Collette, the film is made up of a lot of great characters, each of whom have some form of running joke. The line ""you're terrible, Muriel"", spoken repeatedly by her sister, is always funny, as are the constant 'surprise' appearances by Deidre Chambers, who is having an affair with Muriel's father. Bill Hunter's politician-in-trouble character allows for some fantastic scenes, and as an audience, you really enjoy hating him. There is a lot of visual humour in the film, from Muriel's own appearance, to set pieces like the ""bean bag scene"", which gets more and more absurd as it goes along. The serious side to the film occasionally feels forced, but Collette manages to pull it together with a convincing performance and a look into Muriel's mindThe movie would not be the same without the soundtrack of infectiously energetic ABBA tracks, and their constant appearances are often really funny. (They could have adapted this into a proper musical, and there would have been no need for ""Mamma Mia"" to exist). Despite being slow at times, ""Muriel's Wedding"" is great fun, and manages to keep you laughing throughout.",Muriel's Wedding
55,lottatitles,Winner,8,9 September 2002,"Having read the other comments, I can only assume those of a negative nature come from people who don't watch a lot of films or who prefer the Terminator genre. Someone called this a 'chic flick'. I've never understood what that meant...really. A movie or film is either good, you like it...or, it isn't and you don't. I find that men in this country tend to use that term more than in other countries. This is a film about feelings we've all had (maybe that's why some people can't handle it) and had to deal with anyway we can. Toni Collette, Bill Hunter, Rachel Griffiths, the entire cast are so 'dead on' with these characters...whether we like it or not. Toni, especially, is an incredible actress who lets every emotion wash across her beautiful (yes, beautiful) face, and pulls us into her world. I'm a huge fan of Australian Films and this is one of my favorites along with all of Peter Weir's. You guys should stick the macho junk in the closet for two hours and watch this with your wife, girlfriend, lover, whomever. It might scare you, however, to find you identify with a lot of the feelings. These feelings aren't just female...they're human.",Muriel's Wedding

A supposed friend's wedding and the indiscretions of the groom with the jailing of Muriel for a stolen dress.  Then she gets thrown out of her group and is reunited with another girl from high school.   The confrontation between Muriel and her ex-best friends is wonderful.  The ABBA songs on stage and in the wedding are hilarious but the whole movie gets too serious in trying to tie in Muriel's mother and a jerk of a father.  The ending is wonderful.

60,Lee-107,Very Uplifting!,10,2 August 1999,"Yes, guilty as charged - I am a huge ABBA Fan. And while that was certainly one of this movie's prime attractions, I do think 'Muriel's Wedding' is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Muriel's character is very identifiable... We all go through the same insecurities, phases of demoralization at some nor some point of our lives. Played with disarming honesty by Toni Collette, Muriel is snubbed by her so-called ""friends"" who call her an ""embarrassment"" because of her weight and because she listens to ABBA. Muriel's idea of getting back at those who snubbed her is to get a guy to marry her. This she manages quite successfully by roping in the perpetually sulking National swimmer who wants a wife merely as a tag. Muriel gets back at her ""friends"" but at the cost of nearly losing her real friendship with Rwanda(excellently portrayed by Rachel Griffiths). Her mother's suicide compounds to her sense of futility and she gracefully separates from her husband to return to Sydney and get her life back together, caring for Rwanda, now wheel-chair ridden and making a living without all those superficial aspirations she dreamt of and the vain people whose companionship she so much wanted. This is a great romantic comedy with the kind of emotional honesty not often in movies of the genre. It deals with issues of self-esteem and the universal need for love and friendship and yes, it has great music! But of course!",Muriel's Wedding

A dark comedy about a young woman's desire for independence and acceptance, Toni Collette is magnificent as the title character; it is no wonder this film launched Collette's amazing career. Equally brilliant is Rachel Griffiths, who plays Collette's friend and supporter, as Griffiths' performance is excellent. Supporting cast members Bill Hunter, Jeanie Drynan, Dan Wyllie, and Gabby Millgate are fantastic as members of Collette's immediate and dysfunctional family.

The noise was coming from a favourite commercial radio station I was listening too at the time. Foolishly I thought OK I will go and watch it and shortly afterwards that was the last time I listened to this particular radio station. In short Muriels Wedding was the biggest waste of time and money I have ever suffered, well as far as films go, I did rashly back my football team at the time to win a trophy one year and unsurprisingly lost the modest bet I had made. This film is not funny, in fact for me it doesn't work on any level. The whole experience of watching this film was just embarrassing. I am perfectly aware that the people who put the money into the pot to get this film made were well intentioned and I am also sure that the film itself was made with the enthusiastic assistance of all of its professionals but the result is a turkey. By all means rent this film if you must but prepare yourself for a potential early pressing of the eject button. I genuinely cannot think of anything positive to say about this film.",Muriel's Wedding
63,manders_steve,Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths shine,7,28 October 2018,"It's quite a while since I'd seen Muriel's Wedding, and it remains to me a strangely satisfying film despite the inherent sadness of the plot and the unlovable nature of many of the characters and themes. To me, picking the jaunty Abba songs was a masterstroke, because it lightened the tone considerably, provided a backdrop that nearly everyone seeing the film would know and most would relate to positively.Toni Collette demonstrated what an amazingly versatile actor she is, and the chemistry between her and Rachel Griffiths (Rhonda) to me is what makes the film. Bill Hunter (Bill Heslop) nails the awful unlovable Aussie blokey father role, which provides a rationale for how the premise of the film arose. It provides a lot of issues to think about, from the scheming local councillor Heslop, through Muriel's high school ""friends"" to the South African Olympic swimmer who needed an Aussie bride to become an Australian citizen and be able to leave South Africa.It put director PJ Hogan on the map, was a box office and critical success, as well as establishing Toni Collette.

64,benjaminwg,"The protagonist is kind of reprehensible, even though the performances are good and it was mostly an interesting, fun journey",7,18 March 2021,"I laughed a lot in this. Never seen it before. Was pleasantly surprised. Very sweet. I can see the appeal, but by the last act I found myself wondering why I was rooting for this pretty fat girl. What had she done to deserve me hoping things turn out alright for her? Other than sticking by the sick girl, which in a way was at least as self-serving as it was empathetic, I don't recall her ever doing anything truly laudable or deservedly-endearing. She can't simply be appealing and sympathetic because she's pretty, fat, made fun of, or experiences joy and anguish. And the fact she's kind of stupid like Homer Simpson, quirky, different, and likes ABBA can't simply be enough reason, either. Yes, I realize she's motivated to some extent by upbringing and being brainwashed by mainstream media and fairy tail books as a small child. By the last act I found I agreed with the sick girl and didn't care anymore what happened to Muriel, didn't care if she reformed, and sort of was disappointed in myself for cheering her on in this journey just because of the aforementioned reasons I pointed out. That's just not enough. And, frankly, a sudden reformation in the end is just predictable schlock and out of character for the protagonist, anyway. By the way, that break up was completely unbelievable.",Muriel's Wedding

It's a great Australian film that really shows Aussie culture and lifestyle. Toni Collette is amazing as Muriel and the ABBA songs fit so well with this film. I think Muriel's Wedding is definitely one of if not the best Aussie movie of all time! My favorite scene is the ABBA karaoke at Hibiscus Island that Muriel and Rhonda perform. Also the scenes where Muriel tries on all the wedding dresses for her imaginary wedding to 'Bill'. If you want a good laugh or good Aussie comedy then i would recommend this film. There are many great Aussie actors including Bill Hunter and Rachel Griffiths.,Muriel's Wedding
66,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 4 out of 5,7,12 January 2003,"Muriel's Wedding is an Australian gem that perhaps suffers somewhat from being earmarked as a 'comedy'.  Certainly there are plenty of laughs, but this film is no mere cheap and cheesy crowd-pleaser.  As well as dealing with the insularity and cattiness of her hometown, Porpoise Spit, Muriel also must face the suicide of her mother and paralysing of her best friend. Yet, despite these tragedies, Muriel manages to come out on top, and at the same time strike a blow for anybody who has ever been snubbed by the in-crowd.
The characterisation in the movie is brilliant, particularly that of Muriel's family of no-hopers.  Hoping to shed the title of ""useless"" bestowed on her by her father, Muriel (Toni Collette) absconds with the family's savings to an island resort, where she meets vivacious, straight-talking Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths).  Rhonda is the catalyst for Muriel to become a new person, but unfortunately Muriel takes her obsession with weddings one step too far and marries just for the sake of it.  She thinks she has finally ""made it"", but comes to realise that there's more to life than public image.
The soundtrack is a gloriously appropriate ABBA symphony, although both Dancing Queen and the film's original theme tune are over-utilised.  It is surely partly due to ABBA's pleasant familiarity that it is so easy to become emotionally involved in the film, and the viewer will likely experience the whole gamut of feelings during its course.  The finale, whilst upbeat, fortunately doesn't stumble into the realm of saccharine moralism (which so many filmmakers seem to think it is necessary to conclude with).  Instead, we feel the triumph along with Muriel and Rhonda as they bid a raucous farewell to Porpoise Spit.",Muriel's Wedding

I love Australian movies and this is one of the best! Nothing wimpy about this magnificent coming of age movie that also happens to be an anti-Cinderella story. It's  one of our favorite `mommie-and-me' movies...movies my teen daughter and I delight in watching together. There is something so magical about `Muriel's Wedding.' We have watched it many times and still love it.It difficult to express exactly what's so special about this story...it's not just terrific acting by Toni Collette, Rachel Griffiths, and Jeanie Drynan. These are award worthy performances by women who make you think their characters are so real they could be someone you actually know...maybe even yourself!  It's not just because it's soulful and laugh out loud funny at the same time. Nor is it the brilliant  throw back to ABBA music that help to make the lonely life of a girl who grows up in a dysfunctional family in coastal Australia even more poignant as she takes refuge in the romantic lyrics. It's also a gripping slap in the face to back stabbing teenage girls and a wildly right on jolting look at evil in corrupt local politics. This movie is not feel good plastic Hollywood  fare but hard fought self examination and the young Muriel ends up believing in herself and we cheer for her all the way! Perhaps, the reason I like it so much is that  her self appreciation is not dependent upon friends, family, or a husband...it's purely Murial taking charge of her own life.",Muriel's Wedding

Colette was already a star in Australia, though unheard of elsewhere, but both of these amazing actresses demonstrate in this film the qualities that have shown them to be among the most accomplished and versatile actresses in film and television today.One more thing, I caught Toni Colette doing a star turn in the Broadway musical ""The Wild Party."" This woman is a great musical performer. I would be willing to bet her band is terrific.",Muriel's Wedding

Including the suicide of a mother figure who has such a terrible time she ends it, these said scenes are actually the most harrowing scenes I've ever seen in a film.Rachel Griffith and Toni Colette are both great in the film. All the performances are great, working off the very good script as best they can.A great film.",Muriel's Wedding
70,eeq,Excruciatingly painful and depressing-my wife hated it too!,1,24 January 2002,"Agree mostly with IMDB reviews by MovieAlien and 'wmuti'.  The Mrs. and I saw this as a preview before public release and both HATED it.  Basically some ditzy and vacuous fatty steals her parents life savings to go on a cruise and find a man.  Virtually no comedic elements and plenty of tragedy--totally depressing.  While the acting was OK and background ABBA tunes distracted one from the depressing script, I'm still puzzled why anyone should like this movie.  Maybe it's a 'chick-flick' showing how Muriel triumphs, but my wife--who generally likes 'chick-flicks' hated this too.  One of the very worst movies I have ever seen.  I'd rated this a 1 out of 10.  If you want to see an entertaining and FUNNY Australian movie, try ""Strictly Ballroom"" which I highly recommend.",Muriel's Wedding
71,yorktown_hawk,Hasn't aged well.,7,4 February 2021,"I used to enjoy this in my younger days, but now I'm sitting there watching it thinking how cliche and stereotyped the roles are.It's not really a comedy movie as there aren't many laugh out loud moments, however it's enjoyable in its tackiness and nostalgia.Special shoutout to Rachel Griffiths who was excellent in her role. While the other roles had that cliche, over-the-top tackiness to them, Rachel's performance defied that and was relatable.",Muriel's Wedding
72,Isau,Suprisingly good movie,9,11 February 1999,"I found this movie to be very good.  Unlike many other movies of this type, our heroine in this flick isn't all good and sweet and pretty.. in fact, she's not even really likable, and that's what made her interesting.  The funny thing about this movie is the way so much seems to go on in the background while the characters remain fake and cardboard.  Airheads, politicians, mistresses, white trash families, and mothers all seem flat and lifeless, the events carrying them rather than they the events.  In most movies that would turn me away, but in this one, the whole point seems to be in the flat interactions between these deflated characters who we aren't supposed to feel sympathy for, but instead feel alienated from and possibly laugh at.  I suspect women in general would like this movie more than boys. Gave it a 9.",Muriel's Wedding
73,MeMyselfOnline,"Fantastic, funny, feel good film.",7,11 October 1999,"When I first watched this movie, I loved it...Having watched it countless times since, that hasn't changed.  The heartwarming story of this modern day 'Ugly Ducking' tale has yet to lose its charm with me.My only complaint or gripe?  That after all the c**p that Muriel (that's MARIEL!!) takes, you wish she would give back as good as she gets come the end.  She doesn't quite kick a** like you may like, but then, I guess that would be out of character for her.Eitherway, if you like movies that can make you laugh, make you cry, and make you think, before making you laugh all over again, this is the one for you.Fantastic.",Muriel's Wedding

Toni Collete really embodies Muriel in this movie.I'm bedazzled that she didn't get nominated for an Oscar. This movie is just amazing! I highly recommend you watch this movie. Trust me, you'll love it. You'll laugh,you'll cry. I also love Muriel's mother Betty, she is played by Jeanie Drynan. Her performance was Spectacular.Rachel Griffiths also played very well as confident Rhonda. Bill Hunter plays very well as a bully in this movie. If some of you out there easily cry in a movie. I guarantee if you watch this movie, you'll cry. This movie is a roller coaster experience. You laugh then you cry.Overall I loved this movie. Very Enjoyable 10/10.",Muriel's Wedding
75,superguapo2000,Outback fatback,2,20 April 2009,"For those who, like me, have a clinical aversion to ABBA and can't grasp the allure of the Wedding Fetish, there's too many alienating elements in Muriel's Wedding to allow an honest appraisal. I'm willing to partially accept the obsession with weddings (and it's always weddings but never marriage, isn't it?), but ABBA is where open-mindedness ends and sheer repulsion begins. It doesn't help that the main character is also repulsive, and I don't mean physically. Would have been nice if Mad Max showed up and killed off a couple of characters, including the protagonist.In summary: Dancing Queen should never be played in movies, not even in nightmare scenes.",Muriel's Wedding

It's sad to me that this movie is so underappreciated; however, I guess at the same time I am glad it's not a ""mainstream"" movie.  It's appeal is limited to those who enjoy cleverness over gross-out humor, intelligent dialogue over bad language and bad one-liners, and in general, people who love brilliant cinema rather than Hollywood fluff.  If you haven't seen it, don't expect ""Something About Mary"" or the likes.  It is a WONDERFUL, truly brilliant movie that is as sad as it is clever.  A DEFINITE 10 of 10!!",Muriel's Wedding

It's just that kind of a film; one that by the title I would never have watched, but being an insomniac, I happened to be up and started it about 15 minutes into it. Toni Collete is beautiful, captivating, and if she's half as sweet as ""Muriel"", she must be a marvelous person, This movie is almost a throwback to a bygone day when you have a ""Josephine six-pack"" heroine who leaves her hometown to go to the big city, but comes back down to earth when her friends really need her. It's a first rate film, and I was glad to see on IMBD that she won Australia's ""Academy"" award for her performance; it is so richly deserved! See this film-It's a winner all around",Muriel's Wedding
78,Bob-562,"Quirky, Uneven Film with Outstanding Lead Performances",9,23 September 2004,"The film has a biting satiric edge to it & offers a refreshingly unsentimental, non-judgmental portrait of a young woman deemed a loser by both ""friends"" and family. Toni Collette is magnificent as Muriel, capturing the character's wide range of emotions, from the oblivious to the gushingly enthusiastic. Collette is solidly paired with Rachel Griffith; the two come across as long-time buddies. The open-faced surrealistic sarcasm of the film is in key places undermined by melodramatic tragedies (reminding me of the turkey ""Terms of Endearment""), but at least these solemn moments are treated in an un-Hollywood, non-mawkish fashion. This is a fascinating, memorable film.",Muriel's Wedding
79,tizzi22,"A movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer",10,3 February 2001,"This is the simple story of a girl who like her father, despises what God has given her.  She tries to be in, but just can't it off.  But she has plans and soon is given the means to realize them. This movie is my absolute favorite.  It turned me onto ABBA, but aside from that it does so much more.  The faces and emotions tell the story so well that even without sound you can get a lot of the story. *******SPOILER ALERT*******You will cry for her mother who must take a bus and taxi to be at her wedding when her face falls from her pride and happiness for her daughter to a heartbreaking sad, but blank look which she holds until the end.  This is probably the most endearing moment I have ever seen in a movie and perhaps even real life.  I cry every time I see it.  Especially when you how her mother continues her life with this deep disappointment.  And pay attention to Deidre's being called Mrs. Heslop.  *******END OF SPOILER******
Another part to watch for is change in her face the two times she listens to Dancing Queen.  I think these two scenes are crucial to understanding the movie and Muriel/Mariel. This entire movie is a deep look into not a Cinderella story as shallowly mentioned below, but rather a girl who searches for her niche in life through the eyes of her peers, losing her family and friends in the process, and finds out she has so much more insight for her own life the hard way.  I love the ending because it gives so much hope that Muriel is truly happy with herself but has more to do.",Muriel's Wedding

Toni Collette does a fantastic job as the confused and directionless Muriel/Mariel.  My only complaint was that Brice was out of the picture too fast.  For pure comedy, advance to the ""sex"" scene between these two characters - could it get any better?",Muriel's Wedding

85,angel-youles,A film about a woman with a dream...,9,22 August 2017,"And that dream is to get married, well she does not really want to get married. However, she wants to have a wedding and wear a gorgeous white dress! What woman doesn't? But there's a deeper meaning behind her desire to wed. 22 year old Muriel who leaves in Porpoise Spit in Australia, she is lost in the world after high school, she does not know her place or has any real goals. She spends her time listening to 70s Abba music and dreaming of the one goal she does have... her wedding day... but she's never been in love however desperately wants love from those around her.Muriel and her sister are told to be worthless by their father, a councilor in Porpoise Spit, who wants to see them achieve greater things for themselves. However, he doesn't know the weight of those words, especially the effect it has on Muriel's self esteem. She is shy natured and thinks poorly of herself. You can see this come out later in the film when she changes her name to ""Mariel"" and says ""she never wants to be Muriel again."" because she thinks she's a loser.Muriel is also rejected from being part of a group of popular girls that went to her high school, she is called ""embarrassing and fat."" and she tells them that she'll try to be like them, but they reject her suggesting that she'll never change and regardless will still be who she is... and this is the underlying theme to the movie.Muriel wants acceptance and love from everybody however does not love and accept herself, until she meets Nicole on a holiday in which paid for by stealing money from her parents. Nicole is a friend she has always desired, who accepts and loves her for who she is and also enjoys Abba! Her confidence boosts after her Holiday. To avoid the consequence of stealing money she moves in with Nicole and her parents assume her missing and want her to come home.Nicole sadly becomes ill and needs Muriel's assistance all the time. Which Muriel does for her however here is still a part of Muriel that is lost and unfulfilled and she believes this will be solved through having a wedding of her own. She abandons her friend and searches through the ads for men who want to find women to marry.She meets a man who only wants to marry to keep up his reputation, he is quite stuck up and even mean to Muriel, but it doesn't bother her because it is about her fulfilling her dream and not love.On her wedding day, she walks down the isle with a beautiful and elegant wedding dress with the biggest grin on her face, however the camera pans across the people at her wedding, who do not seem happy for her at all, their faces are bitter or of people who do not care, except for the popular girls, who now want her back as a friend.Soon after she's married, she realizes that she has been denying herself that truth and she cannot go on living a lie. So she leaves her husband. Muriel realizes that no one was happy for her because her happiness does not depend on others, she does not need people to love and accept her but she needs to do so for herself and this is a really beautiful character change, the film ends with Muriel apologizing to Nicole and happy as just herself and where she is in life and its heart warming! and it's great underlying message in which this film has.Toni Collette is a brilliant actress, I'm convinced even more so after watching this film. Her performance the way she delivers Muriel's expressions and nature makes the character seem like a very real person! You can tell she really put her heart and soul into this performance and that's what makes a great actor.I would very much recommend this to anyone who loves movies.",Muriel's Wedding

Poorly acted, horrible music  really, it's Abba, is there a band that is more painful to listen to, outside of Air Supply that is  and a story no one could care about make the Lonely Lady seem like Shakespeare. Steve Irwin looks like Olivier compared to the actors in this movie. The writing of Ed Wood seems inspired compared to the trite trash of this screenplay. I actually can't come up with enough bad things to say about it. I wanted to demand my money back from the video store on the grounds that they should be renting movies made by professionals, or at least movies that appear to be professionally made. Avoid this movie at all cost. It's not even bad enough to be funny.

Hogan does have a somewhat novel idea: let's take the dumb, puerile behaviour that inhabits the typical high school and apply it across the board to suburban society - from corrupt local politician and suffering doormat wife to win-at-all-costs Olympic hopeful. The result is about what you would expect - a ragtag bunch of obnoxious losers go through the motions of an inane plot, with broad attempts at humour that usually just end up being squirmy. Think Jerry Springer with his daily quota of trashy dopes who don't care an iota about their self-humiliation, cause heh, ""I'm on TV"", and you get the idea. As for the ABBA soundtrack, after the first couple of songs the joke has completely warn off, and it gets progressively more irritating as the movie meanders to a trite and predictable ending.",Muriel's Wedding

Muriel lives with her family: her father, a future councilman, but put in the corruption, her mother, put in her own world and her four vague siblings. She had everything, until their ""friends"" decide to take it to her out of the group because her not this in the ""level"" of certain girls. She doesn't know how to get dressed, she doesn't know how to put on makeup, and she listens music of the 70 ', in fact, it is fanatic of ABBA. For that reason their ""friends"" expel her of the group. But in a trip of vacations, Muriel finds her old friend of the high school: Rhonda, a young girl most happy and nice that Muriel. Thanks to Rhonda, Muriel changes her personality, now she dressed very well, she uses very well the make-up and she is most sociable now. But Muriel still dreams of finding that man of her life. But one day, she reads those magazines of where one search to know people, and she finds him.... for to know what will happen you must watch the movie.""Muriel's Wedding"" is an amusing, fascinating and wonderful movie, with an excellent script, with excellent actors, mainly Toni Collette like Muriel, and Rachel Griffiths like her friend Rhonda, and an excellent soundtrack composed in their majority by music of ABBA, like ""Waterloo"" and ""Fernando"", among other. There are very funny scenes, mainly when Muriel's sister always tells her: ""You're terrible Muriel"" One of the best australian movies and one of the best movies seen in the 90 '.

93,Wardman3,Great movie as the Aussies can only do!,9,18 December 2004,"A dark comedy it is but it really touches the heart and it can be quite sad at times. There are many levels that you can watch this movie on and many do say there is a superficialness to it. However, there are core human elements that clearly ring through in this movie. Friendship, compassion, empathy. Toni Colette and Rachel Griffths both make this movie stellar. It is heartbreaking at times to watch Muriel (Collette) wanting to be someone of value. Her feelings are so true to her heart and I am sure many can relate. Griffith's character is portrayed with such humor and honesty. She also has some of the funniest lines I have heard in a movie in a long time.Please watch this! It does offer meaning and you certainly can't go wrong with the music of ABBA!",Muriel's Wedding

Muriel's Wedding is so funny, yet poignant and true to life. Toni Collette was excellent in this film (and this was the first of many great film performances I have seen her in). I can so identify with Muriel and Mariel. Well... my family was not dysfunctional like that at all, but rather her self-image and fantasy life, the mean and shallow clique at school, the love of ABBA music (!), and I even had a friend like the Rachel Griffiths character. Overall a delightful and refreshingly different movie. Highly recommended.",Muriel's Wedding

It has drama, comedy and even some tragedy.  Like life, this movie is complex and deeper than just a dateless-girl-gets-married kind of crud we could expect from the American movie industry.  I hesitate to reveal too much of the movie because although it isn't a thriller, you must go into the movie fresh. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh, but wants a comedy with more depth than the average American romantic comedy.

You will laugh, cry, think, and even feel inspired.  It is a version of an ugly ducking story about a young lady (Muriel) in Australia who lacks self confidence, has hardly any friends, and suffers from a hapless & quirky family life.  She spends her time listening to ABBA (yes, ABBA) tunes and fantasizing about getting married, which she believes will turn her life around and end all of her woes.  She then embarks on a journey of self-discovery that results in an affirming lesson--that the ""real meaning"" in life is often found in the most unlikely of places.  Toni Collette is priceless as Muriel.  I truly respect actors who take chances with their performances.  Toni did.  Rachel Griffiths as Muriel's best friend and the rest of the cast are wonderful as well.  This is another one of my rainy day favorites--the perfect movie to watch to help you feel more inspired.

I only ended up watching it in the first place because some friends were quoting it and I was intrigued! This film is usually billed as a romantic comedy, but it also has it's sad and serious moments. It is one of those films that can have you crying one minute, and laughing the next.  The characters are all important, all have their own personality and are well acted out, even the fringe characters such as Joanie or Brice. The music is the most enjoyable aspects of the film. There are a few Abba songs, which are used to create the mood of the scenes, even before anything happens. All in all, a great film.

In fact, I found it, in general, to be quite sad. The central character Muriel loses almost everything in her quest to become cool and gain social acceptance, and her mother is a truly pathetic figure, the archetypal wife who has given all and lost herself in doing so, but is neither appreciated nor valued.
I felt that, even though it was set in Australia and made use of some of that society's particular foibles to tell its story, this movie was overall a cynical exposure of the shallowness of much of western society. It was a movie which was both skilfully made and (I suspect) successfully conveyed the message it intended, but I didn't find it enjoyable and I wouldn't choose to watch it again.",Muriel's Wedding

Vitriolic airhead marries philandering stud, ugly depressed white trash offspring obsesses on joining the In crowd, marriage is the only way out (for both her & the swimmer). Were there any cliches they left out?  And the plot - a generous use of the word - the plot was like something out of a 4th grader's  book of MadLibs.

All the performances are wonderful, especially Toni Collette who without a doubt should have been nominated for an Oscar.  Don't believe anyone who tells you this is a romantic comedy. It is actually a very warped tale of unlikable characters only interested in themselves manipulating, lying and scheming to each other to see who'll come out on top. In the end, one decides to reform and another loses the fight and decides to do the only action she can think of. Basically, it is funny a lot of the time, but with a very depressive underlying moral that undercuts everything. Those who like to observe films will appreciate the message and relate to it more. Those expecting a nice palatable bit of fluff like ""My Best Friends Wedding"" should keep away.",Muriel's Wedding

Muriel's wedding is a masterpiece of writing and acting. How many of us identified with Muriel's quest to be someone else and how many of us identified with the pack mentality of the ""friends"" Muriel aspired to be? You're either one or the other. It's a thought provoking and honest look at the frail human need to be accepted and even adored. Toni Collettes performance is outstanding, as someone pointed out she wasn't acting Muriel, she WAS Muriel. One of the best portrayals ever on celluloid. The crunch in Muriel's life comes as she attends the funeral for her mother and the eulogy refers to the high point of her mum's life as being Muriel's wedding......(she hadn't even spoken to her mother that day).

Is it about sexual escapades? Is it about corruption? Is it about finding your true self? Is it about a lonely fat woman with no self-esteem who believes she will be a better person if she marries? I guess it has to do with the last statement; however, it goes out on a tangent way too many times. The moment the focus is on the story, it manages to sway away again. One thing is certain: the acting was great. It's not a total waste of time, I sat through it till the end, but I would not see this one again or recommend it to my friends.",Muriel's Wedding
108,jockreby2000,Great movie.,10,23 September 2002,"It's been very interesting reading the comments of other people from throughout the world on this movie.  It's hard to know if the humour will translate across the globe, because even within the English-speaking world there are huge cultural differences.  To an Australian (i.e. myself), this movie is wonderful.The thing about ""Muriel's Wedding"" is that it's absolutely spot-on in its portrayal of so many features of Australian life.  You have the corrupt local councillor taking kickbacks from developers, the lonely guy working in the video shop, the vicious gang of clubbing young women making hell for anyone who doesn't fit in, the wannabe's losing their dignity trying _to_ fit in, etc. etc. etc.  If you want to know what life is truly like living in coastal Australian towns, this is it.  (Not that this is a bad thing, necessarily, it's just that this is how it is.)What makes this movie great, apart from its accuracy of portrayal, is that fact that it is so multi-layered.  There are moments of supreme hilarity, pathos, triumph and sadness, and they work so well within the total package. As another reviewer pointed out, the moment when you see Mrs. Heslop at the church is truly heart-wrenching.Highly recommended - one of the best Australian movies ever.",Muriel's Wedding
109,illusoryjane,A charming reprieve from American cinema,6,27 July 2004,"I haven't seen many Australian films, but I have always been struck by their proclivity to grotesque characterization. This film was no exception. From her careless and unfeeling father to her deliciously shallow and beautiful, popular friends, Muriel is surrounded by the ugliest of humanity. Even our heroine has elements of the grotesque about her until her eventual awakening late in the film. Muriel's friend Rhonda is the only character who lacks the touches of grotesquely, and it's no mistake that she is the character to whom Muriel learns that she can turn.Muriel's wedding tells the story of a girl who was brought up to believe in her worthlessness. She wants nothing more than to be married to prove herself a success at life and get away from the life she's known. In the midst of all her bad decisions (and in the light of one of the most moving tragedies I've seen in a comedy or drama in a great while), Muriel comes to realize that she is going about success all wrong. This film is wonderful and charming, a true comedy, but without the saccharin Halmark ending and obligatory romance so prominent in American movies. This is the story of a real hopeless case, who realizes she's not hopeless and has had everything she needed all along.",Muriel's Wedding
110,stardetective88,One of my all-time favorite movies!!!,10,3 July 2004,"I cannot even begin to fathom why this movies did not become a comedy classic of the '90's. It's hilarious, has great music, and has a good message behind it. This movie revolves around mixed up Muriel and her best friend Rhonda as they move to Sydney. Muriel's biggest goal in life is to get married, so she desperately answers an ad looking for someone to marry a South African swimmer who needs a green card. This movie is the epitome of something great!!!!!Toni Colette does an absolutely superb job playing Muriel. This is the role that made Toni Colette one of my favorite actresses. This movie is a 10/10. I wish they still made fun movies like this!",Muriel's Wedding

112,wizel10,Still an excellent film,7,4 May 2002,"I saw this film again after several years. Still believe is drama, a dark inner film. I never considered as a comedy. Characters are very well put on scene, that even a man can identify himself with some of the performances. Music also makes the point. ABBA is so out of fashion today, that's close to a classic.",Muriel's Wedding
113,nitro2038,A favourite,9,14 August 2009,"Reading through the negative reviews here makes me disappointed that some people just don't understand what this film is about. I think that many people have unfortunately been so brainwashed by the Hollywood style of comedy, that they cannot understand that humour can permeate every aspect of life - including tragedy. For example, when Muriel's bitch friends tell her they don't want her to be in their group anymore, Muriel cries. This would seem to be quite sad and it is, but it is funny at the same time, because Muriel's crying is so gratingly over-the-top (also, the bitch friends facial reactions are hilarious). Another example is when Muriel's family is having dinner at the Chinese restaurant (or RSL or whatever) and Diedre Chambers arrives. You feel sympathy for Muriel's poor mother, as we know that deep down she knows that Diedre is her husband's mistress and it no doubt makes her feel even more useless and unwanted. However, the way the father turns the arrival of Diedre into a 'coincidence' is funny. The classic line for me is the sister and her 'you're terrible Muriel!'. This film is a cleverly constructed comedy with a very real-life feel to it and with some seriously deep messages about society today. If you want totally unrealistic light entertainment (Hollywood-style) see 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' or something.",Muriel's Wedding
114,saffrin,Excellent movie!,10,5 June 1999,"Muriel's Wedding has to be one of the best films I have ever seen.  I have felt like Muriel my whole life and it made me feel so much better to see someone who can get out of that rut.  It helps that the movie combines comedy and drama in an even balance to have you laughing and crying in the same scene.  If anything, you have to see this movie for the zipper scene. :)",Muriel's Wedding

The real beauty of the film is not the fact that she(Muriel) wants to be a success ,but how she is able to realize what a great person she really is as she continues her quest.  The soundtrack really enriches this movie, even if you're not a big ABBA fan, you'll enjoy it's charms.",Muriel's Wedding
118,ATOBrian,So Much...Better...Than Advertised!,10,20 May 2003,"You gotta love the Hollywood marketing hacks.  ""Outrageously funny...you'll stand up and.....cheer!""  Did they even watch the movie? Or was this a cynical ploy to try to make ""Muriel's Wedding"" into a more commercially viable film?Either way, the marketing for this great little movie deserves an award for Most Misleading. In misrepresenting ""Muriel,"" they reduced it to a fun ""chick flick"" in the minds of people who hadn't yet seen it. It's so much better than that.A few years back, my then-girlfriend begged for this on one of our trips to Blockbuster, so I gave in, resigned to a night of gritting my teeth through a silly, formula-written, semi-feminist movie about a couple girls who have fun while getting even with their boyfriends or finally landing the big job or whatever the ending was gonna be.Well, I was FLOORED by what ""Muriel's Wedding"" was, as well as what it wasn't.The film is profoundly psychological and satirical. The person who sees Muriel, powerfully played by Toni Collette, and cannot empathize with her is a heartless, brainless schmuck indeed. Collette's performance and writer/director PJ Hogan's screenplay take Muriel through pretty much the whole range of emotion. Much of this emotion is negative, and it's really painful (but beautiful) to watch at several points. To watch Muriel's harrowing journey toward self-acceptance is to relive painful moments in your past, whether you are a man or a woman.""Muriel"" is also FULL of satire. It has a lot to say about marriage and family life, and little of it is good, although I believe it leaves plenty of room for redemption for Muriel and her abusive father (well-played by Bill Hunter).""Muriel's Wedding"" isn't a perfect movie, though it's pretty damned close. The scenes of Rhonda's and Muriel's life in Sydney, in particular, seem rather episodic, without strong threads to bind them. But this is almost quibbling with a great, great film.That's the way ""Muriel's Wedding"" is. It affords you no escape, if that's what you are looking for. I think that's why most people are so p***ed off about it. They want to be entertained, not depressed by a film that has to do with real life. Well, I can't be too hard on these folks. It's really the marketing department's fault for their false advertising.But if you want to see a very powerful film and are willing be really touched by a it, then see ""Muriel's Wedding.""",Muriel's Wedding

When it came out on video, I remember liking it so I decided to re-watch. That's when it call started to fall into place.

120,susan-269,Complex movie,6,15 November 2007,"From the pictures and descriptions, I was expecting a light, feel-good romantic comedy. ""Muriel's Wedding"" is most definitely not that. It has some romance. It has some comedy, mostly dark. It also has characters who are very cruel to each other, situations that are gut-wrenchingly tragic, and a main character who is dishonest and pathetic as often as she is noble. That being said, the movie does have texture and unpredictability. It's original and mostly believable, unlike most feel-good romantic comedies. But it is not cinematic wedding cake. In fact, it's more like fruit cake, with some sweetness, some unexpected bitter bits, more than a few nuts. I came away with the same impression I get from fruitcake, appreciating the complexity, but not really having enjoyed the experience.",Muriel's Wedding

124,Jax-29,Classic Australian Quirky Film,8,11 June 1999,Muriel's Wedding revolves around Muriel's (who has never even had a boyfriend)desire to get married and her obsession with ABBA.

With a decidedly Oz Abba tie-in (you didn't know Australia made Abba the worldwide group did you?), love gained and lost, and found again, with a Down Under poke (more of a jab!), be prepared to laugh.

The only actor who was half way believable was the South African swimmer when he saw who he was going to marry because I would have been horrified at the prospects of marrying someone as socially unconscious as Muriel/Mariel.

I make sure all of my friends have watched it and every time they tell me how much they loved it. While it could be called a chick flick, it really could just be for anyone who has ever felt down and out. The acting is excellent, very genuine and real. The story is inspiring and there is a particularly hilarious scene where Karma is definitely payed back! All in all, this film is one of the best you will ever find.

128,leij_luth,"Funny, with an underlying sense of sadness.",7,23 June 2002,"Muriel's wedding is a solid work of Australian comedy, with great acting and a funny script, however I also found it a touch sad.The film kept taking emotional turns, from hilarious to depressing. The main character, Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), was funny in a very human way. She shows the audience a quirky, yet believable example of human fallibility, as the girl who never quite meets the standard. Muriel's character is defined by her inability to fit in - despite many attempts. She has a dysfunctional family and weird obsessions with Swedish pop group ABBA, and getting married.All the characters play emotional roles, and the acting performance by Collette and Rachel Griffiths (as Muriels best friend), are inspirational.I laughed a lot, but came away with a general sense of sadness about the emotional cruelty of human beings, and the suffering some people endure. I found the character of Muriel's mother particularly sad, but well acted.Many people I've talked to hated this film, but it remains one of my favourite comedies. As someone who really enjoys Aussie films, I think this was one of the better ones.",Muriel's Wedding
129,adsinoz,Hitting a nerve,8,8 March 2015,"This is truly a great Australian film, and still holds up after all these years. The film has always hit a nerve with me in terms of the Heslop's family dynamics (Mum, make Dad a cup of tea!). I can only speak for myself but I grew up in Queensland around the same time (I am aware this was made in New South Wales) and my experience with my family definitely resonates with that of Muriel's with her family. I really thought at the time this came out that this type of family dysfunction was 'an Aussie thing', but I know better than that now that I am older and wiser. I've never thought of this as a comedy although it has some very funny moments. Even now, I have to be in the mood for Muriel's Wedding due to it's brutally harsh treatment of it's characters. The film is vicious and unrelenting and has made me cry more than once. But it's also a cathartic experience, about a person with flaws like all of us, who is trying to find her own identity, and, despite what she has been conditioned to believe, that she is worthy.",Muriel's Wedding

The phrases not only give you a laugh but lets you see that looks can be decieving and that a person should not be judged on their apperances or even what type of music they like. ""We're made!"" phrase that Muriel excitingly says, enhances you water works with a tear of laughter and also a tear of emotional exhurts.The cast, works extremely well to portray every character and they do this very well.

I've seen this movie 10 times now and every time I see something new. Favourite scenes: ""Why, that's Deirdre Chambers, what a coincidence"".

Also, a B Roll, picture gallery and the usual filmographies/bios.Unfortunately, the audio commentary (ft. director P.J. Hogan & lead actress Toni Collete) is a bit of a waste.

Muriel escapes to a fantasy world, culminating in dreams of marriage that she believes will help her escape the self that she loathes. It is only through tragedy that she sees the shallowness of her own deceptions, and the importance of being her genuine self.Muriel's Wedding is a wonderfully written and acted film. Some parts tend to caricature, yet this is entirely appropriate given that the people portrayed are themselves so superficial and cliché. The principal characters of the story are finely acted: we feel both their despair and effervescent joy. Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths are perfectly cast. The quality of both the script and acting is proved through our love of such a flawed protagonist.Muriel's Wedding is a great Australian movie, and a thoroughly recommended tale of self-discovery.",Muriel's Wedding

And, of course, the superficial ""friends"".

After seeing this movie, you will be. The music is so very important in the movie yet it doesn't impose on the plot or any certain scene. It's just there and it fits so well.Also important to note is the amount of weight Toni Collette put on to play Muriel. When you see her in other roles, you'll be surprised how thin she is. Also for Toni Collette fans is another Aussie movie I highly recommend - ""Cosi"". Released in 1996, it's a much more subtle performance but still highly impressive.",Muriel's Wedding

And yet, she emerges victorious and full of life. I rarely watch any movie more than once, and yet I see something new every time I watch this. Whenever I need to be cheered up, I watch the scene of Toni Colette and Rachel Griffiths lip-syncing to Waterloo.... you need to watch the whole movie to understand its meaning, but it's a riot even if you don't.

141,reedrummond,WOW---This is a MUST SEE and has landed on my top ten of all time,10,1 July 2003,"Folks, this is a winner. It has been on one of my movie channels this month and I have watched it no fewer than seven times...and it just keeps getting better. It doesn't get any better than Toni Collette. She gives me chills, goosebumps, and brings me to tears throughout the whole movie. She is unabashed in her acting and the audience really forgets they are watching a movie. Catch her in the very last scene of the movie---after she and Rhonda shout their farewells to their hometown, the camera zeroes in on Muriel...the expressions on Collette's face are beautifull intense. And Rachel Griffiths---I am now officially a fan. She is utterly believable in her role as Muriel's one true friend who has a bout with cancer and becomes paralyzed. The supporting cast is nothing short of wonderful. Jeanie Drynan brilliantly portrays Muriel's dutiful but painfully submissive/subservient mother. Sophia Lee is over-the-top hilarious and very convincing as the blond popular girl whom everyone wants to be in high school, but whose life turns out to be less than fabulous in the long run. Muriel's couch potato sibs are also chillingly realistic...I could go on and on. The cast is a jewel. And don't get me started on the ABBA soundtrack...what a genius choice of a band for Muriel to be obsessed with. I'm getting on Amazon and ordering ABBA's greatest hits. What I love about ""Muriel's Wedding"" (and what the previous reviewer did not appreciate) is that it very much resists falling into a genre. It could, I suppose, be at home in the romantic comedy category, but it's also a seriously dramatic movie, with some tragic moments. It's funny, depressing, inspiring, and bizarre at once.

How could any movie sound more irritating? But, uh-huh, it's not.What makes this movie ""unique"" is the performance of Toni Collette and the thin line between the protagonist/antagonist qualifications of the characters. You can not just like them or hate them because you can not decide where to put them in your personal moral scale. Although the story itself is pathetically sad, the film could still make the audience laugh out loud in some specific scenes.I believe this film is one of the pioneers of 90's indie movies and obviously it has given great inspiration to the newcomers of ""Ecole Sundance"".",Muriel's Wedding

I can't believe anyone thought this would make a good story. It has not a single likable character except for Muriel's best friend, Rhonda. Depressing family life, hateful, shallow friends, pitiful mother, obnoxious father, it's just awful. I was expecting a light-hearted comedy and lots of laughs. It's mostly dark and depressing with only one or two scenes that really made me laugh. I can't remember the last time I've been this disappointed in a movie. I'll give it this: The acting is good and the ABBA music is lots of fun. Just don't go into it expecting a comedy or you'll be sorely disappointed.",Muriel's Wedding

148,DogloverJCA,Great film!,10,18 August 2006,"This film has been one of my personal favorites! I honestly thought this movie was going to be some sort of ""chick flick"" by the title but to my wonderful surprise was anything but. Muriel, an outcast by both her family and friends, is someone most of us can relate to. We all go through personal struggles at some point in our lives. Dubbed useless by her unimaginable father, Bill, Muriel feels she is worthless and that there is no point to her life. Her friends feel she is not ""up to par"" and disown her because they feel she's overweight, unattractive and unpopular. Muriel feels that if she can get married she has changed, and is a new person, and she eventually marries someone she doesn't even know. In summation, Muriel finds out that the key to happiness in life comes not from trying to impress society, but derives from the self confidence and satisfaction that comes from within.",Muriel's Wedding

150,future_gameshow_host,GREAT movie with numerous life lessons,10,3 August 2006,"I HAVE to write about this movie. You do not know how amazing this movie is. Even if you're not a fan of ABBA, you should watch this movie. It teaches you about life. It teaches you the lesson of what you really want may not make you happy in the long run. It teaches you about friendships. And it teaches you about being yourself and not being ashamed. Let me talk about the last two for a little bit. I will not give away as much of the plot as I can.Near the beginning, Muriel's life sucks. I'm not going to lie. She was a loner who, when felt depressed, locked herself in her room listening to ABBA songs. And then she meets Rhonda, suddenly her world comes alive. One instance that I love is right after Rhonda has therapy for her leg tumor and doesn't feel the need to be alive. Muriel says this in response to it Rhonda's feeling useless (paraphrased): ""When I was back home in Porpoise Spit, I used to sit in my room and listen to ABBA records. Sometimes I would be in there all day, just to make my life seem any good. But since I have met you, I have not listened to one ABBA record. That's because now, my life is just as good as an ABBA song. My life is like Dancing Queen!"" This quote clearly shows how much her life had changed when she met a true friend.In one scene just after Muriel meets Rhonda, they enter a karaoke contest, singing ""Waterloo"" by ABBA. They have costumes, choreography, the works. When you watch Muriel perform, she is very small in her actions from being embarrassed. But in about half of the song, you see her to visibly relax and become more confident about being on stage. This clearly shows that she suddenly realized it was OK to be herself. Elisabeth Vincentelli, who wrote a book review of the classic album ABBA: Gold, ties this scene with the success of the group itself at the end of the book: ""It epitomizes a transition from desperately uncool to popular, but it also affirms loudly and clearly that it's okay to be a dork, a geek, a freak, a queer-you don't have to abide to commonly accepted definitions of hipness to be happy. There are worse ways to define a classic album."" Very well put! This should be a movie to apply to one's life who feels the same way as Muriel once did.This may have made it sound like a sappy movie, which it is, but it also has lots of comedy. There are some great quotes, like Rhonda's response to her tumor: ""So, how'd I get it? It's not from having too much sex, is it?"" Another reason to go rent or buy the movie!",Muriel's Wedding

152,Hollyllujah,What we are searching for can be missed in the searching.,10,8 March 2006,"Wonderful independent film with big picture talent and emotion. The cast is deep in convincing performances. The location is beautiful and the sound track is ABBAsolutly wonderful. Great film to watch alone late at night. The supporting actress has moved on to many successful roles, including a major role, done extremely well, on HBO. Recommended for guys who are not sensitive to women. This film will help in their education. I have seen the film several times, and in another year, if I catch it on cable, I would enjoy renewing myself to the people in the film. This is not a polished production, but there isn't anything bad enough to distract you from getting into the lives of the people in this story.",Muriel's Wedding
