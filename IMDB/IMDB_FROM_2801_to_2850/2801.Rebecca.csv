0,MartinHafer,Exceptional but perhaps a tad overrated,8,8 February 2007,"While I have always thought this movie was a bit overrated, it is still an exceptional film and those on IMDb who gave it scores of 1 or 2 are way out of line. Overrated it might be, but it STILL is a very good and interesting film.First, I'll complain about a few things--then discuss all the good about the film. The original story by Daphne du Maurier was a lot more risqué than the film--with a bisexual story line that is only barely hinted at in the movie. You really can't blame the film makers for this, as the Hollywood Production Code wouldn't allow this plot line to be pursued. So, instead, Rebecca was promiscuous but only with men. In addition, I am really amazed that Joan Fontaine received the Best Actress Oscar for this film. Her character often stared into space and appeared more slow-witted or annoying than just a ""fish out of water"". My daughter watched the film with me and said ""why is that lady acting so twitchy?"". In other words, she behaved in a rather strange and inexplicable manner during some of the film--particularly when she was at Mandalay. Also, I really couldn't understand why the DeWinters kept their crazy old housekeeper--after all, she tried to drive the mistress of the house to suicide. Isn't this grounds for termination of her services?!! Now, despite these complaints that definitely mar the film, there was so much to like about the movie. The script was daring and creative despite the limitations. Most times I see a movie, I say to myself that it reminds me of some other films I've seen, but in this case REBECCA is truly unique and creative. The film also had many, many twists and turns and provided one of the best endings I have seen in some time. In addition, I also liked the camera-work and music, as they created a wonderful ambiance. Despite being a black and white film, it was a beautiful picture.So my advice is to definitely see the film but just be prepared to ignore the plot holes. A hole-ridden film, to me, is still worth seeing in some cases, but somehow doesn't seem worthy of being in IMDb's top 250.",Rebecca
1,TheLittleSongbird,Chilling and dramatic- a must see for Hitchcock fans!,10,15 June 2009,"I am 17, and I love this movie. One definite positive of Rebecca is the masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, full of the usual twists and turns that make his films so pleasing. The chilling and suspenseful story, of a timid young woman marrying a man and finding herself in the shadow of his dead first wife, has many complex issues, such as the possibilities of suicide, murder and mistaken identity, all of which took me completely by surprise. Rebecca also has gorgeous black and white cinematography, and a beautifully atmospheric music score. But it's the performances from the distinguished cast that holds this film together. Laurence Olivier, one of Britain's finest stage and film actors(you only have to see him in Shakespeare to know the talent this man had), gives a towering performance as Maxim De Winter, a broken man haunted by his first wife's death. The lovely Joan Fontaine is the picture of innocence and vulnerability as the 2nd Mrs De Winter, giving a genuine sense of fright and emotion throughout. Also superb is the suave George Sanders as the rather loathsome blackmailing Favel, who smirks and makes acidic remarks as effortlessly as Clark Gable did in Gone With The wind. But stealing the acting honours is Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, a performance that is truly sinister, like the scene when she sets Manderly on fire, her facial expression looking out of the window gave me the shivers. The script was tense, dark and flawlessly delivered. Through the characters we hear that Rebecca was beautiful and possessed all the other positive virtues, so I was shocked when that wasn't to be. All in all, a chilling and dark film, that is a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",Rebecca
2,bkoganbing,On The Road To Manderley,8,17 August 2006,"I've always found it curious that of all the films Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca was the one that wound up with the Best Picture Oscar and that Hitchcock didn't receive Best Director for it. Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.Off the top of my head I would say Vertigo, North By Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Spellbound are all qualitatively better than Rebecca. Yet Rebecca does have a nice Gothic horror feel to it though there is nothing supernatural going on here.Laurence Olivier plays Maxim DeWinter, heir to the estate of Manderley who is in Monte Carlo looking to get away from the place because of the death of his first wife Rebecca. She was by all accounts a regal beauty who was the toast of society and he's in mourning for her loss. But he meets Joan Fontaine a nice, but plain sort of girl who is the paid companion of American dowager Florence Bates. Maybe because she's the opposite of Rebecca he's attracted to her. Fontaine grabs him on the spot when marriage is proposed.Fontaine has a lot of insecurities much like her character in a following Hitchcock film, Suspicion. They're not eased any by Judith Anderson the housekeeper of the big Manderley estate.Mrs. Danvers was Judith's career role. Before writing this review I remarked to someone else that I wonder what Mr. Danvers must have been like. It occurred to me later that there was no Mr. Danvers, he exists only as an excuse or a pretense so there would be no whispers about her unmarried status. She pretends to be a widow. There's more than just latent lesbianism in Judith Anderson's portrayal. She was totally in love with the late Rebecca DeWinter and I'm sure it got good and physical. She can't stand seeing anyone else in taking her place. Since it comes out that Rebecca was fooling around with her cousin George Sanders, why not a lesbian affair as well. If Rebecca were written today, Mrs. Danvers would be more openly lesbian.Rebecca was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's American films as well, though it was done here it was done by the English colony in Hollywood. Hitchcock never had budgets that Selznick gave him over in the UK. The sets depicting the grandeur of Manderley are an eye full. Than again so were the sets of Tara in Selznick's Best Picture of the previous year, Gone With the Wind.Rebecca is a good mixture of mystery, Gothic horror, and romance served up quite nicely by Alfred Hitchcock.",Rebecca
3,Leofwine_draca,Masterclass in mystery,7,15 June 2015,"REBECCA, an enthralling adaptation of the Daphne Du Maurier novel, is probably the closest that Hitchcock got in his career to making a traditional 'haunted house' film. Certainly his adaptation of the classic book is laden with Gothic dread, as a newly-wed bride moves into the ancestral home of her husband and discovers that the spirit of his dead wife is very much alive and out to bring her down.REBECCA is a highly effective non-supernatural horror/mystery flick, with expert direction (of course) and a mature approach to the storyline. It may be a little slow for modern tastes, but this gives the director the chance to let the audience experience the nuances and delightful atmosphere of the storyline.Joan Fontaine is fantastic as the new Mrs. de Winter in one of those 'being driven out of her mind' type roles. Laurence Olivier is more than effective in his ambiguous part. The supporting parts are particularly well judged, with a well-placed cameo for Leo G. Carroll, another humorous bumbling part for Nigel Bruce, and George Sanders appearing as a delightful cad. The latter part of the film, where the mystery begins to be cleared up, is particularly well-handled, leading to a gripping climax. As for Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers...well, she'll go down in the pantheon of Hitchcock villains as one of his creepiest and most ruthless!",Rebecca
4,SnoopyStyle,old-fashion Gothic suspense,7,30 December 2015,A sweet shy woman (Joan Fontaine) is staying at a Monte Carlo hotel assisting her employer pompous Edythe Van Hopper. She falls for the wealthy Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and they are quickly married. His first wife supposedly drowned. They live in his country estate Manderley with strict housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and other servants. She discovers that Rebecca still dominates Manderley.It's Alfred Hitchcock's first American effort and working under Selznick. It is beautifully shot. Joan Fontaine does well as the damsel in distress. The style is moody Gothic. It is a bit slow at times. I would like it to be more intense and less overwrought. It's an old fashion style that isn't my favorite but it is very well made.,Rebecca
5,Hitchcoc,I'm Glad He Made It,9,21 September 2001,"I pretty much ignored this film when I first saw. Having gained a great appreciation for Hitchcock and having studied his films and read widely about his work, I have come to appreciate this more than some think I should. I bought a copy of the movie, but I forced myself to read the book again (it had been about 30 years, when, out of curiosity, I read it). It is a book full of wonderful atmosphere, a bit sappy in places, but has that Gothic appeal that I love. When I got the film out, I was ready, and found myself caught up in the wonderful story. Like Jane Eyre, there is that secret that becomes a part of the decay of Manderly. It can't become alive again until things have been resolved. With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I don't think the acting is average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motive sin marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship and when it is over, it makes one feel the great loss. Like ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about. If it had been made today, it would probably have brought down the characters as well.",Rebecca
6,mark.waltz,Absolutely perfect Gothic Thriller that has many imitators but few of equal quality.,10,19 December 2011,"I recall the first time I saw this on TV almost 30 years ago on the late show, I had set my VCR to tape it, but woke up to start watching a bit of it, and stayed up all night to watch it all. That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.If you thought Olivier's Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights"" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine's bride is as far from Merle Oberon's ""wild and sweet"" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood's most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. Anderson's Mrs. Danvers is a role we've already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson's second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway's hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn't a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can't praise her highly enough. Sanders' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers ""Danny"") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful ""pip pip"" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a ""great lady"".Every moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine's first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then ""How Do You Do"" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca's old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca's, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim's attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter's.While ""Rebecca"" won Best Film at that year's Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama ""The Grapes of Wrath"" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson's Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role. There has also been a European musical version, scheduled for opening on Broadway several seasons ago, but delayed and possibly permanently tossed in the sea under Rebecca's bedroom.",Rebecca
7,claudio_carvalho,Haunted by the Past,9,18 December 2009,"In Monte Carlo, the shy and naive lady's companion (Joan Fontaine) of the snobbish Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) meets the wealthy widower aristocrat Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) in the hotel while her employer is ill. They spend many days together and they fall in love for each other. When the youth is ready to travel to New York with Mrs. Van Hopper, Maxim proposes her and they get married to each other. The now Mrs. de Winter discovers that Maxim is disturbed with the loss of his first wife Rebecca, who died when her boat sank with her alone nearby his manor Manderlay. They travel to Manderlay, where Mrs. De Winter has a cold reception from the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who worshiped Rebecca. Along the days, the humble Mrs. de Winter is frightened by the omnipresence of perfect Rebecca through the arrogant Mrs. Danvers. However, when the boat of Rebecca is found with her body trapped in the cabin, Mr. and Mrs. de Winter are haunted by the past.""Rebecca"" is probably is one of the most famous movies of Alfred Hitchcock in his earlier career, with a suspenseful romance with many surprises and twists. The performance of the fragile Joan Fontaine is amazing with her innocent expression and clumsy attitudes in an aristocratic world that does not belong to her, a simple working class young woman. Inclusive her character does not even have a name. Laurence Olivier makes a couple without chemistry with Joan Fontaine, in the role of a millionaire with a shadow from the past. The introduction, with Joan Fontaine telling her dream, misguides the viewers and I expected a different fate for the lead couple. George Sanders is the perfect scumbag and Judith Anderson performs a creepy character that might be homosexual grieving a non-corresponded love with Rebecca. The cinematography in black-and-white is very beautiful but the DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is not remastered. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquecível"" (""Rebecca, the Unforgettable Woman"")",Rebecca
8,kosmasp,Place Holder,10,10 July 2021,"Hitchcock - never won an Oscar - not in the Best Director department that is. He was nominated multiple times, but never got one. At least this movie right here won one for best movie. I know it is sometimes strange how a movie can win best movie, but the Director won't get one too.Anyway that does not change the perception most have of him: as one of the best directors that ever made movies. And he made lots of them thankfully. I finally came around watching this one - just before I went ahead and watched the ""remake"" that Netflix released last year. I put ""remake"" in quotes because the movie itself does try to establish itself as being based on the source novel.Now I have not read that, so I can't attest to all the changes that were made (although one was made for the ratings board considering the fate of Rebecca - and that was also used in the Remake). Humor was added though apparently and I would guess that the actors made their roles their own. In combination with what Hitchcock was able to get out of them.Many takes on the most simple things apparently and even a lot of looping (dubbing) of lines that he wasn't too keen of. But I've written so much and have not even touched the surface of what makes this movie great.You have a movie that is about the role of a woman - a second wife no less. A movie that seems to tell so many stories - but especially a story that concentrates on the female main character. Some have claimed that Hitchcock was a misogynist. On the other hand the extras here and some feminist claim the exact opposite. Even in his (infamous) interview with Truffaut, some might say it became clear he was more feminist than he liked to admit.And the movie right here seems to be able to capture many feelings of women. Even add some bi-sexual or lesbian love? You could read that into it - maybe it is in the book too. Again, I can't really tell.Every frame here is planned into the smallest detail. Nothing is left to chance and coincidence. There is a reason he is considered a master. The performances of the couple is amazing - Olivier may not be easy to read, but that is again on purpose.You also have the whole theme of romance and the age gap ... love, betrayal, addiction ... so many themes woven in here. And the overall presence of ... Rebecca. A presence that is felt throughout ... while never seen. And yet it is better this ... it is perfect as it is.",Rebecca
9,classicsoncall,"""I am Mrs. de Winter now.""",8,6 November 2007,"Alfred Hitchcock's first American film won him his only Best Picture Oscar, but in learning about the movie, it's almost surprising that the picture was ever made at all. After producer David Selznick shelled out fifty thousand dollars for the screen rights to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, he hired on Hitchcock to direct the movie. The team up with Selznick was immediately fraught with disagreement. Selznick didn't like Hitchcock's contribution to an early screenplay treatment, and brought in his own team, thereby making ""Rebecca"" the only picture by Hitchcock that didn't have his collaboration on the script. Hitch didn't want Joan Fontaine as the female lead, Selznick didn't want Olivier. The producer also had difficulty with Hitchcock's directorial method, thinking him too slow in his approach. The result - nothing short of brilliant! Most of my appreciation of the film lies in the performance of Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. Her early appearance is marked by the tenuous acceptance of her role as the mistress of Manderley, constantly ill at ease in the presence of such formality and elegance. Very quickly, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) becomes her nemesis out of a fierce loyalty to the unseen title character. That bears mentioning, as the first Mrs. de Winter, who is deceased, holds the viewer in an unrelenting grip throughout the story. The constant reminders of the elegant first wife of Maxim de Winter (Olivier) keep one constantly riveted on the unraveling of the Manderley mystery.Though he was top billed, I never got the impression that this was a Laurence Olivier picture. He seems to appear from time to time to remind the viewer that Manderley is part of the de Winter fortune, but it's the war of nerves between Fontaine's character and Mrs. Danvers that give the film much of it's psychological tension. The latter third of the picture that reveals the nature of Rebecca's demise provides the twist that clears Maxim of a murder charge, but it would have been even better to see Jack Favell (George Sanders) twist in the wind over his unfounded accusation.Say, I couldn't help it, but the picture's ending had me making a comparison to another film classic, ""Citizen Kane"". As the camera closed in on the the letter 'R' of the burning lingerie case in the closing scene, I kept thinking R = 'Rebecca' = 'Rosebud'. Orson Welles had a similar girth to Hitchcock too.",Rebecca

Less Known, But the One To See?",7,3 February 2011,"When a naive young woman marries a rich widower and settles in his gigantic mansion, she finds the memory of the first wife maintaining a grip on her husband and the servants.Mysteriously, this is Hitchcock's Oscar winner. Not ""North By Northwest"" or ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""Dial M for Murder""... but this, which I think the average film lover may not have even heard of. Or, at least, I had not... but maybe that just shows my lack of knowledge.I found the first half hour or so a bit slow. Others have said the film leaves you ""enthralled"" the whole time. I do not know about that. However, after it got going, I was sucked in ,and i really felt for the main character... it is hard to fill someone's shoes, especially in a relationship. And then the twist... oh my!",Rebecca
11,lee_eisenberg,Hitch comes to Hollywood,10,26 December 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie won Best Picture and Cinematography (unfortunately, he didn't take home a Best Director Oscar). ""Rebecca"" portrays widower Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and an unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) getting married. But on their honeymoon, she discovers that the memory of Max's first wife is apparently haunting him in multiple ways. And servant Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) isn't exactly what she seems.The possible common Hitchcock theme that one can see in this movie is the murderous gays: there's the possibility that Mrs. Danvers is a lesbian. I don't know whether or not Hitch was a homophobe, but one can see the theme. Either way, ""Rebecca"" remains a classic.",Rebecca
12,jboothmillard,Rebecca,9,30 June 2005,"Most people would think that Psycho would be the most financially successful at the cinema from director Sir Alfred Hitchcock (Suspicion, Rear Window, Vertigo, The Birds), but actually it was this one, based on the book by Daphne Du Maurier. Basically, on vacation in Monte Carlo, a self-conscious inexperienced young woman (Oscar nominated Joan Fontaine) meets aristocratic widower George Fortescue Maximilian ""Maxim"" de Winter (Oscar nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier). She works as a lady's companion to Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates), and the two spend a good deal of time together, leading to love and marriage. Maxim takes his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in south-western England. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Oscar nominated Judith Anderson), is domineering and cold, and is obsessed with the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter, the eponymous Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers has preserved Rebecca's former grand bedroom and continues to display various items that carry her monogram (the letter ""R""). The new Mrs. De Winter is overwhelmed and intimidated by the huge house and her newfound responsibilities. But more than anything the spiritual presence of Rebecca causes Mrs. De Winter to believe that Maxim is still in love with his first wife, which could explain his occasional outbursts of anger. It is only later, talking to others, Mrs. De Winter discovers what happened to Rebecca; she died out at sea after her vessel capsized, and her body was washed ashore a few months later. There is also the appearance of Rebecca's sleazy cousin Jack Favell (George Sanders) when Maxim is away. Wanting to please her husband, Mrs. De Winter suggests holding a costume party as he and Rebecca used to. Mrs. Danvers advises her to copy the dress worn by a young woman in one of the portraits displayed on the staircase, which she implies is one of Maxim's ancestors. But, when Mrs. De Winter comes down the staircase wearing the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca wore an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. He angrily orders her to remove the dress, and she runs upstairs in tears. Mrs. De Winter confronts Danvers about this, but Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place. Feeling helpless and disturbed, Mrs. Danvers almost persuades her to jump to her death from the second story window in Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a sunken boat has been discovered. Rebecca's body has been identified aboard the boat, and suspicions start to circulate, as Maxim identified her body previously. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that he misidentified another body as Rebecca's in order to conceal the truth. He hated Rebecca and the marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca told Maxim she intended to continue the promiscuous and perverse life she had led before they were married but pretended to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. Rebecca had an ongoing affair with her cousin Jack Favell, and one night she told Maxim that she was pregnant with Favell's child. During a heated argument, she fell, struck her head, and died. To conceal the truth, Maxim took the body out in a boat, which he then scuttled and identified another body as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. De Winter to shed her naïve ways as they both plan how to prove Maxim's innocence. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim by threatening to reveal that she had never been suicidal, which is suggested by the police. When Maxim goes to the police, they suspect him of murder. However, further investigation reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill with an incurable cancer, and may have had only weeks to live, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realises that Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her via indirect suicide so that Maxim would be ruined. Maxim is freed and returns home. But returning to Manderley, the mansion is on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. Mrs. De Winter and all the staff escape the fire, except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her. Also starring Nigel Bruce as Major Giles Lacy, Reginald Denny as Frank Crawley, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Julyan, Gladys Cooper as Beatrice Lacy, Leo G. Carroll as Dr. Baker, and Hitchcock's cameo is as a man with his back turned to the audience walking past Sanders talking to a police officer after a phone call. Fontaine is highly convincing as the constantly nervous as the working-class woman thrown fast into marriage and the high life, Olivier does very well as the husband haunted by his past, and Anderson is highly memorable as the evil housekeeper with a sinister obsession (there is a possible lesbian subtext) with the dead wife of the title. It is a film of two halves, the first about the new wife trying and failing to fit in, and the second the truth about the first wife's death being exposed, it has terrific camerawork and a splendid score that adds to the eerie atmosphere, and it is engaging, an interesting classic romantic psychological thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Franz Waxman, and Best Writing, Screenplay. Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Laurence Olivier was number 21 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 4 on The World's Greatest Actor, Mrs. Danvers was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 73 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",Rebecca
13,ccthemovieman-1,"Wonderful Visuals, But A Big Yawner Overall",4,24 May 2006,"This review won't be accepted gracefully on this website but at least I am honest in telling you this was a big disappointment to me, considering all the great reviews I read (not here) prior to seeing it. Some of that praise is simply because it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie with ""Hitch"" being a big favorite among national critics.Even though I own a good amount of classic films, this was way too slow, way too corny and old-fashioned. I should re-purchase this film and use it the next time time I have trouble getting to sleep at night.Joan Fontaine has a nice, pretty wholesome face but that's about it. Her character in this was just plain stupid and got worse as the film wore on, especially at the end. Judith Anderson, whom I read was so ""creepy"" in this, was not anywhere near as evil as built up to be. As usual, the real-life wacko, George Sanders, is the most interesting actor in the film.Having said all that, I do want to highly praise the sets and camera effort of this movie. The best part of this melodrama was the cinematography with some wonderful scenes inside ""Mandaly"" (the mansion). The cameras did a great job with the use of shadows, some of the best I've ever seen. Without the visual treats, I doubt I could have stayed with this 130-minute film.",Rebecca

15,BA_Harrison,Hitch's first hit from Hollywood.,8,13 February 2020,"Director Alfred Hitchcock is renowned for his visual acuity, creating some of the most memorable shots in movie history; he also had a keen eye for beauty, casting some of Hollywood's most stunning actresses in iconic roles: Grace Kelly in Rear Window, Maureen O'Hara in Jamaica Inn, Tippi Hedren in The Birds, Ingrid Bergman in Spellbound, and Janet Leigh in Psycho, to name but a few. Perhaps his most enchanting leading lady was Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Suspicion (1941), but who was never more appealing than in her first film for Hitch, Rebecca, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.The gorgeous Fontaine plays a meek young woman (we never discover her name, but she's not the 'Rebecca' of the title) who falls for rich aristocrat 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) while working in the South of France. Equally besotted, Maxim proposes to the self-effacing beauty, and takes her back to his ancestral home, Manderley, which he once shared with his first wife Rebecca, before she drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs. de Winter does her best to adapt to her new lifestyle, but is constantly under the shadow of her predecessor, with stern housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) being particularly disapproving of Maxim's new bride, deliberately driving a wedge between the married couple and even going so far as to try and talk Mrs. de Winter Mk. II into killing herself.Thus far, the film is pure melodrama and sappy romance, and avid Hitchcock fans might be wondering where the murder and mystery is; worry, not, for this comes in the second half of the film and provides plenty of intrigue and suspense as Maxim reveals what really happened to his first wife and is subsequently suspected of her murder. Both his wife and the viewer are aware of his innocence, but with Rebecca's lover Jack Favell (George Sanders) accusing Mr. de Winter of murder, and plenty of damning evidence, things are looking pretty bad for the poor fellow. It all wraps up nicely in the end, of course, but there are plenty of tense moments along the way, all handled in the director's typically assured manner, with bags of atmosphere and sumptuous cinematography.But as great as the direction and story are, it is the performances that really make Rebecca a winner: Olivier is perfect as the troubled toff, Anderson is wonderfully wicked as scheming housekeeper Danvers, nobody does 'bumbling oaf' quite as well as Nigel Bruce (playing Major Giles Lacy, who puts his foot in his mouth whenever he speaks), Sanders is suitably slimy as adulterous blackmailer Favell, and Fontaine... well, she is completely captivating, every smile, every tilt of her head, and every nervous glance guaranteed to win over the viewer (she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Oscars, but lost to Ginger Rogers). Hell, even the dog that played Maxim's mutt Jasper was excellent (so cute!).",Rebecca
16,moonspinner55,A sumptuous Gothic...,7,6 November 2006,"Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes a handsome romantic-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock involving a naïve young woman (Joan Fontaine) who weds a wealthy, mysterious man (Laurence Olivier) and moves into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife. Despite a stiff opening reel, ""Rebecca"" is a well-mounted psychological melodrama in the ""Jane Eyre"" vein. Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) to death--she's indeed a little grandiose--though it's still a stunning characterization: a steely-eyed villainess who ranks right up there with the most enjoyable cinema-baddies. The movie gushes and flutters over Olivier almost as much as Fontaine does; he's quite good, but this turns out to be Joan's picture. Increasingly insecure, nervous, chatty and overeager, Fontaine runs the gamut of emotions and is never less than compelling. 11 Oscar nominations with two wins: George Barnes for hsi cinematography and for Best Picture. *** from ****",Rebecca
17,blanche-2,one of the greats,10,11 June 2005,"Rebecca is one film I could watch over and over. It is definitely one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. I recently saw the DVD version for the first time, which had the screen tests and some of Selznick's memos. My favorite was the memo that said, ""Please don't say anything to Larry and Vivien"" referring to the fact that Vivien Leigh wanted the Fontaine role so that she could be with Olivier. Though her second screen test was better than her first, in my mind, I've always pictured Leigh as the actual Rebecca, were she ever shown.The casting is perfect, with Joan Fontaine as the insecure Mrs. de Winter, coldly manipulated and laughed at by Mrs. Danvers, as expertly portrayed by Judith Anderson. Jack Favell is Rebecca's sly cousin, beautifully played by George Sanders. Olivier is gorgeous as Max, mysterious and distant. He utters two of the all-time most devastating lines heard in a relationship: ""Happiness is something I know very little about. If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that."" I have one quibble with ""Rebecca,"" which is very minor. There were just a few too many shots of Rebecca's initials. But I loved seeing that R in the last shot.",Rebecca
18,Quinoa1984,"a producer/director combination that works, elegantly and to the best of abilities",10,5 June 2006,"David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best ""chick-flicks"" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the ""2nd"" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. It's also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see.",Rebecca
19,JohnHowardReid,Last Night I Dreamt I Went to Manderley Again!,10,28 August 2008,"If 1939 was Hollywood's greatest year, 1940 certainly followed it mighty close. And of all 1940's marvelous movies, Rebecca is one of the most enduringly entertaining. In fact, it has not dated in the slightest and is still one of the most suspensefully intriguing, rivetingly fascinating of all Hollywood's essays into the realm of the romantic Gothic thriller. Among many reasons for this success, I offer the following thoughts at random: (1) Daphne du Maurier is one of the most talented and articulate writers in this field and her novel has been expertly adapted; (2) despite his disclaimers, Rebecca is the sort of movie at which Hitchcock excels. It has a brooding atmosphere of mystery and horror that Hitchcock is able to play up to such an extent that it becomes more important than the plot. This is a major triumph because when boiled down, the plot is actually rather familiar, even (dare we say it?) trite. Hitchcock's creation of this richly pervading atmosphere which leads to such a complete suspension of our minds, is achieved by his masterly control of pacing, acting, composition; and his ability to influence photographer, composer and set designers to produce the right effects. Notice, for example, that Manderley is really a castle of the mind. It is too shadowy, too remote, too unreal because it is in the mind. It exists now only in the heroine's mind. ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."" As these words are visualized on the screen, we don't see a real Manderley, but a Manderley of the mind, a nightmare, a ghost. This is Hitchcock at his most accomplished. Never mind Foreign Correspondent with all its showy bags of directorial tricks. There are just as many brilliant displays of legerdemain in Rebecca, but they are thrice as effective because they are so imperceptible, so subtle; (3) Rebecca is blessed with a most gifted cast. Joan Fontaine is exactly right and never gave a finer performance. It is really a most difficult role. The heroine in these Gothic romances is frequently some colorlessly bland little mouse of incredibly limited experience. Joan takes this stereotype and works on it with such persuasion that she brings the character not only to a vivid life, but to an astounding pitch of audience sympathy and identification. Olivier also delivers an admirably judged performance, giving de Winter effective shades of moodiness. The rest of the players are equally adept, though all are rightly overshadowed by Judith Anderson, whose coldly intense housekeeper is easily her most memorable and haunting role.",Rebecca

She is at a resort as a companion to the wealthy Florence Bates. Bates is quite effective as a domineering matron who loses Fontaine to the infatuated Olivier.The two marry and go back to the estate of Manderley. She meets the entire staff and is certainly unaccustomed to having things done for her. As head of the staff, Judith Anderson etched an unforgettable eerie character-Mrs. Danvers, who was totally devoted, to Olivier's first wife, Rebecca. The unusual technique of never showing who Rebecca is, is quite effective.We soon learn that Rebecca's death is suspicious. Naturally, we have George Sanders, a cousin to Rebecca, to stir up things as well as plot with Mrs. Danvers.When finally, it appears that Olivier had killed his wife, the truth emerges that even shocks the devoted Danvers. Not able to get her way, Danvers literally turns up the heat and burns down the place in an exciting ending.Though ""Rebecca"" was voted best picture of the year, nominees Olivier, Fontaine and Anderson (in a supporting role) came up short.A clever mystery with great performances.

Most obviously, it's one of the most perfect ""Gothic"" dramas produced; making a very steady transformation from Daphne du Maurier novel to film, it gives the genre refreshing celluloid life. Mr. Hitchcock directs star Joan Fontaine (as Mrs. De Winter) to the top of her profession; her guilty, frightened performance is a model for the reluctant Gothic heroine. Mysterious Laurence Olivier (as Maxim De Winter) and the supporting cast are perfect; with sinister Judith Anderson (as Mrs. Danvers) raising her character to striking icon status. Ms. Anderson's excessive fondness for ""Rebecca"", and the understated perverseness of sexuality between Mr. Olivier and both Mrs. De Winters, gives the film a edginess not permitted at the time.

23,sunwarrior13,An Ageless And Timeless Hitchock Film,10,27 October 2012,"Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers.A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature.Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.",Rebecca
24,hitchcockthelegend,Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?,10,4 March 2008,"Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman.After meeting and marrying 'Maxim' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion?A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be.For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel. But the film has survived the ""appeasing"" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black & White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story.

25,Doylenf,"This is a Daphne duMaurier story, not a typical Hitchcock film...",8,29 December 2006,"It's silly for those who complain that Hitchcock did not put his usual stamp on this film--and then they cite VERTIGO, MARNIE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, etc., etc.--when all the time Hitchcock himself has said that this was not a typical Hitchcock film per se. He knew he had a Daphne duMaurier story to tell and he was not able to turn the whole thing into his kind of film because David O. Selznick insisted that they be as faithful as possible to the original material.And it works. REBECCA is a marvelous film, notable for the casting of the up until then rather unknown JOAN FONTAINE in the lead (which gave Selznick and Hitchcock many headaches as they tried to exact the kind of performance they wanted from her), at a time when Fontaine was regarded in Hollywood as a second-rate ""wooden"" actress who had only done a bunch of supporting roles in ""A"" films and leads in ""B"" films. She certainly proved herself up to the task.I think her performance is well nigh perfect, suggesting the timid, insecure young woman who is intimidated first, by her worldly husband, Maxim deWinter, and then by his domineering and sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (JUDITH ANDERSON). But if there is one major fault, it is that I never really felt the chemistry between Max deWinter (LAURENCE OLIVIER) and Fontaine. It's as if he has all he can do to merely smile at her--he seems to be tolerating her rather than really loving her.Maybe that's because, as good an actor as he was, he was unable to show any real affection for a woman he personally wished were not playing his wife. (It's well documented that there was no mutual admiration going on between Olivier and Fontaine), although she did respect the fact that he could do everything exactly the same in take after take. Not only did he treat her with only lukewarm consideration, but she had to contend with Hitchcock who claims he had to devise all sorts of things to keep her performance on track.Whatever, the end result is what counts and REBECCA is impeccably produced, written and scored (by Franx Waxman) with utmost respect for the DuMaurier story. Supporting roles are all capably played by a British cast including GEORGE SANDERS, NIGEL BRUCE, GLADYS COOPER, REGINALD DENNY, C. AUBREY SMITH and MELVILLE COOPER.The scene where Joan Fontaine finally stands up to Mrs. Danvers, reminding her that she is now the mistress of Manderlay, and the confession scene where she listens and reacts as Olivier explains what happened on the yacht are memorable examples of first-rate screen acting. It is for these scenes where she finally gathers some strength to help her troubled husband that Fontaine really deserves the most admiration. Her earlier scenes as the mousy heroine are just a bit overdone, in my opinion.And so, with the exception of a lack of real chemistry between the stars, I think REBECCA is another example of David O. Selznick's quest for perfectionism in translating a novel to the screen as faithfully as the production code allowed.",Rebecca

This has always been regarded as a masterpiece but I don't really like it. It's is beautifully done with top production values (Manderley alone is stunning) and won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography (also for Best Picture which I can't figure out). Fontaine was nominated for her wonderful performance and George Sanders and Gladys Cooper stand out in supporting roles. Also there's a STRONG lesbian subtext between Mrs. Danvers and the first wife. But that's about it for good things. Olivier is terrible in his role. He comes off as an obnoxious jerk--I kept wondering what Fontaine's character saw in him. He didn't want Fontaine in the movie (he wanted his wife Vivien Leigh) and it comes through loud and clear. The movie moves far too slow--things seem dragged out for no earthly reason. Also even though Fontaine was great her insecurity at the beginning got annoying quick. More than once I just wanted her to slap Mrs. Danvers silly.I've seen this multiple times and still can't figure out why it's so highly regarded.

Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former ""partner"". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic.Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.",Rebecca

Olivier and the eerily stupendous Judith Anderson provide the ultimate in sophisticated horror partnerships and make this by far my favourite Hitchcock film.

Having considered both Hitchcock and Olivier vastly overrated almost all my life I had no problem avoiding this one when it occasionally surfaced on television but recently it was given away with a newspaper and so eventually I stuck it in the DVD and tried to give it a fighting chance to justify the hype surrounding it. I've seen about 90-95% of Larry Olivier's films and found them mostly ho hum but here he hits a new low worthy of Emil Jannings or Charles Laughton at their worst. Displaying neither charisma nor charm he is nevertheless able to sweep an ultra naive Joan Fontaine off her feet and repair with her to his Gothic manse where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, is all-pervasive not least with the Gale Sondergaard-lite housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson). About half the 'English Colony' - UK actors domiciled in Hollywood - pop up in an attempt at 'local color' so trivia buffs can have a field day looking out for C.

31,Boba_Fett1138,Good but also just one of those overrated Hitchcock movies.,7,24 October 2008,"Not that this movie is horrible but it just also doesn't exactly lives up to its reputation. This is not the only Hitchcock movie with this problem and even though I absolute love most of Hitchcock's movies and he was an absolutely brilliant and a one of a kind director, he doesn't get a critical free pass from me. Needless to say this movie disappointed me even though it had plenty of redeeming qualities, which in the long run still makes this a perfectly good movie.Problem to me is the movie its story and then especially the pace its being told in. Mostly the middle part of the movie is just a complete bore. Nothing interesting or mysterious enough is happening in it. From an Hitchcock movie you would at least expect some suspense but there is actually very little of that present here. You can say that this movie is not really being enough 'Hitchcock' like. Perhaps this was because this was Hitchcock's very first Hollywood movie and he was kept more on a short leach by the studio's and the movie its producers?A redeeming quality is the movie its last halve hour or so, when your whole view of the movie its main character suddenly changes when you learn about the truth. You really don't like sympathize for the man at first but once you know what really happened this suddenly all changes for you and he becomes actually a tragic character you start to care for.The movie is also being innovative by using some real dynamic and experimental camera-work at times, as you basically always can expect from an Hitchock movie. It also makes good use of miniature and while watching this movie I couldn't help wondering if this movie didn't somewhat inspired ""Citizen Kane"". Some of the effects and camera handling seems to be the same and of course the Manderlay estate can also be seen as Xanadu, you don't need a lot of imagination for that.The movie tries to create a good dark and mysterious atmosphere but when there is not an awful lot happening in the movie, atmosphere is not really enough to make a movie with. It suits the movie that its being shot in black & white and all but the atmosphere is just not as good, moody and horror Gothic like as everyone tries to make you believe it is. The story just simply doesn't allow this.The movie has a typical solid '40's cast, with popular actors such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and popular supporting actors such as George Sanders, Nigel Bruce and Gladys Cooper involved. It was especially nice to see Laurence Olivier in an Hitchcock movie, two Hollywood legends working together. The acting is overall good in this movie though it tends to become a bit overly melodramatic at times.Give credit where credit is due. This is a good movie but no way a classic, or among Hitchcock's best work. Oh well, seems that just not a lot of people agree with me on this, also considering that this movie won an Oscar for best picture in 1941. It won as well for its cinematography by George Barnes and was nominated in 9 more categories.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rebecca
32,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Fantastic Hitchcock, one of his best",10,20 September 2004,"This is Hitchcock at his best; just when you think that you've figured everything out, you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around. This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old cliché of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance.

Give me ""Foreign Correspondent,"" Hitchcock's other 1940 release and fellow Best Picture nominee, any day.""Rebecca"" starts out promisingly enough, as a Gothic ghost story about a naive young woman (Joan Fontaine) recently married to a wealthy aristocrat (Laurence Olivier) who finds herself competing with his dead wife, a woman whom Fontaine mentally builds into an image of female perfection until the memory of her almost becomes a physical presence in the house. But the mystery departs the film around the three-quarters mark, and the enigmatic spell of the movie goes with it. Fontaine and Olivier are two limp noodles at the film's center, and it falls to Judith Anderson, playing the mysterious and creepy housekeeper who fostered an irrational love of her former mistress, to keep things alive.The production design and black and white cinematography look stylish, but the film doesn't give Hitchcock the opportunity to impose any of his playful directorial signatures on it. As a result, it's a bit of a bore.Grade: B",Rebecca
34,AlsExGal,A film with a nameless protagonist and an invisible namesake,9,15 January 2017,"This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American-made film. Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how well Hitchcock ""got"" what American audiences wanted in their suspense films, hitting them out of the park from the moment he began working in the US. Apart from being a tad bit long, this is a well made film. I love the inside of Mandalay and Sir Laurence Olivier played a wonderful mysterious and sullen Maximillian De Winter opposite his new wife, a beautiful and naive young Joan Fontaine who is never even given a name here, probably deliberately and in keeping with how mousy and ""second hand"" she feels about herself in relation to the first and late Mrs. De Winter, who is actually Rebecca from the title.Of course there is also George Sanders, playing the type of character he is best known for--sarcastic, snobby, self-assured, pompous, witty and verbose. He hits the nail on the head as Rebecca's ""cousin"" - so he calls himself. Of course the most eerie and unsettling character was Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's housekeeper or ""maid in waiting."" Danvers takes great pains in sabotaging the second Mrs. De Winter's marital relationship with Max de Winter,--even going as far as calmly urging her to to plunge to her death into the water from Rebecca's bedroom window at Mandalay. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but I won't give them away. It's best if you watch them unfold yourself in true Hitchcockian style.I will say that Rebecca, the first wife of Max de Winter, is NEVER seen, but we learn about her by what is said about her by the various characters, even going as far as seeing the untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be. The ending is a surprise in more way than one, and yet Mrs. Danvers gets the last word in her own way. A great movie by Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick.",Rebecca

He likes that she isn't the part and is obviously sweet, but keeps calling her a stupid fool. Her reasons for liking him are non-existent, other than his wealth. She gets carried away with what others may think and it becomes awfully repetitive, but for her to be tricked by Mrs Danvers like that's stupid. I mean, I knew immediately that the portrait would of been of the late Rebecca. The characters are all unlikable, even Fontaine's innocent character to an extent, because she and everybody else's so poorly written. Mrs Van Hopper at the start, completely delusional.",Rebecca
36,AaronCapenBanner,Gothic Romance,7,12 October 2013,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this Gothic romance that stars Sir Laurence Olivier as Maxim De Winter, a recently widowed(and quite wealthy) man vacationing in Monte Carlo who meets the paid companion(played by Joan Fontaine) of a older woman. They unexpectedly fall in love and get married. They then return to his home in Cornwall, a country estate called Manderly ruled over by the imposing housekeeper Mrs. Danvers(played by Judith Anderson) who holds sacred the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter Rebecca, who died mysteriously in a boating accident. As events unfold, the new Mrs. De Winter will discover things about Maxim's past that will come to haunt her... Impressively directed and acted film is still melodramatic stuff given a high gloss, but remains entertaining and atmospheric, though hardly deserved to beat ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" for best picture of 1940!",Rebecca
37,zetes,"The very definition of ""Haunting""",10,1 June 2000,"I was quite interested in the film while I was watching it, but when it ended, I didn't feel impacted. Very soon afterwards, however, my mind began to feel very heavy. The first words of the film came floating back to me: ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again."" I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film. I still feel enshrouded in the mist and smoke that curled around Manderly. I can tell that this is going to be one of those films that, when I recall it to memory, I will fall back into its mood. I can't say this for too many films.One of the reasons that I connected with it so tightly was the main character, the narrator, the new Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine was perfect in this film. Out of the ones with whom I am familiar, I don't think that there is another Hitchcock heroine who was as well developed. Kim Novak's character Judy from Vertigo was close, and so was Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane from Psycho. Those two heroines provoked great pity in my soul. But the heroine of Rebecca beats them all.I was completely involved with her. She begins as little more than a slave to a domineering woman, Edythe van Hopper (their relationship was a little confusing to me; a hired friend? This made me suspicious. I think that there was a lot of suggestive lesbianism in this film, perhaps between van Hopper and the heroine, but definitely between Rebecca and Ms. Danvers. Watch as she delicately shows the second Mrs. de Winters Rebecca's underwear. Also notice that Rebecca used Ms. Danvers' name at the doctor's office, having gone there to find out whether or not she was pregnant). The heroine only escapes from one owner to go to her next owner, Maxim de Winters. He treats her even more cruelly than Edythe van Hopper did, calling her a ""little fool"" and an ""idiot."" When he called her those names and reprimanded her, I trembled. As the movie went on, I think my mind actually became fused with the heroine's. I started to cry when she did after Ms. Danvers tortured her psychologically. When Ms. Danvers tried to convince her to jump out of the window, I felt as if I was about to fall to my death.I became rather disappointed when the focus moves from the heroine to Maxim. His predicament became more interesting near the end, but my sympathies, my whole attention were squarely focused on Fontaine's character. Thus arose my initial impression of the film. This small disruption can be forgiven, because the film as a whole just remains in my mind as a sad, beautiful masterpiece.Rebecca is one of Hitchcock's best films. Definitely a 10/10.",Rebecca
38,christopher-underwood,I have several problems with the film,6,18 February 2008,"Having seen almost all of Mr Hitchcock's films except this one it seemed time to catch up with the one many people reckon as one of his best. Well, what can I say? It is fine. Interesting from time to time and with the prowling Danvers and developing mystery, one's interest is just about held. I have several problems with the film, not least with the two leads but I think that for me the real problem is that this is not so much Hitchcock's film as that of the all powerful and at that time all involving Mr Selznick. Given more of a free reign, I would have expected Olivier to be replaced if he could not get himself a little more involved in the proceedings and not to have had Joan Fontaine play her role so meekly (and dowdily!). Most of the action at Mandelay is good and creepy but we seem to gain little from the early scenes, supposedly showing us the couple's love blossom. I also felt that the almost comic cops at the end took away what edge the director had managed to engender. Perhaps if the whole film had been confined to the house the Hitchcock shadows and menace could have helped sustain a more sinister feel throughout. Ah well, very watchable if minor Hitchcock.",Rebecca
39,whpratt1,Classic Picture of ALL CLASSIC FILMS!,10,29 February 2004,"Have not viewed this film in many years, however, when ever I need to see a great Classic Film with great Actors and a director like Alfred Hitchcock, I can really appreciate the great films from the past and the great gift Hollywood has given.  George Sanders(Jack Favell),""The Lodger"",'44 plays a horrible blackmailer, who is very hateful and tries very hard to destroy Laurence Olivier(Maxim 'de Winter),""The Jigsaw Man"",'83, and claims that he murdered his first wife. Judith Anderson(Mrs. Danvers),""The Red House"",'47, supports Jack Favell in his efforts to break up the marriage of Maxim'de Winter and rid him of the beautiful Mansion that he lives in. Judith Anderson was a great actress and played very evil and cruel roles through out her career and was given the highest award that England could present to an actress, naming her DAME in 1959.  If you look close enough, you will see Nigel Bruce(Maj.Giles Lacy),""Sherlock Holmes & the Spider Woman"",'44,who played a great supporting role.  He was Dr. Watson in the 1940's Sherlock Holmes series.   Alfred Hitchcock made this film into a masterpiece of fine acting,with great perfection, he even produced in later years a great horror picture, ""Psycho"", which cannot compare to ""Rebecca"", but  the film brought in a great deal more MONEY!",Rebecca

41,JamesHitchcock,One of the Great Hitchcock Classics,8,15 November 2005,"It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period. ""Jamaica Inn"" was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With ""Rebecca"", however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.A number of Hitchcock's films, such as ""The 39 Steps"" or ""North by North-West"" end up with the hero and heroine falling in love, but are nevertheless essentially suspense films with an element of romance. ""Rebecca"", however, is essentially a romance with elements of suspense. Indeed, it starts out as a romantic comedy. A young woman (we never learn her name) staying on the French Riviera with her employer Mrs Van Hopper, meets and falls in love with Maxim de Winter, a handsome older widower. There is a brief comic sequence as the two lovers try to outwit the overbearing, bullying Mrs Van Hopper and escape back to England.With the shift in location to England, the mood of the film becomes darker and more serious. We learn that Maxim is the wealthy owner of Manderley, a stately home near the Cornish coast, and that he was widowed about a year earlier when his first wife Rebecca drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs de Winter finds it difficult to adapt to her new role as the mistress of such a large house, especially as she feels that everyone, including the servants and Maxim's friends, is comparing her unfavourably with the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Maxim reveals to her that his first marriage was an unhappy one as Rebecca was compulsively promiscuous and betrayed him with a number of lovers. This revelation does not, however, put her mind at rest, because evidence soon comes to light that suggests that Maxim may have killed Rebecca out of jealousy.The ""suspense"" elements of the film only occur near the end, when Maxim has to struggle to clear himself from suspicion of murder. There are no typical Hitchcock set-pieces like the crop-duster in ""North by North-West"" or the shower scene in ""Psycho"". This is, however, one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's films. Although it was shot in California, the morning mists, the pine trees by the rocky coast and the Gothic mansion are all suggestive of England. (I suspect that if Hollywood were to make the film today they would try to Americanise it, but in the forties their attitude to British literature was generally more respectful).In a way this is a ghost story, although not in the literal sense of a tale of supernatural happenings. Manderley may not be literally haunted, but it is permeated by Rebecca's spirit. The old house is solid and luxurious, but it also has an oppressive air, especially for Mrs de Winter. (Max Ophuls was to conjure up a similar atmosphere in ""Caught"", made a few years later). Rebecca does not actually appear in the film; she does not appear in the book either, but that is a first-person narrative told from the viewpoint of her successor. In the film, where the first-person perspective is largely abandoned, it would have been much easier to show her in flashback, but Hitchcock chose to resist this temptation. In my view he was right to do so. Rebecca is far more frightening as an unseen but malevolent and brooding presence than she would be if seen in the flesh.Mrs de Winter is an outsider at Manderley, partly because she is from a less privileged social background than Maxim, partly because she is the only character who never knew Rebecca personally. Maxim was probably attracted to her precisely because she was so unlike Rebecca. As she is supposed to be somewhat plain and dowdy, Joan Fontaine, one of the most attractive actresses of the period, was perhaps not physically right for the role. (Joanna David, in the 1979 TV production, seemed closer to du Maurier's conception of the character). Nevertheless, Fontaine's interpretation of the role is a very good one, making her shy and bewildered but possessed of an inner strength which enables her love for Maxim to survive.Laurence Olivier is also good as Maxim, bringing out the two sides of his character. On the one hand he is the calm, self-possessed English gentleman, on the other a man haunted by his past. The other performance which stands out is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Always dressed in black, with a severe hairstyle, moving silently through the house, Mrs Danvers initially greets the new Mrs de Winter with an icy formality, but gradually becomes her chief tormentor. Although this could not be explicitly stated in the forties, there is a strong hint that Mrs Danvers is a lesbian and that she might have been in love with Rebecca. Certainly, the scene in which she stands lasciviously pawing her late employer's underwear is highly suggestive.It certainly seemed eccentric of the Academy to give this film the ""Best Picture"" award while withholding ""Best Director"" from Hitchcock. 1940 was, however, a very strong year in the history of the cinema and, excellent film though ""Rebecca"" is, I am not sure that it is necessarily a greater one than John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" or ""The Philadelphia Story"", all of which were nominated. I suspect that the decision to give ""Best Picture"" to ""Rebecca"" and ""Best Director"" to Ford may have been a deliberate attempt to spread the honours more evenly. Nevertheless, ""Rebecca"" remains one of the great Hitchcock classics. 8/10",Rebecca

43,Rainey-Dawn,"Not As ""Haunting"" As I Remembered",6,5 February 2017,"I guess the film left me with more of a ""haunting"" story in my memory banks than it really is. I watched this one as a teen and just watch it recently and I was disappointed with the film all these years later. I think the biggest let down was when the mystery was revealed about the 1st Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca. I also do not like the way they belittled the 2nd Mrs. de Winter -- we have no idea what her first name is. Sure the focus is on the dead Rebecca but that is no reason to treat the 2nd Mrs. de Winter by not giving her a first name in the story. I guess they just wanted us to focus on the ""I'm Mrs. de Winter now!"" aspect.It is a good film to watch but not nearly as thrilling, mysterious and ""haunting"" as my memory lead me to believe (remember). Sometimes movies are best left as a good memory, but then again maybe it's better to watch them years later to find out if it's really a good film or not, a young mind can think a lot of things are good when as an adult it isn't as good.6.5/10",Rebecca
44,sddavis63,Good Job Building This By Alfred Hitchcock,7,12 September 2011,"The secret to truly appreciating this movie is to get through the first hour or so of it. To be frank, that first hour is less than riveting. We find ourselves following the romance and the early part of the marriage of the wealthy and lonely widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) to his new young bride (Joan Fontaine.) There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.Once we're through that first hour, though, plot twists start to emerge. Maxim starts to pull away from his bride - is he also having trouble accepting her as the new Mrs. de Winter at the estate? Are the differences in the marriage just too much to overcome? Then Rebecca's body is unexpectedly found and questions begin to emerge about how she died. At this point, director Alfred Hitchcock manages to turn what had been a rather empty story into a pretty good suspense/thriller. In that last hour, Hitchcock builds the story brilliantly, so that it gets progressively more suspenseful, and by the time the shocking final scene comes along, as a viewer you're absolutely hooked. It's hard for a movie to overcome such a long stretch at the beginning where little of great note actually happens, but ""Rebecca"" manages to do just that. It's also interesting as an example of a fairly early piece of work by Olivier. (7/10)",Rebecca
45,gridoon,Another good Hitchcock offering.,8,28 July 2002,"Methodical direction by Hitchcock; startling plot twists (at least for those of us who haven't read the novel); subtle chills; superb performances by Joan Fontaine (lovely), Judith Anderson (hostile even when she's being polite), George Sanders (suave and ruthless); it just gets a bit too talky in some places toward the end.      (***)",Rebecca
46,Lejink,Posh and Bec,8,15 October 2020,"""Rebecca"" was among the first books I read as an adult and I've always had a soft spot for the story with its famous first line ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again"", the lustre of which the film acknowledges by incorporating it into its spoken introduction. Coincidentally, Hitchcock's previous film, his last before crossing the Atlantic, was another adaptation of a Daphne Du Maurier novel, ""Jamaica Inn"", where it's fair to say the end result was far less satisfying.Here, with the backing of Selznick, the production values are much higher as can be seen in the sumptuous sets and depth of quality in his casting. While Hitchcock may have been initially unexcited at having to make a faithful adaptation of a popular novel, he undoubtedly delivers a grand, stylish film which went on to win the Best Film Oscar that year.Literary adherence constraints aside, it seems that Hitchcock was otherwise free to make the film his way without Selznick's usual high level of interference and so very much puts his own mark on the movie, with soon-to-be trademark imaginative lighting and tracking techniques as well as drawing fine performances from his cast. Judith Anderson, for me, steals the show with her ""wicked witch of the east"" turn as the vindictive housekeeper, Mrs Danvers whose twisted love for her former mistress leads her to encourage an innocent young woman to commit suicide. That extended scene with Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs DeWinter is the highlight of the film, her dark costume, wart-bearing face and severe hair-do giving her a demonic presence right out of the Brothers Grimm. Fontaine too is excellent as the hapless new wife, shy, awkward and lacking the personal confidence to fill the mythical Rebecca's glass slippers. Olivier continues his strong, silent persona recently seen in ""Wuthering Heights"" while George Sanders as Rebecca's caddish lover and Gladys Cooper as Fontaine's interfering former-employer are memorable in smaller parts.Like others, I found the turnabout in the characterisations of Olivier and Fontaine too marked where you practically witness a backbone transplant between them at the crisis point in the action just as the pace of the film is slowed to allow the necessary explanations and exposition to finally solve the mystery but it's all worth it just to see the memorable final shots of Anderson flailing about in the flaming inferno of Manderley which will reunite her with her adored mistress.I enjoyed a number of Hitchcock's British-made films but here you get to see what he can do with the support of a major studio and the access it gave him to better writers, technicians and actors. Still one of his best and best remembered films, as calling-cards go, it's very impressive.",Rebecca
47,ElMaruecan82,"Rebecca, Larger-than-Life, Larger-than-Death...",8,2 March 2017,"""Last night, I dream I went to Manderley again."" This is the narration, murmured by Joan Fontaine's soft voice and inviting us for a posthumous tour over the English countryside, to the local manor that turned into a ghostly no man's house, surrounded by dark and brooding trees enveloping the place with an aura of sacred danger like some monster's claws over a precious catch. What is with that Manderley that inspired that dream anyway? The answer is of course in the title, it's all about ""Rebecca"". In fact, there's not a single element that belongs to the film or to the original novel written by Daphne du Maurier and that can be defined with the economy of that name-calling. Manderley was the place Rebecca lived. Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) is Rebecca's widower. Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) is her former governess. And Joan Fontaine suffers from the most ungrateful status as she's not even given a first name, she's only known as the ""second Mrs. De Winter"" she's not even Rebecca's rival because it's a lost fight, mentioning her in the same breath than Rebecca is like pronouncing the name of God in vain.So, the whole movie is overshadowed by Rebecca's aura, it's like the black-and-white photography, drawn through powerful contrasts, was just some decoy containing the shadowy presence of Rebecca, likely to commit an intrusion at any time, by means of a memory, an evocation, a revelation or a confession. There's a moment where Fontaine asks Maxim's best friend (Reginald Denny) about Rebecca, all he can say is that she was the most beautiful creature he ever saw. It takes some superhuman talent to convince us that Fontaine's not as beautiful as Rebecca, however she looked. As the shy, hapless and desperate-to-please Mrs. De Winters, Fontaine is vital to the credibility of the story because through her behavior, she's the plain that gives prominence to the mountain.And 'plain' is the word, it is the mark of a very subtle talent to take distance from the usual strong-minded, glamorous and independent heroines played by the likes of Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn and create such a fragile, delicate and mild-mannered woman, begging for friendship rather than love, in awe of her husband and in total fear from Mrs. Danvers, the ominous governess who never misses an opportunity to remind what kind of a woman Rebecca was. It's a real psychological torture-game operating on Mrs. De Winter's head and frail shoulders and she hardly finds comfort in Maxim who seems to be constantly preoccupied and absent. Olivier seems rather uncomfortable in the role, but while the story unfolds, we slowly understand the reason of his emotional nonchalance and the no-less odd attraction to his new wife. Of course, even the answers belong to Rebecca.Daphne du Maurier was a woman who enjoyed isolation, not just for work but also as a way to contemplate her freedom and question her identity. This distance from the world predisposed her for fascination, for the ability, as a 'first person' to be haunted by someone, and it often happened to be a woman, or her memory, sometimes even a vague idea was enough. Through her fertile imagination and ambiguous sexuality, she managed to translate this power into a splendid Gothic-tale whose risqué subjects forced Hitchcock to make a few changes. But he faithfully, albeit at times not too subtly, respected the original material and his camera-work conveyed the ghostly presence of Rebecca. Even Danvers who seemed to have had a privileged relationship (of platonic nature in the film) seems to glide over the place, as if she was possessed by the soul of her deceased mistress.Hitchcock was a craftsman and his camera loved the faces of Anderson and Fontaine, the cinematography also accentuates the feeling of an impending danger, and the acting was enriched by the presence of a youngish George Sanders and Leo G. Carroll who would also reveal one thing or two about good old Rebecca. It was Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie and needless to say the trial was conclusive. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture, over classics like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""The Great Dictator"", without winning any of the major awards in the directing, acting and writing department, but I guess that's what can be said about ""Rebecca"", it is a great picture with the looks, the mystery, the acting and everything one could ask for.I only wish it didn't overplay the melodramatic violins and a succession of twists and revelation at the end satisfy the mind, but don't fool us either as Olivier didn't play the kind of roles that deserved a happy ending by Hitch' standards. The film redeems itself with some last-minute thrills but Hitchcock would make subtler films. Still, ""Rebecca"" holds up well today because there's that uniqueness in the heroine and this extraordinary presence, the fascination over the fact that the most fascinating character is actually absent. The American Film Institute recognized Mrs. Danvers as the thirty-first villain of all time, but I wonder if Rebecca on her own way was the real antagonist and would have deserved that title a little more. Indeed, we never see her, but we can feel her actions, just like the Man in ""Bambi"" who also nominated in the same list, an invisible but an undeniably evil presence.Now, does Rebecca win or lose as an antagonist? Well, from the opening line, the one about that dream, one can guess that you can never totally get rid of Rebecca, and maybe for that reason, despite the film's flaws and that it's never mentioned at along with ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" or ""Rear Window"" as Hitch' best, we can never totally ignore ""Rebecca"".",Rebecca
48,MOscarbradley,One of the finest of all literary adaptations,9,19 September 2008,"You might feel like giving the second Mrs DeWinter a good shaking, (we never learn her Christian name), and screaming, 'For God's sake, woman, pull yourself together', but there is no denying that Joan Fontaine's pitch-perfect performance is one of the greatest casting coups in the history of the movies. A year before Fontaine was just a mousy supporting player before being cast as the mousy lead in this classic adaptation of the Daphne DuMaurier novel, one of the finest of all literary adaptations, (the screenplay is credited to Robert E Sherwood and Joan Harrison). Fontaine was born for the role and was never this good again and the Oscar she should have won, they gave her the following year for a much less interesting performance in ""Suspicion"", (ah, the good old days of sympathy voting). But then all the performances in ""Rebecca"" are perfect; few films are this well cast.Olivier is simply extraordinary as Maxim DeWinter, the dour master of Manderlay. The year before he was a magnificent Heathcliffe, the dour master of Wuthering Heights, but his performance here is even finer. It is an intuitive piece of acting, as good as anything he did in later years, finding the deep, dark heart of a character that might have been merely novelletish if played by someone else. And then there's Judith Anderson's definitive Mrs Danvers who transcends the potential pantomime villainy of the part with a wonderfully subtle piece of acting. Elsewhere, there isn't a duff performance in site, (Florence Bates' Edythe Van Hopper is particularly treasureable).Indeed this is one of the few screen adaptations of a good book that improves on the original; the acting alone would see to that, but it is also psychologically astute and as one would expect, magnificently directed by Hitchcock who molds the material into another study of somewhat ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary events. In this respect it's as recognizably Hitchcockian as many of his later films, and like the best of his later work it stands up to repeated viewings.",Rebecca
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Happy wife, happy life.",7,9 November 2020,"Essentially, 'Rebecca (1940)' feels like three different films welded together; each of its acts are somewhat distinct in tone and, even, style. To begin with, the picture focuses on a whirlwind romance between the nameless protagonist and a rich recluse who's haunted by the enigmatic existence of his eponymous ex-wife. It feels sort of like a romantic comedy here, with only a few hints of darkness seeping into the fray, and its aesthetics are rather light and, for want of a better term, fluffy. It also culminates in one of the worst marriage proposals ever, a declaration of love disguised as an insult. The second act is by far the feature's most successful, focusing on the protagonist's attempts to acclimatise to the vast halls and large staff found in her new home, all while feeling pressured to live a certain responsibility-ridden, rich-blooded lifestyle as the 'lady of the house'. It's a lonely, mysterious and somewhat gothic fish-out-of-water segment that does a fantastic job of putting you in the new Mrs. de Winter's position. It's also the part in which the haunting, almost otherworldly presence of the deceased yet incomparable Rebecca is most keenly felt. The icy air that hangs over the house and its inhabitants belies the fact that this is, in essence, a ghost story, which gives the piece an interesting texture and lends it an air of suspenseful unpredictability. The movie's final third takes place after what you initially presume to be its big, reveal-ridden finale. It turns into a sort of courtroom drama/ police procedural and is much more focused on delivering information, albeit in an intriguing and well-conceived way. It lacks the almost ethereal vibe that the second act is soaked in, feeling much more in-the-moment and, in a way, straightforward. Of course, this segment isn't bad. It just feels as though it could have been refined somewhat and arguably isn't all that necessary in the grand scheme of things. Still, the conclusion is satisfying. Overall, the film is a beguiling and often enigmatic experience that keeps you engaged throughout. 7/10",Rebecca
50,dromasca,the less Hitchcock of Hitchcock's movies,8,4 December 2008,"'Rebecca' is the first film that Hitchcock made in US and the only one that was crowned with a Best Picture Oscar, although it should be noted that the Oscar was not received by Hitchcock but by producer David O. Selznick, who had produced one year earlier 'Gone with the Wind'. It is somehow overrated in my opinion, as despite being a good movie it is not one of its best, and it's the less Hitchcock of all his films.The film starts as a romance, with young and innocent Joan Fontaine meeting widower Laurence Oliver on the Cote d'Azur to become in 20 screen minutes his second wife. It's 20 minutes of good romance, which let us feel that if he wanted Hitchcock could become a good romance movies director. Second part is the most Hitchcock one with the young wife becoming mistress of the castle which is still haunted and dominated by the shadow of the late Mrs. de Winter (we actually never learn her name - she has no name, Rebecca, the first wife has no face in the film, no portrait left). The psychological relation between the second Mrs. de Winter and the intendant of the house, faithful to the memory of her first mistress is the key conflict of the film, and here we get some of the fine balances of innocence and terror that we well know from other films of the master. The third part falls into quite routine police inquiry, and although the ending may hold some surprises it is this part that is really dusty and did not make it through the six decades since the film was made.There are some good or even bright parts in this film, the acting of Joan Fontaine and especially of Judith Anderson as one of the classical villains of all times is very good (less is Olivier's - this is not one of his great roles), and some camera work is really asuperb. Overall the film is unequal, and too many and too long boring parts make it one interesting but not one of the brightest pieces of work of Hitchcock.",Rebecca
51,ThomasDrufke,Classic Hitchcock Film,8,7 April 2014,"He is the master of suspense. And this movie is another great example of probably cinemas greatest director of all time. He never fails at surprising us at every turn of the movie, and of course given us his classic cameo moment. This movie is so impressive because of how early he made it. This was one of his first major hits, and one of his best. While I still prefer Dial M for Murder and Rear Window as his best Mystery films, this one doesn't disappoint.Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. I think she is the character that I will remember for years to come and I'm glad she got an Oscar nomination that year. Another thing Hitchcock is known for is the twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Major props to the writing crew, though its based on a book, the writers did a great job making this story our own and not giving anything away until its revealed but also leaving enough clues to where the second viewing becomes that much cooler.My only complaint would have been the length of the film, it dragged at times which lessened my hype for the ending. But it didn't make the final product as surprising as it was. But I will say the man guarding the shed definitely made me suspect that there was something not being told to us. That final scene with the house being burnt down was quite a surprise and a huge bang for this movie to go out on.In what was a typical Hitchcock thriller, we got everything that makes goose bumps rise on our arms and all the memorable scenes that we have become familiar with in terms of a Hitchcock movie. As of now I would put this movie in the top 7 or 8 of Hitchcock movies, and that is most definitely praise.8.8/10",Rebecca
52,Cineanalyst,"A Haunted House, Incest, Lesbians and Rosebud",9,1 November 2020,"The central romance and mystery may be the least interesting thing about ""Rebecca,"" but even that has its psychosexual perversity. It's a typical Hollywood coupling of an older man, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier)--in this case a widower--with a younger and inexperienced woman (Joan Fontaine). She's presumably a virgin before they meet, but, more than that, for most of the picture, she's entirely submissive and unsure of herself. She has so little identity beyond constantly being afraid and her devotion to her husband that she's never even given a name until she's married, becoming the second Mrs. De Winter. Orphaned, she leaves the employ of one mother figure to marry a stand-in for her other deceased parent. This is precisely what Maxim adores about her, too, as he orders her to never be 36 years old and laments what a pity it is that she has to ""grow up."" The Oscar-nominated Fontaine nails ""that funny young lost look,"" too, that her fatherly husband wishes to preserve. The great mystery of this Gothic romance turns out to be that Maxim didn't love his first wife precisely because the gendered roles were reversed--him inexperienced and Rebecca unsubmissive and sexually promiscuous. It's the old chestnut of punishing women for sexual infidelity, which, as it involves her cousin (George Sanders), also takes on an incestuous quality this time--and not of the sort condoned in the father-and-child dynamic of the second marriage--to go along with a hint of gay panic and queer bashing over the subtextual lesbianism between Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and the threat thereof between Mrs. Danvers and the second Mrs. De Winter.The value of this underpinning ideology of enforcing heterosexual patriarchy aside, all of that surely makes for a sensational read by Daphne du Maurier, as does its genre hopping, as pointed out by Don Ranvaud, from fairy tale to mystery to detective story, but as the 2020 adaptation evidences, not necessarily a great movie. It would also be par for the course for an Alfred Hitchcock film, but, fortunately, it's also one of the strongest pictures visually in his oeuvre. And in the career of David O. Selznick, as it's been oft reported that the two men battled over the production as if the conflict between the Mrs. De Winters on screen were merely an abstraction for the real-world control of the artistic direction. Auteur theory has been kind to Hitchcock, but don't forget that before winning Best Picture for ""Rebecca,"" Selznick was awarded another the previous year for an epic, ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), that wasn't authored by any particular director at all, with the vision of the producer, Selznick, as well as that of the newly-designated production designer, being of more import.As others have mentioned, from the Criterion Collection home-video commentary by scholar Leonard J. Leff, to comparative videos on the web, ""Rebecca"" bares striking visual similarities with the next year's ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). Both begin with virtuosic shots trespassing through gates to the enclosed estates, each represented by some nice exterior miniature work and matte paintings. The camera in this one is made to appear to be going straight through the iron of the barrier. Both end with the ""R""-marked objects ablaze--taking their secrets with them to their fiery ends. In between, both feature a film-within-the-film that provide a superficial glimpse at their subjects. Both concern the ghosts of their eponymous dead characters. These films are also remarkable in standing out in their day for how they photograph spaces, the architecture.Technically, ""Citizen Kane"" is significantly more ambitious, as it also is in its plot structure--while all we get here is the remembered voiceover narration to deviate from the otherwise ordinary plotting--but ""Rebecca"" remains effective for how felicitous the photography of the architecture of Manderley is to the drama. I love how small Fontaine looks amid those wide shots of those spacious rooms, hallways and staircases--reinforcing how small her character feels psychologically in her new, mysterious environment and in comparison to the first Mrs. De Winter. And how her sense of being lost is reflected in the seemingly labyrinth structure and secret spaces of the property. Lyle R. Wheeler's sets also feature those wonderfully high door knobs that appear at eye level with Fontaine. The seaside location also has the benefit of waves standing in for sex in this production made during the era of the Hays Code.As in ""Kane,"" the gulf within her marriage is represented visually by them sitting on opposite ends of a long dining-room table. Viewing this again after seeing the 2020 remake, there's also more than our learned association through decades of such films with the Gothic that this story looks better in black and white. Never mind the story, one can tell there's something darkly sinister and mysterious afoot by merely looking at the shadows on screen. There's especially a lot of highlighting of eyes--that bar-shaped illumination from masked key lights that I've recently learned has been dubbed ""Shatner lighting,"" but clearly existed before ""Star Trek."" ""Dracula"" (1931), for one, also features effective use of the technique. In ""Rebecca,"" there's also an emphasis on sunlight slipping through foliage, clouds and fog in the opening tracking shots. Cinematographer George Barnes, being awarded an Oscar after having been nominated at the first two Academy Awards ceremonies, was evidently one of the best in the business--even if ""Rebecca"" also features some atrocious rear-projection composites. The contrast to the exquisite interior camera movements and techniques is stark--even in rear projection. The dimming of the lights on the background figure as Fontaine turns her face in profile in one shot, by contrast, was an effective use of the rear-projection effect. Additionally, besides the opening sequence, one of my favorite tracking shots is the one Maxim narrates of his last interaction with Rebecca, with the camera following the movements of the invisible ghost.The acting helps, too. George Sanders is George Sanders, and I'm a fan of that. I'm less fond of Olivier in this one, although he at least has some evident affection for his wife visible on his face (as opposed to that in the 2020 iteration). To be fair, it's not a great character anyways. Right off the bat, the guy doesn't even wait around after he orders a coffee (the wasted work of the waiter never to be resolved in the film, either, by the way). On the other hand, as should already be apparent, I think Fontaine works well. Were she not, Anderson would've entirely stolen every scene of hers (such is the case, to beat a dead horse, I'm afraid, in the 2020 version), because, boy, she's creepy as Manderley's housekeeper--ever more so when she's also being erotic. The way she handles Rebecca's clothes--from her fur coat, to her underwear, to her see-through fabric caressing the bed--it's as though Mrs. Danvers were undressing Rebecca's ghost in front of the new wife. It doesn't get much more obvious than that in a 1940 Hollywood production, and, if that weren't enough, how about those waves again superimposed over that ""R"" for ""Rebecca,"" as the second Mrs. De Winter recoils from the thought. Interesting, too, in this light, that Danvers may not be so much trying to sabotage the second marriage, including by the Rebecca dress, as to engage the new wife in a similar lesbian affair or to bring back the image of her past love. To top it off, the ending is one of the all-time greats--the fire, the camera movement, and the figure of Danvers.It's the spatial relations of that camera, though, especially in exploring interior space and imbuing the architecture with its own character that is the standout here. It's what other great filmmakers, such as those of ""Kane,"" evidently picked up on. It's what would continue to mark Hitchcock's best films, ""Rear Window"" (1954) and ""Vertigo"" (1958) most among them.",Rebecca
53,ericstevenson,Alfred Hitchcock's latest cameo (in the movie),10,19 May 2016,"I admit to being confused by the first twenty minutes or so of this film. This might be the last Alfred Hitchcock movie I ever saw as I've seen almost all his other well known films. It really is great to see this evolve into a movie truly worthy of his namesake! Almost all his films are horror or mystery or at least thriller. This is a film that definitely got better as it went along. It just got better and better atmosphere as it went on. You would think the main female character in this movie would be named Rebecca, right? Nope, that's actually her husband's deceased wife who never even appears.It's amazing to see how much is done in this movie. The husband shows off their home movies even though they just got married. It will make more sense as more is revealed about the story. I feel bad for not finding the Hitchcock cameo in this! It turns out you can barely see his face at all and I had to watch a supercut to make sure it was him. Yeah, I'm such a nerd and I have heard of people who watch his movies just to see his cameos. It's over two hours in, a record! The strange thing is that it begins with opening narration. It ends without any, so it's hard to tell if she's actually telling the story. It was certainly unpredictable, as expected from any of his movies. This may be one of his earliest films that's really consider one of the best of all time as it would be over ten years that ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"", ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"", AND ""Rear Window"" would come out. It's always nice to see when an artist first becomes an expert! This is a must see for anyone. I personally don't find this as good as most of the movies that I just mentioned, but that's still a compliment for someone as good as him! Perfect ****.",Rebecca
54,cricketbat,The only Alfred Hitchcock film to win Best Picture,8,31 October 2018,"It's strange that Rebecca is the only Alfred Hitchcock film to win Best Picture, and yet it's not his best film. However, this movie still does a great job of creating consistent tension and making the viewer feel uneasy during seemingly mundane situations. Additionally, this film offers up an unpredictable story as well as some wonderful performances from Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense.",Rebecca
55,secondtake,Sucks you in totally...a high romance with astonishing sets and photography,10,31 March 2010,"Rebecca (1940)Ah, to see another great movie from those few years when Hollywood peaked, when that combination of art, freshness, and sheer collaborative talent combined over and over. I'm talking from Gone with the Wind to Casablanca, 1939 to 1942. Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to. But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars. And it was up against The Letter, The Grapes of Wrath, and The Philadelphia Story, all of which are more proof that the movies of this period are a zenith of a certain kind of Hollywood. The studio system. (Yes, there are hundreds of other great movies from other years, but I'm not really trying to make my case here.) Hitchcock never won an Oscar for best director (neither did Welles), but he could have here without fault. As much as this is just a movie to get lost in and enjoy, it's also a movie you could watch over and over and study.",Rebecca
56,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Classic,9,27 August 2021,It had an interesting topic. Hitchcock did a great job as usual. Casting was so good. This movie doesn't need a reboot. It will always be a classic movie.,Rebecca
57,vincentlynch-moonoi,Superb Hitchcock tale,8,31 July 2012,"Before getting to the meat of the movie, I want to comment about the quality of the recent Blu Ray edition. This is a very crisp and clear rendition, well worth the update from DVD.I want to begin by giving praise to 2 of the supporting actors here. The standout is Judith Anderson (later Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. Also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. However, I prefer her in later roles where a little comedy was woven into a rather steady characterization.If you buy the DVD with the ""making of"" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. Mentioned at one point is the question of lesbianism on the part of the character played by Anderson. PERHAPS, but I think the documentary was wrong...that the target was wife # 1, not Joan Fontaine's wife # 2.While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as ""Suspicion"", ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", and ""Spellbound"". I'll give it ONLY an A, not an A+ that I would give such films as ""North By Northwest"" and ""Vertigo"". However, I think it is so much better a film than ""Wuthering Heights"", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again.Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). He also plays a man who is still in turmoil from...from what?However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal, particularly because she plays against her own type. Watch any old interview with her; she was always ACTING extremely refined; here she is playing a very awkward new wife. It may be her best film...either that or ""Suspicion"". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive.The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy short performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll.I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife.The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an ""8"" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!",Rebecca

This is the first Hitchcock's American/Hollywood movie so it has typical British flavor, like all previous Hitchcock's mysteries.

61,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,3 January 2005,"A stylishly directed and photographed film that examines a number of themes, such a deception, death and depression, and explores well the emotions of its characters. It is rare to find a film like this, as it tackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious. The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance.

The initial events seem innocent enough - a wealthy gentleman sweeps an insecure young woman off her feet while on a trip to Monaco - yet things go on a gradual downtown as the events of the past catch up to them. The atmosphere is one of extreme discomfort, as the protagonist is constantly under scrutiny and compared with her predecessor, a universal obsession that she eventually succumbs to. The stark monochrome cinematography suggests that many things are hidden in the mansion, and the emotional acting adds deep characterisation to everyone on screen, all culminating in some shocking twists.",Rebecca
63,Thanos_Alfie,Mystery in the most out...,7,8 February 2015,"""Rebecca"" is a mystery movie in which we watch a shy woman who was working as a companion girl of another woman. In a trip she and one rich man fall in love and they decide to marry. When they are returning to the main house of the man she understands that he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a boating accident the year before. And in that the mystery starts.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was really nice written but also for the direction of it which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock and his contribution in the success of this movie was really obvious. We can understand in many scenes the tips and the guidance that Alfred Hitchcock gave to the actors on how to play, to show etc. About the interpretation I have to say that I loved the interpretation of Joan Fontaine who played as Mrs. de Winter and also the interpretation of Laurence Olivier who played as 'Maxim' de Winter. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Judith Anderson's who played as Mrs. Danvers and I believe that she was great on her part. Another important fact that I have to mention is that this movie did not tire me even a little and kept me in tense in the whole duration of it, something that I believe is extremely important for a mystery movie.Lastly I believe that ""Rebecca"" is a nice mystery movie which combines really well this mystery with the romance between the couple and the result that comes out from it is the best. I also think that this movie is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock and I strongly recommend it to everyone because it's a must see movie.",Rebecca
64,didi-5,Hitchcock goes America,6,17 April 2004,"This brooding, dark classic has all the hallmarks of Hitch at his best, with the shadows, the striking shots, and the fine performances from Laurence Olivier as Maxim, a very young Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs De Winter (admirable how the film still gets around the problem of her not having a first name), and best of all, Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers.  The fabric is broken somewhat by George Sanders appearing to do his usual bored aristocrat act, but that's a small quibble.  The reliable Gladys Cooper and C Aubrey Smith appear in tiny roles.The film is never boring, and even though it stretches and changes its source material in places, it does a good job of making a movie out of Daphne du Maurier's novel.  Any reader of 'Rebecca' will have their own ideas about the characters - I'm glad the temptation to actually show 'Rebecca' herself was resisted.",Rebecca
65,zkonedog,Hitch's Directing + Great Story = Best Picture,9,10 March 2017,"Despite the fact that Alfred Hitchcock is widely renown as one of the great directors of his time, it is a bit strange how so many of his films (especially the later ones) have such lame plots. Hitch can make practically anything watchable, but Cold War stinkers like Topaz or Torn Curtain, for example, just weren't going to be classics with even the greatest at the helm. In the case of ""Rebecca"", however, the overall plot is equal to Hitch's masterful style, producing an epic film worthy of its Oscar statue.For a basic plot summary, ""Rebecca"" begins with the the meeting and courtship of Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and the lady who will become his wife (Joan Fontaine). When the couple arrive at Maxim's elegant mansion, however, the new bride discovers just how deep the love of Maxim's first wife runs through the home, especially in maid Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson).The main plot element of this film reminds me very much of ""Vertigo"" in the sense that a supernatural presence is hinted at. Viewers never quite know what is going on (further hinted at by Hitch's adept film & music touch) until quite literally the final minutes of the movie. I won't give away any details here, but suffice it to say that the mysteries throw enough curve-balls to keep you on the edge of your seat in wonder.The acting is also top-notch. Olivier & Fontaine shine in their leading roles, but Anderson's Danvers pretty much steals the show in this one as one of the great creepy movie characters of all time. Comparable to Nurse Ratched in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"".Overall, ""Rebecca"" has got to be up near the top of all ""Best of Hitchcock"" lists, as it excels in pretty much every element of film-making. Whereas other Hitchcock films rely on Hitch's tricky camera work or silly humor to a large extent, ""Rebecca"" is just a fantastic story translated well onto the big screen.

If there's any doubt of that, watch the scene of Olivier's Max recounting what happened to Rebecca. On page, it's nothing more than a well-written monologue; in Hitchcock's hands, it's a chilling piece of melodrama - a ghost story nearly-come-to-life.

68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A Gothic Hollywood romance in the hands of a master,9,25 May 2011,"Both a Golden Age Gothic romance and a true Hitchcock thriller, ""Rebecca"" somehow merges its director's style with its producer's sensibility. Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but ""Rebecca"" ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in ""Jane Eyre"" opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by ""following her"" with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure. But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place. Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz."" It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences would have you believe ""Rebecca"" to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time.

70,Vartiainen,"The longer it goes, the better it gets",7,27 August 2017,"A young, sweet and naive girl from humble origins (Joan Fontaine) catches the eye of a wealthy aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). One whirlwind romance later they're married and moving back into his ancestral home called Manderley. But almost immediately she has to start dealing with begrudging staff and the proverbial ghost of the previous Mrs. de Winter.The film managed to surprise me pleasantly. Because let me tell you, the first third of this film is boring. It's so absolutely boring. A young woman moves into an old manor, terrible things start to happen, et cetera, et cetera. But, seeing that this was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, it really shouldn't have surprised me that it didn't remain that boring. The movie changed directions abruptly, and then again. When it got to the final few minutes, I'd call it outright brilliant.Hitchcock also manages to inflict the film with a lot of flair. It was his debut in the United States and was met with almost universal approval, including Hitchcock's first and only Academy Award for Best Picture. And I'd say it's earned. It's an old movie, but filled with a lot of neat tricks and touches. Things you'd nod your head approvingly at even in modern films. The mood is built with almost surgical precision, the soundtrack supports this beautifully and the characters keep revealing new sides of themselves.Is it the best film Hitchcock ever made? No, it's not, but it's still a great watch for all fans of mystery and suspense. And quite a different love story as well, if you're looking for that as well.",Rebecca
71,weezeralfalfa,"Very slow to engage one's interest, until the last part",7,16 August 2017,"For me, this romantic drama didn't get very interesting until the last 40min. of a 2hr.,10min. film. However, I can say the same thing about ""Casablanca"", for example. This section begins with the startling revelation by Maxim de Winter(Laurence Olivier), that he detested, rather than cherished, his deceased wife: Rebecca. His young replacement wife('no name')(Joan Fontaine) had been in aw of Rebecca, as everyone praised her whit, energy, and skill as the mistress of an English manor. It's very odd that Maxim was so late telling his new wife that he hated his former wife, for several reasons. He said she was incapable of real love. She continued with her promiscuous lifestyle after they were married, although she managed to mostly hide this. She taunted him with details of her affairs and the suggestion that she was pregnant by another man. 'No name' was elated that Maxim, apparently in contrast to everyone else she had met at Manderley, despised his former wife, giving her an opening to outshine Rebecca, at least in Maxim's mind.(Incidentally, it's Manderley, not Mandalay, as a few reviewers wrote. Mandalay is a city in Myanmar(Burma)). Even a year after her death, there were still many physical reminders of Rebecca in the manor, often labeled with 'R'. Her room remained as it was when she died. Probably, this was more the policy of the head servant: Mrs. Danvers((Judith Anderson) than of Maxim. She had an extraordinary fondness for Rebecca, and often reminded 'no name' of her inferiority. At one point, Mrs. Danvers asks 'no name' why she doesn't leave, since Maxim doesn't love her. She opens the window, and suggests 'no name' may want to jump out. It's curious why 'no name' didn't fire her at this point?! It demonstrates how much Mrs. Danvers hated either 'no name' or Maxim or both. Also, during the burning of Manderley, Mrs. Danvers told 'no name' that she started the fire because she couldn't stand to see them as a happy couple in Manderley. Again, it's unclear whether her anger is directed at just one of them or both. Clearly, Rebecca hated Maxim, as he hated her, and tried to goad him into killing her, when she wanted to die because of her advanced uterine cancer. That way, presumably, she could ruin Maxim while accomplishing her goal of dying quickly. Did Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers have a common reason for hating Maxim? If so what was it? Could it be that they both hated men? Could they have had a lesbian relationship? The Production Code wouldn't allow clear evidence for a positive answer. Note that in burning the Manderley, Mrs. Danvers destroys all the remaining physical reminders of Rebecca, as well as herself. This was a suicidal act as well as an act against the de Winters. I see practical problems with the whole business of Maxim staging an accidental drowning of Rebecca to cover up her dying from a fall on her head during their tussle. First, why did he go to this trouble? He could have reported the truth that her death was accidental. He didn't think anyone would believe him, but I don't see why not. Rebecca's body was said to be found inside the cabin of the scuttled boat. But this was a year after she disappeared and nearly as long since he had supposedly identified her body some distance from the Manderley. Her body should have completely decomposed by then. Small Flesh-eating animals could get through the holes opened in the boat bottom to sink it. Thus, identification would probably have to be through dental records. The question of how those boat bottom valves got open is also a sticky point. She could have opened them, but why go to the trouble of drowning herself that way. Also, a letter from her on that fateful day gave no hint that she felt suicidal. However, her recent report from her doctor of an advanced cancer gave a possible motive for suicide.Why is Joan Fontaine's character nameless other than the 2nd Mrs. de Winter? She probably has more screen time than anyone else. I can only guess, because compared to Rebecca, she was looked upon as a nobody.See it in B&W at YouTube.",Rebecca

The casting is brilliant, the story is hauntingly beautiful, the performances are the best of what Hollywood once was, and the sets are of quality design and architecture. The direction is awesome, but it's Hitchcock, and I expect nothing less from his productions.Rebecca is a glamorous, beautiful socialite who has won the hearts of all who knew her. Well, almost all. But a year after her untimely death, her grieving husband near his wit's end, has grown seemingly suicidal and aloof.He engages his grief while on a trip to Monte Carlo, and meets the beautiful personal secretary and maid of a long-time friend, Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper. She is young, naive, and completely unprepared for the life which is awaiting her; all qualities which George Fortescu Maximillian 'Maxim' de Winter finds endearing.I won't detail the events in this movie, as the story itself is quite haunting, with surprises around every turn.This is a definite ""must have"" in any suspense / horror / Hitchcock / classics movie collection, and a mandatory must see for all fans of all movies.It rates a 10/10 for its absolute perfection, from...the Fiend :.",Rebecca

'Rebecca' combines a compelling story with excellent acting, masterful direction and haunting cinematography. The flow of the film, as it moves from almost light comedy (Florence Bates' over-the-top society-snob character) to romance to mystery to Gothic horror is a testimony to Hitchcock's skill as a director as well as the quality of the script and the talent of the cast. The climatic destruction of Mandalay and the immolation of Mrs. Danvers as she stands by her 'shrine' to Rebecca is one of Hollywood's most memorable scenes. I think that this is one of the finest films to come out of the 1940s as well as one of my personal favourites.",Rebecca

However, there's a ghost in Mandalay... just not the type of ghost you'd be expecting.This is straight-up Gothic drama in all the Edgar Allen Poe sense of the word, but most deliciously it's some very biting dark comedy. It's just so wonderfully perverse watching these damaged characters haunt their own spaces and creep around like sludge from the hollows.I have to say I've enjoyed this movie much more than I've enjoyed a lot of Hitchcock's works. I don't know precisely what it is but Hitchcock doesn't do it for me sometimes. Near the end of this movie the plot does go into what I'd call ""typical Hitchcock mode"", which kind of damaged the movie a bit for me but not enough for me to lower its rating any. It's kind of like how the end of AI could be dropped completely from the plot and we'd end up with a good movie, only the ending of this movie doesn't retrospectively damage the quality of the movie as a whole... it just sort of lets it peeter out a bit.At any rate, it was absolutely lovely, with characters with a bit more on their mind than just, oh, I don't know... running away from the law or whatever. It's wonderfully felt and wonderfully presented, making the entire thing feel more magical.By the way, is it just me or do a few scenes of this movie remind me of scenes from Citizen Kane and Disney's Beauty and the Beast? --PolarisDiB",Rebecca
75,ackstasis,"""She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her.""",9,25 December 2007,"By the end of the 1930s, working for Michael Balcon at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation , director Alfred Hitchcock was heading towards the peak of his artistic potential. Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating  Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films  their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death.Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine plays a young, modest woman who falls in love with a wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who still apparently mourns the death of his wife, Rebecca. Following a humble wedding in Monte Carlo, the two lovers return to Maxim's sprawling Manderley estate in Cornwall, England, where the servants  especially the chillingly creepy Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson)  find it difficult to accept this young bride as the new Mrs. de Winter. Whenever Fontaine's character finds herself within the walls of her new home, the atmosphere in each of the rooms is discomforting, even suffocating, as she struggles vainly to assimilate into a world for which she is unsuited. Her character symbolically remains without a given name, reinforcing the story's stance that she is without an individual identity; as long as she remains with Maxim, she will continue to be evaluated against Rebecca, and will be forever in the lingering shadow of Maxim's long-dead, ""perfect"" previous wife.The Master of Suspense certainly knew how to make an entrance into Hollywood, and 'Rebecca' is definitely one of his top ten films {out of the twenty-seven that I've seen thus far}. Though, at 130 minutes, it is one of the longest motion pictures that Hitchcock ever produced, the film never drags nor feels overly cumbersome, with the extended running time merely prolonging the suffering that the audience must endure through Fontaine's innocent, continually-threatened character. This isn't the sort of thriller that lulls you into a false sense of security and then shocks you, since that was simply not Hitchcock's style. Like another Gothic thriller of which I am fond, George Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944),' the main character is forever at ill-ease with her surroundings, and we, as the audience, are never afforded the luxury of feeling safe and secure. Rebecca de Winter is one of the most meticulously-detailed unseen characters in the history of cinema, and, without the story ever straying into supernatural territory, it seems as though her lingering presence is somehow orchestrating the disturbing events of the film.",Rebecca
76,mjneu59,Hitchcock goes to Hollywood,10,29 December 2010,"Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood debut, while not likely to appeal to the same fans who champion 'Vertigo' or 'Psycho', is nevertheless a 14-karat treasure from the Golden Age of movie-making. Purists will argue that the film is more Selznick than Hitchcock: a blockbuster studio production packed with talent, prestige, and all the glamour money can buy, but certain touches (mostly those concerning malevolent maidservant Judith Anderson and smarmy playboy George Sanders) could not have been duplicated by any other director. The film today, restored to all its magnificent, pristine clarity, is suitably lush and moody, and after all these years the atmosphere of unease surrounding the stately house of Manderley is still palpable. But the Daphne Du Maurier scenario is still very much an anachronism: the innocent, unsophisticated girl who marries into wealth and tries, desperately, to conform to society's manners is hardly a valid role model these days. And once the mystery of the late Rebecca de Winter is finally solved, the Gothic plot settles into a conventional blackmail scheme more typical of the Master of Suspense.",Rebecca

However, Rebecca is not a regular,run of the mill Hitchcock film with a lot of suspense.This is because this master of suspense deliberately avoided suspense in order to remain faithful to the original book written by English writer Daphné du Maurier.In this manner a personal touch was added to a film which has been celebrated all over the world.A giant screen of an equally huge cinema hall would ideally be the best place to appreciate this film with one's family as one can appreciate superb black and white cinematography which brings out the best of a Gothic tale.It is true that Alfred Hitchcock made ""Rebecca"" in USA for an American producer but it is still very much a British film as most of the actors including Laurence Olivier portray genuine behavioral traits of an English society.",Rebecca
78,robfollower,My personal favorite. Arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort,10,17 March 2019,"1940 Hitchcock's first American film (and his only Best Picture winner), Rebecca is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense The acting is uniformly excellent. Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl. But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best. Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner. The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful. In a line-up of great motion pictures, ""Rebecca"" stands as one of the giants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort",Rebecca
79,CubsandCulture,"Wonderfully Atmospheric and Stylish, but the plot had to kick in...",8,30 September 2018,"The first 3/4 of this film are a slow creepy descent into madness largely thanks to Mrs. Danvers figuratively being a waking nightmare. The nameless heroine, the wonderful Fontaine, is memorizing as the oppressive nature of Manderley and Rebecca's memory is slowly tearing her apart on the existential level. Maxim, the wonderful Olivier, is unpredictable. You are never quite sure if he charming or sinister. Hitchcock directs with flair and whips up a delightful slice of Gothic horror. Or maybe it is romance, But then you find out Rebecca liked sex.Well, not quite liked that but a ton heat goes out of the film after the reveal about Rebecca's death happens. Admittedly, the reveal scene is extremely gripping and it is masterful the way Hitchcock makes you perceive without seeing Rebecca. And it works thematically as well as the film is discussing the notion of identity. Nonetheless, there isn't much there (in terms of drama) after that point. Unfortunately, the film still has 30 minutes or so to go. The film lags until the fire and the problem is mostly the screenplay. That was some fortunate cancer if you think about it. This is a good Hitchcock film. There are better ones.",Rebecca
80,pixrox1,"A virtual sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND, only without the racism . . .",9,6 November 2013,". . . it is no coincidence that the movie REBECCA comes from the fiendish mastermind behind WIND, producer David O. Selznick. After studying his memos to director Alfred Hitchcock for hours, several things become clear. First, Selznick treated Hitchcock as a total idiot, and bullied him to such an extent that any Miami Dolphins offensive lineman would have quit the team if faced with even half the amount of abuse. Second, Selznick decided that the magic formula for making Americans empty their wallets at the cinema box office was to select a period piece from a female novelist at the top of the best seller list and spare no expense on costumes to put a word-for-word Readers' Digest length ""picturization"" on screen. Fortunately for REBECCA, the censors forced Selznick to accept a change of the key plot point from the book regarding Rebecca's death, which improves the story's believability by at least 400%. An equally important break for this picture is that Hitchcock's one-camera, one-take shooting style prevented Selznick for totally destroying Hitchcock's work in post. (Perhaps the best proof of the virtual meaninglessness of Hollywood's Good Ol' Boy Oscar voting system is that Selznick--NOT Hitchcock--got an Oscar for REBECCA; the best picture awards for THE ARTIST & ARGO prove that, if anything, the system has devolved to an even lower nadir today). Finally, the reason WIND merits just 3 of 10 compared to REBECCA's score of 9 is that the latter is 1 hour, 45 minutes shorter, and is NOT a racist misogynistic marathon melodrama.",Rebecca
81,estebangonzalez10,The master of pulling the rug under you,9,17 March 2014,"""You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers! But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her - no one ever got the better of her.""Without ever being physically present or having a line in the film, Rebecca's strange influence over everyone dominates the film in a way only Hitchcock could have pulled off. I still have a lot of Hitchcock films to catch up with, but so far I haven't seen one I disliked. Rebecca is a near masterpiece and Hitchcock once again proves his craft as a director by slowly building a psychological romantic thriller and then once we are hooked with the characters he pulls the rug under our feet and delivers some surprising twists we never expected. This may not be one of Hitchcock's most popular films, but it will always be regarded for being the only film of his that won him an Oscar. Rebecca isn't his best film (which in my opinion is Rear Window), but it deserves to be ranked amongst his best work thanks to a gripping screenplay, some wonderful performances, memorable characters, and above all its beautiful black and white cinematography. It is simply stunning and despite being made in 1940 it still manages to remain incredibly suspenseful and unique. Despite knowing that Hitchcock is going to come up with an interesting twist he completely catches me off guard every time and leaves me even more engaged with his work. My only complaint (a minor one) with his films is that despite being subtle throughout the story at the end he spells everything out for the audience trying to explain the twists (Psycho is the best example of this, but in Rebecca it's done again and it makes the film drag a bit near the end, but it's only a minor complaint considering we are talking about the Master of Suspense). Rebecca is based on Daphne Du Maurier's celebrated novel (who also wrote The Birds which Hitchcock later went on to direct) and adapted by Robert E. Sherwood. The story centers on a shy unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) who works as a paid companion to the wealthy Edythe Van Hooper (Florence Bates). While they are in Monte Carlo she meets a wealthy estate owner named Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Edythe mentions that Maxim's wife, Rebecca, passed away an year ago in a boating incident and he hasn't recovered from it. During their short stay in Monte Carlo however, Maxim falls in love with her and the two marry within weeks of having met. Maxim takes the new Mrs. de Winter to his beautiful country home known as Manderley and introduces her to the staff. Despite being in awe of the majestic home, she feels intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who remains obsessed with Rebecca. As the days pass, Mrs. de Winter begins to feel overwhelmed by everyone's affection towards Rebecca and somehow she feels that Maxim is still very much in love with her. Rebecca's shadow seems to interfere with everything she does and she begins to feel her relationship is doomed.Rebecca is not simply a psychological thriller centering on relationships, it is a film focusing on identity. Despite never being seen, Rebecca's presence dominates this film and she seems to have a strange effect over everyone. In contrast, the second Mrs. de Winter only gets her name once she marries Maxim and she never really has an identity of her own. She is continually threatened by Rebecca's presence no matter what she does and despite wanting to overcome it she can't because everyone seems to have adored her. Hitchcock builds the tension and suspense very subtly with memorable characters. Despite being extremely beautiful Joan Fontaine pulls off an incredibly natural and believable performance as this shy and insecure pet-girl. Laurence Oliver also plays his role as the loving but distant character very well. However the two most memorable performances for me came from the supporting cast. Judith Anderson and George Sanders play the villains to perfection. Sanders delivers some comedic relief, while Anderson's mysterious and cold face uneases us from the moment she appears on screen. The Gothic mood underlying the film mixes perfectly with the haunting ghost story as Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere once we step into Manderley. Hitchcock has done it again.",Rebecca
82,iquine,Subtle Suspense,9,4 December 2017,"(Flash Review)Counter to the majority of suspense films out there today, Hitchcock derives great suspense from two things that are not literally characters on the set, which creates an eerie atmosphere and discomfort as the story plays out. One core suspense point I'll leave as a surprise and the other I'll say is the metaphorical character of the film, the massive mansion, accentuates the underlying tension. The story kicks off with a young woman, who is an assistant to a wealthy older lady staying in Monte Carlo, who catches the eye of a wealthy gentleman. She is enticed by his charm as well as his wealth. As their romance takes off, she is brought to his mansion complete with a full staff and is slow to warm herself to the icy head housekeeper who has a mysterious fondness for the wealthy man's former lady. Will she regret her new station in life in the lonely mansion? Will she gain the confidence needed to navigate the housekeeper's unusual emotions and trumpet herself as the new lady of the house? Nicely paced, well edited, communicative shot framing, smart and engrossing dialog and crisp black and whites make this a stellar and memorable Hitchcock suspense film.",Rebecca
83,Lechuguilla,The Hovering Ghost,8,14 February 2010,"Poor girl. No matter how hard she tries, the second Mrs. de Winter (Joan Fontaine) just can't quite measure up to the memory of Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter, a ghost that hovers over Manderley, British estate of the wealthy Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Manderley is an enormous castle-like house, first seen in black silhouette in the opening sequence. It lies in ruins. Yet, there are memories contained therein, and the film's plot structure consists of one long flashback, as told by Joan Fontaine's character. ""Rebecca"" is a Gothic love story, and Manderley is where most of the story is set.This is a ""dark house"" melodrama. And it's a good one. Manderley's interiors are imposing and intimidating, like the house manager, the severe Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), whose job it is to please Mrs. de Winter. Yet fearsome Mrs Danvers lords over the place, causing considerable inferiority and grief for Fontaine's character.The underlying theme I suppose is the introduction of disorder into an otherwise orderly, predictable aristocratic circle. There's an ever-so-slight hint of subversion in the story, injected by the main character, lovely but naive, clumsy, lacking in social skills, someone who doesn't fit in among the usual Manderley crowd.The plot's middle Act, set at Manderley, is by far the best. The first Act takes place at Monte Carlo. And in the third Act, the plot turns perfunctory and shifts away from Manderley. We thus lose the ""dark house"" atmosphere. The film's dialogue strays into exposition in the second half.B&W cinematography is competent. We get multiple light sources in interiors, and lots of shadows. Rooms are big, and the staging creates a credible sense of wealth and aristocratic power.The film's overall acting is very, very good. I don't see how Joan Fontaine, or anyone else, could have done better in her role. Olivier and Anderson also give wonderful performances.Both entertaining and thematic, ""Rebecca"" is a high quality film that focuses on a young woman put in an awkward situation. The story is haunting and eerie. Despite its age, it still speaks to a modern audience, as most of us feel uncomfortable if we're placed among people, or in situations, that seem intimidating or threatening.",Rebecca
84,smatysia,Quite good,8,2 September 2020,"An older film that has aged fairly well, thanks in no small part to director Alfred Hitchcock. I understand that it hews fairly closely to the book by Daphne du Maurier, but I have not read it. Outstanding acting from the leads, especially Joan Fontaine, whose character is forced to grow up quite suddenly, and Ms. Fontaine was able to emphasize this transformation through speech, expressions, and mannerisms. It may not be Hitchcock's best, but it is quite good nonetheless.",Rebecca
85,MissSimonetta,A triumph of gothic filmmaking,8,23 March 2020,"While there is perhaps more of producer David O. Selznick in REBECCA than director Alfred Hitchcock, this is still a high point in the careers of both men, a triumph in gothic style and mystery. Due to this being a favorite film of both my mother and my grandmother, I have seen it well over a dozen times through the years. It never fails to impress me.In many ways, this feels like two movies in one: the first part involves the unnamed second Mrs. De Winter (played by a ravishingly lovely Joan Fontaine) trying to settle into her role as the new mistress of Manderley and the second part involves discovering the suspicious circumstances behind Rebecca's death. Fontaine really only gets to do much of anything in the initial half as her meek character grows a backbone and matures. By the time her arc is over, so too is her time as the protagonist (notice how she is not present for the scene where we finally learn just what was up with Rebecca). This makes the movie feel a little disjointed, but it's too small a flaw in the grand scheme of what the movie does well.There's gothic and then there's GOTHIC-- the cinematography of this film is pure chiaroscuro, drenching that old mansion in shadows. Fontaine is often dwarfed inside of Manderley, emphasizing her displacement and the power of the past over the future. Franz Waxman's score is gorgeous, romantic, and ghostly.All of the actors give great performances (I almost forgot to mention Laurence Olivier as the tormented Maxim de Winter, a character I admit I find broderline insufferable in the first half of the movie), but my favorites are George Sanders as Rebecca's ""favorite cousin"" Jack and Judith Anderson as the wonderfully creepy Mrs. Danvers, an illustration of the old idea that love makes people do the darndest things. Even with the Production Code firmly in place, her erotic fascination with her dead mistress is plain just from the way she handles Rebecca's underclothes. She commands every scene she's in and gives the most memorable performance of everyone. (I do wish she and Sanders had more screentime together though; I just love their verbal sparring and mutual loathing.)Overall, this is a good, old-fashioned ghost story. Hitchcock would make movies closer to his interests in the years to come, but REBECCA is no slouch and a fine beginning for his Hollywood career.",Rebecca
86,AAdaSC,Anyone for tennis?,7,23 December 2014,"Joan Fontaine (Mrs de Winter) is a companion to the very snobby and highly amusing Florence Bates (Mrs Van Hopper). While holidaying in Monte Carlo, they bump into Laurence Olivier (Maxim) who is mega wealthy and owns the stately home of Mandalay in Cornwall. A romance between Joan and Larry develops behind the back of fussy Florence, and by the end of their stay in Monte Carlo, Joan and Larry are engaged. They marry and return to Mandalay but the overbearing presence of Olivier's first wife ""Rebecca"" still lurks at every corner. But, things are not as they seem.The film left me thinking about how I would feel about Olivier's character if I watched the film for a second time. I would definitely view him in a different light now that I know the story. You have to get to that point to understand what I mean as things take a very different turn about three quarters of the way through and his motivations become very different to what has been previously assumed. It's a clever twist. Up to that three-quarter way mark, I found that Olivier, Fontaine and housekeeper Judith Anderson (Mrs Danvers) were all too predictable and that the film was a little long. However, things pick up with the discovery of Rebecca's boat.The cast are uniformly good with George Sanders (Favell) standing out as a cad. He is elegantly sublime and slimy as he looks out for number one. At the other extreme was Fontaine – I'm not keen on feeble female roles and so she grated on me on several occasions. Chicks in films need to be funny or be ready to fight back. None of this drippy stuff.A couple of things that I didn't notice during the film – Hitchcock's usual appearance (it is there, though), and the fact that Joan Fontaine's character doesn't have a first name! The film is a little long but it's worth it in the end.",Rebecca
87,drownnnsoda,The other woman,10,22 May 2015,"Joan Fontaine plays a self-conscious working class woman who falls in love with and marries a wealthy high society man (Laurence Olivier) and moves with him to his sprawling ancestral estate. She is met with bizarre reception from his friends, as well as his mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and finds herself haunted by the ceaseless memory of his first wife who died in a bizarre accident outside the property.Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most Gothic work, ""Rebecca"" is a phenomenal and faithful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel; the film itself has deservedly earned its place in the film canon, much as the source novel has in the literary realm. The plain truth is that ""Rebecca"" is an all-around masterwork. It's easy to forget that this is a Hitchcock film, which is maybe what makes it such an interesting piece of his filmography— while the film has Hitchcockian colorings, it is quite possibly the least ""Hitchcockian"" of all his films, leaning more as an ode to Gothicism than any of Hitch's signature quirks.Predating the aesthetics of Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"", Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"", and Lewis Allen's ""The Uninvited"", ""Rebecca"" is the paramount of spooky mansion films, which is interesting because it really isn't a spooky mansion film at all (yet another paradox). It is not at all a ghost film, though the presence of the eponymous Rebecca haunts every frame just as much as the memory of her torments the leading lady. Fontaine's character is reminded of, compared to, and prodded with the memory of Rebecca at every turn, and the film's shadowy photography of the expansive manor's interiors provide a landscape in which the omnipresent former wife can possibly lurk. Ominous and portentous warnings from the bizarre housekeeper only accentuate the feeling that Rebecca may be lurking in any corner, be it in human or spirit form. As a partial result, the terror that is central to the film is very much psychological; if anything, I'd categorize the film as a psychological thriller, though the thrills are fairly light, especially by today's standards. Tour-de-force performances from Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier especially boost the overall impact, with Fontaine believably embodying a woman who finds herself in a new life that is haunted by her predecessor, and Olivier is quietly menacing yet charming and suave. Judith Anderson's legendary performance as the cryptic Mrs. Danvers is also key here, adding a necessary unnerving sensibility as she invokes Rebecca more forthrightly and disturbingly than any other character. Unlike so many films of the era, the performance here are truly timeless.I would say that this is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, but the truth is that it's just a great film, period. It is dissimilar in tone from what the director is most celebrated for, and for that reason is easily separated from his stylistics, though very much an important hallmark in his career. ""Rebecca"" is an understated masterpiece of Gothic horror that looms over the genre just as ubiquitously as our titular invisible monster. 10/10.",Rebecca

90,slokes,"Chick Flick ""Vertigo""",7,30 July 2010,"Nearly 20 years before ""Vertigo"", Alfred Hitchcock made another film featuring romantic atmosphere, social misfits, a possible ghost, and male-female frustration. Except in ""Rebecca's"" case, it was from the woman's point of view.""Rebecca"" features identity confusion as well, in this case pitting a woman without a face against another without a name. Joan Fontaine is the nameless one here, paid to keep a miserable battleaxe company until she is whisked away in Monte Carlo by rich, debonair Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's a perfect fantasy except that the place he lives, Manderley, is a perfect nightmare.""We're happy, aren't we?"" the bride asks at one point. ""Terribly happy!"" The problem's the dead former Mrs. de Winter whose first name is the movie's title. Based on a best-selling novel by Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca's malign spell is captured in the ornate but shadowy set decoration, a creepy Franz Waxman score, and the raven-like Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), a maid who pops out of corners of the frame offering unwanted advice on how ""the late Mrs. de Winter"" would have wanted things.Beaky, unblinking Mrs. Danvers is one reason guys might find this film frustrating. If she's so nasty, just send her packing, right? But Mrs. D works for me because of the heroine's trembly manner. Fontaine wears her character's insecurity very well. She wants to be on Mrs. Danvers' good side, which only mines ""Danny's"" contempt. Still devoted to Rebecca, a spellbinding force for whom ""love was a game"", Mrs. Danvers's perverse loyalty prompts a jealous cruelty. In ""The Shining"", we learn that people leave traces of themselves in strange buildings after they're gone, like ""if someone burns toast"". In ""Rebecca"", Mrs. Danvers IS the burned toast.Olivier is a bit of a stiff here, though it suits the part. It's a woman's-eye story all the way, with a real tough-love male to draw out his lover's unquenchable spirit. He wins her over to him with such lines as ""I should have asked you to have had lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily"" and ""I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool"". He probably sent her out for Chinese food on their honeymoon, too.The movie moves very slowly, stringing out every hurt emotion. Because Rebecca was lost at sea, Fontaine has to blurt out at one point irrespective of nothing: ""I never have any fear of drowning, have you?"" cuing a musical sting. Around Maxim, there are lots of stings. ""I'm boorish through living alone"", he says, but of course that only makes the heroine's devotion more grand. Like Mrs. Danvers, she loves fully, but not at all well.Still, ""Rebecca"" is a solid romantic film with recognizable bits of Hitchcockian suspense worked in the corners. It's his first and most successful collaboration with David O. Selznick (a nudge who this one time was right to nudge), his first American film, and his only Oscar winner.I can think of several other Hitchcock films deserving of Oscar over ""Rebecca"". But it's better than no Oscars for Hollywood's greatest director. Looking past that, ""Rebecca"" is a solid, character-driven story worth watching and appreciating for its own substantial merits.",Rebecca
91,gcd70,Timeless classic from Hitchcock,7,7 January 2008,"Winner of the 1940 Best Picture Academy Award, ""Rebecca"" was the only film to ever gain the prize for the master of the macabre, Alfred Hitchcock. Yet for this pic we are not treated to the macabre, rather to the story of a lonely widower, who, seeking to make a new beginning, meets and marries an impressionable young girl in the south of France. All appears to be going well until the two return to his stately home near Cornwall, where the memories of his late wife start to haunt not only him but his new bride as well, as she tries in vain to fill her shoes.Daphne Du Maurier's dramatic novel is skilfully presented by Hitchcock as he weaves a web of intrigue and deception for his fascinated audience. One always knows that things will all work out, but the hows and the why-fors are kept just out of reach, leaving the viewer to become deeply involved in both the plot and the wonderful characters.Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are both very enjoyable as Mr. and Mrs. De Winter, the newly weds who have encountered troubled times at ""Manderley"". The support cast impress also, with Judith Anderson a particular stand out as Mrs. Danvers. Franz Waxman provides some very appropriate music, while George Barnes' cinematography also received an Oscar. Even the effects and Art Direction are admirable in this David O. Selznick production.Alfred Hitchcock never wastes a moment in a movie which is never as melodramatic as some of his other works from that period (eg. ""Jamaica Inn"", ""The Paradine Case"" and ""Spellbound""). Certainly a very enjoyable and memorable mystery that will entertain a great many who derive pleasure form such timeless classics.Saturday, June 25, 1994 - Video",Rebecca
92,EUyeshima,Overlooked Hitchcock Masterwork Remains a Classic Romantic Mystery in Wonderful Criterion Restoration,9,8 February 2006,"Even though this film won the 1940 Best Picture Oscar, it does seem a shame that master director Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic mystery is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his later works like ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"". I'm not sure why but it may be because at the time, it was a film more associated with David O. Selznick in the afterglow of ""Gone With the Wind"" than with Hitchcock who was making his first picture in Hollywood. Sixty-five years have elapsed and diminished the perception of Selznick's then-powerful influence. Suffice it to say that ""Rebecca"" survives as one of Hitchcock's most atmospheric masterworks, beautifully filmed by George Barnes and with two superb lead performances by Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Major credit needs to go yet again to the Criterion Collection for restoring the original beauty of the black-and-white film from a pristine print and resuscitating a clear soundtrack. The result is well worth revisiting even if you have already seen it in earlier forms.The full-blooded plot is intricately based on the way Du Maurier sets up the two main characters. At the center of the story is a naïve, unadorned young woman working as a hired travel companion for the selfish Mrs. Van Hopper. Because of her testy employer, she ends up on the French Riviera where by chance, she meets Maxim DeWinter, a brooding, wealthy widower. DeWinter is energized by the young woman and decides to marry her on the spot. The newlyweds return to DeWinter's residence, the foreboding estate called Manderley. The young woman's insecurity is heightened by the cold housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who takes an immediate dislike to the new Mrs. DeWinter. Mrs. Danvers's adoration is reserved strictly for Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. At first, the new wife is completely intimidated by the manipulative Mrs. Danvers, but over time, she takes stock and becomes a more formidable presence until a revelation threatens to destroy her marriage. As the film plays itself out, the young woman discovers the real cause of Rebecca's death and gains strength in providing support for her tortured husband.In her first important role, the 23-year old Fontaine captures the right mix of deepening anxiety and innocence in portraying a woman so insecure as to not have a name in the story (she is referred to as ""The Second Mrs. DeWinter"" in the credits). Fresh from his equally ominous turn as Heathcliff in William Wyler's ""Wuthering Heights"", Olivier plays older, and it suits his polished manner much more as a well-bred man trapped by his personal demons. In a role that has been parodied endlessly ever since, Judith Anderson expertly plays the implacable Mrs. Danvers with a foreboding chill with her overly modulated tones. I do have to admit there are some moments -especially as she holds the candles near her tersely twisted face - when you almost want to laugh from the overemphasized dramatic effect.Smaller roles are filled expertly by familiar faces - George Sanders, a full decade before his acerbic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"", plays a far more bald-faced scoundrel but with the same smarmy panache as Jack Favell; the befuddling Nigel Bruce and a relatively sympathetic Gladys Cooper expertly portray Maxim's brother-in-law and wife; and in the early going, Florence Bates makes a wonderfully wicked Mrs. Van Hopper. Once the center of the mystery has been exposed, the film does move quickly toward its conclusion running somewhat counter to the pacing Hitchcock uses in the story set-up. Regardless, many of his touches are on full display, especially the distorted camera angles and creative use of lighting. It all makes for grand entertainment.The Criterion DVD is a wonderful two-disc set with expert commentary provided by film historian Leonard Leff, the author of ""Hitchcock and Selznick"". It's obvious that he has studied this film intensely and come up with some golden nuggets of insight regarding the film machinations and the treatment of various plot developments. The second disc for true aficionados with an in-depth Du Maurier biography; numerous Selznick memos (for which he was most famous) on the ongoing production; more recent interviews that Leff conducted with Fontaine and Anderson; and most interestingly, archived footage of screen tests with actresses far more established than Fontaine at the time - Vivien Leigh, Loretta Young, Margaret Sullivan, a seventeen-year old Anne Baxter. Except for Baxter, who brings a touching Oedipal twist to her audition, it becomes clear how hopelessly wrong these beautiful actresses are for Fontaine's role and instead would have been ideal as Rebecca. The first disc is a must-see; the second is for devotees only.",Rebecca
93,Enchorde,"Long, slow, good acting but far too little ""Hitchcock"",",5,20 November 2005,"Recap: Maxim de Winter remarries with ""Second Mrs de Winter"" after a short a quick romance at the hotel. Maxim is a very rich man from the top of society while Second Mrs de Winter is totally new to riches and her newfound status. Maxim takes his new wife to his mansion, the huge Manderlay, and they are booth greeted by the staff. But this is not the first time Maxim is married. His former wife, Rebecca, drowned a year ago and her memory lies heavy over the mansion. Mrs de Winter feels totally out of place, like an intruder, and it does not help that Mrs Danvers, the head of the staff, was very fond of the first Mrs de Winter and is acting very cold towards the new wife. And Maxim, when not leaving his new wife alone, acts very strange when anyone speaks of Rebecca. His new wife feels that she has to compete with an idol and does everything she can to please her husband, but as she misinterprets a lot of signs, she fails. And one fateful night, things are discovered that puts the death of Rebecca in question. Accident? Suicide? Murder?Comments: A good acted but unfortunately too long drama/mystery. Hitchcock emphasizes the love triangle between Maxim and his present and former wife very much, and after a while it almost seems repetitive. The movie takes small and very slow steps and very little new is introduced. Until we nears the end, when Maxim's story about the death of his first wife is put in question. Then we get to see the mystery and some of the suspense I think of when hearing the name Hitchcock. But its too late, by then I was already bored and had some of my attention elsewhere.Otherwise, a good production, very good acting from Joan Fontaine, and from Laurence Olivier with the distant character of Maxim. Unfortunately there are some mistakes done. Manderlay is obviously a miniature, and some of the background, mostly ocean, doesn't really connect with the actors. Supposed to be a classic, but I was a little disappointed.5/10",Rebecca

Take a good look at it in the opening of the film and ask yourself the question, Does this house look very similar to the one Charles Foster Kane lived at in Citizen Kane? Not only does it look very similar, but the film starts out exactly like Citizen Kane with the slow movement of the camera introducing the mansion. I wonder what Orson Welles was thinking when he made his masterpiece 1 year after Rebecca premiered in theaters?????",Rebecca
95,Steffi_P,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again""",8,23 November 2006,"Hitchcock's first US production is distinct from anything he did before or after, most significantly in that it was an adaptation of classic novel. With the exception of The 39 Steps, before and after Rebecca Hitchcock would normally work with original material or loose adaptations of lesser-known novels. After leaving the relative freedom of the British studios, it was also his first time to work with perfectionist producer David O. Selznick, who often exerted as much control over the way a picture turned as the director.The fact of Rebecca being such a highly regarded and well-known novel was clearly something of a straitjacket for such an independent and formulaic director as Hitchcock. There could be no major changes to the plot, little room for Hitchcock to squeeze in his trademark suspense and black humour. Hitch instead sticks to his other forte, using the arrangement of shots to convey mental states, true feelings and relationships between characters  and at that he is at his best here. In an early scene where Maxim de Winter sits down for coffee with Miss Van Hopper and Joan Fontaine's character, he focuses on Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine's reactions, even though the clucking Miss Van Hopper is doing most of the talking. In a later scene at Manderlay we see Joan Fontaine sitting alone at a huge dining table, with the camera slowly pulling out to show her sense of isolation.Hitchcock also goes a long way in creating atmosphere with large wide open spaces, curtains blowing in the breeze and the way he moves actors in and out of the frame. Mrs Danvers' first entrance, walking arrogantly straight into the middle of the shot is particularly memorable. A brilliant example of how Hitch uses a few simple techniques to achieve a change in mood is when Maxim and Joan Fontaine are viewing a reel of home movies from their honeymoon. Halfway through they are interrupted by the butler with the news that an ornament belonging to Rebecca has gone missing, and Joan Fontaine owns up to breaking it, leading to an argument. Before the interruption the camera focuses on the projection screen, and we see footage of the newlyweds happy together. Afterwards however the camera ignores the screen and focuses on Olivier and Fontaine, their faces half-lit, emphasising the tense, awkward atmosphere.Another problem with faithfulness to the source novel means that the dialogue is often overly literary. Joan Fontaine's opening narration sounds particularly lofty. Luckily the two lead acting performances are good enough to carry it. Laurence Olivier is great as usual. I didn't like Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter on first viewing, but then I realised what was actually annoying me was the way the camera draws in on her and the music swells up for all her emotional moments, which is more the fault of Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Overlooking this, her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved.Rebecca is an engrossing film, and one that stands up well to repeated viewings. It has to be said this is mostly down to Daphne du Maurier's gripping, twisting story. But credit has to go to Hitch for using the freedoms of cinematic technique to convey it. Aside from the minor flaws already mentioned, I can't really think of a better way it could have been done. Whatever the case, it has to rank among Hitchcock's finest films.",Rebecca
96,ShootingShark,Ultra-Classy Adaptation Of Classic Gothic-Romantic Mystery,7,14 August 2005,"A young woman falls in love with the troubled Maxim DeWinter when they meet in Monte Carlo. They marry and he takes her to Manderley, his mansion in Cornwall. Once there however, she is overcome at every turn by the ghostly shadow of Rebecca, De Winter's first wife, who drowned under mysterious circumstances a year before.Hitchcock's first American film is a gorgeous adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic novel, sumptuously produced by David O. Selznick. I'm not generally a fan of classical romantic fiction, but Rebecca is most definitely an exception; not only does it have several great plot-twists but the central character is brilliantly conceived and entirely sympathetic, and the brooding Gothic atmosphere of both Manderley and Rebecca confine the drama within a tremendously chilling ghost story. The cast are all first-rate but both Fontaine and Anderson give career-defining performances. Fontaine is tremendous - beautiful and passionate in an earthy, selfless way that fits her nameless character perfectly, whilst Anderson, as the villainous Mrs Danvers, is so good that she single-handedly launched a standard movie stock-character (the over-zealous housekeeper) in hundreds of subsequent films. This was the movie which allowed Hitchcock to paint on a really huge canvas, and he creates a powerful sense of dread - you can almost feel Rebecca's presence in the film. There's a stunning shot of Mrs Danvers opening some drapes, where he suddenly freezes the frame and dissolves to the next scene, epitomising the essence of the story - a place frozen in time, where nobody can move forward or shake themselves free of the past, and everything is stagnating. For my money this is the best Gothic romance ever filmed; a brilliantly directed movie of a tremendous book.",Rebecca

99,davidmvining,Hitchcock comes to Hollywood,10,29 June 2020,"So, Alfred Hitchcock traded an out of control actor/producer in Charles Laughton for just an out of control producer in David O. Selznick. That honestly feels like a step in the right direction. Instead of having an egomaniac try to dictate Hitchcock's own movie to him on set, he only had the egomaniac on the phone and in the editing booth. Reading about Hitchcock up to this point in the timeline of his filmography, this is the first time I've seen his editing in the camera technique mentioned where he only shot exactly what he needed to edit together. So, he didn't have entire scenes playing out across multiple takes, instead he shot what he needed from a particular actor in an exchange at a particular angle and stopped filming. I have to imagine that this was a technique that he developed while working in the studio system in Britain where he had to be as economical as possible. It had the added advantage of preventing Selznick from completely remaking the film in the editing bay. So, despite the stories of how much Selznick wanted to mess with the film, Hitchcock made the film in a way that only minimal messing could happen.Anyway, the film is based on another Daphne du Maurier novel after Hitchcock adapted her Jamaica Inn as his last British picture. This is apparently a much more faithful adaptation of du Maurier's work than the previous film. A young woman is attending Ms. Van Hopper as a paid companion in Monte Carlo when the pair meet the mysterious and very wealthy Maxim de Winter. Ms. Van Hopper, a rather tiresome socialite well past her prime, desperately tries to latch onto Maxim, but the young attendant effortlessly falls into his arms romantically, and the romance blossoms into a quick marriage. The real joy of Ms. Van Hopper is how she quickly morphs from a tiresome bother into a woman of experience as she tells the new Mrs. de Winter that she's entering a world that she does not understand.At Mr. de Winter's residence in Cornwall, Manderley, a gothic mansion on the coast of England, the new Mrs. de Winter meets the house's staff, in particular Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. This is where it becomes apparent that this is a ghost story. The former Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, is mentioned in almost every scene. Everyone seems haunted by the mysterious presence of her a year after her disappearance and death, but her former presence affects different people in different ways.Maxim can't bear to hear her name or be reminded of her, and he won't talk about her, leaving his feelings a mystery. Mrs. Danvers, on the other hand, treats Rebecca's name with the utmost reverence. When the new Mrs. de Winter finds her way into Rebecca's old room, Mrs. Danvers touches Rebecca's things like they are holy objects, her brush and pillow case (embroidered with an R) in particular. Mrs. Danvers goes so far as to encourage the new Mrs. de Winter to wear a dress that Rebecca wore to a dress up party a year before in an effort to drive a wedge between her and Maxim.Eventually, Maxim reveals the true past of his relationship to Rebecca and his role in her disappearance to his new bride, a terrible secret that weighs on him heavily and could turn into serious consequences if found out by the right people such as the local sheriff or George Sanders, Rebecca's cousin and lover.What sets this movie apart from everything Hitchcock made up to this point is the maturity. From the basic approach to actors and their performances to framing and to emotion, Rebecca doesn't feel like the work of a man who's most successful movies have been adventure yarns about shadowy organizations doing shadowy things for shadowy reasons. This is a character drama that uses Hitchcock's entire array of technical skills and also manages to fit in thematically while finding places for his telltale sense of suspense. The way the truth gets doled out steadily over time, with questions lingering about motive and desire for main characters with the new Mrs. de Winter as our point of view into this strange little world, is all about building suspense towards the central questions at hand (something that honestly, despite my defense of the film, should have been in Jamaica Inn).The only thing that I have some small reticence over is the final fifteen minutes or so of the film when everything gets revealed. For what it is, a series of reveals that the movie actually did build up towards, it works and has a certain appeal, but it feels more banal than the more Romantic and Gothic film that had preceded it. Again, it's not a bad series of reveals, it just doesn't feel like it quite fits. The final images of the film, though, do fit wonderfully well as the ghost of Rebecca burns away in visual metaphor.This is a sort of greatness that Hitchcock, up to this point, hadn't really been working towards. The films that were meant to be taken more seriously, like Juno and the Paycock and The Skin Game felt as much like quick solutions to the question of talkies from a producer perspective than anything else, and, while The Skin Game is a successful film, it always felt limited visually (due to a few outside reasons Hitchcock had no control over). Working from novels, with greater inherent scope than stage plays, feels like a more natural fit for film in general, and Hitchcock fills the frame really well to fit the story. So, despite some lingering, limited questions of authorship between Hitchcock and Selznick, this does represent a reinvigorated Hitchcock in his new Hollywood home.",Rebecca
100,onepotato2,"Yep, that's a melodrama",4,6 March 2008,"In kissing off her nasty, disapproving guardian (Mrs. von Hoffstetter) and improbably marrying wealthy Maxim de Winter, nameless, socially-retarded servant Joan Fontaine leaps from the frying pan into the fire. Van Hoffstetter is instantly replaced by the awful, iron-willed, disdaining housekeeper at her new estate, Mrs. Danvers; some sort of nightmare embodiment of all that's wrong and masochistic about British servitude. Not able to get over her own mousiness, Fontaine develops a fear of Danvers, and a bizarre inverted power-dynamic develops. The plot (eventually) thickens...The big revelations are hopelessly convoluted and plot-negating. Here's the final hour's worth of conflicts which all reverse themselves into pointlessness. --- Maxim can't bear to be reminded of Rebecca apparently because she was such a paragon of womanhood. Oh, but wait, he actually hated her; what a stroke of luck for our heroine! --- Someone else is buried in Rebecca's grave, meaning (gasp!), Rebecca's still alive? Nope, she's dead anyway. --- Rebecca was a conniving bitch and was provoking Maxim to kill her? Oh, but luckily, she accidentally fell and died anyway. --- Rebecca was probably pregnant making it look like Maxim killed her? Oh, but no, luckily she was full of cancer and would have died that month anyway. OH come on already! Such poor writing. One of these limp developments would have been too much. Generally, we don't go to a movie to watch dumb luck neutralize a catalog of threats in someone's life.Rebecca is unusually slow and uneventful. I've rented this three times previously, out of a sense of obligation, and fallen asleep each time, after no more than 45 minutes; and never finished it. The idle rich are shown having lots of time to be idle and fret about obscure things; pretty dull, unless you're into time-jumping, class-fantasy. I watched it recalling that the British pretty much consider their upper-class to be lunatics. I fell asleep again this time, but trudged on just to be through with it, once and for all. At the first twist, the damned thing should have ended, but there's still about an hour of reversals left! It's decidedly un-Hitchcockian except for Hitch's odd use of miniatures and rear-screen, which is becoming distracting here. A puppet of Mrs. Danvers closing a tiny window is unconvincing even at the scale of TV. This is a dull, clumsy, overlong melodrama with tedious, long-delayed segments devoted to exposition. There's also a costume ball; a bankrupt cliché if there ever was one. Rebecca is a bad movie.",Rebecca
101,nycritic,What Atmospheric Gothic-horror Should Be.,10,5 March 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock was and is still the undisputed Master of Suspense, and there is a lot of that here in his foray into Gothic horror, as the mystery surrounding the unseen yet omnipresent Rebecca will engage the viewer from its dreamy start to its bleak conclusion. This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported ""atmosphere"" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock's first true masterpiece.Not one performance rings false, not to the novel or to their respective interpretations. Lawrence Olivier, quite possibly one of the greatest actors that ever lived, portrays a broken man who still lives haunted by the past as he himself were still living in that unending hell. Judith Anderson embodies one of the most coldly sadistic figures in cinema history, her smooth and elegant truculence only exceeded by Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. One can't seem to understand the way she wallows in her dead mistresses' clearly perverse nature, but that exactly she does, right down to her own end. George Sanders does what he does best: sneer, smirk, and spit line after line of practiced venom, and would be honored 10 years later in ALL ABOUT EVE. Gladys Cooper, still striking in her 50s, plays into her casual cattiness which means no harm, although her rendition of Beatrice Lacy is a little subdued from the novel's version.And then there is Joan Fontaine. Not one of the best actresses on film, yet here, playing a role that evolves beautifully from a frightened, weak girl who is put into a situation she does not understand and who turns right at the point of losing it into a much more mature, strong woman capable of holding her own, she carries the weight of the entire drama and comes forth with flying colors. While I would have preferred Anne Baxter who would have been the exact right age for this role, Fontaine exudes so much restraint and nervousness about her character (partially to blame Olivier's treatment of her and Hitchcock's telling her the entire cast hated her), it's almost a relief when she finally decides to confront Olivier about what it the secret of Manderley. Not many roles require such a change and not many actresses would sink her teeth into a part that requires being put-upon until she can't stand no more, and this is one beautiful performance.A movie that should have won more Oscars that year, REBECCA has since grown in stature and proved that a film need not trophies to be Timeless and Great.",Rebecca
102,JuguAbraham,Daphne du Maurier and the actresses carry the film,7,10 April 2006,"Hitchcock's cinema has always been propped up by a good novel, play or script. His cinematic flourishes embellished these materials with a remarkable intuition of how viewers would react to his treatment of the written material.The real genius of the film ""Rebecca"" will remain with the author du Maurier. Hitchcock's treatment of the story was to change the end of the story to make the leading man appeal to the audiences. Daphne du Maurier's murderer is transformed by Hitchcock into a tragic hero. That's what American audiences wanted in the Forties and want even to this day. Hence the film gets the Best Picture Oscar and other Oscars. But even with the changed ending, the story is great. In the book, the lead characters go on to live their lives after Manderlay burned down in another far way place.This film has all the ingredients that go down well with most audiencestwo superb performances (Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter and Dame Judith Anderson as the housekeeper with lesbian attachments) and the realistic special effects that recreated Manderlay within the studio. If people were wide-eyed at the performance of Olivier in this film, I suggest they see a British film called ""A Term of Trial"" directed by Peter Glenville, which has a story with quaint similarities to Olivier's role in ""Rebecca"" to see the thespian at his best.What is Hitchcock's contribution beyond the fine performances of the ladies? He was able to capture the sinister quality of Manderlay (just as the house of the murderer in ""Psycho"") in the opening sequence through spoken words and visuals and the burning of Manderlay at the end by light on the faces of people viewing the spectacle. He was probably aware that the basic material of du Maurier was the flip side of ""Blackmail,"" one of his early films with a gender reversal. He was probably thinking of reworking elements of ""Rebecca"" in ""Suspicion"" a film he made 3 years later.""Rebecca"" might have won awards but in terms of cinema it pales in comparison with four Hitchcock films ""Notorious,"" ""Saboteur,"" ""Sabotage,"" and ""Blackmail."" Interestingly, this is a rare Hitchcock film that presents women who gain in strength other rare examples being ""Marnie"" and ""Spellbound.""",Rebecca
103,lewiskendell,All is not as it seems in this Hitchcock classic.,8,15 August 2010,"""I've loved you, my darling. I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.""Rebecca begins very simply, with only the slightest hints of the twists and turns to come. After a whirlwind romance in the South of France, a young woman (Joan Fontaine in a nameless role) is swept off to Manderly, the lavish ancestral home of her new husband, Maxim (Laurence Olivier). It doesn't take her long after arriving there to find out that the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's deceased first wife, continues to hang over Manderly. The stress of constantly being compared to the memory of the seemingly perfect Rebecca begins to outright suffocate the young wife, and her husband's frequent outbursts of temper and preoccupation combined with the unfavorable opinions of some of the household staff becomes more and more overwhelming. All is not as it seems in Manderly, however, and hidden secrets are eventually brought to light, with life-changing consequences. I thought Rebecca was a great movie. It initially seemed to be a light romance, before seamlessly bringing in elements of mystery and even courtroom drama. It's actually a relatively dark story, full of sordid dealings and shady characters.  Quite a surprise or two is sprung on the audience before Rebecca is done, and while this doesn't seem much like a Hitchcock movie in the beginning, by the end, there is little doubt that his fingerprints are all over this. I highly recommend it.",Rebecca
104,Handlinghandel,The Opening Voiceover Is Classic,7,31 August 2002,"I hadn't seen this movie in maybe 15 years. The opening voiceover spoken by Joan Fontaine is splendid and classic. The movie is beautifully, skillfully directed. I am not a fan of Hitchcock works such as ""Vertigo"" -- no matter how often I see it, it still seems tacky -- or ""Psycho"" after the shower scene. So this is far better.My favorites are ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" ""Notorious,"" and ""Strangers on a Train."" And ""North By Northwest.""But it is a bodice-ripper. It's awfully corny in many ways. Olivier's seeming uninterest in Fontaine makes sense in the early parts but once The Secret has been revealed and they speak to each other in Hushed Tones, he seems no more interested.",Rebecca

They fall in love, and within two weeks they are married. The young woman is now the second ""Mrs. de Winter.""Maxim takes his new bride back to Manderley, his rather large country house in Cornwall. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), is domineering and cold, and is obsessed with the beauty, intelligence and sophistication of Maxim's dead wife Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter, preserving her former bedroom, the master suite, as a shrine. Although dead, Rebecca's presence is nonetheless pervasive - several things throughout the house - stationery, handkerchiefs, bed linens, even the master bedroom door - bear her ornate ""R"" or ""R de W"" monogram. As her closest confidant, Mrs. Danvers regularly comments on Rebecca's exceptional grace and style. When asked what Rebecca was like, Frank Crawley (Reginald Denny), Maxim's best friend and manager of the estate, absent-mindedly tells the new Mrs. de Winter that Rebecca was an exceptional beauty.The new Mrs. de Winter is intimidated by her responsibilities and begins to doubt her relationship with her husband. The continuous reminders of Rebecca overwhelm her; she believes that Maxim is still deeply in love with his first wife. She also discovers that her husband sometimes becomes very angry at her for apparently insignificant actions. She also meets Rebecca's so-called ""favorite cousin,"" Jack Favell (George Sanders), who visits the house while Maxim is away.",Rebecca

Hitchcock still had to get used to the division of labor between the director and the producer in Hollywood, especially when the producer had the name of David Selznick.""Rebecca"" is based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier. Two more Hitchcock films were based on the work of this writer: ""Jamaica Inn"" (1939) and ""The birds"" (1963).In ""Rebecca"" a young woman is compared to a dead woman so often that it almost seems one is trying to reshape her after the image of the dead woman. This is also the theme of ""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock). In Verigo it is a man who tries to reshape the woman, and so Vertigo is a psychological film with sexual undertones.In ""Rebecca"" the adoration of the dead woman comes from a woman (the housekeeper Mrs Danvers played by Judith Anderson).
Mrs Danvers moves around the house in complete silence and in so doing resembles a ghost. In the final scene Mrs Danvers shares the fate of the house she has been serving in for so long. Judith Anderson maybe a less known actress than Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier (the two stars of this film), in my opinion it is her performance that gives the film its gothic horror like mood.",Rebecca

Place a pair of pince-nez on the bridge of your nose and witness two great stars, Joan Fontaine is outstanding, add immense depth to an already deep, dark and disturbing tale with some sinister supporting characters thrown in for good measure, none more so than Judith Anderson as the mysterious and cryptic Mrs. Danvers.",Rebecca
109,seymourblack-1,"Romance, Fear & Dark Secrets",9,21 March 2014,"In ""Rebecca"" a young woman's experiences of romance, fear and dark secrets correspond with her transition from innocence to maturity and prompt her saddened husband to reflect that ""it's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved won't ever come back. I killed that when I told you about Rebecca. It's gone. In a few hours, you've grown so much older"". The despondency, regret and sense of loss that are embodied in these words are incredibly profound and typify the general atmosphere of gloom and melancholy that's such a strong and important feature of this extraordinary film.During a short stay in Monte Carlo, a naïve young lady who works as a paid companion for a rich overbearing society woman meets and falls in love with an older aristocratic Englishman called Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Their relationship develops rapidly and soon the young lady becomes ""the second Mrs de Winter"" (Joan Fontaine) and returns with her new husband to his enormous estate in Cornwall and his huge mansion called ""Manderley"".Maxim is a moody widower whose first wife, Rebecca, died in a boating accident. He's often brusque with his wife and she assumes that his sudden outbursts of anger are linked to his inability to come to terms with the loss of Rebecca. When she becomes the new mistress of Manderley, the second Mrs de Winter is soon overwhelmed by her new role and starts to feel rather isolated because of the aloofness of her staff and her husband's rather distant manner. She's also surprised and intimidated by the degree to which the spectre of Rebecca seems to be ever-present as everyone in the mansion (including Maxim) seems obsessed with Rebecca.Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson) is the cold, severe looking housekeeper who ""adored"" Rebecca and now keeps her room exactly as it was when her previous mistress was alive. Her hostility to the second Mrs de Winter is obvious from their first meeting and she does everything within her power to undermine her new mistress including trying to get her to commit suicide. The feelings of fear, inadequacy and powerlessness that the second Mrs de Winter experiences at this point are intense but soon everything changes when a sunken boat is discovered nearby with a body inside it. A whole series of revelations then follow and make it clear that so many things at Manderley were not as they had originally appeared to be.Laurence Olivier's performance as a tormented man who's haunted by his past is very good but definitely outshone by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Fontaine's expressions and body language convey her character's timidity, uncertainty and sincerity with enormous power and Judith Anderson is convincingly evil as one of movie history's most memorable villains.An interesting feature of ""Rebecca"" is the techniques that are used to make the second Mrs de Winter appear insignificant and inferior. Not only does she get cruelly dominated by her employer in Monte Carlo and consistently patronised by Maxim but she's also denied even the basic dignity of having a name. When she's first introduced to the staff at Manderley, she's made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because she's rain-soaked and dishevelled and visually, the distorted dimensions of the interiors of Manderley make her look physically smaller, lost and out of her depth in her impressive new surroundings.Although Alfred Hitchcock famously dismissed ""Rebecca"" as not being a ""Hitchcock film"", it's an exceptionally good film that's very well directed with numerous touches that are characteristic of the great director's work.",Rebecca

This all leads up to a quite an awesome conclusion, where some layers are peeled off to find.. Well, more layers! This is quite an amazing little twisted tale. One of which I wasn't sure where on earth it was going, but after the De Winters get married and they move into Manderlay, the spectacular property which Mr De Winter lives on (and which Lars Von Trier named a dreadfully silly movie after) the movie then switches into high gear (and sometimes into camp, when Judith Anderson playing the wild house servant Mrs Danvers is around).

111,bobsgrock,Hitchcock's beginning into greatness.,9,5 May 2009,"There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was successful during his tenure as a British film maker who thrived on low-budget suspense pictures and was churning them out nearly every year. However, it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood, and along with famous producer David O. Selznick, he adapted Daphne du Maurier's classic book into a thrilling and tense story about obsession, death and the effects and memories we all take with us long after someone moves onto the next world.What makes this such an interesting picture is the fact that Hitchcock was able to adapt some new and ground-breaking ideas into the filming process which obviously improves the quality of the experience as well as usher in a whole new way to create movies. He storyboarded every scene, used deep-focus photography and edited the picture ""in camera,"" in other words only shooting what he wanted to see on the screen. This gave him a complete vision of what he wanted as well as kept the nosy Selznick's hands away from his product. What it leaves us today is spellbound, suspended and amazed at what he was able to do with a camera; in some ways 40 years ahead of its time. Though he would not receive as much credit as Orson Welles one year later with Citizen Kane, he nevertheless left behind a stirring story filled with complex and emotional people who bring us along on this strange and mysterious journey.The movie never would have been as great without an all-star cast, which Hitchcock had with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as the two lovers separated by the dead Rebecca's presence as well as supporting characters Judith Anderson as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and the slick and sneaky George Sanders. The narrative feels to bend a little in the final third as we are brought along to figure this dilemma out in a routine police investigation. Nevertheless, filled with dazzling images of Manderley, a completely convincing performance by the beautiful Fontaine and Hitchcock's ability to have Rebecca cast a shadow over the characters despite being dead, this is a classic not to be missed and one that needs multiple views before the mystery is cleared up. Even then, perhaps all will not be revealed.",Rebecca

113,telegonus,English Gothic,9,2 December 2002,"Rebecca is a gorgeously mounted, opulent filming of Daphne du Maurier's runaway best-seller, and is at its core a Gothic romance of a high (but not that high) order. Joan Fontaine plays the unnamed, callow young woman who fulfills what seems to be every woman's dream, which is marrying a brooding, handsome English aristocrat. As her husband, Laurence Olivier glowers nobly, and while I wouldn't say that he throws away his lines, he does give the impression that he's better than his material he's given to work with, as indeed he is. Director Alfred Hitchcock, whose first American picture this was, is quite conservative in his approach, as this movie really ""belongs"" to producer David O. Selznick, who all but buried poor Hitch with his famous memos as to how he felt the film should be made. Given Selznick's exquisite taste, and the way the movie came out, his instincts were probably correct.The movie contains a secret, and here it departs considerably from the novel. I won't give it away, yet it's worth mentioning that the movie takes a turn toward the end that's such so astounding and unexpected that it actually works, making the picture surprisingly satisfying almost in spite of itself. Selznick was right after all.",Rebecca
114,marcin_kukuczka,Gothic Atmosphere and Sophisticated Characters,9,18 August 2013,"Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein ""evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty."" And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls ""facile and penetrating"" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin).The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story ""stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature"" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, ""allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres"" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to ""somewhat uncharacteristic works"" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie.(Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that ""it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama."" Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that ""cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again."" Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy.(Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, ""the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe."" Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that ""the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria."" But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, ""considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses"" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion.(Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as ""a second Mrs. De Winter"" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she ""emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca."" Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances.REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.",Rebecca
115,sharky_55,"I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.",7,9 July 2016,"The ghost of the late Rebecca de Winter is a constant presence in the haunted halls of Manderley, although we are never graced with her physical presence or even a still picture of her supposed great beauty. Nevertheless she is talked up as the absolute paragon of womanhood and femininity; mature, sophisticated, the most beautiful creature you could ever lay your eyes on. Joan Fontaine plays the opposite quite well - the naive, tittering little girl who could never compare to the first Mrs de Winter (at least in the eyes of Mrs Danvers), and yet Maxim seems to fall for him anyway. In a funny way, the twist does make sense; most of the resentment is from Mrs Danvers herself, eyeing needles her way as she dons what Rebecca made stunning and keeps her former bedroom in pristine condition, like an obsessive shrine. Hitchcock begins with an eerie statement; the ghost dominating a dream where she returns to the fated Manderley and drifts right through the gates (a clever trick with the camera) as though nothing will stop her from seeing that no woman ever replaces herself. Later the happily married couple mimic the same entrance through the gates and up the driveway, in pouring rain (never a good omen), although the soundtrack is stirringly romantic and attempting to convince us that all is well. Beneath the ground level class and sheen Hitchcock utilises the great Gothic archways and ominous shadows well. Through the soundtrack, a pair of double doors seem to almost speak directly to Fontaine, enticing her to unveil their secret. She is blonde, of course, and wears white, whilst the housekeeper is robed in pure black and has a face that is constructed from ivory, still, unmoving and emotionless. She is like Nosferatu the vampire himself. Unfortunately what the twist does, effectively, is render this all rather fruitless. Initially the entire atmosphere of the troubled Manderley estate is fraught with second guessing on both Fontaine and the audience's part. The visuals, soundtrack and performance all fight to wrest control of the mood; they contradict each other, they try to drown each other out. It's all wonderfully tense because we are alongside Fontaine trying to make sense of the whole affair of Rebecca. But the twist makes it all unironic. Everything becomes played straight - Maxim is just a troubled gentlemen, and the romance becomes sappy and sentimental; see how they make eyes at each other during what should be a pivotal trial scene, and later as Hitchcock holds on their kiss and embrace. Still, it does make for some great moments, chiefly one where Maxim recounts the fateful night with Rebecca. The camera becomes one with his conscience here; it imagines Rebecca on the bed, it rises to meet her eye-level as she gets up, and you can almost visualise her strutting and sneering around the room with a cigarette as the camera swings around. But isn't the former much more frightening? From that moment on, the film loses all of its psychological mystery and appeal, and it is only a matter of time before the happy reconciliation of husband and second wife. Hitchcock would later perfect this with a little film called Vertigo.",Rebecca
116,gftbiloxi,Hitchcock Meets Hollywood,8,3 June 2005,"Hitchcock himself was dismissive of REBECCA. In some respects it is easy to see why: the film is very much a lavish Hollywood romance; the nature of the story offers little room for the director's legendary talents; and censorship issues of the day effectively prevented the film from touching upon the most startling plot twist of the original novel. Worse still, Hitchcock found himself strangled by producer David O. Selznick, who was legendary for control-freak attitude. And yet, in spite of all these problems--and in spite of Hitchcock's own feelings about the film itself--REBECCA remains one of Hitchcock's most praised and widely admired films, and with good reason.The film is perhaps Hitchcock's single finest exercise in pure atmosphere. Every frame manages to convey a combination of misty romance and increasing emotional disquiet, and the look feeds beautifully into the famous story of a mousy second wife who becomes increasingly insecure about her wealthy husband's seemingly perfect and mysteriously dead first wife, Rebecca. The script is remarkably strong, and the cast, with Dame Judith Anderson offering a truly legendary performance as Mrs. Danvers, is particularly fine. Everything about the film is dreamy, slickly produced, and expertly executed, and even the most jaded viewer will likely be drawn into the film's quietly mounting sense of insecurity and paranoia.If this film had been made by any one except Hitchcock, I would have given it a full ten stars--but Hitchcock would quickly break Selznick's control and he would go on to make a host of still greater films, often working without a producer of any kind at all. REBECCA is an exceptional film, but it pales beside the director's later work.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Rebecca
117,johno-21,A great film,9,28 February 2006,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."" So begins the Daphne de Maurier novel and so begins this film wonderfully adapted from it by Phillip MacDonald and brought to life by Director Alfred Hitchcock of the strange days of the life of the second Mrs. de Winter. Despite what it says here on IMDb about Hitchcock winning an Oscar for Best Director for this film he did not. John Ford won for Grapes of Wrath. Hitchcock was nominated five times including for Rebecca but amazingly he never won a Best Director.This did win the Best Picture for 1940 which of course is the big award to win but it was otherwise shutout from it's 11 nominations. This is a fine film with a great cast of Joan Fontaine as the 2nd Mrs. de Winter along with leading man Laurence Olivier as her husband and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. The film's title character Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winters never appears in the movie except in a portrait. George Sanders, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Leo G. Carroll round out the fine cast. David O. Selznick showed with this film a preview of what great films would come from his studio in the 1940's following his monster hit the year before of Gone With The Wind and Hitchcock with this gave all a preview of what was to come from him. This is a beautifully done film and like the novel is now a classic. It's not as suspenseful as other Hitchcock films to come. It's sweeping landscapes and large interiors has the signature look of a Selznik produced film. I've seen this film several times and would rate it a 9.5 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.",Rebecca

119,dglink,Hitchcock & Selznick's Superb du Maurier Adaptation,10,6 April 2014,"""Last night I dreamed I went to Manderlay again..."" and so begins one of the most captivating films from Hollywood's golden era. A superb adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's best selling novel, ""Rebecca"" was Alfred Hitchcock's first American directorial assignment, although producer David O. Selznick's strong influence is evident. While lacking the color and historical spectacle of ""Gone with the Wind,"" Selznick's follow-up to his 1939 blockbuster shares lush production values, a thickly romantic atmosphere, and flawless performances with its illustrious predecessor. Both classics were adapted from popular novels, and both won Academy Awards for Best Picture.Du Maurier's well known mystery centers on a never-seen, but exquisitely beautiful and admired woman, Rebecca, who dies tragically before the story begins; however, she casts a dark shadow over her husband, his young second wife, and Manderlay, a stately seaside estate in Cornwall. The mystery-romance unfolds before George Barnes's Oscar-winning camera work, which emphasizes velvety blacks, window-cast shadows, and rainy reflections on a grandfather clock. Franz Waxman's lush score weaves its own web throughout the film with an appropriate mix of romantic themes and suspense.In front of the camera, Hitchcock drew memorable performances throughout. Sporting a mustache and a touch of grey, Laurence Olivier embodies the handsome Cornish aristocrat, Maxim de Winter; smooth, cultured, refined, and harboring a dark secret. With a voice born for sarcasm, George Sanders steals his scenes in a snide, cunning performance as Rebecca's ""favorite"" cousin. Mrs. Danvers ranks among cinema's most beloved villains, and Judith Anderson is cold, impassive, and riveting. Also called ""Danny"" in a sly allusion to her lesbian infatuation with the title character, Anderson excels in a restrained, yet hypnotic scene, where she fondles Rebecca's furs and caresses her lingerie; the actress says everything that the Production Code forbade about Danver's relationship with Rebecca. Florence Bates is another scene stealer as Mrs. Van Hopper, Joan Fontaine's employer; selfish, self absorbed, catty, and unforgettable. In support, Selznick sprinkled in such veterans as Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, and Leo G. Carroll to fill out an exceptional cast.Although easily overlooked among the bounty of rich performances and skilled thespians, Joan Fontaine's portrayal of the second Mrs. de Winter is exquisite throughout. Still in her early 20's, Fontaine's subtle growth from shy insecure travel companion, dominated by her overbearing employer, to self-assured supportive wife is masterful and never calls attention to itself; on a subsequent viewing, fans should focus on Fontaine throughout and marvel. While Fontaine grows as a woman, she also becomes closer to Olivier as the story unfolds; initially, Olivier kisses her chastely on the forehead, retains a distance between them, but, as the secrets spill, Olivier reaches out to her and, eventually, they kiss on the lips.Hitchcock's final image in ""Rebecca"" foreshadows that in ""Citizen Kane."" A silk pillow embroidered with an ""R"" is consumed by flames; a year later, Orson Welles ended his masterwork with a sled emblazoned ""Rosebud"" also engulfed in flames. Like the Welles classic, ""Rebecca"" is a timeless film that bears repetition. Despite familiarity with plot and ending, the film is like an old friend, and a return to Manderlay is always cozy, comfortable, and welcome.",Rebecca

This film was Hitchcock's first Hollywood venture and his first collaboration with David O. Selznick, a producer with whom he would grow to have a volatile relationship for many years.  It is also the first and only Hitchcock film to win a Best Picture Oscar. 
This film is excellent in many ways, but the beauty lies in the performances of the excellent cast.  Joan Fontaine was expertly chosen in the role of the nervous and unsure `second Mrs. de Winter' and the always superb Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the volatile and conflicted Maxim de Winter.  While George Sanders is always delightfully smug and droll in his supporting role, the real star of this film is the psychotic Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson.  Her obsession with Rebecca manifests itself into instant hatred and scorn for Maxim's new wife, and Anderson's both understated and at times over-the-top performance is fantastic.As with many films of this era, the subtle jokes and dialogue are extremely dated and laugh-worthy, and the melodrama is palpable at times, but this film is a certified classic and in this reviewer's opinion, Hitchcock's best film until Shadow of a Doubt was released in 1943.  --Shelly",Rebecca

In that particular category, it is one of the best efforts, but if we talk about his movies in general, this isn't in the same league.The best about this film is the fine visuals and especially the Manderley mansion and respective scenario. It actually starts pretty good but as it runs it becomes a merely average story (although there are good moments here and there) and therefore a little boring. Plus, it is also a tad long.Having that said, practically the whole film is accompanied by lovely background music. Laurence Olivier has a great acting as the short-tempered Maxim de Winter. A very pretty Joan Fontaine acts very well as Maxim's second wife whose name is not once mentioned or revealed. Judith Anderson's acting as the malicious and jealous Mrs. Danvers is very believable. There is one particular scene which is haunting because Mrs. Danvers is taking Maxim's wife to the window as she speaks and both her words and attitude are suspect - they almost suggest that she's advising her to kill herself. George Sanders as Jack is great too.The title character is dead and her presence is only as a haunting memory. But as nearly the whole movie talks about her, she is a permanent presence, as a memory and psychologically.The ending is the worst part. It wasn't an especially good ending. A shame, this movie starts so promising that it seemed that it was gonna be pretty good.",Rebecca

126,tonypeacock-1,The beginning of the Hollywood film noir?,8,30 April 2020,"Alfred Hitchcock directed classic from 1940. The great director's first Hollywood production that earned him surprisingly his sole Best Picture Academy Award.The film is based on the novel Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier a classic story that is brought to the big screen in a great adaptation by the master of suspense stories Hitchcock along with the studio backing of producer David O. Selznick who had produced another screen success Gone With The Wind the year previously.The film has 4 great elements. 1 - Casting. Laurence Olivier plays English aristocrat Maxim de Winter who owns a lavish property in Cornwall, U.K. called Manderley. de Winter is haunted by the mysterious death of his first wife Rebecca de Winter the year previously in an apparent drowning accident at sea. de Winter begins the film vacationing In Monte Carlo where he meets a young and nameless female companion to the rude Edythe Van Hopper. The young companion is played by Joan Fontaine. In a whirlwind romance Maxim and Fontaine's character engage to marry and later return to the de Winter residence Manderley. It is here that the story develops as the staff of Maxim especially servant Mrs. Danvers have an air of suspicion (unfairly comparing her to the beloved Rebecca) about the second Mrs. de Winter. Mrs. Danvers is played excellently by Judith Anderson and as the film develops gets more nasty and evil not only in her demeanor but her actions.2 - Photography. The film is shot in the standard black and white of the time but has the haunting look especially of Manderley meant to portray the spirit of Rebecca.3 - Direction. Hitchcock himself is the master of building up suspense before the foul play ending. So what is the foul play ending? Of course it is to do with Rebecca's death. It becomes apparent that the original verdict of cause of death could be wrong. Hitchcock keeps the viewer glued to the story throughout!4 - Production values - Hollywood offered Hitchcock an elevation in the production values of his films from the pretty mediocre level he had enjoyed in England. The special effects in this film include fantastic miniatures of Manderley. Special effects became a trademark of Hitchcock films in later years. Selznick's contribution towards the production is obvious and rightly earned the film a Best Picture Oscar. The only element missing from this film is lack of humour. The gloomy novel put paid to that. However the performances of the cast make up for it. The mood swings of Mr. de Winter could have been an insight into the demands of Olivier backstage? Made in 1940 the film is perhaps at the beginning of the film noir glut of films that Hollywood released in the 1940s?",Rebecca
127,Igenlode Wordsmith,"It's clever, but is it Art?",8,31 December 2005,"The tragedy of this film -- at least to anyone who knows the book, which is naturally a self-selecting and biased group -- is that the pacing is terribly uneven. It's almost as if the studio suddenly noticed that the picture was going to run twenty minutes over its allocated slot, and ordered the final scenes to be cut to the bone and run together at breakneck speed. The result, for me, is a curiously unsatisfying finale; why go to the trouble of altering the original plot to ensure that Maxim's wife is in the house when it is set on fire, for example, and then cut the sequence so quickly that there is no real element of suspense whatsoever? It's a tragedy precisely because the film was potentially so good. I've seen stage adaptations of the same story, and they totally failed to catch the book's mingled atmosphere of sunlit happiness and suspense -- the taint of Rebecca reaching up from the past to destroy the innocence of the present. Right up until the moment when the heroine descends the staircase, however, this version is almost flawless; the comedy, the romance, the crippling social humiliations, the country-house interiors, the monstrous Mrs van Hopper, kind and tactless Beatrice, insinuating Jack Favell, aloof Maxim... and, of course, Joan Fontaine, who might have been made for the part. I had no mental image at all of what the book's heroine looked like -- but the moment I saw Miss Fontaine I knew she was absolutely right. Arguably she is too beautiful, almost distractingly so at times; but her style, her body language, the schoolgirl simplicity of her face, are all exactly fitting to the mood of Daphne du Maurier's unnamed narrator.My problems with the film start when it tries to become a thriller. Having retained the book's long build-up to the revelations, Hitchcock then suddenly seems to lose interest in their results: Maxim's fury and his wife's misery over the Caroline de Winter costume are barely glimpsed, and the nightmarish build-up of the book to the gallows, from this point on until the final revelations in London -- and their totally unexpected outcome -- is translated instead into a series of short sequences that convey little atmosphere beyond the bare mechanics of the plot. The scenes where the heroine is caught 'trespassing' in her predecessor's bedroom and breaks down are overwrought and unconvincing, one of the rare occasions where Joan Fontaine puts a foot wrong.However, the scenes during the inquest and in the inn afterwards -- as Favell's little blackmail attempt misfires -- are an example of effective adaptation, and the role-reversal scene between Maxim and his wife is both touching and poignant; she has paid for the newly-acquired strength to support him with the loss of the youth and freshness that first brought them together. From now on the marriage will stand or fall on the bond of mature affection they have managed to create. It is precisely because the film *can* succeed where it allows itself space that I find the cramped outcome so frustrating! A major problem for Hitchcock in moving to America was, of course, the Hollywood requirement to tone down the central plank of the plot: the fact that Maxim was genuinely guilty of Rebecca's murder. This weakens the whole 'confession' scene, since covering up an accidental death is scarcely a crime worthy of such moral agonising, and undermines the critical moment of revelation: instead of the simple and terrible ""I shot her, but she was still smiling"", we get ""I hit her, she looked almost pleased, I was about to hit her again, when she fell down through the open door and hit her head on some old ship's tackle which was lying around"". As a means of suicide, inciting your husband to punch you in the jaw seems less than encouraging...Oddly enough I was rather disappointed in Mrs Danvers, who didn't seem as sinister as I'd been expecting; she is polite and unenthusiastic, but doesn't betray the seething jealousy and ill-will the script ascribes to her. Since none of this is ever explicit, but only her unhappy mistress' perceptions, I suppose it's hard to convey -- and after all, if she were as openly witch-like and malicious as the girl sees her, other people would have noticed. I wasn't entirely won over by Laurence Olivier either, as he allows a slight air of boredom to creep in now and then -- the actor bored with the part, alas, rather than the character paralysed with ennui. By and large he is adequate to what is mainly a shuttered role; from time to time, as Maxim opens out, he is excellent, but I did get the impression on occasion that Olivier would rather have been doing something else.This is really a one-woman show, with all the other performers as supporting actors. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar for which she was at least nominated, and her portrayal of a gauche girl's growing maturity is the luminous centre of the film -- which makes it all the more unbalancing when the deliberate choice is made to strip her out of the plot at the end! The story has been all about her reactions, and the novel remains so: but in Hitchcock's finale we have the facts alone without any reaction at all -- Olivier underplaying as elsewhere -- and the unintended result is to rob vital sequences of their emotional depth. It remains a clever plot, but clever on its own isn't quite enough.",Rebecca
128,perfectbond,Patience is a virtue with this film,8,4 March 2003,"With Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca, the viewer's patience is rewarded once he or she has allowed the 'Master of Suspense' to set all the plot elements and back story in place before proceeding to the main thrust of the story. Regarding the acting, Joan Fontiane is absolutely believable as the young woman trying to discover and live up to the legend of Rebecca. Olivier has to convey a very complicated set of  emotions, often conflicting, and he succeeds in doing so. All the character actors whom I recognize (eg. Nigel Bruce) from other films are picture perfect in Rebecca as well. To me however the actor who leaves the most indelible impression is the actress who plays Ms. Danvers. She really comes across as loyal to her former mistress and tormenting towards the new lady of the house. I should also mention that all other aspects of the production are more than competent, especially the haunting voiceover at the start of the film. All in all, great classic picture, 8/10.",Rebecca
129,elvircorhodzic,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.""",10,22 May 2016,"I can not help feeling that the hostility between the producer and director on the one hand and the main actors on the other hand resulted in such a unique and excellent film. REBECCA is a mystery drama with elements of Gothic style that captivates completely. The director deliberately provoked gloomy atmosphere on the set. Despite that the actors are perfectly done their job.The beginning of the film is reminiscent of a typical romance or ""Cinderella"" story in which a little bit of stink. After the wedding story becomes very anxious mystery with a strong dramaturgy and excellent acting. Set design is incredibly fit with the atmosphere. Emotion and cold alternating. Despite repeated plots this movie I would not describe as a thriller. Rebecca is a film about violence against relations and ties with the past. Voltage, typical in Hitchcock's creative work, there is more than just entering the Manderley, not wane even after the last scene.Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter is a common companion and plain, simple girl who becomes the mistress of a huge estate and wife of a man of high lineage. It becomes Mrs. De Winter, but how to do it, when the first Mrs. de Winter still there? Fontaine probably had no idea how her mood affect the perfection of character. In Hollywood she entered through the front door.Laurence Olivier as Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley is habitually cold and sharp. In the second part of the film his emotions rise to the surface. Olivier is certainly one of the few actors who make a small play in conflict with his own emotions.Perhaps the animosity was as good a reason of attraction between Olivier and Fontaine on the screen.Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, housekeeper of Manderley is the perfect villain for this opportunity. The terrifying stillness, cold look, lack of emotion, facial expression that suggests hatred etc. Hitch is through this character touched two controversial topics psychological violence by women and lesbianism.The film is little you can complain about, one that nicely rounded whole, diverse genres, accompanied by fine music theme by Franz Waxman. With Laurence Olivier in the title role, a triple Oscar winner and founder of the British National Theatre, Hitchcock as a director and an intriguing storyline. Rebecca is absolutely brilliant film with shades of threatening the past, violent and tragic present and an uncertain future.",Rebecca
130,FloatingOpera7,Films Of The 40's: Rebecca,10,12 May 2006,"Rebecca (1940): Starring Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, Florence Bates, Melville Cooper, Leo G. Carroll...Director Alfred Hitchcock, Screenplay Phillip MacDonald ""Last Night, I dreamed I went to Mandalay again""..........Based on Daphne Du Maurier's best-selling mystery novel, this film represents Alfred Hitchcock's earliest cinematic work, devoid of any disturbing psychological aspects or straight-out terror, such as his later works, from ""Psycho"" , ""The Birds"" and onward. Instead, we have a well-made movie whose mystery and suspense depends mostly on the haunting aspects of the cinematography and the premise: Widower Maxim De Winter (ably performed by the one and only Laurence Olivier)cannot ignore his dark past and his dead wife Rebecca, whose shadow, memory and ""ghost"" still haunts the country estate of Mandalay. Nonetheless, he makes the mistake of remarrying again. After a brief romance, he marries a naive and social-climbing young woman (Joan Fontaine) who knows absolutely nothing of the dark secrets contained within Mandalay and how strongly Wife No. 1 Rebecca has affected the lives of its occupants. Rebecca never appears in the film and remains only a mentioned character (though we do see what she looked like in a portrait). Judith Anderson, in a terrific performance, portrays Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper and Rebecca's most devoutly loyal friend and guardian. Mrs. Danvers resents Wife No. 2 and is openly hostile to her, claiming she can never be anything like the great Rebecca. The first part of the film can easily be mistaken for Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"", with its sprawling and haunting mansion and ""dark secret about the first wife"". But toward the end, the film takes on a different style - the courtroom drama. Even as such, the film is consistent and full of suspense, keeping us to the edge of our seats (I imagine audiences at the time were). If not quite faithful to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, it represents cinema of old Hollywood, which was full of great acting and great drama, the likes of which we don't see today. These actors live their roles, their British background in theater serves them well. This is also Hitchcock at his most versatile. He creates a powerful film, and one whose scenes are still ingrained in people's memories, such as the scene in which Joan Fontaine dresses up, unknowingly, like Rebecca to a costume ball and upsets the guest and Maxim and the final scenes, in which Mrs. Danvers, in a fit of rage after Wife No. 2 is found innocent in the trial and will indeed become the next mistress of Mandalay, sets fire to the home. A close-up within the burning house reveals a burning bed, then a burning pillow, then a burning single letter R. Rebecca casts a powerful spell and this is one of the greater mystery films of 1940.

I'm sorry.Our male hero alternates between making his love interest cry and heckling her for trying to please him. He proposes by mentioning it in a flippant and sort of insulting manner from the next room. Our female hero tries so hard to please everyone that she's constantly excusing herself and breaking down.Sure, people like this exist in the real world. But this is not a Leaving Las Vegas story of crippled people... it's portrayed as a true love story. I find it sickening. These days, we look up to strong women, and we certainly don't want people (of any gender) constantly saying thing that are mean.To add on top of this, I didn't feel any chemistry between the characters... declaring their love felt quite sudden, I didn't feel any real chemistry about the hero's angst about his dead wife... the whole film just seemed contrived. The scenes where the heroine isn't quite ready for rich living become repetitive, like beating a dead horse. It would feel preachy if only there were some message to preach. Finally, I'm sorry to say it, but cinematography and things like color have been in films for a long time now.This film left me even more confused than Chasing Amy and I couldn't get all the way through it.

134,oOoBarracuda,Rebecca,6,10 January 2017,"Being an avid fan of Alfred Hitchcock's films, I should rank Rebecca high on my list. It was the only of Hitch's films to win an Academy Award, winning Best Picture in 1940. However, much like North by Northwest, another fan favorite, I don't care for Rebecca. Almost everything that makes a film Hitchcock-esque seems to be missing in Rebecca. The film is full of imposing camera angles and the wonderful lighting I adore in Hitchcock pictures, but his standard care with which his narrative is formed seemed completely different. Starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, Rebecca tells the story of a recently married couple and the self-consciousness experienced by the new bride who cannot seem to escape the shadow of her new husband's deceased first wife. 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) a wealthy man living in a sprawling estate meets a quiet, timid young woman who he instantly falls in love with and decides to marry. The new Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine) soon learns that there is a spirit hanging over her new home, that spirit belongs to the first wife of her new husband, Rebecca. Mrs. de Winter soon becomes fully aware just how much Rebecca's memory has engulfed her husband's thoughts. There are even rooms in her home that haven't been changed since Rebecca was there. Mrs. de Winter clashes with the staff in the home, as it seems everyone is longing for the first Mrs. de Winter.Rebecca seems less like a Hitchcock film than the sole comedy he made Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The audience wasn't thrown into the suspense like in Strangers on a Train, the tone wasn't set like it was in Psycho, it was a diligent narrative that seemed more like a John Ford film than a Hitchcock picture. The cinematography was brilliant, and more than deserving of top prize that year for George Barnes. The film itself was fine, just not at all what I expected from Hitchcock's only Oscar winner.",Rebecca

Very unpleasant types: Hecate van Hopper, Maximum de Winter, Deathly Danvers, Flakey Favell Foulenough, combine to bully a sweet, pretty, innocent, young girl with no name. But she slowly grows strong, takes Maxim in hand, and in the end sees off the others. This all takes place at Manderley, not Mandalay. Joan Fontaine is gorgeous.Florence Bates, as van Hopper, has a vicious Hitchcockian way with a cigarette, a stubbing technique later adopted by Jessie Royce Landis in To Catch a Thief. Was this another way Hitchcock decided later to repeat himself ? Just a thought. I don't think he showed up personally in Rebecca.An unusual Hitchcock perhaps, because it is heavy on atmosphere, somewhat reminiscent of Edgar Allan P, and although there is a modicum of suspense, it is slightly flat in that department. It's almost as if Alfred was feeling his way with his first film under American skies. Rebecca's death throes, her smile of satisfaction as she expires, reminds me of Claggart, although the film of Billy Budd was not produced until 22 years later.

I understand the character of the lead is supposed to be someone who's unsophisticated and naive but Joan Fontaine plays the part like a scared puppy who piddled in the corner of the room and is about to be found out. We are hammered over and over and over again with that performance.I'm watching her simper to the point that she comes across as an idiot and it is starting to wear thin. Okay, we get it, she's not from a rich background, she feels somewhat intimidated, she's a little worried about pleasing her husband, but come on. I mean an hour of this?Like others have said, there's simply no chemistry between the two leads.The movie score is overdone as somebody else mentioned and I agree. It's just constant loud strings of schmaltz.Everyone is rude to her. Everyone insults her to her face, including her husband and somewhere along the line most of us would get a backbone and fight back out try to make this movie interesting instead of 80 minutes of someone looking like they're about to break into tears.Finally, after way too many minutes setting this up, the film finally picks up.

141,roghache,"Marvelous, if not quite faithful, adaptation of du Maurier's thriller",9,12 June 2006,"This black and white classic is generally a wonderful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel, and despite a number of liberties taken, I compliment Hitchcock on this brilliant thriller. The story revolves around a shy young woman who, having no family herself, is forced to serve as a paid companion to an obnoxious socialite named Mrs. Van Hopper, vacationing in Monte Carlo. While there, she meets a handsome but abrupt English widower named Maxim de Winter, who is staying at the same hotel and escorts her about. The innocent young woman is swept away by this mature and mysterious man, though she dares not reveal her emotions, given her lowly social position. Though there is strangely little romance involved, Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. The two wed and honeymoon abroad, then Maxim brings his bride home to his grand English country estate, Manderley. At Manderley the insecure, nameless second Mrs. de Winter is emotionally haunted by Maxim's first wife, the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Though Rebecca drowned many months earlier in a boating accident, her memory seems all too fresh in the minds of Maxim's sister Beatrice, his servants, and indeed Maxim himself. The haunting R's are everywhere...on the table linens, the lacy handkerchief, the address book, the dressing gown case. We never see so much as a photograph of the mysterious Rebecca, but her lingering presence is felt through both her possessions and the recollections of others. The domineering and foreboding housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, was personally devoted to Rebecca and exhibits unconcealed disdain for the new intruding and inadequate mistress of Manderley. When Danny shows Maxim's new bride the bizarre West Wing shrine she keeps to her former mistress, it seems as though Rebecca herself might walk in at any moment and use the nightgown and hairbrushes meticulously laid out for her.For me, the quality of any adaptation of this novel depends upon the persona of the second Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine is sympathetic and endearing in the role, suitably shy and bewildered, but this actress is far too pretty! Maxim's new bride should be unglamorous, even plain and dowdy. Primarily for this reason, I prefer the 1979 serial version which has a perfectly cast Mrs. de Winter. However, Laurence Olivier is superb as the mature, sophisticated, often brooding, and occasionally rather nasty Maxim de Winter. The most masterful performance is definitely given by Judith Anderson as the dark, sinister, and menacing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, whose chilling stare dominates much of the tale.Maxim's business agent and friend, Frank Crawley, is faithfully portrayed as a quiet, kind, and competent individual who is unfailingly loyal to Maxim. Beatrice is suitably forthright, Giles foolish and chubby, the servants appropriately formal, and Jack Favell utterly despicable. Mrs. Van Hopper is wonderfully captured as the rude, chattering, condescending, and altogether obnoxious socialite of the novel, fawning over the aristocracy. Her character is necessary in order to cement sympathy for her paid companion and her social situation. I found the Monte Carlo scenes well presented, though could hardly picture du Maurier's gauche heroine so comfortably at ease dancing with Maxim.The sets especially are brilliantly done, depicting Maxim's grand English country manor. I felt that I was literally standing in Manderley's grand hall with its incredible staircase. Library, morning room, dining room, upstairs galleries, Rebecca's bedroom, and boathouse are all perfectly captured. The Cornish coastal scenes with the haunting fog enshrouded sea are portrayed in typical eerie Hitchcock fashion. Even Jasper the spaniel is perfect!*** WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS *** According to the Hays Code, no movie could depict a murderer in a sympathetic light so the screenwriters were forced to cast Rebecca's death as an accident. Fortunately, I was aware of this in advance so managed the altered portrayal of events quite well. However, it certainly changed the flavour of this sinister tale. As appealing as the dewy eyed Joan Fontaine is, Hitchcock falls short in capturing Mrs. de Winter. He changes completely her role in the Manderley costume ball preparations by indicating that SHE herself is taking charge. In the book, Mrs. de Winter feels utterly inadequate and useless in these preparations as the domineering Mrs. Danvers organizes menus, flowers, music, and invitations. The worst outrage is his failure to depict the complete transformation of this awkward, insecure young woman, initially so ill at ease as mistress of Manderley and timid with the servants. Once she is assured of Maxim's love and no longer haunted by Rebecca, the novel's Mrs. de Winter immediately becomes a confident lady of the manor, scolding a maid and even taking on Mrs. Danvers. Yes, there IS one movie scene where she DOES defy the housekeeper, declaring, 'I am Mrs. de Winter now'. However, it's ALL WRONG, defeating its purpose by occurring BEFORE Maxim reveals the truth. Hitchcock is certainly a master of the thriller but totally missed the point here. The ball scenes are shortened due to time constraints, some of the later settings altered, and liberties taken with the conclusion. The novel's Mrs. de Winter is driving home from London with Maxim, rather than remaining behind at Manderley during the fire. The lovey dovey embrace with the implied 'happily ever after' ending is unfaithful to the book. Neither at the beginning nor elsewhere is the viewer ever informed that the de Winters are currently living abroad in obscure hotels on the Continent in self imposed exile. However, for those less concerned with accuracy to the novel, this movie is a haunting and engrossing romantic thriller with an extremely sympathetic heroine.",Rebecca

While I'm not sure I would rate this his best picture, there is so much to love here if you are a fan of Classic Film.There is an unforgettable opening sequence with fog and trees and crashing waves. The cinematography here is some of the finest I have ever seen. It also won a much deserved Oscar for Cinematography. There is a stunning dream sequence that is also very well done. All the filming creates the perfect mood for a Gothic tale of romance and tragedy. One thing Hitch was the best at was creating mood and tension and this movie highlights his skill perfectly. He accomplishes this through fantastic cinematography and direction that capitalizes on the use of shadows and tense angles, as well as a great mood-setting musical score. The lighting effects are also used with great skill.Fontaine is perfect as the nervous, insecure new bride. Her acting doesn't have a single insincere note in the whole of it. I understand Hitchcock helped achieve this superb performance out of a relatively young and inexperienced performer by telling her Olivier despised her because his wife, Vivien Leigh, lost the role to her. Hitch also told her the rest of the cast hated her as well. Can you imagine how insecure this would make a young, inexperienced actress? Olivier is at the prime of his physical beauty here, and does a superb job of handling the various depths of his character as they are revealed. Mrs. Danvers is enough to send shivers down your spine - what a creepy woman.Parts of the movie do seem to drag a little slow. And it seems to run long as well.

Based on my own enjoyment of it, I'd rate this film an 8 out of 10.Please bear in mind that this is one of the slower Hitchcock films. Until its plot accelerates toward its end, it spends much of its running length as a methodically paced, brooding Gothic romance and mystery. It's also a psychological thriller, and you can tell that Hitchcock is working to translate onto the screen its character-focused source novel. (I haven't read Daphne du Maurier's eponymous 1938 book.)""Rebecca's"" final act brings the viewer into familiar Hitchcock territory with some interesting surprises. What I liked best about seeing the director's style, however, was his trademark sharp characters and dialogue - with both heroes and villains sparring in a dry-witted and rapid-fire fashion. It's something you don't often see today. I don't think all old movies are like this - some of the ""classics"" I've been recommended are absolutely vapid. But Hitchcock treated his viewer as intelligent adults, and I think it's part of the reason why people love him.",Rebecca
146,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,10,19 April 2021,"Cheerio from my local.The Outstanding Production (now called Best Picture) Oscar debate still rages after all these years. In one corner: Rebecca, the winner. In the other: The Grapes of Wrath. For me, The Philadelphia Story is the winner, simply because I enjoy that film more than the others. It's a fun movie buff debate; each film stands on its own and is mandatory viewing for anyone who enjoys old films. They're all Ten Star films.In this, Joan Fontaine (as Mrs. De Winter) doing her best Oliva de Havilland impression (those two sisters could do the face of anguish like no other), is a common girl who married an aristocrat, Laurence Olivier (as George Fortescue Maximilian ""Maxim"" de Winter). Covering the plot is pointless - and covering the two leads acting ability equally so.What does deserve a mention is Judith Anderson (as Mrs. Danvers), the manipulative Nurse Ratchet of the estate Mandalay. One scene - probably the most famous - is her encouraging Mrs. De Winter to hurl herself out an open window and on the rocks below killing herself. It's shocking; she plays the villain perfectly.This tense scene is immediately followed by the biggest coincidence in movie history (okay, exaggeration...but c'mon); where divers find the boat of Rebecca and her body...what odds! It's groan inducing even now...but that body had to turn up for the third act.Regardless of that small quibble...this film is gorgeous B&W, perhaps a bit too long and few dialog heavy moments (notably, when Maxim is telling his wife the truth about Rebecca).High Recommend.",Rebecca

148,dr_clarke_2,"Enjoyable, but not Hitchcock's finest work",6,6 June 2020,"Rebecca is notable for being Alfred Hitchcock's first American film, and his only film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Given that latter point, it's perhaps ironic that he would later go on to make much better films: Rebecca, despite its reputation, is not his finest work.
Rebecca is closely based on Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same name, and sees Joan Fontaine's otherwise unnamed second Mrs de Winter meet and marry rich widow Maxim de Winter, only to discover that the shadow of his deceased first wife Rebecca hangs over their marriage. Part romance and part psychological thriller, the story sees the second Mrs de Winter - through whom the plot is focalised - gradually discover the truth about Rebecca's death.
The problem with the plot is that it changes direction twice, resulting in an uneven feel to the film. The first half sees the second Mrs de Winter meet Maxim, fall in love, get married, and then find herself somewhat lost in his huge mansion Manderley, which is metaphorically haunted by the spectre of Rebecca. The plot shifts halfway through as we start to discover the truth about what happened to her, and then shifts again for the final quarter, as it transpires that Maxim actually hated his first wife and he ends up in the familiar Hitchcock territory of a man desperately trying to clear his name in the face of wrongful accusations about Rebecca's death. All of which makes the film feel top heavy, with a padded first half and a second half that suddenly introduces new characters, most notably George Sander's caddish Jack Favell.
The other problem here is the characterisation. The screenplay is credited to Robert E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison, with adaptation by Philip MacDonald and Michael Hogan, and the involvement of four writers (plus, technically, du Maurier) is perhaps why it is less focused than it could have been. The film's main protagonist the second Mrs de Winter is quite nervous, insecure and basically rather wet during the first half, but suddenly finds new reserves of confidence and determination once she discovers the truth about Rebecca; despite a strong performance from Joan Fontaine, this means she never quite rings true. Similarly, Laurence Olivier's Maxim is by turns cold, warm, distant and vulnerable as the story demands and thus feels less like a real person and more like a function of the plot. Likewise, icy housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who gradually and subtly undermines and persecutes the second Mrs de Winter, suddenly decides to burn Manderley down at the end and kill herself in the process (possibly accidentally) purely out of spite, which feels like a step too far for the character.
But despite these faults, there is much to enjoy and admire here. Hitchcock's characteristic directorial flare is apparent throughout, bringing an appropriately Gothic feel to the film which has aged well. Right from opening scenes, George Barnes' award winning cinematography impresses: the second Mrs de Winter's first view of Manderley is through a rain-sodden windscreen, and after the wide-angled, deep-focus shots of the French Riviera scenes, close-ups and other techniques at Manderley make the excellent sets seem oppressive, whilst at the same time enormous and labyrinthine. Franz Waxman's score - added in by producer Selznick during editing - is a bit intrusive at times, but for the most part is memorably atmospheric as the mood of the film darkens. And whatever the flaws of the characterisation, the acting is superb: there's a lengthy scene in which Maxim reveals the truth about Rebecca, and which consists largely of melodramatic dialogue: Olivier's performance and Hitchcock's direction make it tense and absorbing. Judith Anderson is well cast as the intimidating Mrs Danvers, as is George Sanders as Favell and Florence Bates as Mrs. Van Hopper, the second Mrs De Winter's battleaxe of an employer.
Overall then, Rebecca is perhaps not as a good as its reputation would suggest. Nevertheless, like most Hitchcock films it is worth watching, and is significant for bringing the director to America, where as history has proved, he would go on to make some of his very best films.",Rebecca
149,ozthegreatat42330,A giant of a film in a time of great classics.,10,12 April 2007,"This excellent and moody film by novelist Daphne Du Maurier, under the masterful direction of Alfred Hitchcock won a best picture Oscar in an era of great pictures. Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the somber, brooding Max De Winter, and Joan Fontaine epitomized vulnerability as Mrs De Winter. Judith Evans was daunting as the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers and George Sanders brought a fresh presence as the cousin of the late and lamented Rebecca. The black and white feature is dark an mysterious and perfectly suited to the story. Hitchcock would go on to make many other excellent thriller and mystery stories, but to my mind none of them hold a candle to this one.",Rebecca
150,zeekwunlau,A little thought,8,11 May 2020,"Mr. Maxim was very suspicious as soon as he appeared. He invited the hostess to travel, but his expression was so impatient and anxious. It seemed that he was not enjoying but what forced him to do these things. His posture was high, and the hostess was in him. The words are ""girls"", ""kids"", and the miserable life of the hostess, his angry temper at any time, I suspect that this is a blue beard-like character, the hostess's cautious flinch, but also her self-positioning ratio Since the hostess is more like a pet, she has to please the gentleman in order to qualify as the owner of this manor. When Maxim spoke of rebecca 's accident, he hated her instead of rebecca, the heroine 's eyes were the brightest in the show, it was a real joy, and it was different from the pleading with a pitiful smile. It was only after that that the heroine changed her direction of courageous growth. That was the source of her courage, whether she was accidentally killed or murdered. In the novel, it was murdered in the movie, but for the heroine, both murder and accident could only be Accidentally, a murderer is better than a husband who never forgets his ex-wife. Maxim was injured here in rebecca, so he subconsciously found the hostess who is completely opposite to r. The biggest advantage of the hostess is that she is different from the discordant upper class. Her clumsyness is her flash. It 's a pity. Yes, the hostess is a very adaptable person. I think about Stockholm, why there are more women with such a psychological state. In primitive tribes, women are used as reproductive resources. When this tribe loses, they only become the mothers of another tribe. In addition to being a loser, the male will die. The Lord had no choice about getting married. He was proposed by a wealthy husband and continued to live with the wife who made trouble. She chose the former so she naturally fell in love with the gentleman. Like behind a window in ""Back Window"", the sweet newlyweds live upstairs with their husbands who killed their wives and separated their corpses. They are in different periods of love, and the hostess will never be incompatible with the upper class. No one cares about her. Name, she will have a name and life like ""rebecca"" one day.From the current perspective, the level of suspense is not as good as that of the past, but the housekeeper's method is not a trick, but the fire burned everything in the Mandoli Manor. The last shot is the pillow embroidered with her initials in the rebecca room.",Rebecca
151,rollernerd,Slow and mediocre,5,28 March 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review is the romance mystery Rebecca (1940), which apparently won the Academy Award for Best Film. I have no idea why. There are so many brilliant Hitchcock flicks that should have won best picture but this film is definitely not one of them. I wont go into full detail of the plot so a quick summary is that a shy insecure poor young woman played by Hitchcock alum Joan Fontaine meets rich widowed Max de Winter played by the Shakespearean elite Laurence Olivier. Both fall in love and they quickly get married. He then brings her to his huge English estate called Manderley and soon the new wife quickly finds out that Max can't seem to get over his first wife whose name was Rebecca - yup she dead. And theres this weird possible evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers who loved the first wife, Rebecca - the one true Mrs. De Winter and doesn't want anyone to take her place. Interesting? It took me 4 or 5 times to get through this film. The funny thing is you do not know Fontaine's character who is the narrator in the beginning of the flick. The film is slow and mediocre and there are stale performances in particular from Olivier, I just couldn't see the engagement. Fontaine is the opposite, she is completely over-the-top especially when she yells out ""Maxim, Maximmmmm!!"" The chemistry between the two characters is horrible and awkward. The lady who plays Danvers does well in tormenting the new Mrs de Winter by showing her all the important things that belonged to the late Rebecca. But what really turned me off was the movie was wayyyy too slow and too long and some scenes felt repetitive especially when the flick takes small steps. Overall a letdown 5/10.",Rebecca

The story twists and turns, but the truth remains elusive. The suspense atmosphere and the rhythm of the story fully reflect the director's ability, from the beginning to the end exudes the unique charm that black and white old films cannot resist.Although the director said that his film was a failure, but in the end it got a great success, it should be because he asked too much of himself.

Because other films of this era are today available in technicolor and this one only in black and white although it seems technicolor might be preferable on a reissue the artful brilliance of the photography and editing in capturing the mood and setting of the novel display Hitchcock at his most brilliant. Judith Anderson, Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier, Nigel Bruce, George Sanders, Gladys Cooper and Florence Bates seem most memorable among the strong from top to bottom cast. The argument less of the story is filmed than in the two still available today on DVD remakes seems of less importance than a stunning film which visually and aurally holds your interest in total delight and enticement from beginning to end.",Rebecca
154,xan-the-crawford-fan,Dark atmosphere; fabulous film,8,10 October 2021,"An unnamed heroine (Joan Fontaine) meets the charming, and much older, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). After a quick courtship, Maxim brings his new bride back to his home of Manderly, but the spirit of his first wife, as well as one servant's- Mrs. Danvers- inability to forget Rebecca. But what really happened to her? Where did she go, and why are some people unwilling to forget, yet others not wanting to remember? Watch the film.It's not a thriller in the conventional sense- there's no threat, no one is trying to kill any of the main characters, no one is descending into mental illness. The film achieves its effect by having the spirit of the first Mrs. De Winter loom over the picture, largely and heavily. You never see any pictures of her on the walls, never see her in any flashbacks- yet she still dominates the picture. She is only mentioned by name, and her room is still preserved, but she creates an uneasy atmosphere.Judith Anderson, who played Mrs. Danvers, also adds to the uneasiness. Obsessed with the titular Rebecca, and unwelcoming towards the second Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine), she is cold and calculating, like a snake. She doesn't even blink. Laurence Olivier is also quite creepy as Maxim de Winter, which he isn't supposed to be, but as the film goes on, he becomes more likable. Joan Fontaine is much better here than any other film I've seen her in- she plays one of her usual meek and mild characters, but is more meek and mild than usual. I do feel that she overdid her character's patheticness in the beginning, but with some of the other characters present and her seeming inability to ever replace Rebecca, it is understandable and I don't mind it at all.Alfred Hitchcock directs the film very well, very skillfully, much better than he would direct some of his later, more highly regarded films, adding a Gothic touch to the romance/suspense without letting his actors descend into camp. As I mentioned above, the set design is very good, the house making one feel claustrophobic despite the large, Victorian-style rooms. I did feel that the film went on a bit too long, not that it overstayed its welcome, but rather that the courtship between Larry and Joan could have been shorter, as it didn't hold my attention very much. On the flip side, the ending is fabulous, and unexpected (even better if you don't read the spoilers), but what happened to Rebecca is different from the book to the movie- liked what happened in the book better, but this was the production code era, so they had to make that part moralistic.Overall, recommended, but it helps to get to know Joan Fontaine and Larry Olivier before watching- they're both acquired tastes. But this is one of Hitchcock's best.",Rebecca

To me, this is added virtue. Who ever heard of a dark, brooding Gothic melodrama having humour in it? This is a totally serious movie which was Hitchcock's first American movie. Thanks to the larger budget he got across the pond from David O. Selznick, he could build magnificent sets crammed with detail. The film is helped enormously no end by the cast, with a dream team that included Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce and C. Aubrey Smith.

157,MF210,Very Good Hitchcock film,9,19 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Rebecca is an earlier Hitchcock picture, it came out in 1940. It represents one of his best films in the 40s. It was worthy of its Best Picture and cinematography Oscar. The acting is great. Laurence Olivier gives a great performance but I feel he rushed his lines at one point. Some say this shows his character is nervous but I could barely understand him at one point. Joan Fontaine gives a brilliant, flawless performance, she should have won the oscar. Judith Anderson also should have won the oscar for supporting actress, she was very scary as Mrs. Danvers. The rest of the acting is good.
Hitchcock has made an atmospheric film here, but I believe he did better in the 40s. Make no mistake Rebecca is very good but he would do better in the near future. However, the screenplay is brilliant. Its wonderfully constructed and has solid dialogue. The Sets, Costumes, and Sets are brilliant. The problem I have with Rebecca is I think its starts to drag at one point. The scenes that are overlong are necessary but I was bored at one point. So I dont know how they would have cut them. Overall, Rebecca is a classic and definitely worth watching.",Rebecca
158,mgruebel,Hitchcock waxing,8,16 December 2013,"Rebecca is one of the transition films that took Hitchcock from his British period to his early US period. Joan Fontaine, who just died as I write this, really is someone to behold in this film. It is always amazing how Hitchcock starts with innocuous situation, like a young woman employed as company for an elderly lady, woven together with a chance encounter, and ends up with a tightening noose around his characters. He perfected this in Psycho, and in the late, lesser work Family Plot - which is still remarkable.As always, the suspense does not arise because the viewer is left in the dark about things the characters know. We discover the truth together with the main character, biting our knuckles.Judith Anderson deserves a special mention. Her contempt for Fontaine's character, the usurper of the dead Goddess she worshiped as head housekeeper, drips off the screen. In general, the acting by the female lead and her female antagonist is much stronger, the roles are much juicier, than the male lead (a very competent Olivier) and his antagonist. Hitchcock really was a woman's director, and it shows in this film.The sets are eerie, the costumes (by Edith Head? I don't recall for certain) perfect, even the letters that move the plot along are individualized in their handwriting.It's gorgeous to watch, and the ending satisfies, yet the details are so rich, it is worth seeing again after a few years.

159,dkncd,An English country estate with tension and not tedium,10,5 November 2007,"""Rebecca"" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a woman that marries a wealthy widower and settles in his considerable estate, only to find that the lingering memory of the man's first wife, Rebecca, hampers the couple's happiness. Stories about English country estates with a legion of servants can easily be bogged down and boring, but ""Rebecca"" proves exceptionally tense and interesting.Joan Fontaine is the ""second Mrs. de Winter"", who is attempting to overcome the resentment associated with filling a place of high social standing in the stead of the seemingly perfect ""Rebecca"". Fontaine makes the character enchanting and extremely sympathetic. Every slight to her character and moment of self-doubt is disconcerting to see. Laurence Olivier is as skilled as ever as the distressed ""Maxim"" de Winter and effectively creates an ambivalent character. Judith Anderson is very unnerving in every scene she is in as Mrs. Danvers.The story has an underlying mystery and various twists that make it interesting. The film's tension is built up masterfully with the help of its sharp dialogue. It is impressive the way the tension returns near the end just as it seems to vanish.

162,steven_torrey,A great HORRIBLE movie or a HORRIBLE great movie!,10,13 March 2016,"The very nature of this kind of suspense drama is to lead the audience on, oftentimes with misdirection, or heightened atmospherics (an unblinking Mrs. Danvers). Of all Hitchcock movies I have seen, this one seemed to actively present Director Hitchcock as 'Deus ex machina'. The whole film seemed so contrived and fake; a story should develop 'suis generis' while this one seemed to develop by directorial disposition. In the end, to my way of thinking, it just seemed klunky. And unbelievable. For Hitchcock, the audience has to be conned into believing the events are plausible, the story line is plausible; and for many Hitchcock films, that can be a stretch. For me the worst moment came when Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) dresses as the first Rebecca for a masquerade ball at the suggestion of Mrs. Danvers. Rebecca ended up then, at that point, looking like an idiot; she always seemed not especially bright as a character--and that single decision made her seem downright stupid. Further, an inquest--long after the death of a person--was one more instance of directorial interpolation. And Rebecca, upon hearing that she is, in reality, manipulated into being the 2nd Mrs. Rebecca de Winters, would have acted appropriately in demanding answers from her new spouse; instead, she turns to Mrs. Danvers, who is intended to look and be something of psycho-zombie for confirmation of details. Again, turning to the demonic Mrs. Danvers makes Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) look borderline idiotic, especially given that Rebecca is portrayed in the film as being terrified of this psycho-zombie.To me, in the end, the movie just didn't work. I gave it 10 stars--because either way it is great as a horrible movie or horrible as a great movie; an exercise and insight into how not to make movies, especially from a Director who mastered this genre with such brilliance by making the barely plausible--seem possible.",Rebecca
163,fletch5,Overappreciated,6,8 September 2000,"""Rebecca"" is often mentioned as one of Hitchcock's finest works. In my opinion, it's his most overappreciated film. I just don't understand what's so good about this overdramatic, fairly unhitchcockian yarn. It goes on and on and on revealing ""the secrets of Manderley"", and then ends quickly, almost furtively. Maybe the maestro himself didn't like the film neither, because his cameo is a really hard one to catch! Still, ""Rebecca"" is worth seeing at least for Judith Anderson's amazing performance as the evil Mrs. Danvers.If you're a Hitchcock fan, take notice that Leo G. Carroll (Dr. Murchison in ""Spellbound"", senator Morton in ""Strangers on a Train"", the professor in ""North by Northwest"") makes his first appearance in a Hitchcock movie as Rebecca's doctor (near the end of the film).",Rebecca
164,Filmdokter,Intriguing plot but a bit heavy on the dialogues,7,29 May 2021,The film kicks off quiet slowly and Hitchcock allows to get to know the two lead characters (Fontaine and Olivier). The plot really gets going once the newlyweds arrive at Manderlay. From there the film that's started rather as a romantic story turns into a thriller (what happened to Rebecca?) and a drama (Fontaine and her struggle as the new lady of the house). It is a bit of a shame that the great way in which Hitchcock tells this story visually is sort of abandoned in the final 40 minutes or so. There we have (really) long dialogue scenes that take the thriller bit out the film. A pity but nonetheless a film worthwhile checking out.,Rebecca

It has a lot of personality, and that is because of its legendary director who takes all the credit for me. The plot is well run and accessible, it became a bit dense in the middle. The way Rebecca's character is put together is great, it doesn't require an actress to play it because in our minds she has her own face and scenes, even the energy that adheres to the character.The performances were neat, it is the first film I have seen by Joan Fontaine and I admit that she did not surprise me, I suppose that her character was not so enthusiastic. Laurence manages to stand out a little more giving having the role of developing the twist of the film, where he takes it out of that seemingly nostalgic and gray character, and becomes something darker. Judith Anderson stands out strong with this sinister and insane housekeeper, a superb performance that works.Film nominated for 11 Oscars, winning two, including the most important of the night ""Best Picture"".

I liked Joan Fontaine's acting better than Larry Olivier, I felt she put a lot of soul into her character (her acting may have been enhanced by Hitchcocks comment that everyone on the set hated her) and you sort of felt awkward when she and Maxim were having a fight, you felt sorry for her.

However, as a major caveat, this really doesn't make much difference at all to the final product. It's a fine film in it's own right, and the fact that it's probably The Master's most frills-free work actually aids it in creating a level of human interest that might not otherwise be present.In a build-up not unlike novels such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, we are introduced to our heroine, a sweet young girl who tries to be nice to everyone. She meets a brooding, handsome older gentleman, and proceeds to fall in love with him. After marriage, they relocate to his estate, which is absolutely vast. Inside, she will unlocks secrets of the past... As well as tangle with a maid who resents her being there in the first place...We really feel for this young lady (No, I'm not forgetting her name... The film doesn't give her one) as she desperately tries to fit into this new, aristocratic world around her, but failing dismally (mostly due to the machinations of another. Hitch captures her feelings of isolation well, while her husband remains a distant figure, before giving us the BIG twist which sets up the major conflict towards the end.For all the masterpieces he made, I don't believe Rebecca is the first choice most people would go for as Hitch's only Best Picture win (Not even Best Director, he never even accomplished that honour) but it is clearly a highly atmospheric suspense / drama which shows he could do more than just have us on the edge of our seats. 7/10",Rebecca

All of Hitch's films, though mostly good, have screenplays that are just unbelievable & improbable to some degree and ""Rebecca"" is certainly no exception. Fontaine's character is S-O-O Weak, Naïve, Passive, & Fragile that it lacks credibility. NO Woman, even in pre-Feminist times, could possibly be as much of a Clueless Doormat as the new Mrs de Winter. That as the new mistress of Mandalay she would have kept that witch Mrs Danvers as the housekeeper is at least very unlikely, especially when Danvers tricked the new Mrs de Winter to wear that dress for the ball. The Mrs Danvers character was rather unreal too. She was much more a caricature than a believable character. Otherwise, a very suspenseful, & well thought out storyline, with great dramatic tension, although the ""dramatic"" was much too ""melodramatic"" in my opinion. How a great director like Hitch got stuck with so many sub-par screenplays is beyond my comprehension.",Rebecca

It's not exactly scary from the point of view of the audience, but you feel increasingly worried for Joan Fontaine as Rebecca's ghost eat it's way into the movie.My only regret is that I have not yet been able to catch a decent copy of this movie.

The story revolves around a young woman who meets Maxim De Winter and soon becomes his second wife. Later, he takes her to her place named Manderley where she learns a dark secret to his first wife. Rebecca is a twisted fairytale. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Joan Fontaine who is a shy and insecure woman looking for love. She later meets Maxim De Winter who acts as her prince charming even though he is cruel towards her and she tries everything to escape her evil godmother and eventually the two fall in love and get married. She has this fantasy that he will to her to his palace called Manderley and live happily ever after, but it is far from happy. She is Snow White who wakes up from her coma with the imagination that she will live happily ever after with her prince charming, but once she sees Manderley up close her fairytale is an illusion. Mrs. Danvers is the Queen in the Snow White story who is the scariest woman in movie history. Mrs. Danvers loved the first Mrs. De Winter almost as she were the first wife before the second Mrs. De Winter took her place. All the other characters that we meet along the way are part of the second Mrs. De Winter's fairytale illusion. She's still wants that fairytale to be real and it's the only one living in that fantasy while everyone else is oblivious of the fact that they are also part of the story, but they don't realize it. By this point there is no hope for her as she refuses to be woken up from her dream as she believes that dreams can come true while the first wife was cruel to Maxim. Maxim at once believed that dreams do come true, but once he found out about her real intentions he woke up and realized that his dream was shattered. Alfred Hitchcock takes the beloved fairytale that we all know and turns it upside down and gives it a more gothic tone. Overall, this love story shows us that love is cruel and harsh even though we don't want to accept it. Rebecca took me completely by surprise as it showed me what love is truly about filled with tons of suspense that makes this a great film to watch.",Rebecca
172,jonathandoe_se7en,Hitchcock proves himself the Master,9,7 October 2001,"With Rebecca, his first US film Hitchcock proved without a doubt that he was one of the truly talented and gifted film makers ever to pick up a camera. There are none of the bold plot devises and cranked up tension in this film, something that Hitch would later make his own throughout the rest of his career, Rebecca relies on performance. With the great acting, production design and cinematography Hitchcock creates an intensely dark mood.The shadows of the house and the look and feel of everything, the fog that fills the air, the pure black and white images draw us into the story, we don't know what's going to happen next but we can't wait to find out. This use of almost expressionistic style only helps to compliment the performances of the leads. Laurence Olivier is fantastic as the tortured Mr de Winter, a character full of dimensions, we don't know weather to hate him or feel sorry for him, and his performance is so well timed and so well judged that everything fits him. He gives the character both a restrained villainy and a sense of saddening loss at the same time.Then we have Joan Fontaine as ""The Second"" Mrs. de Winter, her quiet and shy performance means we can feel for her immediately. Her curiosity in finding out the truth behind Mr de Winter spills out onto the viewer, making us all the more interested in the mystery. There is also Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, giving a fantastically devilish performance. Rebecca is all about mystery and intrigue, with a little bit of romance and mild black comedy, that is why I have tried to say as little about the plot as possible, because with Hitchcock it's best to go in knowing nothing at all. And with Rebecca you will be in for a rewarding experience.Not Hitchcock's best, but definitely in the top five. 9/10",Rebecca

The old scenic backdrops were fun to see, but obviously artificial.  While Joan Fontain was adorable, Lawrence O'livia was far too stiff for me to get comfortable with his character.  The gal that played the gustapo type housekeeper was way over the top.  She looked like something out of the silent film era. All very interesting, but not totally satisfying for me.

Discovers that she live in the shadow of her husband beautiful first wife, Rebecca discover family secrets and an obsessive housekeeper. The film is slow and takes too long to get to the point; you rather listen to Orson Welles radio version. The acting was all right, but Joan Fontaine was miscast as the nameless character but she got a cute face. The film is overrated and stupid, but it based on book by the same name and directed by Hitchcock himself before Rear Window and The Birds days. They cast the right actor to play Maxim DeWinter(played by more talented Sir Laurence Olivier).",Rebecca
178,HarlequeenStudio,Did he do it?,10,19 June 2017,"I was so scared when I watched this film as a kid. Mrs. Danvers is scarier than any vampire, she appears and disappears almost like a ghost, so ominous it's clear something must be terribly wrong with this household. One almost expects her to announce, ""This is Hell and I am the Devil."" For the young woman that moves into this house (Joan Fontaine), she sure is. A new wife of the owner, Max de Winter, she feels small and insignificant, constantly unfavorably compared to Rebecca, the deceased first wife, by Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. We see her roaming about the gigantic house, lost and confused. She doesn't even have a name and Rebecca does, still the lady of the manor, as ever. We never see a picture of Rebecca though, and our mind, just like the young Mrs. de Winter's, can't stop trying to imagine the greatest beauty to ever grace the earth. She was prettier than Joan Fontaine! Her husband Max, played by Laurence Olivier, doesn't help her much with his constant put-downs. Olivier was perhaps a better film actor than he had thought of himself. The film shifts from romcom, to psychological, to very real horror. Cynics would say, the natural stages of any marriage. But in the masterful hands of Alfred Hitchcock, it's art. The Selznick production - impeccable, as always. Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers will forever give me nightmares. Oh, the glory days when women were villains!",Rebecca

It was made almost 70 years ago and a master craftsman made it but for me its just a reasonably good creation. I well remember watching it for the first time and when the film ended I felt as if there was something major that was missing or not well done. I have never really lost that feeling in all of the viewings since and unfortunately I have never satisfactorily figured out why it doesn't seem right. It isn't the setting or the fact that the film was made in black and white or the actors and actresses who were involved in its making, however, the actress who plays Mrs Danvers was superb and well worth watching just to see her performance and I have not read the book therefore I am not aware if it is a fair representation. Whatever it is that is not right about the film is all the way through. I know that a lot of people really like this film and when I come across someone who does like it and why I will hopefully find out why I don't. Anyway I would still recommend anyone watch this film because as I have previously said a master craftsman made it and whatever it is that doesn't sit right its probable that its just me so please watch it and make your own mind up.",Rebecca
180,maitreg,Laurence Olivier at his finest,8,4 April 2001,"This is worth watching just for Laurence Olivier.  He's that good.  This is an early Hitchcock classic that's more mainstream than his later work and, I think, much better.  Pre-WW2, the rich widow Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) decides to spend a few weeks in Monte Carlo with her hired companion/assistant (Joan Fontaine).  When the companion is introduced to the recently widowed, wealthy, and handsome Maxim de Winter (Olivier), she is swept from her feet.  They marry rather quickly and she moves into his mansion.  However the atmosphere is not very welcoming.  Most of the staff is still mourning the recent death of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, and the new Mrs. de Winter cannot seem to fit in.  Hard enough as it is to live up to the expectations set by Rebecca, it quickly becomes apparent that some of the staff WANT her to fail.  How far will they go?  Excellent film. Maybe Hitchcock's best.",Rebecca

182,enmussak,Give it some time,9,15 December 2002,"During the first 30 minutes of this movie, you can either get frustrated or patiently wait for something to happen.  Because I have infinite respect for Hitchcock, I knew that his choices were carefully planned and that the film would pick up sooner or later.  Of course, it did.  The end of the film was very gripping, but in order to get to that point Hitchcock spent considerable time developing the situation and character interactions within Mandalay.  Looking back on it, the last half of the film wouldn't have been as effective if he hadn't.  For the haters of this film, probably those who are used to the pacing of North by Northwest of Rear Window, they likely found the slow pace unbearable.  The film finished with power, but only for the patient.",Rebecca
183,tripper0,I was so disappointed.....,6,3 September 2001,"Its really a crime that this is the one Hitchcock film that wins best picture.  It doesn't compare to 'Rear Window',  'Notorious' or 'North by Northwest'.  All of the performances were excellent.  Olivier was good, as this is the first movie I've seen with him.  Fontaine was enchanting as the new Mrs. de Winters.  Its been mentioned, but Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers does add a sense of dread and intrigue into the mix, and was memorable and excellent as well. The first hour of the movie I was quite interested.  I found myself becoming intrigued as to what happened to the original Mrs. de Winters, and really what the big secret was with Maxim de Winters.  I felt a sense of tension, and I was rather intrigued.  That, of course was the first half of the movie.Then comes the second half, when we are exposed to the big secret.  And let me tell you, I was not impressed.  The movie, in my humble opinion, quickly changes tone.  It loses its identity as a psychological thriller and becomes something less.  The romance between Fontaine and Olivier quickly becomes unbelievable, as we are supposed to believe that she would still love a man such as him.(you'll see what I mean when you watch it)  It loses the sense of tension and intrigue that fueled it beautifully for the first half, and comes to a screeching halt.  I lost interest at that point, and by the grand finale, which I was also ill impressed with, I just didn't care anymore.I should note that I personally don't like plot twists.  The most important aspect of any film, for myself, is the story.  When something happens that I don't like, it weakens everything else.  Its a shame here because the performances were top notch.  The romance was a bit stale, nothing compared to the beauty that was 'Notorious'.  This is probably the worst I've seen of Hitchcock, but luckily he gets much better than this.  He is still the master, but even the master can have a bad movie here and there.  I mean, Spielberg did make 'Hook'.  All that said, 6 out of 10.",Rebecca
184,SendiTolver,"You know, old boy, I have strong feeling",9,24 July 2018,"'Rebecca' might be the best film Hitch made in the '40s, and it still holds up great today. As matter of fact, it is one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all times (and not only my personal opinion, I dare to think). It starts of as sweet romance, the first 30 minutes really look and sound like lighthearted romantic comedy where charming man with troubled past falls into innocent young woman. But soon, the darker note are pressing in, and the viewer is tangled into the twisted mystery world of Manderlay. It is one of those movies where repetitive viewing, when you already know all the twists and turns (which some might be quite shocking, but never preposterous) never fails to engage the viewer. Also the cast and performances. Hitchcock's movies always starred some of the greatest actors of the time and most of them gave their best performances in Hitchcock's movies. 'Rebecca' is not an exception. Laurence Olivier is perfect as charming wealthy man with troubled mind, and Joan Fontaine just shines as innocent, but never dumb or dull, simple girl who is not used with the high class British lifestyle. George Sanders always manages to come off as charming, even in his villainous roles.Masterpiece in every aspect.",Rebecca
185,Jalea,I love This Movie,10,16 August 2007,"This is one of my favorite movies! My family comments on the fact that I watch black and white movies. It is because of the creativity and the dialogue. The 40s the dialogue was always crisp, clean and the actors enunciated their lines, you understood every syllable. No mumbling or swallowing of words in the 1940s (with the exception of comedy and gangster movies).This is one of best of the best. You never see the violence, death or heated arguments. All of the gory details are presented in a narrative form and yet you are enthralled. It is because the actors were excellent story tellers.And there are a few innuendos and witticisms, some of which if you are not watching or listening carefully, you will not catch.

This was also the first film in which he adapted someone else's work, the famous novel by de Maurier.This film features all the twists and strange characters you would expect from Hitchcock along with the trademark unexpected ending.

Even if director himself was not completely happy with being under someone else control (David O. Selznick was simply not a man to ignore) it has his signature all over the screen, from complicated characters hiding secrets from each others to evil lurking in the shadows, morbid fascination with death, innocent heroine (it never occurred to me earlier that she is never called by her name) lost in the imposing majesty of Manderley to twists and turns of a fascinating story itself. And - the best of all - this is a movie with Mrs. Danvers (magnificent Judith Anderson). Now I can finally admit that I always found her the true owner of Manderley and if anybody asked me, I would drown both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, in my version Mrs. Danvers would live on and on forever, bringing fresh flowers in Rebecca's bedroom and occasionally even try those silk stockings and underwear made by nuns from convent. (What kind of nuns knew how to sew sexy underwear?) Hitchckock would have been amused to find that audience of the future find the villainess the most appealing character in the movie.

Joan Fontaine is excellent as the young bride, although the character annoyed me with all her crying. Laurence Olivier shines as Maxim de Winter. He is the perfect person to play the handsome, tortured widower. George Sanders is also perfect as Favell, combining both humor and menace to build a memorable character. When watching the film, it's easy to tell why this won the Oscar for Best Picture. The only problem I had w/this movie is the fact that they changed Rebecca's death. In the book, Maxim kills her. In this, he does not. She trips and hits her head. I liked the book version better.

All those Hitchcockian twists are great, Mrs. Danvers is deliciously wicked, and the on-screen interaction between Olivier and Fontaine (considering they hated each other when the cameras were turned off) was quite convincing. I have rarely enjoyed movies from this era because I thought the acting was wooden. Maybe it's just that I'm a big Hitchcock fan, but I don't think that's totally it. The lighting is wonderful, providing such crisp detail, the cinematography excellent, the set design marvelous (with the exception of a couple of cheesy fake backgrounds), and the miniature Manderley is exquisite.

195,davidholmesfr,Fire and Ice,9,19 February 2002,"Worthy of its place in cinema history, Rebecca remains a lesson to all would-be filmmakers. The opening scenes, light, airy and frothy, played out in romantic comedy style as de Winter meets his second wife in the south of France, soon give way to a more forbidding atmosphere. From the amusing delights of Mrs Van Hopper and sunshine to the menace of Mrs Danvers and the swirling mists of Manderley is a short, but life-changing step for the second Mrs de Winter.Hitchcock's use of light and shadow add to the feeling of foreboding. The fall of shadows across Joan Fontaine as she explores the house adds to the impression of her imprisonment in the rambling old house. And slowly, as ever, the master builds the tension as we realise that there is more to de Winter's first marriage and his wife's death than meets the eye. As one minor quibble, perhaps the scene in which Fontaine appears for the ball in a copy of a gown Rebecca had worn was slightly over-played, given that we could all see what was coming. The acting between Olivier and Fontaine was out of the top drawer, no doubt aided and abetted by Hitchcock's `encouragement' of the personal dislike the two had for each other. Judith Anderson's icy menace makes her perfect in the role of Mrs Danvers and is a strong counterpoint for the fiery ending. Lighting, editing and all the other elements come together to make this a fine piece of early noir.",Rebecca

Hitchcock made pointed references to the fact the Rebecca was often a cold and sexually unresponsive wife . There is the assumption that Rebecca was at least bi-sexual. To really appreciate the subtlety of this film it helps to factor in this possible relationship between the women. Hitchcock working under the censorship code of the time could only hint at it. However, with this in mind, one doesn't have to look hard to connectthe dots. Rebecca is wonderful story telling with a first rate cast and is beautifully photographed.

However, not much happens during the first 40 min. of the movie, i'm afraid, and the acting by the leading couple wasn't that great. Olivier looks a bit ""wooden"" and inexpressive in his role as Maxim de Winter, while Joan Fontaine overacts in some of the scenes. It seems to me that the secondary actors like Sanders and Andersen stole the show here.

The story opens with Joan Fontaine finds Laurence Olivier (he was so young and I felt oddly attracted to him) on the ledge of a cliff, ready to jump in. She stops him and they met up again later that day. They spend lots of time with each other and soon marry, despite the fact that Ms. Fontaine is unprepared for her new role as Olivier's wife. Trouble only continues when Ms. Fontaine arrives at the large estate and finds that everyone, especially the head maid Miss. Danvers, compares her to the greatly loved Rebecca, Olivier's first wife who died tragically a year before when she took her boat out by herself and drowned.

Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, a duo of classic movie icons, star in REBECCA, a story of a naive young woman who marries a wealthy aristocrat that is haunted by the memory of his dead first wife, Rebecca.When it starts off as a romantic film, it shifts the tone to a dark and mysterious thriller, after we are introduced to Mrs. Davers, the intimidating housekeeper who is dangerously obsessed with Rebecca.There are many twists and turns in the plot, mainly Olivier's confession of drowning Rebecca's body in her boat after she accidentally hit her head and died when taunting him about the fact that she was pregnant with another man's child. The truth was she was sick and wanted to anger him into killing her so he can be prosecuted.The cast was brilliant and extremely convincing in the portrayal of their respective characters.

It's hauntingly shot, with superb shimmering black-and-white cinematography and a shivery spooky atmosphere. Laurence Olivier is credible as Maxim, but the ultimate shoutout goes to the highly talented and stunningly gorgeous Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter. Judith Anderson also sets the bar high with the first in a series of excellent Mrs-Danvers-performances (followed by Diana Rigg and, more recently, Kristin Scott Thomas).Although it works well as an adaptation of the novel, it's not a Hitchcock film that I find myself returning to again and again. His trademark playfulness is notably absent, and it also suffers from the irritating 1940s habit of playing orchestral music in the background of almost every single scene. If Hitchcock hadn't made his signature cameo - walking in the background of Jack Favell bickering with a police officer - you probably wouldn't immediately detect that it was directed by him.Despite being an early work, should Hitchcock really have reflected on this film with a grimace later in his career? No. An early work, yes. A disappointment - no! He contributed the best adaptation of what is an horrifically difficult book to adapt. This is a good one.",Rebecca

Although the movie drags a little bit, it really  picks up after the first hour.  Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and George Sanders all give excellent performances, but it is really Dame Judith Anderson who steals the picture.  Just thinking of how she played Mrs. Danvers gives me chills.  Rumor had it that Hitchcock deliberately made Joan Fontaine feel terrible by claiming to hate her and getting everyone in the movie to dislike her as well, but the reason why he did it was so she would perform in the title role the way Hitchcock envisioned it.  One thing about this movie--I was shocked and you will to when it was revealed in the movie a certain plot element.  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to see it.

207,nofear1012001,Love it or hate it.,10,31 October 2002,This is very much a love it or hate it Hitchcock movie. I think its outstanding. One reason people may hate it is the suspense takes a long time to build up and Hitchcock himself didn't seem to fond of it. But don't let that fool you- this is a great and twisted love story mystery movie. Joan Fontaine's character is one of the greatest reasons to purchase this. This is Hitchcock's first picture in America and his first under producer David O Selznick. Don't miss out on this classic. The Criterion version is recommended once again- a LOT of extras.,Rebecca
208,thepartyoftea,"Felt, not seen....",10,28 August 2006,"Rebecca (1940)Hitchcock's romantic suspense thriller proves to be one of the most gripping and tangling movies of his career. Rebecca invites you in slowly, and slowly builds on itself. A happy go lucky beginning quickly turns into a movie that touches themes of suicide (Max on the cliff), second marriages, lesbianism (Mrs. Danves and her obsession with Rebecca), incestuous relationships (Rebecca and Jack), murder, and more. Rebecca opens on a down note showing a beat up old mansion and reflecting on better times and then shows a man close to the edge of a cliff. The movie shifts to a happy-go-lucky romantic sugar movie. The well written script and the nervousness and light hearted acting done by Joan Fontiane. The movie quickly changes and soon begins to feel like a mystery or a ghost story with whispers of Rebecca and how no one talks about her and her presence being felt despite being dead for over a year. The camera movements, acting (especially from Mrs. Danvers) and lighting help achieve a suspenseful feel to the movie. The nervous out of place feel that the new Mrs. de Winter exhibits was done encouraged off screen by Hitchcock when Laurence Oliver (who plays Max de Winter) hated Joan Fontiane as the leading lady, this off screen chemistry added to the film. The movie keeps several things secret and keeps hinting ever so slightly at many things. At sometime I thought Rebecca was still alive, or that she was a ghost. The curious and light hearted attitude of the second Mrs. de Winter adds to building the suspense and helps keep the audience guessing and hoping the mystery will be reveled. When the secret of Rebecca's death is finally revealed the movie takes another shift to dramatic and a different suspenseful feel. This shift takes a toll on the new Mrs. de Winter and even characters in the movie spot this. Another important element is the presence of Rebecca throughout the movie. Rebecca is never shown and you never hear her voice, yet she's everywhere in the movie. Her 'R' symbol is almost like an omen within the house.The movie's core is the new Mrs. de Winter and her struggle to fit into her new life. She must learn how to live as a trophy wife, be a socialite, wife, wealthy, and live up to Rebecca, the first wife. Throughout the movie you hear whispers of how great Rebecca was and it takes it's toll on the new Mrs. de Winter, even to the point where she commands,"" I Am The New Mrs. de Winter.""The cinematography is extremely well done and brings scenes to life. The happy go lucky young romance of Max and the new Mrs. de Winter is set in Monty Carlo, a city famous for royalty, thrills, beautiful landscape and luxury. The next location is the massive mansion Manderly, which at first looks inviting, but quickly feels old and empty like a mausoleum. The beach also has a foreboding feeling to it. The loud crashing waves, the fog and a cabin full of Rebecca's possessions.There was one thing that caught my eye is the acting by George Sanders(who plays Jack). A real distracting habit shown in the film is that George was blinking 5 times per second. Also, sadly the using an alias at a doctor's office could no longer work due to the paper work one must go through at a doctor's office. Hitchcock delivered one of his greatest movies with a strong cast, performance, atmosphere, mood and gripping story that will have people guessing..",Rebecca

210,shafatqadri,Rebecca Rebecca......Nice one,8,12 March 2008,"Long discussed as the first film Alfred Hitchcock made in Hollywood as well as the beginning of the legendary conflict between Selznick and Hitchcock. Producer David Selznick had just had a great movie the previous year (Gone with the Wind, 1939) and signed on Alfred Hitchcock for the first Hollywood movie by Hitchcock (his earlier movies were all British). What is less known is that in the entire fabulous career of Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca was the only movie that won him a Best Picture award. And that too in the year 1940, when competition was fierce with the movie, 'Grapes of Wrath', 'The Great Dictator', and 'The Philadelphia Story'.With an outstanding cast and perfect control of the actors, Hitchcock, who resisted the domination of Selznick in his projects, manages to weave out of Daphne Du Maurier's novel, a Hitchcock psychological thriller. Somewhat against Hitchcock's intent, the story indeed is fairly true to the novel, with a few exceptions necessary to satisfy American censor boards.The movie opens with waves crashing against rocks and a narrative by the protagonist, who will never be given a first name, only Mrs De Winter as the plot unfolds. We meet for the first time the silent but dominant character of the estate of Manderley, the ancestral home of Mr. DeWinter. It is a stunning edifice and more than a little imposing.Flashback to the beginning of the story, to Monte Carlo. A young woman who is a paid companion to an overbearing pompous society matron sees a man brooding, overlooking the cliff. She yells 'stop' thinking him about to jump. Irritably he sends her off.....How the movie unfolds you got to see that yourself. The movie was a great success both critically and financially. It got a total of 11 nominations and won 2 awards: Best Picture and Best Cinematography.As a Hitchcock flick, it shows what the master could do with a few extra bucks in his pocket. With a budget that Hitchcock could only dream about in England, the production values show an exponential improvement which include stage sets, lighting conditions, extensive screen tests, and costuming, to create an environment where the film will live.For Selznick, it was the second monumentally successful film in a row. For Hitchcock, it was the beginning of the love affair that American audiences have for Hitchcock films.",Rebecca

212,tabbyharwood,Infatuation leads to Death,3,29 October 2014,"Rebecca, a movie from 1940 directed by Alfred Hitchcock; starts of being told by a narrator from a dark gloomy outside setting. It quickly changes to the indoors of a wealthy home. A wealthy woman, Mrs. Van Hopper has a young lady that tends to her needs and young lady takes a liking to Maxim played by Laurence Olivier. They start spending a lot of secretive time together and they fall in love. Mrs. Van Hopper continually reminds her that Maxim had a wife named Rebecca Van Hopper's daughter is getting married in New York and she must leave Maxim. Maxim wants her to marry him and not go to New York but to go to Manderley with him.The new Mrs. De Winter is treated differently by everyone in Manderley because Maxim's first wife, Rebecca still has an impact on everyone there. Mrs. Danvers, the main housekeeper doesn't take a liking to her because she loved Rebecca. It's hard for her to adjust because everyone compares the old Mrs. deWinter to the new Mrs. deWinter. The new Mrs. deWinter is forbidden from going to certain places within the area. From the beginning of the movie I couldn't figure out what the young lady's name actually was. Only after her marriage to Maxim was she referred to as Mrs. deWinter. Clues are given throughout the beginning of the death of Rebecca but the lady never asks directly what happened.Through the curiosity of the new Mrs. deWinter, she accesses areas of the house that are considered sanctuaries for Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers torments her by showing her all the important things to the late Rebecca.The new Mrs. deWinter instructs Mrs. Danvers to get rid of all of Rebecca's writing. She suggests a costume ball to Maxim and he agrees. Mrs. deWinters dresses as Rebecca in the portrait and Maxim is mortified. She wasn't aware that it was Rebecca in the picture. Mrs. Danvers suggested she wear it knowing he wouldn't approve.Maxim tells Mrs. deWinter that Rebecca's shadow has been in between them. Maxim knew Rebecca's body was the whole time because he put it there. He killed Rebecca and was living with the guilt. During the court proceedings due to the new findings of the case of Rebecca's death. The new Mrs. deWinter faints during the proceedings. The investigator finds a note from Rebecca and claims Rebecca was murdered by Maxim because she was pregnant and it wasn't his. They visit the doctor finds out she was not pregnant but actually was sick with cancer. Both men were devastated.The camera angle at the end of the movie expresses that Mrs. Danvers died to be with Rebecca. Her infatuation with her drove her to her own death.",Rebecca
213,lhug74,Rebecca,7,12 May 2015,"I can see now why Alfred Hitchcock is such a well-respected and well known director. The movie, Rebecca, is about a young woman living in Monte Carlo with her mean employer. She met a very wealthy man by the name of Maxim de Winter. The two fall in love and move back to Maxim de Winter's large estate but it doesn't take long for his new wife to notice that the death of his first wife, Rebecca, still has an effect on everyone in the house. They all still miss her and it is obvious that they wanted the new wife to kind of take the place of Rebecca in a way that she just couldn't do. Rebecca had a huge effect on the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. She even set the house on fire at the end of the movie and ended up dying in the house. The movie had a very surprising ending which I liked. Hitchcock is a great director and you can see that through the movies lighting, camera-work, sounds, and editing.",Rebecca
214,cleigh115,Great hitchcock film,9,11 May 2015,"Out of all of the movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, ""Rebecca"" is certainly one of the best. It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose ""presence"" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. Hitchcock is known for twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.",Rebecca
215,m-carter-68742,Hitchcock does it again,8,17 December 2015,"Albert Hitchcock creates yet another masterpiece. From the start, the cast is like a dream team. The acting was superb., though sometimes over dramatic, but that was common for the time. The music was also spectacular. It allowed for the mood to be set. Both soft and hard shadows were applied when they needed to be. The story was something different, someone being haunted by their husbands dead wife? Thats different even for todays horror type movies. The atmosphere created was brilliant, we know we couldn't see Rebecca, but she had a god like feel. She was always there, manipulating things as she pleased. A different story from the start was made amazing by the stellar actors and actresses involved in this film. Easily a must see for any horror buff",Rebecca
216,Kuba_D,Masterpiece,10,7 June 2007,"After having succeeded in Europe, the master of spy films, Alfred Hitchcock was invited to Hollywood by David O. Selznick in the year 1939. This time the director reached for a novel 'Rebecca' by Daphne du Maunier. It is a story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine), who becomes a second wife of a British lord (Laurence Olivier), and his residence she meets with the cult of Rebecca. Rebecca was the lord's previous wife and she has died in very peculiar circumstances.Film cost more than a million dollars. And it was matter of conflict between the creator and the producer. But it gathered more than 10 Oscan nominees and two Oscars for the best movie and cinematography. Selznick himself was quite surprised by the piece of art. He decided to produce the movie only due to the fact that the final scene of fire reminded him of the fire of Atlanta in 'Gone with the Wind'.This master psychological thriller opened a new chapter in Hitchcock's works, making him the Hollywood's master of manipulating with mood.",Rebecca
217,andyman618,My favorite Hitch,10,13 August 2003,"SPOILERS ABOUND!!!!`Last night I dreamt I was at Manderly again.' As with Daphne DuMaurier's novel, so begins Alfred Hitchcock's classic film adaptation, and the only one of his films to be awarded an Academy Award for Best Picture. It should also be noted that the film also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography, Black and White. Hitchcock, Fontaine, Olivier, and Anderson were also nominated in their respective categories.Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie, and much has been written about the interference by David O. Selznick with its production. That is not the purpose of this review, though. Frankly, I don't know all that much about what went on behind the scenes, but I do know that the resulting film is a masterpiece.Rebecca can be divided into three parts: Monte Carlo, Manderly, and the inquest after the discovery of Rebecca' sunken boat.At Monte Carlo, we are introduced to Joan Fontaine's character, a complete nonentity (in fact, we never learn her real name) who is serving as a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, an obnoxious, wealthy matron delightfully played by Florence Bates. While there, she meets George Fortescu Maximillian de Winter (Maxim for short,played by Laurence Olivier), fabulously wealthy and as charming as Mrs. Van Hopper is boorish. Maxim has been traveling trying to recover from his first wife Rebecca's untimely death in a drowning accident. At the end of her stay at Monte Carlo, the young woman is surprised to have Maxim ask her to marry him, although not with as much romance as she would probably have liked, and much to the consternation of her erstwhile employer Mrs. Van Hopper.The movie then takes us to Manderly, the palatial family estate of the de Winter family. Here Fontaine's character truly finds herself out of her depth as the new mistress of Manderly. Not only has she never had to deal with such a large house and a retinue of servants, but she gets a decidedly chilly reception from Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), and everywhere she goes and everyone with whom she speaks reminds her of the beauty and accomplishments of Rebecca. She feels overwhelmed by the specter of Maxim's first wife and of his abiding love for her. Not only that, but Fontaine's character is treated like a child, both in Monte Carlo and at Manderly, whether it is in the dismissive way of Mrs. Van Hopper, the fatherly manner of Maxim, or in the gently patronizing way of Frith, Manderly's head butler. One gets the feeling that the new Mrs. de Winter is a child lost in this great house, afraid of making any false steps.Judith Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers. Although she never raises her voice, and always speaks with seeming respect to her new mistress, Anderson nonetheless allows Mrs. Danver's malevolence to come through. She is the archetype for all the cold-hearted housekeepers who have come since, and none can match her. She never lets Mrs. de Winter forget Rebecca and how she was loved by everyone, especially Maxim. Haunted by the specter of Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter seems to feel like an intruder, trespassing on Rebecca's home and sleeping in her bed.Mrs. Danvers finally reveals the depth of her hatred by suggesting a costume for Mrs. de Winter to wear at a party that was originally worn by Rebecca. After Maxim's expected negative reaction, Mrs. Danvers urges her, in arguably the most memorable scene in the movie, to commit suicide by throwing herself from the window. Mrs. de Winter is saved, though, by the wreck of a boat near Manderly and the noise of the rescue that is undertaken.During the course of the rescue, another boat is found: the one in which Rebecca died. Having discovered Rebecca's corpse inside, it is announced that an inquest must take place to investigate her death. When his wife tries to comfort Maxim, he reveals to her the truth behind his relationship with Rebecca: that he hated her, and was trapped by her into a sham of a marriage. He also tells her of how Rebecca died; that he had killed her in a rage and sunk the boat with her body inside. After this revelation, a change comes over the new Mrs. de Winter: she grows up, and is visibly more self-assured. She and Maxim, to a certain extent, reverse roles, in that he loses hope and she must comfort him and reassure him that all will be well, when in fact all seems hopeless. She is now truly the mistress of Manderly.During the inquest, it is discovered that Rebecca's boat was scuttled, and had not capsized as was previously thought. Circumstantial evidence begins to pile up against Maxim, until a visit to Rebecca's personal physician reveals her ultimate betrayal and clears Maxim's name.Rebecca is, essentially, a drama of mystery and romance, and in lesser hands it could easily fall into the trap of melodrama. But Hitchcock's deft direction, the superb cinematography, and the outstanding performances by the entire cast make it one of the greatest romances ever made, and one of my favorite films.",Rebecca
218,westersnows,"""I am Mrs. de Winter now!""",10,1 April 2014,"There is no way I couldn't review this. As a rule I don't have favorite films (because I can never pick) but let's be real, it's probably this one. I've seen Rebecca a good 10+ times and it never gets old. I feel obligated to talk about the book just a little (it's amazing read it), because there is a big difference. First of all, I'm so thankful that the nameless main character in the novel remains nameless in the film. The book is slightly more twisted, as Maxim intentionally kills Rebecca in the novel, which makes for a much more complex and slightly more intense plot. This obviously could not be carried out in a 1940s film, however. Although I wish they had.I really love the characters in this film. They make the whole story, and the idea of Rebecca is so strong it's like she's there as a fully formed character. Mrs. Danvers is the quintessential eerie housekeeper (who a lot of later figures are based off of), and her scenes with Mrs. de Winter are some of the best. It's obligatory that I mention the photography at this point, because it's really VERY nice. Especially the scene where Mrs. Danvers is trying to convince her to jump out the window. But I have to say, the thing that draws me to this film the most possibly is how much I relate to the main character. She reminds me so much of myself. Plus, people are always telling me that I look like Joan Fontaine, creepy. So, arguably the best Hitchcock film ever made—this movie is gold. Don't let me near the negative reviews, I might have a conniption.",Rebecca
219,dmataylor-43810,Boring.,1,9 June 2018,"If there was an Oscar for most boring picture, Rebecca surely deserves it. Rebecca made my fall asleep. Besides being boring, the film had no story and a lack of suspense. Hitchcock at his worst. Again, this film is boring. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",Rebecca

Joan Fontaine(who was Oscar-nominated)plays a woman who marries a rich, dashing Englishman(Laurence Olivier), but she soon is haunted by the memories of his late wife, Rebecca. Adding to Fontaine's troubles is the evil and scary Mrs.Danvers(Judith Anderson)who is the housekeeper that is completely obsessed with Rebecca. Major lesbian overtones here. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of Hollywood's golden era and a Hitchcock triumph!",Rebecca
221,appleimacdude,one of the best movies of all times!,10,13 August 2004,"This movie has so many twists and turns - you may think you have it figured out very early on, but soon discover that things don't seem quite as they may appear - this is not a simple movie!  Very cleverly written, with superb acting on the part of the staff, both in the major and minor rolls!This would be an excellent addition to anyones film library, a good movie to take out for others to see who may not be familiar with old movies - or for those who are!This was a movie where I had to immediately check the IMOB database to find out details on who everyone was after I watched it (on TMC on TV, which doesn't air credits after the old movies - good commentary, but I had to know ""who played Mrs. Danvers"" - Dame Judith Anderson!",Rebecca

The whole story was acted out wonderfully by Olivier and Fontaine, Oliver played the mysterious handsome man well, and Fontaine was believable as a naive girl who fell for the looks. There were so many instances of great cinematography unique to Hitchcock films, playing with light and shadow to really tell the story along with the dialogue to make everything come together. Alfred Hitchcock as the director definitely left his mark on this movie, since I saw it was adapted from a book, and not created by him, he made it his own with great directive vision.",Rebecca

Took many an efforts to finish this one off.. such was the loss of momentum and failure of creation of Hitchcockian allure for me.Loads of laboured scenes, too much of make believe stuff, and general lack of effort with script/dialogues.

224,l-seidel,Less is more,9,19 April 2014,"Rebecca is a beautifully made film that, every time I watch it, sticks with me for some time after. Hitchcock masterfully uses the medium of film to mirror the story he is telling. The way the images flow across the screen is haunting, beautiful and adds so much to the emotional resonance of each moment. I think what I love most about Rebecca is how many scenes revel in the quiet and in sparse dialogue. Words are being said, but you can hear the characters holding back torrents of emotions and thoughts. This is especially true in scenes between Mrs. Danvers and the new Mrs. De Winter. I can't say enough about the actress who portrays Mrs. Danvers. I found myself so drawn to her character while at the same time completely creeped out by her. This is how you do horror!Definitely my favorite Hitchcock film.",Rebecca
225,BronwynN,"Last night, I dreamed I was at Manderley again ...",10,23 October 2009,"We never meet the title character of this classic Alfred Hitchcock film. However, she inhabits the halls of Manderley as if she was alive and watching everything that occurs. Through her medium, the mysterious Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca still ominously dominates the inhabitants. And ominous is exactly the right word to describe the real star of this film, Judith Anderson (before she was a ""Dame""). Mrs. Danvers floats through the house, intent on her task to prevent the new Mrs. DeWinter from taking her rightful place as the Lady. Through innuendo, menace, and her belittlement of the young woman Mr. DeWinter brings home from Monte Casino, there is utterly no doubt that Danvers wants to destroy her employer's or any other person's chance at happiness.If we never see Rebecca, we are also never told the name of the childlike woman brought home as Maxim DeWinters' new wife. This is a brilliant device (both in the book and film), because it makes it easier for each of us to visualize ourselves wandering those halls, looking at the portraits in the gallery, and always thinking that Mrs. Danvers will float from nowhere, to work Rebecca's evil from beyond the grave, making all of us know that we will never be good able to measure up to the maid or her mysterious Rebecca.",Rebecca
226,bragant,"""I am Mrs. de Winter NOW!""",10,10 November 2009,"Despite the fact that Hitchcock himself tended to be dismissive about this film (telling Truffaut, ""It has held up remarkably well. I have no idea why.""), REBECCA is undoubtedly one of his timeless classics - the kind of work which has become so embedded in the collective unconscious that certain scenes, lines and characters are mythic, to the point of parody (think of Carol Burnett's riffs on this story in her 1970s comedy show, or Stephen King's use of Mrs. Danvers' image in his ""Bag of Bones""). This is also one of Hitchcock's great crowd-pleasers - when first released, it played in New York for a year - held over repeatedly due to audience demand - and in England the movie went through the roof, running in London for virtually the length of World War II. It's been playing constantly since then in frequent revivals and television screenings. REBECCA's production was fraught with tension and pain: principal photography started only days before the outbreak of WWII, to the great personal distress of the nearly all-English cast and crew; Hitchcock exploited Joan's Fontaine's inexperience by telling her that she was terrible and everyone hated her so as to deliberately keep her in a near-constant state of defensiveness, fear and anxiety which was 100% appropriate for Fontaine's character; and it soon became quite obvious that Selznick and Hitchcock could not stand one another and would be unable to work together in the long run. The resulting motion picture, however, brought nothing but good fortune to everyone connected with it - Laurence Olivier's long-desired Hollywood career finally took off, Hitchcock's reputation in America was secured, Joan Fontaine became an international star overnight, Selznick won his second Best Picture Oscar in a row and dominated world box-office for another year, and Judith Anderson became an icon, just for starters. This is one of those rare instances where a fantastic book was brought to the screen and made into an equally good film. Miss DuMaurier's plot is legendary: On holiday in the south of France, the untitled Cornish nobleman Max de Winter meets and marries a sweet young girl (Fontaine) whose timely attention perhaps stops him from suicide in one of the best meet-and-greets of all time. Mr. de Winter's subsequent proposal (""I'm asking you marry me, you little fool."") rescues the girl from the hell of her life as a paid companion (""I didn't know companionship could be bought,"" says de Winter) to the Gorgon-like American socialite Edythe Van Hopper (Played with true verve by Florence Bates: ""Give me a chocolate quick!"" she cries as she stubs her umpteenth cigarette out in a jar of cold cream). After a whirlwind courtship and fast Italian honeymoon, de Winter brings his bride to the ancestral estate of Manderley. The second Mrs. de Winter is not happy in her new home, which seems to be overshadowed by the presence of Maxim's first wife Rebecca, dead for some time in a boating accident. Matters are not helped by her own complete ineptitude in her new position of Great Lady, or the hostility of the housekeeper, black-clad Mrs. Danvers (superbly incarnated by Dame Judith Anderson in the only successful one-note performance in movie history), who seems to have a strange fixation on her dead mistress, keeping Rebecca's clothes, personal possessions and rooms exactly as they were during Rebecca's lifetime. De Winter himself behaves like a different man - brooding, gloomy, temperamental and even verbally abusive. Poor Joan Fontaine blames herself for her predicament, contrasting her awkward plainness with Rebecca's alleged poise, grace and popularity...After a disastrous development during a costume ball, matters seem even more hopeless when Rebecca's previously-undiscovered body turns up out of nowhere, and it seems Mr. de Winter has a lot of explaining to do...Strong plot and performances aside, this film has a truly unique atmosphere - George Barnes' Oscar-winning cinematography transforms Manderley into a Gothic symphony of light and shadow where unseen forces seem about to manifest themselves at every turn. Perhaps the greatest bit of showmanship is the way the dead, absent Rebecca becomes a major character - in the stunning and very perverse sequence (""Feel this..."") where Mrs. Danvers shows the new Mrs. de Winter Rebecca's things, you can SEE Rebecca in your head while ""Danny"" speaks. While the film is quite long (over two hours), you won't want it to be shorter by one second! A classic for the ages which the whole family can watch and enjoy together.",Rebecca

Those hints perfectly showing a haughty but kind woman for viewers. Also this is one particular view I like most. It is from that dog - Jasper. Director uses a tracking shot for Jasper to show viewers that Jasper might see something that is not notable by humans!",Rebecca
233,carmenv,Visually stunning and tragically beautiful.,10,30 September 1999,"This is a classic film, not only because it was Hitch's first American film, but because the story and the idea of tragic romance is virtually non-existent in films today. The story centers around an wealthy English man who is suicidal and gloomy after the death of his wife.  This role is carried out brilliantly by Laurence Olivier.  He meets and falls in love with a young and very naive girl he meets in Monte Carlo. He marries her and brings her back to his boyhood home, called Manderley. This is when the trouble begins. The wife, played wonderfully by Joan Fontaine, is ill at ease as a mistress of the house and is intimidated and frightened at the idea of the first wife, Rebecca, haunting the house and the idea that she does not measure up to Rebecca, who was charming and beautiful to all who knew her. Rebecca allegedly died in a sailing accident, and when the wreck of her boat is found near the estate, all the past rises up again to destroy Maxim and his bride. Films like these are no longer made, which is why they are called classic. If you enjoy suspense, romance, or even Alfred Hitchcock films (Heaven knows I can't be the only Hitchcock fan around!), rent this film. It is rarely shown on cable, so don't look for it on TV. A Hitchock film celebration was recently held on Starz!, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and AMC and none of these channel showed this film. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!Enjoy a rare glimpse of Hitchcock when he was first getting started in Hollywood, and look for Hitch's quick cameo at the beginning of the film.",Rebecca
234,janesbit1,"A masterpiece, filmed in beautiful black and white!",8,6 February 2000,"This is the only Hitchcock movie that won an Academy Award for Best Movie, preceeding Citizen Kane by one year.  There is much in Rebecca reminiscent of Kane--from the outstanding opening black and white cinematography of the tracking shot of Manderley to the final shot of the embroidered pillow surrounded by flames. The Academy snubbed Hitchcock himself, as they never did award the all-time best director the top prize for himself.  Hitchcock's influence is demonstrated throughout the unfolding of the film.  As in many of his films, your initial assumptions will likely prove wrong. Laurence Olivier plays a wealthy man haunted by the death of his first wife, while Joan Fontaine plays an ""ordinary"" young woman who becomes the second Mrs. de Winter.  Fontaine's character obviously loves her husband but feels out of place in the vast mansion, especially when the sinister and strange Mrs. Danvers appears. Rebecca holds up well with age.  The characters are memorable and the subtle Hitchcockian twists are riveting. Renting this classic will be much more worthwhile than watching 99% of the more current fare available.",Rebecca
235,shanie25350,Overlong and overrated--not one of Hitchcock's best,5,29 September 2021,"Okay, but overlong and overrated. Lovely cinematography. Great score. I liked Joan Fontaine as Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, but did not care for Laurence Oliver's performance as Maxim de Winter at all. I never realized how horribly he mumbled until I saw Rebecca and, after seeing it, couldn't believe he was considered one of the most acclaimed actors of the 20th century. You really need subtitles/closed captioning to understand him in this film. I found Olivier nearly impossible to understand without subtitles--and not necessarily because of his accent, but because he constantly mumbles, merges words together, and is basically incoherent except when he's angry and shouting. Plus, he's totally detached and unemotional and speaks too fast in a cold tone even in the scenes where he's supposed to be falling in love with Joan Fontaine's character. Olivier's performance was very disappointing, and I think just about any other major leading man of that era could have played the role of Maxim de Winter better than he did. At least they would have been more coherent.I give this film 5 stars for the cinematography and gothic atmosphere, but it's not one of Hitchcock's best.",Rebecca
236,Dimitri44,Mrs. Danvers,10,23 August 2012,"Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age?Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way.Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told ""Danny"" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers.Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one.Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact.Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.",Rebecca
237,burkhart-3,My least favorite Hitchcock movie,3,6 December 2000,"I still have no idea why people like this movie so much.  The acting is poor, particularly that of Olivier.  He comes across as overacting terribly. Miss Fontaine fares better.  She, at least, gives us a decent performance. Anderson is completely not to be believed.  The music is so overdone it makes you wonder what they were thinking by putting it in there so much. This movie is just waiting to be parodied (as it has been).  And then there's the ending when this turns into a movie in search of an editor. Every time you think it might be over it goes on for ten more minutes. Then, is it over?  No, it just rambles on and on until you want to strangle whoever is playing that awful music.  It should be noted that this movie has more of Selznick in it than Hitchcock.  After making this film Hitch began to try and get every other studio in Hollywood to hire him out so he wouldn't have to work with Selznick again.  He even makes fun of Selznick with smug jokes in later movies.  I can see why.  If somebody took my movie and put in that music and let it ramble on forever I'd be mad at them, too. There is a good idea for a film in here somewhere, but this isn't it.  I hope all the people who voted this the best picture of 1940 were given a nice padded cell.  I was planning to write more, but just thinking about this movie is making me cringe, so I'll just stop.  If you like good movies, see many other Hitchcock classics, but leave this one on the shelf.",Rebecca

First of all, i think that we all must pay our respects to Daphne DuMarrier, without her brilliant novel this movie would have never taken shape, I read the book and absolutly have fallen head over hills for it. She is brilliant in her writing and i love the story, the book has more information about the characters, and has more passion in it, its more realistic, and i love it,
The Movie was also very very good, i thought it wouldn't be very accurate to the book at first, because most movies aren't However i loved the preformance of Laurnece Olivier and Joan Fontaine, i loved the way it was filmed, and i love how it takes the lines straight from the book. Its a wonderful movie, and a classic, to the end of time.For those who have only seen the movie, i urge you to read the book to get the full affect thanks",Rebecca
241,Chris-268,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly...""",10,15 August 2000,"One of Hitchcock's finest films, and in my top five of all time. What can I say about this movie? I'll start with Joan Fontaine- perfection. In her long career she never equaled her performance as the Second Mrs. De Winter. Incidentally, she was given an Oscar the following year for her role in Suspicion, a vastly inferior film. Obviously a make-up vote by the Academy. When I first saw Rebecca years ago I fell in love with Joan, and I remain so to this day. She proved everyone wrong, including Olivier himself (who incidentally wanted his fiancee Vivien Leigh to play the part) who said she couldn't handle the role. Could you imagine Leigh as the Second Mrs. De Winter? No, no one could have been better than Joan Fontaine.I would like to address some comments made by other reviewers: First, the issue of lesbianism. After reading the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, I understood much better Mrs. Danvers obsessive devotion to Rebecca. Turns out she had been Rebecca's ""maid"", or ""governess"" since childhood. Strangely, we are not made aware of this in the film. Whether it was omitted deliberately to suggest that Danvers was a lesbian is anyone's guess. It's certainly suggestive, but it's hard to believe Rebecca would have returned any feelings to the loathsome Danvers, either for her looks or her personality. Danvers' obsession seems much more likely to stem from the fact that she had known and cared for Rebecca since childhood, and lived vicariously through her and her high social position.Second, the issue of chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier. It's obvious Olivier is dissatisfied with his co-star, and it creates an interesting effect. I see Rebecca as a story about a man perhaps incapable of expressing love. From their on screen interactions, it's clear to me that De Winter cares deeply for his new bride, but just doesn't know how to show it. Or perhaps his spirit remains poisoned from Rebecca's cruelty. Fontaine's character, meanwhile, is the personification of love and devotion, and will do anything for her Maxim. This is also the feel I get from the novel about both characters. What we see on screen is two people in love, caught in a spider's web woven by the ghost of Rebecca. And there's nothing wrong with that. They don't smolder like Bogart and Bacall, but perhaps they will learn to after the shadow of Rebecca has been vanquished.*spoiler alert* Another important difference from the novel is Rebecca's death. In the novel Maxim shoots her through the heart; on screen, he strikes her but she later stumbles and hits her head on a piece of ships tackle. This could have been changed because of the Motion Picture Code back then, which didn't allow for ""villains"" to go unpunished. If Maxim had killed her, he would have had to pay for it. Or, another interesting possibility is that Maxim lied about it. Maybe he really did kill her and made up the accident? Seems more Hitch's style. Intriguing, though unlikely. But, I digress.The storyline in Rebecca flows smoothly with a steady, highly suspenseful pace. Little by little, we see through Fontaine's eyes and hear through her through ears as more and more of Rebecca's secrets are revealed. We watch her painful ordeal as she struggles to force her meek personality on the imposing domain of Manderly. And in the end, she succeeds.The use of light and shadow in this film is unsurpassed in any black and white film I have seen. The presence of Manderly is constantly thrown on Fontaine's character through the ornate windows, casting their shadows on her. When Beatrice tells her in the study that ""Mrs. Danvers simply adored Rebecca"", we see a close-up of her profile in full lighting as she turns her head in shock and despair, and everything in the background fades to darkness. Hitchcock is showing us how heavily the specter of Rebecca weighs on her mind; she shuts everything and everyone else out.I could go on well past 1000 words about Rebecca. I even loosely based one of the characters in a novel of mine on the Second Mrs. De Winter, and in describing her I quoted Olivier, saying she had that ""funny, young lost look I loved."" Rebecca should never be lost or forgotten. This film remains an ageless, timeless masterpiece by one of the greatest filmakers of all time.",Rebecca
242,ankitmirinseth,One of Hitchcock's finest works,9,16 June 2009,"This was Hitchcock first American masterpiece which marked the beginning of a new era for Hitchcock. It was the first among the string of hits he directed during 40's and 50's. And moreover this is is so different from his other movies which generally revolve around some guy trying to clear his name and someone discussing a perfect murder. I cannot understand why academy didn't award Hitchcock an Oscar for this(though the movie got one) This is the story of a young simple woman played by Joan Fontaine who falls in love and marries a widower Maxim De Winter who is the lord of Manderly . She finds herself in a awkward position of the employer in their mansion with a fleet of servants to her disposal . But she finds that everyone is still in awe with with maxim's ex-wife Rebecca and no matter what she does she cannot fill her shoes. Maxim played by Laurence Olivier is a loving husband who loses his mind easily and bursts into violent anger sometimes. He is quite convincing as a man trying to forget his dead wife and trying to move on. But the most memorable role is that of Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper.She represents Rebecca in the movie and cannot accept new Mrs. DE winter as Rebbecca's replacement. She creates a mesmerizing atmosphere with her icy looks and fearlessness.The strength of movie lies in the impeccable performances by everyone especially the scenes the new Mrs. DE winter share with Mrs. Denver's. And to compliment this is the chilly music score by Franz Waxman.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent Ultimately this is a must watch for everyone.",Rebecca

244,huntermcintyre,Rebecca review,8,7 December 2017,I really enjoyed this film like I usually enjoy Hitchcock films. This one is a bit different however. His suspense element is still here but the films true highlight is its directing. This films directing is truly special and Hitchcock really uses the camera to get every reaction and emotion out of the actors. Speaking of the actors they really do Hitchcock's directing a favor because each of these actor play their rolls excellently. This film is a little bit different from normal Hitchcock films but it is very good and I really enjoyed watching it.,Rebecca
245,Loring,chilling,9,18 August 2002,"OK, so Joan Fontaine overemotes a bit.  But Olivier is excellent in his effort to act the carefree playboy haunted by his first wife, as is the spectacular supporting cast, the cream of British character acting of the 30's and 40's.  George Sanders plays the part George Sanders always plays (and it is irrelevant whether he is the good guy, as in the Falcon series, or the bad guy, as in most of his other films) and does it better than anyone else can.  Judith Anderson makes your blood curdle while she is being ever so proper and polite.  And then there is the first Mrs. De Winter -- ah, she is the scariest of all to poor, suffering Joan.  A simple but brilliant story by du Maurier directed masterfully by Hitchcock.  A horror movie where all the horror is in your mind, but then, aren't those the best kind?",Rebecca
246,FairiShadows,Definite must see no matter your tastes,9,12 October 2005,"I am no lover of the classics though I am a Hitchcock enthusiast. As with all Hitchcock films, this one is a great watch. It has an interesting story that will captivate any audience. At any moment you might think you know exactly where the story is going, but there are just enough twists that you're never bored and are more than likely surprised. The most wonderful part is that there IS a story here. It's not just the glue that hangs by a bead holding together great action or unbelievable mystery and intrigue, though there is a good deal of that as well. It's also a refreshing change that while the basic story for most of us today would remind of us other films, it doesn't smack of a tired story that never should have been retold or changed in any way. It is fresh in a dark and brilliant way. The pace is good and the acting is adept even though one might find it stilted in that reactions may seem canned. It is one of my biggest problems with early films and yet, 'Rebecca' is not limited by this. It is absolutely clear why it is an Oscar winning film.Great Sunday afternoon film. If you're looking to expand your horizons and delve into film that doesn't seem like it was made for the sole purpose of advancing a career and making oodles of dough, I suggest grabbing this one.",Rebecca

249,basford,"Only film I would ever call perfect, just brilliant!",10,13 February 2006,"'Rebecca' based on the Gothic novel by Daphne Du Maurier is the great Alfred Hitchcock's first American film. Ironically, it's more British than his British work is, and the great thing about it is that it brings out the spirit of the novel, as opposed to being typical Hitchcock work.What a cast! Laurence Olivier (my fave actor and god) as the sardonic Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter, George Sanders as the blackmailing cadish Jack Favell, Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers, Reginald Denny as the faithful Frank Crawley, Gladys Cooper as Mrs Lacey, Nigel Bruce as Mr Lacey, there are several others but we will be here forever if I name them all. But what I am trying to say, EVERYONE in the cast is just so brilliant, you cannot single one out as a best performance when all these talented actors all give it their 100% best.The plot is done straightforwardly and not in the slightest bit difficult to understand, about a man who has been widowed for over a year, marries a young nervous girl and brings her to his mansion. however, the memory of Maxim de Winter's first wife 'Rebecca' who was loved by everyone but was a cruel, spitefull, shallow rebellious woman, is constantly kept alive by the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers (why Judith Anderson never won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this I'll never know), the new wife and Maxim have to constantly battle against the dead Rebecca's popularity and it is a real scary journey for them, it's an alliance between a gawky virgin and a widowed sadist, a woman who's past is so blank that she doesn't even possess a name and a man who's past is so dark and horrible that he has contemplated suicide. You might find it a bit weird first time when you watch it, but honest to god, if you enjoy all genres of film, you will love this. As I said before, it is stupid to single out someone for giving the best performance in this film, but I suppose the one who commands your attention the most overall has to be Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers. Perfect settings, perfect costumes and a perfect film. I have no issues with this film at all. I am now reading Daphne du Maruier's novel and am enjoying that too. The novel is loosely inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Joan Fontaine played Jane eyre in a 1944 production of Bronte's novel with Orson Welles but was nowhere near as good in that as she is in this. However, back to the point, great great film. Please watch it when you can, you will love it. Enjoy.*Laurence Olivier was immensely rude to Joan Fontaine and caused her weeks of misery during filming. Why? He was p*ssed of the Vivien Leigh (his then wife) didn't have the part and took it out on Fontaine. When she informed of her recent marriage to actor Brian Aherne, he spat back 'Can't you do any better than him?' I'm surprised he wasn't hit.",Rebecca

Most of the film is awfully boring, needlessly drawn out without any substantial plot or anything to create tension and suspense and I was wondering what is the plot where is this film going to? For example the early part in Monaco where De Winter met his future second wife played by Joan Fontaine lasted about half an hour when it could have been done in ten minutes maximum.Only the last 45 minutes of the film reminded me somewhat of the Alfred Hitchcock dexterity but overall this film was mediocre and quite insipid, you won't lose much by giving it a miss and watch instead one of his top films such as the ones I mention above.",Rebecca
256,orcrush,"good, but not Hitch's best",9,9 June 2000,"A sprawling, romantic, literary drama in the vein of 'Gone With the Wind' does not exactly seem like a typical movie for the so-called 'master of suspense'. And in fact, for much of the movie Hitch seemed out of his element, setting up suspenseful moments, just for the sake of having them, without having any real bearing on the plot. In fact, the plot doesn't even seem apparent until about 2/3 of the way into the picture(which is when you're finally rewarded for enduring the first 6 hours or so). On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a director stepping out of his element once in a while, and the characters created by Joan Fontaine(who won an Oscar the next year for an inferior Hitch film, Suspicion, in one of the Academy's most blatant make-up votes ever), and Judith Anderson(as one previous reviewer alluded to, Cloris Leachman's comical performance in Young Frankenstein was a certain homage) are among filmdom's all-time best. Obviously, Academy voters, still on a GwtW high, loved it. I personally prefer his other nominated film of 1940, Foreign Correspondant, which was more of a typical 'Hitchcock thriller'. In short, it's a solid 8 or 9 film, but it's not a 'real' Hitchcock movie(one wonders if these types of movies should have just been left in the hands of romantic directors like Fleming or Cukor). Heck it's not even the best movie named after a woman('Laura' takes that prize).",Rebecca

258,blu_cu,WONDERFUL!!!,9,20 November 2001,"Rebecca was the second consecutive Best Picture produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick did the right thing in bringing Hitchcock to direct the film and in doing so, turned it into a classic. Hitchcock is a genius and throughly deserved an Oscar. Laurence Olivier plays the rich English owner of Manderly, Maxim De Winter. Olivier gives a fine and tortured performance of a man who is haunted by his dead wife, Rebecca. His performance was great but the only flaw is that his character is annoyingly unresponsive to his wife. Judith Anderson gives a chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers, the crazed housekeeper with a lunatic obsession to her dead mistress, Rebecca. Her lines are classic and it is she who gives the tense atmosphere to the movie-Hitchcock's dark and cold Manderly just enhanced Miss Anderson's performance. It is Joan Fontaine who really gave the stellar performance as the second Mrs. De Winter. She is a shy girl who suddenly marries the haunted Maxim of a great estate. Hitchcock originially wanted Fontaine's sister, Olivia De Havilland to play the part. Olivier wanted his wife, Vivien Leigh. Although both ladies are great actresses, I'm glad that Fontaine was cast because she made Rebecca what it is today. This was the movie that sprung Fontaine to stardom and her shyness of the camera was carefully inputed into the character of the lonely Mrs. De Winter. Her first words: ""Last night I dreamt we went to Manderly again"" sets context not only to the story but to the character of Mrs. De Winter. She is shy, unused to a formal life, desperate for Maxim's love and most of all, intimidated by the presence of the late Rebecca in Manderly. Mrs. De Winter was supposed to be a plain and mousy person and so, Fontaine had the misfortune of being a beautiful woman playing an unattractive one. However, Fontaine presents other ways of being unattractive--such as that Mrs. De Winter has absolutely no social skills. All in all, Fontaine gave a performance that deserved a Best Actress Oscar. Although she lost out to Ginger Rogers, the Academy gave a compensation Oscar the following year for her less impressive ""Suspicion"".",Rebecca
259,zemboy,Outstanding in every way,10,27 February 2015,"This is my all-time favorite movie and I'm 72 years old (making Rebecca three years older than I!) I won't waste space repeating all of the praise that's already been expressed by so many reviewers about the wonderful acting, directing, musical score, etc. I would like to comment, however, on the performance of one actress who never seems to get much credit. It's Florence Bates, who plays the rather short but important part of Mrs. Van Hopper at the beginning of the film. I don't think her performance as the rich, rude, self-centered American traveler abroad could possibly have been more perfect. She interrupts and rudely scolds her paid companion (Joan Fontaine), she pushes herself on Max DeWinter in efforts to scrape an acquaintance with him because of his wealth, she's totally repulsive and she speaks English in the uppity- rich Boston/Philadephia manner. She is rude and insulting at all times.Now here are some amazing facts about Florence Bates. Born in 1888, she grew up in Texas, was from a Jewish family, and was a talented piano student but a hand injury forced her to give up piano. She was a brilliant student and earned a university mathematics degree; taught math in high school briefly, then studied law and became the first woman licensed to practice law in Texas. She was fluent in Spanish and, after radio was introduced around 1920 she had her own Spanish-language radio program in Texas with the goal of improving relations between Americans and Mexicans. She later ran her father's antique shop, and when her husband lost his fortune in the 1929 crash the couple moved to California and operated a bakery. In California she acted in a few plays and finally in 1939 she landed her very first film role--in Rebecca! She ran into Alfred Hitchcock by accident and he knew she would be perfect for the part and offered it to her--her very first film role.Clearly a person of immense energy and multiple talents, she was 51 years old when she made this ""film debut"" (Rebecca was actually filmed during 1939 but not released till 1940.)As to her acting in Rebecca, the way she uses her voice, facial expressions and general posture and demeanor to create and project the personality of this relatively minor character is, in my opinion, nothing short of genius. If you have a DVD copy of the film, have another look at her brief performance (she is only present in the first half hour of the film.) Watch especially the scene at Max DeWinter's hotel room door as he announces to her that he has become engaged to her ""companion."" And watch the movements of the camera as it anticipates her glance toward the companion after DeWinter's hand gesture. I agree with reviewers who suggest that Hitchcock should have won ""Best Director"" because just this scene alone should have won the award for him, in my opinion.As to Hitchcock's use of the camera, I think it's wonderful the way he has the camera OFF the face of the person speaking and, instead, ON the face of the person being spoken to. Example: the early scene in which Mrs. Van Hopper announces the engagement of her daughter and her sudden decision to sail for New York. We only see the back of her head as she speaks--allowing us to focus on the full facial reaction of Joan Fontaine to this awful news.These are just a couple of the touches of genius in acting and directing that I appreciate in this wonderful movie. Virtuoso performances by Judith Anderson and George Sanders in addition to Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier and, in fact, great work from everybody involved.",Rebecca
260,kimsuzi08,"The great interaction between characters, space, and camera.",7,6 December 2020,"I really like acting. Not only Mrs. Danvers but also Mrs. de Winter, Maxim, and Jack Favell all seem absorbed into the role. They made the characters alive literally. Especially, I like Favell's face when he came down to Rebecca's secret and Maxim's clumsy movement. I totally agree with Hitchcock who thinks Vivian Leigh, whom Laurence Olivier recommended as the role of ""I"", is the perfect Rebecca.People say that this movie is the most different one from other Hitchcock films. However, the interaction between characters, space, and camera as well as the all-pervading atmosphere of gloom are obviously Hitchcock's. I felt captivated by using this movie in my current IPD research with the camera movements shooting Manderley around.(Spoiler)
~~The structure that Rebecca never appears in is really interesting. Rebecca exists nowhere but everywhere.~~I began to watch this movie right after booking the musical Rebecca Daejeon tour. Although the show was canceled twice due to Covid-19, I'd not finished it yet. Eventually, I watched it for a few months with keeping the chillness. I really liked that long waiting. I think I should quickly move on to the next movie, Psycho.",Rebecca
261,theconservativeliberal,Captain Misogynism or the master of predictability? Take your pick.,2,27 June 2008,"These lines of dialogue are a good summary of why Rebecca sucks.I'm not beautiful, or intelligent. - But you have other, better qualities. Like kindness and sincerity. - So let me ask you, what was Rebecca like? What did people see in her? - Why, she was the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.Either this is the worst writing ever, the worst character development ever, or a really pathetic attempt to be mysterious and complex, making it again the worst writing ever. Hitchcock is so blindly driven by his technicality that he actually forgets to read the screenplays he's turning into films. And if that's not the case, if he wasn't hearing impaired on set, he has the intelligence of an infant and the creative energy of a euthanised walrus. On top of this hysterical delinquency, I can't believe women's rights groups haven't tried to bury Hitchcock under the insurmountable pile of celluloid he cost the world. Every female character in his films is either retardedly stupid, socially inept, cruel and backstabbing or insane. I can almost see sometimes the bruises on these actresses faces from the beatings he must give them in their trailers each night.",Rebecca
262,sinel-47034,brilliant film by a brilliant filmmaker,7,3 May 2015,"I believe ""Rebecca"" is the only Alfred Hitchcock movie to win any kind of Academy Award. Joan Fontaine is excellent in this movie. She looks adorable and she plays the soft-spoken, stuttering, shy, self-effacing heroine well.Laurence Olivier gives his usual excellent performance. The end of the movie has the (now) usual Hitchcockian plot twists, and the viewer feels compelled to root for the protagonist to get away—not with murder, but certainly covering up an accidental death—that would have appeared to be murder.Another spoiler. Rebecca's suicide—by trying to get someone else to kill her—perhaps the resultant scandal being a form of revenge against de Winter—seems implausible. I cannot understand why it is universally accepted in the movie that Rebecca's diagnosis of terminal cancer is a motive for suicide. Most cancer victims I know fight like hell, though a suffering few may have suicidal thoughts when they start to think they are only painfully delaying the inevitable.Overall, ""Rebecca"" is a brilliant movie by a brilliant filmmaker.",Rebecca
263,fredschroeder-63011,Rebecca,9,7 December 2016,"I loved this movie. An early Hitchcock film, it resembles the certain suspense accompanying his direction. The eeriness of the old ms Dewinter, Rebecca, room allowed for the plot to build, a certain tenseness overtime those double doors popped up. the lighting was dark, a lot of the time it kept a majority of the shot in deep shadow. the deep shadow allowed for the idea of the unknown to build, similar to the threat of the old Rebecca. she was never explained, just mentioned and there are only reminders of her around the home. the eeriness builds with the coldness of the maid, the entire movie just build slowly upon itself. it is an excellent movie to preface the films Hitchcock was about to make, a wonderful predecessor.",Rebecca
264,asmgodoy,A classic by all means,9,16 March 2020,"Not always the title of a novel, or a movie, has to do with the main issue that is treated in the novel, or on the movie. It stands to The Name of Rose (there is no one called Rose in the novel), as well as to the Three Musketeers (Dumas tell us the story of D'Artagnan, and not the story of the musketeers, who are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis). It goes quite perfectly well to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca. A classic, by all means, Rebecca has been challenging its viewers since 1940, the year it was released. Throughout the movie Rebecca is the main character, she is everywhere, she is in everyone's minds and thoughts, but she never appears. We have no idea of how she was, yet she remains at the core of this charming movie. Sir Lawrence Oliver (by then very you'd and handsome) is a millionaire who marries a humble girl, played by Joan Fontaine. They live in a castle, owned by the sometimes irksome millionaire. But Rebecca, to whom the millionaire was firstly married, seems to be everywhere. To impose herself in this new and aggressive milieu the humble girl has to face Rebecca's ghost. Amazing, and not arguably up to date, due to the mystery Hitchcock carries on.",Rebecca

266,shahbaz-2,Hitchcock's Best,10,19 January 1999,"In my opinion this is Hitchcock's best. For sure there are a number of movies by Hitchcock which are almost equal in appeal, mystery and thrill, but, if I'm given the chance to select a best I would refer to this movie w/o any doubt. The other Hitchcock movies that I liked are (accordingly) North by Northwest, Vertigo, Notorious, Spellbound, Rear Window, Psycho, Birds and Suspicion. Yet to see some other good Hitchcock movies like, Strangers on a Train, The Rope, Lifeboat, Shadow of a Doubt, Foreign Correspondence and Dial M for Murder.Hitchcock never won an Oscar as best director. But this was the only Hitchcock movie to ever win the Best Picture. Joan Fontain gave her best shot as a confused housewife tormented by the memories of Rebecca. One of the best acting in the film history in the role of a leading female character. I was surprised to know that Fontaine didn't win the Oscar. She won it a year later in another Hitchcock movie, Suspicion. But whoever will see both the movies, must admit that Fontaine was hundred times better in Rebecca than in Suspicion.",Rebecca
267,ThingsAreLookingUp,God I hate how much I love Joan Fontaine's performance!,10,19 July 2021,"Apparently, Hitchcock was horrible with her getting her through what her character is living in the movie meaning constant pressure and a feeling that she's doing things wrong. Laurence Olivier was also awful to her but because he wanted Vivien Leigh to be casted (as usual). Well, I guess it worked, because Joan Fontaine was OUTSTANDING! She is probably the only old hollywood actress who managed to portray anxiety so well, probably because it was real sadly but god she was just perfect for the role! Yeah I know Vivien Leigh could have probably done a good job and it's not because she was already known for portraying a strong woman that she couldn't potrayed the litteral opposite because she's an amazing actress but like can we praise Fontaine a little more?My favorite movie of all time with my favorite actress! Also underrated Hitchcock movie with the most underrated Hitchcock blonde, ironic when they're both the only ones that got Oscars!",Rebecca

Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.",Rebecca

Rebecca is not only a classic, but it set a bar for film making and storytelling that is impactful even today. Joan Fontaine is perfect at depicting the sweet naivety of the young girl who, even in the book, has no name. She is no one until she meets and marries Maxim de Winter, played by an epically brooding Laurence Olivier. There is intrigue, suspense, obsession, and maybe even MURDER!

It is indeed the first of Hitchcock' masterpieces if one doesn't count his earlier British film ""The Lady Vanished"". One of the most memorable film characters ever is Ms. Denvers, the housekeeper who is still loyal to Rebecca. After watching this film, it is hard to forget about her extreme coldness and cruelty toward the young Mrs. DeWinter. Although this is not one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful films (most trained viewers can easily perceive how the story will turn out)it is one of his simplest and most emotional.

It is a fantastic movie, completely under- rated and one I feel which will be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to replicate today in terms of actors, atmosphere, locations and storyline. The actors were amazing (I can't stop praising them) Laurence really nailing the role as the torn lover between his guilt and love for his 2nd wife. Joan Fontaine shines as the 2nd wife, creating what appears an exciting, genuine chemistry with Laurence whilst retaining what appears like a natural sort of innocence, that makes her a joy to watch. If only their were more actresses like her today!!! The supporting cast is well presented too. With Mrs Danvers giving me the chills every time she came on screen. Poor Joan I felt so sorry for her! The suspense of this plot is what drives you to complete the movie like the 2nd Mrs de Winter (Joan) you wish to know what is wrong with Maxim (Laurence) truly.",Rebecca

Quite different from his other films, Rebecca contains no violent blood scare scene at all. But what makes Alfred Hitchcock talent is we can feel the tension atmosphere all through the film (the housekeeper's eyes to the girl, the weird west room, the sign tune of Hitchcock....). Joan Fontaine does a great help to the film as the The Second Mrs. de Winter. We have to mention without Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers),we can hardly imagine how it will to be. The film is really perfect until The Second Mrs. de Winter know all about Rebecca in the cottage. The after portion doesn't fully close to the beat of the film(Maybe director must make it a 2-hour-film to satisfy the company)After all,as a film won Best Cinematography & Picture in 1941 Oscar.

The film lacks gothic and mysterious elements that are present in Daphne DuMaurier's novel. I feel as if this film was rushed and there was not enough depth to the characters. The build up to the big twist was underwhelming. While reading the book, there was a lot of build up towards the end, preparation.

His abilities as an auteur are just beginning to develop in this haunting, dark film.  I read the book in high school and saw the movie several years later.  The interpretation is wonderful.  Joan Fontaine plays the mousy second Mrs. deWinter beautifully.  She is a bit more attractive than I had first imagined here in the novel, but her acting ability overcomes that minor drawback.  Also, for the time period, I could not think of a better actor to play Maxim than Sir Laurence Olivier.  Not only is he extremely talented, but he is exceptionally handsome as well.  He is a perfect match against Ms. Fontaine.  The first time I saw the movie, I immediately thought the young Olivier looked and acted like Cary Elwes (a great tribute to the latter!)

283,goatcheese-25746,Underrated Gem,7,16 December 2019,"Rebecca is truly an underappreciated Hitchcock movie. It's very Gothicly atmospheric and has a dreamlike feeling.The acting is particularly strong in this film. Joan Fontaine really sells the meek, naive wife character and her switch to a more powerful character is very noticeable, her character arc is enjoyable because of it. Laurence Olivier is charming but also brooding and mysterious at the same time, haunted by the memory of the looming Rebecca. Judith Anderson really does a great intimidating and unsettling performance, you really hate her by the end. An all round great cast.The plot was pretty engaging and intriguing, the memory of the titular Rebecca is successfully shown to be powerful with the lead always being compared to the seemingly godlike Rebeccca. All the characters are entertaining and interesting to watch. The plot twist is surprising, I didn't see it coming and it really made the third act more exciting.The set design was convincing in this movie, especially the imposing hallways and rooms of Manderley, Rebecca's room in particular. The flowing curtains seem just perfect to me.However, this movie could have been just a bit shorter. Some scenes dragged a little and could have been cut or trimmed down. This wasn't often though.Overall, this was a really good film that was very well acted and suspenseful throughout, with a suitably mysterious atmosphere. It could have been a little shorter but that doesn't detract too much from the experience. I recommend it.",Rebecca

286,riverspipe,Proof people praise what is expected to be praised,5,2 April 2005,"There are two moments of cinematic greatness in this film. 1)The home movie scene, and 2)the scene involving Danvers manipulating Joan Fontaine after the costume ball. But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again. But again it doesn't, and when the ending finally does come, it is of such an enormous magnitude that it feels too brief.Then there is the story, which I believe has a couple of plot holes, and realistic dilemmas, though I cannot say with absolute certainty. The film has a chance, but not without a reassessment of the script. Another chance at astonishing greatness blown.",Rebecca
287,Pimpernel_Of_Scarlet,The First Hitchcock Classic?,9,16 January 2009,"This Hitchcock film was the first he made in Hollywood and he thought it was a compromise because he did not have complete control. Don't let that fool you. This is a classic film by perhaps the best director in history and it offers a view of Gothic horror and/or mystery you won't soon forget.""Rebecca"" is nearly 70 years old and yet it still projects a surreal world that draws the viewer into its web. Laurence Olivier is convincing as the brooding Maxim de Winter--a man unable to forget his first wife, Rebecca, who died a mysterious death. That presents a big problem for Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. She is a young and fragile newlywed who finds herself in a dark and confusing situation. She cannot fathom Maxim's many mood changes and his cold demeanor and she feels everyone is comparing her to the first Mrs. de Winter.This begs the question why did she marry him in the first place? Was she blinded by his scholarly manners or his offer of a comfortable life? Whatever he presented in courtship changed as soon as he returned to Manderley. He never seemed to grasp the fact that she felt out of place and was confused as to her role as lady of the manor.Some argue that Fontaine was too weak in the role, but I could not find a false note in any of her scenes. She started out as a mousy girl in love who was dependent on a strange, distant husband for everything. But, she fought her way to the truth about the first Mrs. de Winter and became a strong woman at the end of the film.Character actors, a Hitchcock staple, are a big plus in ""Rebecca"" as Dame Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Gladys Cooper and George Sanders bolster the film. Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers, the manor's housekeeper, whose presence seems to cast a cold and foreboding pall over everything. Her formal manner also has de Winter's new bride completely mesmerized and the give and take between the two actresses becomes a battle of sorts. Maxim seems unaware of the tension between the two and he seemingly has no fear of Mrs. Danvers even though she is so much a part of his tragic past.Although unspoken throughout, Hitchcock resurrects the memory of Rebecca as a tool to haunt all aspects of this film. From beginning to end, there is the strange feeling that she is still alive somehow and has returned to Manderley to claim her rightful place.In 1940, Hitchcock could well have used color for this film, but black and white proved to be an excellent choice. The dark shadows and fog just make the mansion that much more eerie and that includes the billowy curtains, which take on a life of their own when the wind blows.This film was Hitchcock's first ""modern"" picture, seemingly eons away from his small British movies of the 1930s. It is a Hollywood studio film (in the best sense) and David Selznick's production skills are evident as the ""look"" of the movie is very good even by today's standards. Even if the director felt this was not his best effort, many critics think this is Hitchcock's first classic film in a long line of them.",Rebecca

Jack Favell seems to be a male version of Rebecca, who hates Maxim out of envy partly, but also because he loathes or is bored by most people -- similar to the way that Rebecca felt, we are led to believe. I think that this is particularly the case since Rebecca and Jack are not from the same socio-economic stratum as Maxim, who ultimately had the most material resources of all the characters. Jack is, in a way, an embodiment of Rebecca, as Danvers is, and he is obsessed with Rebecca, as most of the major characters are except the more stable Bee, Giles, and Frank.",Rebecca

'Rebecca' is a recommended classic for all ardent fans of Hitchcock movies. Not only the suspense gives us chills, the film has soothing love sequences between Laurence Oliver and Joan Fontaine. Joan as Mrs. de Winter steals the show with her innocent love over her husband. Judith Anderson's portrayal as Mrs. Denvers is one which should be noted. She simply stuns the audience with her dark brooding body language and the tone she speaks. The sequence involving her and Joan in the old Mrs.de Winters room speaks the work of Hitchcock.

293,everafter_tales,Simply the Best,10,8 October 2012,"I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max.Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day.For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing.Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well)'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.",Rebecca

The characters didn't reflect the writers picture of what they should have looked like and the acting was way over dramatized. It seems in many cases Hollywood ruins movies for the readers of the original books points of view. Was the acting good in this movie? Yes Was the directing good? Sort of... Was the casting correct and true to the story? NO I never understood why this movie was so popular... probably because most of it's viewers hadn't ever read the book before and since Hollywood loves to change things to make them ""better"" people didn't notice. If you want to see an amazingly accurate version of this wonderful book, watch the version from 1997 by Masterpiece Theatre staring Charles Dance as Maxim and Emilia Fox as Mrs. de Winter. The casting was PERFECT as was the acting. All the characters fit especially Mrs. de Winter who is supposed to be a little quiet mousy thing of a girl, very naive, who isn't all about glamor like the Mrs. de Winter depicted in the original film, who looked more like Rebecca than the character she was cast to play.",Rebecca

The way the plot develops in this film is absolutely brilliant! Movies today are so class-less compared to this. What a performance by the actors of this film. Joan Fontaine's portrayal of Mrs DeWinter is completely convincing and I spent much of the movie really feeling for her. In the scene when she finally stands up to Mrs Danvers (""I am Mrs DeWinter now!""), you just want to cheer out loud for her! After seeing this, I really want to see more movies staring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier to see what else they were capable of. The cast of this film are true artists who understood and got into their character, rather than making the character like their real personality, like so many actors do today. Sometimes I think it would be great if this movie were remade for today's audience, but it could never be done as well as this. A true masterpiece like this one should be left alone, as it will stand the test of time without any help.",Rebecca

297,Jayso311,Hitchcock masterpiece,10,20 May 2020,"A fantastic movie with a very intriguing plot and so many great characters. The two main leads play their roles perfectly; the mysterious Maxim, of whom acts very suspiciously throughout the film, and the innocent Mrs De Winter who gets involved in an unusual situation and naturally goes a bit crazy as a result. The two have great chemistry and their dialogue is enthralling to watch, culminating in an incredible moment between them near the end of the film where Maxim puts it all on the table. And then there's also the evil Mrs Danvers, who with her insane obsession of the late Rebecca will do anything to ruin the life of the new Mrs De Winter. I also really enjoyed Jack Favell, the snarky blackmailer who steals the few scenes he was in. The way the film switches from romance to thriller is perfectly done, and the many twists along the way make for an exciting watch.",Rebecca
298,ajsanvido,Alfred Hitchcock's Most Beautiful Film,10,12 June 2017,"'Rebecca' is Alfred Hitchcock's most beautiful film. Closely based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the film follows the romance and subsequent marriage between an unworldly young woman and Mr. Maxim de Winter, a wealthy widower and owner of the lavish estate Manderley. From its famous opening line, ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again"" the film transports us into a dream-like world where fears of unworthiness and incompetence predominate, and the specter of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, reproaches the young Mrs. De Winter at every turn.The casting in 'Rebecca' is impeccable. Joan Fontaine plays the wallflower wife (nameless in both the film and the novel) of Maxim de Winter. Fontaine brings to the role the perfect blend of hand wringing, stutters and stumbling around, while managing to look absolutely lovely doing it. Her performance is beautifully understated and full of sincerity and quiet charm. Lawrence Oliver was the obvious choice to play the moody and unpredictable Maxim given his earlier (and equally excellent) portrayal of Heathcliff in William Wyler's 1939 adaptation of 'Wurthering Heights'. However, it is Judith Anderson's haunting presence in the role of Manderley's housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, that really steals the show. Anderson captures the nuances of this conflicted, complex woman who is often a stronger and more compelling character than Mrs. De Winter, the dreamy heroine. The scene in which Mrs. Danvers gives Mrs. De Winter a tour of Rebecca's former bedroom is among the most powerful in the film.'Rebecca' is beautifully scripted throughout, drawing heavily on du Maurier's original text. One key difference between novel and film, however, is that Maxim's culpability in Rebecca's death is largely mitigated in the film version, while in the novel he explicitly confesses to intentional murder. One can debate the merits of this choice - it certainly brings the film to a more conventional resolution, where Maxim is permitted to assume a semi-heroic role and the demands of moral conduct are satisfied. But this comes at the expense of du Maurier's original intention, which would have allowed a moral ambiguity to cloud the interpretation of the characters of Maxim and, especially, Rebecca.Ultimately, 'Rebecca' is among the most lovely and elegant pictures ever made. It does full justice to Daphne du Maurier's complex novel about relationships and the judgments and circumstances that divide them. Highly recommended to all fans of classic cinema and literature.",Rebecca
299,Gene-10,Availability of Fantastic Classic Films,10,5 October 1998,REBECCA (1940) is one of the best films that I have ever viewed classic or otherwise.  A fantastic performance by Laurence Olivier which many critics will agree in most all his films. The settings used in many frames were super in presenting the situation being shot at the time.  Considering the time frame (era) in which the movie was depicting has to be a masterpiece. I further believe that it's just a shame that this movie seem to be out of print.  No one seems to have it. No one can order it. No one prints it any more.  A GREAT LOSS TO CLASSIC MOVIE LOVERS. GREAT MOVIE! GREAT CAST! MAGNIFICENT DIRECTOR!  WHAT A LOSS!,Rebecca
300,angelofdeath-3,Hitchcock's analysis of the past on the present,10,17 October 2000,"'Rebecca' is perhaps the best exponent of a film made on a material level, as oppossed to Felleni's films for example, that explores issues concerning elements of humanity such as guilt (or lack of it) and also the factor of the past creating a voice for itself throughout Hitchcock's adaption of the novel. These issues have been explored more times than anyone would like to remember, but in 'Rebecca' they find voice through Rebecca's ever haunting and ever intrusive presence within the house. Indeed, her memory has found itself to be present in every element of the film, including the sea of course, the letters, statuette's and most importantly every character makes her return into the present. Maxim is the only break in the chain as he wants to forget his past, repress it to the deepest recesses of his mind, whereas he finds this impossible due to her memory almost controlling his future on behalf of those other characters opposed to his ideal.This film begins as a sort of fairy tale in respect to the hauntingly relevant opening shot (again recalling a memory) with its long, slow camera zoom crawling along the twisted driveway to Manderlay, all of which is shadowed by the voice of Joan Fontaine who speaks in a sad and sombre tone attributing to the kinetic effect of this scene with her own dreamy commentary.Although there are many scenes of this film that deserve great merit, and it is still mysterious to me how Hitchcock's directorial maturity and hauntingly simple visual deftness was never recognized by the Academy in terms of best director, the other immortalised scene featured in this film is that which finds the culmination of the relationship with Mrs. de Winter and Mrs. Danver's which takes place, unsurprisingly in Rebecca's bedroom. Again the memory of Rebecca creeps into reality through the cruelty of Mrs. Danver's and the symbolic representation of the sea. The effect of the presence of Rebecca from this scene on firmly roots itself into the present- I won't spoil this entirely brilliant movie more than that.This is, to put it simply, an absolutely unblemished film and in my opinion, is in no doubt Hitchcock's greatest achievement (perhaps in part due to the innocently beautiful Joan Fontaine, not that the other actors aren't great also) or in the least stands next to his other greats 'North by Northwest' and 'The lady Vanishes' - although I must admit I haven't seen some of his films. Hitchcock's use of expressionism (most notable in his earlier films) was not pioneered by him but he certainly brought it more prominence than it had with the average movie go-er. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie NOW!",Rebecca
301,s_menchen,What Hitchcock was in the 40's,10,18 June 2001,"If one were to ask me who Alfred Hitchcock was, I might tell him/her to just watch ""Rebecca"". It is a magnificent piece of work, and I could watch it over and over again. The cast is terrific, the story couldn't be better, and virtually every element could not be improved. I've given it a 10! Suspense, romance, what more could one want from a movie?",Rebecca

Every time I run across it flipping channels, I have to stop and watch it to the end.  If you have not seen it, you should!!!  Joan Fontaine plays a plain (although JF is FAR from plain), young girl who meets the wealthy widower Max DeWinter.  Lawrence Olivier is sexy and complex as Max, causing me to fall in love with him.  Max's deceased wife, Rebecca, died tragically in a boating accident but continues to haunt all in the house. This is the best Hitchcock movie I have ever seen.",Rebecca

304,leo-357,My lifelong obsession,10,28 February 2007,"This is *THE* movie that turned me into a movie fan, specifically in the genres of Gothic horror and psychological thrillers. I was 11 years old in 1973, and my sisters were watching the Brady Bunch. I escaped to my parents room and the small B&W TV that received only four channels. Fortunately for me, one of those stations was the local PBS affiliate, and they were airing Rebecca.There's a lot to be said for a movie of this complex intensity that can keep an 11-year old in fascinated rapture for hours. At that time, I didn't catch the name of the movie, and I only knew Alfred Hitchcock from the syndicated reruns of his TV series. Some years later I was discussing movies with my then girlfriend and her brother, and I described the plot of the most captivating movie I had ever seen, but whose title I couldn't remember. Her brother immediately said, ""That's Rebecca by Alfred Hitchcock."" We rented it that night and the memories of why it grabbed me so hard the first time I saw it came flooding back. From that day forward I have been nearly compulsive about collecting Hitchcock movies, documentaries and just about any psych thriller I can get my hands on.If you are on this site, it's likely that you're already a movie fan, but check out Rebecca and it could bring your interest in movies to a whole new level.",Rebecca

306,bobcaronna,"gripping drama, superb",10,19 June 2011,I saw this film for the first time recently and there's no question it's one of the best films ever made -- it grabs and holds your attention throughout. But everybody says that sort of thing. What I want to add to the mix is that this is a film in which one of the major players (if not THE major player) never appears and in fact is dead. Who could pull that off any better than Hitchcock? I read somewhere that somebody (Selznick?) wanted a flashback during De Winter's 'confession' in the boathouse -- a flashback showing the events of that fateful evening -- but Hitchcock had the good sense to leave Rebecca unseen and dead -- the flashback would make her a 'real person' and ruin the whole effect. Good for Hitchcock. Why is Hollywood turning out only foul-mouth trash today?,Rebecca
307,jetk-1,Fails,3,16 June 2008,"This film is pretty much a disgrace to the book. It has terrible dialogue, music, and is very, very boring, not even in such a way that leaves you to hope for a climax, or some kind of abstract moral or psychological meaning, but in a way that makes you claw out your eyes with frustration that a movie can be so terrible.It is baffling to think that this won an Oscar, and just because you have a pretty face doesn't mean you make a movie good. And I'll add that the character of the 2nd Mrs. DeWinter is supposed to be dreadfully boring because she is supposed to be of no consequence at all. What a terrible letdown after reading the book.The only thing gloomy about the movie is that it actually exists.",Rebecca
308,jaaakez99,Observation,10,28 September 2008,"Does anyone else think its possible that Mrs. Danvers was either Rebecca's mother or maybe a sister? Given Hichcocks hobby of adding subtle items into his movies, this idea is plausible from the Director's motive. That Director's like to add their own styles to books and plots makes my observation also plausible. Couple of comments in the movie that have led me to this question are the Dr.'s comment at the end of the movie that ""Mrs. Danvers had been coming to see him for years"". Also that Rebecca uses the name Mrs. Danvers. The other thing that makes it possible is that Rebecca had a sordid past, according to Max's narration of their visit 4 days after their marriage.Also, Mrs. Danver's complete obsession with Rebecca, ultimately leading to her own similar deamatic suicide ( a wish to die in the same method as she believed Rebecca died), and destroying Manerlay in the process. That Manderlay was made into its current style by Rebecca also adds a bit more to my conclusion. It is also very obvious the cousin is not really a cousin for many obvious reasons. So he would not have known her past. There are a few more tidbits that can also make my conclusion plausible, but I will ask you to re-watch the movie with my conclusion in mind and see what you think.",Rebecca
309,rohitbajaj,Great movie!,10,14 February 2004,"This is one of the finest movie I've ever seen, the cast was excellent and the acting especially Joan fontaine was top-notch: she missed the Oscar though.

310,bdcharger69,Best movie ever!!!!,10,18 February 2011,"This movie is very close to the actual book, written by Daphne du Maurier. I read the book after I first saw the movie. The similarities are amazing. When I first saw this movie I fell in love with it. I never really liked black and white movies but this one caught my attention right off the bat. The love story is amazing. Alfred Hitchcock is an amazing man. I don't want to spoil the movie. It is a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson are well paired. The ending of the movie is definitely a surprise! It was a pleasure to visually experience the early way movies where put together and the difference between the 1930 to the present.",Rebecca
311,AugDog,Pioneer of the Used Car Salesman Character,10,4 July 2007,"Hitchcock deserves props for his role in developing the Sleazy Car Salesman archetype with George Sander's Jack Favell. At the beginning, Favell appears as a dashing, charming bachelor (think a more rugged Hugh Grant.) By the end, he is a sleazy, blackmailing, cousin-humping, used-car salesman . . . he literally is a car salesman (in a scene near the conclusion, he implores the chief constable to come see him if he needs a new car.) Hitchcock helped pave the way for future ""Sleazy Car Salesman"" characters such as William H. Macy's Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo"" and Robin Williams' Joey O'Brien in ""Cadillac Man"" to name a couple. Overall, the success of this film was due in no small part to the decision to cast the 20-year old neophyte Joan Fontaine as the new Mrs. De Winter; she played the role perfectly as she appeared to be intimidated and uncomfortable in her surroundings. This can largely be credited to Laurence Olivier and Alfred Hitchcock for being a couple of pricks. It has been widely noted that Olivier was upset that his girlfriend Vivian Leigh was not given the role, so he took it out on Ms. Fontaine. Hitchcock, not one to shy away from a little psychological manipulation, decided to further Ms. Fontaine's torment by telling her that EVERYONE on the set hated her for maximum character affect.If not for the overbearing score (it's like John Williams on amphetamines coupled with a deaf sound editor) this would be a great movie.",Rebecca
312,sunbrite06,One of the best,10,28 September 2004,"This is one of Hitchcock's earliest films in the United States that incorporates all the suspense and mystery of a true Hitchcockian thriller but with a more romantic feel. With an awesome plot and great acting we can really see why this won Best Picture in 1940. I absolutely love this film, it's definitely in my top three. The camera work is great and the acting, brilliant. Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine have great chemistry on screen, and the rest of the cast is wonderful, especially, Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers the sinister housekeeper. Anyone who loves, mystery, romance, suspense, or drama, can find it in Rebecca.",Rebecca
313,hilarygirl13,Joan Fontaine's character is nameless,10,25 April 2005,"If you are into scary movies, this is the best. My mom was jumping every five seconds and finally left after screaming her head off! I guess this is a spoiler--in a way, about the dress. The dress Mrs. Danvers convinced Joan Fontaine to wear--it was rather predictable. So, that is sort of a spoiler. Anyway, it was really creepy, and (another spoiler if you didn't see it) Mrs. Danvers' face in the end was REALLLYY creepy. But did you notice that Joan Fontaine is credited as ""the second Mrs. DeWinter, and she doesn't have a first name. Mr. DeWinter just calls her ""dear"" or ""darling."" She doesn't have a name, because it is overshadowed by the first Mrs. DeWinter. CREEPY MOVIE ALERT! This movie is not rated, because it is so old, but I would rate it PG-13 for disturbing images.",Rebecca

The Selznick/Hitchcock team may have been very strained relation-wise, but it proved to turn out one heck of a motion picture. The photography is awesome. The shadows cast all over Manderley are beautiful. The performances are dead-on. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar, but Judith Anderson is the best here. She never misses a note as the sinister Mrs. Danvers.The basic summary is this: Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) takes his second wife (Fontaine) back to his large estate Manderley, where his bride is terrorized by memories of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca.There is no other movie that can compare. A perfect 10.",Rebecca
315,lgirlproductions,A great classic movie,10,4 February 2014,"Contains spoiler alert. This one is probably one of my all time favourite classic movies. The intensity hits you from the opening scenes. Mrs. Danvers is one hell of a scary housekeeper. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. This movie is filled with mystery, murder, romance and a who done it plot. If you love the old classic movies and haven't yet watched this one, I would recommend getting hold of a copy somehow. A great Sunday afternoon movie to watch.",Rebecca

I strongly feel that Joan Fontaine is the most lovely lady to have visited this planet Earth! Her acting on screen, is an invaluable gift which is one of the greatest & finest things to have existed ever ! From the very first frame, she has more than lived the character.

Was yearning to watch a good thriller on the book, because it is one of the most spine chilling stories of those times. The fact that this thriller is made by Alfred Hitchcock has made all the difference. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are absolutely credible as Mr and Mrs De Winter, and Judith Anderson is terrifying as Mrs Danvers. If you've read the book, you know the twist at the end. But if you haven't yet, the movie is a treat for you. Every frame is delectable and worthy. The suspense unfolds gradually and at the beginning you wouldn't even guess what's in store for you.

319,LuuxeDelux,Answered Questions,8,23 March 2018,"I'm not saying that this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films (it isn't), but it IS one of my favorite books. Because of the production code being in full swing in 1940, several main plot points are either much too subtle or were left out of the film altogether, and I want people who have seen ""Rebecca"" to understand some of the most important things in the story.-First of all, why the heck was Mrs. Danvers such a creep? Because she was in love with Rebecca, who was using her like she used everyone else! Daphne du Maurier (the author) was also a lesbian, and this dynamic in her writing was intentional. If you watch the movie again with this in mind, with Danvers as a jilted lover who was upset by 1) Rebecca's cheating on her (and Max); 2) R's supposed pregnancy; 3) Rebecca's drowning; 4) Max's remarrying; 5) Rebecca's body being found (again); and 6) the new Mrs. de Winter's getting rid of Rebecca's things, it makes a LOT more sense. Trust me. Danvers was not *just* creepy / evil.-Why did the relationship between Olivier and Fontaine seem off? Because it was. He was distant; she was naïve; it was supposed to be a weird match. They actually only really fall in love when she helps him cover up the murder (in the book, he DOES kill Rebecca, not just cover up her death - the revelation / plot twist is not just that he murdered her, but that she was a really manipulative and horrible piece of work under all of her ""charms"", and that he hated her.The book is amazing. I won't tell you everything that Hitchcock had to leave out, but the film does seem unfinished because of it (and Fontaine overacts like crazy).",Rebecca
320,rutledgekenneth,You've got to watch this one.,10,15 June 2005,"This is an absolutely excellent movie. The acting is superb and the tension of the story grips you to the very end. It would be well worth anyone watching the film and enjoying the various twists and turns found in the movie. I would suggest that after watching the movie you should also read the book........but read the book only after watching the movie. Hitchcock is at his best in this one and makes use of some very good character actors. One of the things to watch in this movie is the entire lifestyle of the English characters and the way wealthy people live. It is extremely interesting to note various differences in how people react to things in a culture with class distinctions. The housekeeper in this movie is a fascinating and complex character designed after the typical English housekeeper. However, she is like no other housekeeper you'll run into. The main female lead could not have pulled this off any better than she did. The acting is superb and is so believable you find yourself forgetting its a movie. That......to me..........makes for good movie watching. Enjoy!",Rebecca
321,maillyndsay,"Fabulous, evocative, faithful dramatization...",10,21 December 2005,"Hitchcock does a typically superb job of dark suspense with an already compelling Du Maurier novel. This film is also notable as a period piece, capturing a niche of society in fascinating and witty detail. However it is, most of all, a damn fine thriller that one can watch again and again.Hitchcock remains faithful to the original novel (note that in the book, for example, the central character is never named); while ""Rebecca"" never appears as a character in the film and yet holds a magnetic power over the entire cast despite her absence.
