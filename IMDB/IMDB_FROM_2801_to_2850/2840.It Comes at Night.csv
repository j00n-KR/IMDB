0,SnoopyStyle,a little clarity needed,6,20 October 2017,"Paul (Joel Edgerton), his wife Sarah, and their son Travis are living in their boarded up isolated cabin in the woods. They bury an elderly man after he contracted a disease. The home is sealed up as protection from an unspoken outbreak. Will breaks in and is taken captive. He tells them that he thought the home was abandoned and he left his family behind to look for supplies. Filled with apprehension, Paul drives Will to retrieve his family. They are attacked along the way.This is an apocalyptic film stripped down to its bare bones. It has its appeal but the outbreak transmission leave me a little perplexed. It feels more like a possession than an actual disease. The info has been stripped out so much that the lack of an exposition has left some confusion in the basic premise. I'm not usually a fan of expositions but a little clarity is helpful. Sometimes, it's important to lay down a scaffolding to help build a solid structure.",It Comes at Night
1,claudio_carvalho,Could Have Been Better and Better,6,4 September 2017,"Paul (Joel Edgerton), his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), their seventeen year-old son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and his grandfather Bud (David Pendleton) live a reclusive life in an isolated cabin in the woods. When Bud contracts a mysterious disease, the family is forced to put him down and burn his body. During the night, an invader breaks in their house and they dominate the man and leave him tied to a tree in quarantine to know whether he is sick or not. A couple of days later, they find the stranger is healthy and he tells that his name is Will (Christopher Abbott). He explains that he left his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and their little son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner) in an abandoned house to seek for water and food. Paul and Sarah invite him to bring his wife and son to live with them so that they could protect each other. On the arrival, Paul explains the rules of his house to the couple and they share the labor and supplies. But paranoia about disease and the outside menace arrive in the house affecting the lives of the two families.""It Comes at Night"" is a thriller with promising beginning and deceptive conclusion. The plot is developed at a slow pace creating tension, including sexual, in the viewer that waits to see those that come at night. Unfortunately nothing but a dramatic paranoia happens disappointing everyone that was expecting a plot point or a big surprise in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ao Cair da Noite"" (""At the Twilight"")",It Comes at Night
2,nogodnomasters,Didn't you say you had a brother?,3,25 September 2017,"Paul (Joel Edgerton) a history teacher, does what he must to protect his family during the unnamed outbreak that appears to be an airborne pathogen with limitations outside the host as there was never any disinfection done outside of an occasional bath. A second family joins them, but Paul lives in distrust. We get to know the two alpha males briefly over a drink 50 minutes into the film, but essentially we know as little about them as the infection.On the plus side the film maker had them put a cartridge in the respirator which many indies omit. They wore the optional nose cups that prevent them from fogging up. The night time lighting was good and didn't show incorrect shadows from camera lights. The problem was, the characters were boring and action was sparse. You get the feeling early, they are going through the motions for some sort of twist ""see we are clever"" ending which didn't justify the boredom.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity.",It Comes at Night
3,kosmasp,Inside/out,10,12 February 2018,"Let's be clear about it: this is not a straight horror movie. It is a movie that builds on mood and characters. Especially the former, because a lot of things will go on in your head. If you get into it (and the movie dares you too, so no pun intended), there is a lot to discover. There are a lot of metaphors, there are a lot of interpretations of certain things.And there is the superb acting. Even when a character does something that easily qualifies as ""stupid"" (and I would call that out in any other movie too), there are reasons behind the behaviour ... or you can think of some without the movie losing any of its touch or it powerful impact. This does not answer many questions, which may make it a no go for some viewers from the start. If you like a challenge though and a movie that is smart and scary and confident in what it portrays, this is a must watch! It was one of my highlights of 2017. Watch it and cherish the slow paced burning and all the revelations that come in hand ...",It Comes at Night
4,Sleepin_Dragon,The rather good rating surprises me.,4,3 June 2019,"I'm all for appreciating and enjoying the obscure, but I at least like to have a level of understanding during a movie. This film left me feeling totally underwhelmed. The narrative was such that nothing was explained, therefore nothing understood, and the characters were such that I didn't particularly care what happened to any of them.The main problem, is that it's very slow, I forgave the first thirty minutes, convinced it would open up, and the action would begin, but it never did somehow, it remained flat throughout.So disappointed, I really looked forward to this, but was pretty much put to sleep by it. 4/10",It Comes at Night
5,jboothmillard,It Comes at Night,5,15 July 2017,"I don't normally see many films without seeing a trailer or any promotion, or with little or no actors in it I know, but this scary movie had fairly positive feedback, and I like to be surprised now and then, so I made an exception for once. Basically a highly contagious disease has ravaged the outside world, secure within a house in the middle of the woods are Paul (Loving's Joel Edgerton, his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), and their teenage son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). Sarah's father Bud (David Pendleton) contracts the disease, he is killed and his body is burned in a shallow grave. The next night, an intruder is caught breaking in, the stranger, Will (Christopher Abbott), is tied to a tree overnight to confirm whether he is diseased or not. The next morning, uninfected, Will explains he did not know the house was occupied, he was looking for fresh water to help his own family, Will offers to trade their supply of food for water, Sarah suggests Will bring his family with him to the house, reasoning more people would make it is to defend, should anyone else discover their location. Paul agrees, he and Will go to collect his family, along the way they are ambushed by two men, Paul kills them, but accuses Will of setting him up, but Will points out that he fought them also, relieving Paul's mistrust. A few days later, Paul returns with Will, his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and his young son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner), Paul and Sarah establish the rules they use to keep safe, including keeping the only entrance locked, keeping night time excursions to a minimum, and always going outside in daylight in a pair. One day, Travis's dog Stanley (Mikey) starts barking aggressively and chases an unseen presence in the woods, Travis follows the dog deeper into the woods before Stanley's barking stops, Travis insists to Paul and Will he heard something in the woods, but they decide to return home, Paul insists the dog knows its way home. That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather, he discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room, Travis takes him to his parents, then hears something downstairs, investigating he finds the front door ajar, he wakes Paul and Will who investigate further, they find Stanley bleeding and gravely sick, they kill and burn the dog. When Travis reveals the door was already open when going downstairs, Sarah suggests Andrew sleepwalked and opened the door, tensions begin to rise between the two families, Paul decides they should isolate themselves from each other in their own rooms for a few days, to calm down and ensure no one is infected. The next morning, Travis hears a distraught Kim telling Will they need to leave, Travis tells his parents Andrew is very likely infected, and as such, he may be infected himself, Paul and Sarah put on protective masks and gloves and take weapons to confront them, fearing they will steal food and water, or return later. Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive, Will insists his family are all healthy and demands to take food and water for them to leave, Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will and force him to step outside. Paul and Will have a brutal fight, until Sarah shoots and kills Will, Kim flees with Andrew into the woods, Paul fires after them, he kills Andrew, a hysterical Kim begs Paul to end her misery and kill her, and he does. Witnessing all this, Travis is dazed and vomits blood, he later spots signs of his own illness in the mirror, in the end Travis awakens with a full sickness, Sarah, also sick, comforts him as he dies, she and Paul, both infected, sit together at the dinner table in silence. I will firstly say that it is a very odd choice of title, there isn't really any ""it"" to see, the only ""it"" that be referred to is the disease, but anyway, the performances are all fine, the story is simple enough to follow, there are the small jumpy and bloody moments, but mainly it is creepy with the nervy atmosphere, unsettling dread, and the paranoia, a reasonable psychological horror. Worth watching!",It Comes at Night
6,Quinoa1984,"""Now it's dark"" - Frank Booth",9,8 June 2017,"It takes a considerable amount of skill to direct what is being advertised and I suppose in strict genre terms *is* a horror film (though I'd claim in the pendulum it swings more towards drama or thriller than horror, but I'll get to why it can be considered the 'H' thing soon enough). It takes someone though with guts and confidence to take a trope and to not only take it seriously but try one's damndest to revitalize it. The dream sequence is what I'm referring to, and horror movies and thrillers for so many years get lured into the easy ideal of, 'well, time for a character to have a dream and we'll make it look like the character is REALLY going through with this or what they're seeing and then BOOM, it's scare time!' If you want the cheapest of examples of this, Siskel & Ebert had a good highlight of one such dream 'gotcha' set piece in Jaws 4 of all things, but I digress.Trey Edward Shults gives his... do we call Travis the protagonist? I suppose so, considering we see so much through his perspective, but we do see his dreams. But this isn't a filmmaker going out of his/her way to make scares to mess with the audience; this is about the character first and foremost, that it's about what Travis is experiencing in that house that is full of, what one might call one of Travis's drawings that he makes, deep/dark values, not even shadows but simply the black abyss that makes up most of the house at night, and because what he's seeing and hearing and feeling, whether he's in that long hallway that leads up to the blood-red door (even from the trailer that door did enough to sell me on seeing the movie), or if he's outside and we're only looking at his face hearing a dog bark, or if he sees his dead grandparent, we're meant to be there WITH him. And Shults reclaims the dream sequence for a horror movie and makes it vital and more than a gimmick; it's part of the whole experience.Indeed the title may refer to how Travis sees things at night, when he's there in his bedroom or his special crawl-space attic listening in on the newcomers, Will, Kim and Andrew, as they talk or make love or, later on, when something bad is happening. Certainly the ""it"" doesn't really refer to the virus (let's call it 'Son-of-Captain-Trips' for all intents and purposes), as that can come at any time really. With the exception of Sarah, who I found underdeveloped, this is also a horror movie where the people feel like real people, and how you might imagine those in a high-pressure, hopeless situation would act around one another. We know things will likely boil to a head somehow, but Shults does a good job in his script keeping us guessing, and not in a contrived way; this could go the bloody route, this could go the 'love triangle' route (to put it another way, Keough and Harrison Jr have good chemistry together in their brief time one on one), or it could go somewhere else, like maybe we're told more about the virus or what led to this apocalypse. This last part Shults is least interested in. In a way there's a small undercurrent here, barely spoken but present, of many independent films where characters are in the woods somewhere and they... mostly talk, and that's it. Character Study Central.But It Comes at Night is more ambitious within its tight dimensions, and it's especially in look that this film is a must see on a big screen; the cinematography is, like many of the films A24 has picked up in its astonishing run of distributed product, presented in such a way that you're always on your toes, always meant to be in suspense, but genuinely so. Even when things seem cool or calm, or when those few times Shults goes for a montage showing some passage of time like Will and Kim getting adjusted to everyone else, the way the film is shot is unique and lends itself to adding the intrigue. On the way home from seeing the film, my wife commented that more horror movies should take a cue from this, that it's really not that difficult to simply *try* a little more, to not go for the easy and the lazy all the time.I agreed with her in theory, yet I think a film like this, or last year's Green Room or to a degree The Witch, takes someone with vision and a sense of not going the usual path (or Edgerton, who produced it, also has an eye on such independents throughout his career too). The only drawback or... I shouldn't say it like that, more just an observation, is that where this all leads to is a stone-cold bummer. This isn't to say the quality of the film suffers, it's only that one leaves It Comes at Night completely drained. I dare not say why that is, but I did kind of hope that Shults could've left the door open for something not so wholly sour by the end of it all. It's art, it's haunting, and it's depressing as all get out. But at least there's those dreams/nightmares to keep us engaged.",It Comes at Night

8,view_and_review,What a Letdown,5,12 March 2018,"What a letdown. I can't say it was a huge letdown because that would imply that I expected it to be great, but it is a let down which means I expected it to be decent.The movie starts with a family burying the grandfather who'd succumbed to and illness. Judging by how the family made sure to wear masks to do the job they were afraid of this illness and wanted to take every precaution. This contagion tale focuses solely on this family but then broadens its focus to include another family. It's a strange dynamic because two families are trying to coexist in a post-apocalyptic era in which distrust is far more common than trust. That's the setup. Where do they take it from there? I'll answer that. Nowhere. This movie goes no-where. It was a total farce, a total bait and switch. Scary movies in general are pretty lousy (although I keep coming back) but at least most of them have a definite aim, a definite goal. This seemed to be aimless and goal-less. I waited for something to materialize that I could sink my teeth into. Even if it tasted bitter or sour at least it would be something of substance. This movie had no substance just appetizer after appetizer to keep you seated. In the end this movie offered nothing but a grand dead end.",It Comes at Night

Very misleadingly titled horror film (for those with no imagination that is) about 2 families facing an unknown plague that threatens their physical, emotional and mental well-beings (to say the least) with plenty of dread and paranoia caked on. Filmmaker Trey Edward Shults employs all the ins and outs of a body horror genre film with atmosphere but skimps on the whats, whys, hows which is beyond frustrating and cops out in its final act (um, one too many 'dream sequences' to begin with).

10,evanston_dad,Feel-Bad Movie of the Year,5,15 November 2017,"Good grief, is this the feel-bad movie of the year or what?A family of survivalists have holed themselves up in an isolated house in the wake of some biological incident, the details of which are left vague, but which has resulted in a virus that kills anyone who contracts it. When another survivor with a family stumbles upon them, they must then decide whether or not to turn their backs or extend a helping hand. It's a parable that examines where the instinct to protect oneself and those he loves ends and the impulse for basic human decency begins.I guess I'd have to say that ""It Comes at Night"" was effectively done, because it left me feeling absolutely awful, and I had trouble shaking it. But I would also have trouble shaking the image of someone getting run over by a car -- no one would have to present it artistically for it to get to me. The final moments of ""It Comes at Night"" go places few movies dare to go, but it might make a viewer have to decide whether it's dramatically satisfying or cheaply manipulative. Grade: C",It Comes at Night
11,Wizard-8,"Not boring, but also not satisfying",5,24 June 2018,"From the description of the movie on Netflix - and the title of the movie itself - I was expecting ""It Comes at Night"" to be a full blooded horror movie. But in actual fact, it really isn't. Though there are a few creepy sequences, the movie is more of a straight drama, a kind of post-apocalypse movie that spends most of its time running at a fairly sober level. Actually, the movie being different than what I expected didn't bother me at all. What did bother me was that there are some key features of the movie that don't have enough explanation at all. For example, the part where the dog goes crazy and runs off, and a later scene about a door being open mysteriously. The movie definitely has some strengths - it does not spoon-feed its audience about the plot setup, instead making you learn little by little what happened. There are some tense moments, dramatic and/or creepy. And I wasn't bored at any moment. But the many unexplained questions that come up ultimately make this a (near) miss. Still, if the filmmakers attempt to make another movie, I will give it a look, since there were some good things in this film, and they may have learned from their mistakes here.",It Comes at Night
12,trashgang,nothing came at night,5,8 September 2017,"It Comes At Night, what a great title for a horror but after seen this over-hyped flick I really asked me that question, what did came that particular night? It's post-apocalyptic, that's all I can tell and some kind of virus is conquering the world but where it comes from, what does it do, nothing is explained.Does it need to be explained, no it doesn't but then you will need a damn good movie and sadly this isn't. Therefor nothing really happens except before the opening credits which looked promising and the last 10 minutes when things go awry at the house. In between it's slow moving and to be honest nothing really happens except a few nightmares again promising. I can dig slow movies but if nothing really happens then it isn't worth picking up. Nothing came that night, or maybe they are referring to the child...but again, he arrived at day. So at the end this wasn't good at all, great title, bad flick.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",It Comes at Night
13,deloudelouvain,What is coming at night? Because I still don't know.,5,30 October 2017,"It Comes At Night is a strange title for this movie because after watching it I still have no clue why they call it like that, it has nothing to do with the story. The story is quite simple with not much or even no explanation why suddenly people are getting sick. So the mystery element in the movie will never be revealed and that's always a bummer. It's just an average movie with a tiny bit of suspense but not that much to keep you really interested. The actors are not bad but they are not Oscars winners either. I've seen a lot better movies in the same genre so all in all I'm disappointed. I could have done something else instead of watching this movie.

14,christopher-underwood,one hell of a focused and horrific movie,9,11 July 2017,"I can appreciate why some are upset that it is not some traditional rampaging monster that 'comes at night' but this is one hell of a focused and horrific movie. And the real horror is the extent of distrust in others and it is very apt that at this moment in the world where everything suddenly seems a little uncertain that we should be thrown into this dark little number. The photography is spot on, the sombre score from Brian McOmber just right and, of course, it is the script that really wins the day. The performances are all good but if the script is right it is hard for competent actors to go far wrong. Kelvin Harrison Jr is a new name on me but he does a wonderfully convincing job in what for me is the crucial and most difficult central role. He grows within his performance from boy child to crucial adult and in the sweetest section of the film, in the middle, he is visibly charmed by the affection and playfulness he spies on the newcomers. Not as much 'action' as some might have liked but I was totally captivated at the start and as someone else has said, by eyes never left the screen till the end. Completely involving and disturbing and many have referred to this as post-apocalyptic which is not quite right because whatever it is that is happening - still is.",It Comes at Night
15,namashi_1,A Rare Horror Film!,6,31 August 2017,"'It Comes at Night' doesn't rely on cheap thrills or jump scares to get you spooked. Here's a (rare) horror film, that uses Atmosphere & FEAR itself to give you the chills. The film isn't meant for all, but, for those out there, ready to see horror with a more psychological angle, will be intrigued.'It Comes at Night' Synopsis: Secure within a desolate home as an unnatural threat terrorizes the world, a man has established a tenuous domestic order with his wife and son. Then a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge.'It Comes at Night' has a strong first-hour, where the tension & the spookiness kept me engaged. BUT, sadly, the second-hour is sluggish & the narrative doesn't go beyond its promising premise. While the atmosphere & the treatment remain suitably grim & eerie, the goings-on are loose & repetitive after a point. Even the climax, is a tad predictable. In short, 'It Comes at Night' has a chilling first-hour, but a disappointing second!Trey Edward Shults's Screenplay begins strongly, but doesn't go beyond its premise. How I wish the Writing as interesting as the entire set-up. Shults's Direction is excellent. He creates a bleak world of fear & fright, with a remarkable vision. He deserves brownie points for daring to make a Horror film, that doesn't follow the genre clichés. Cinematography is claustrophobic, but effective. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are well-done. Brian McOmber's Score is chilling.Performance-Wise: Joel Edgerton is competent, yet again. His portrayal of a family man, ready to do anything for his folks, is compelling. Christopher Abbott is natural to the core, as the other man, who'd do anything to protect his family. Carmen Ejogo, Kelvin Harrison Jr. & Riley Keough leave a mark. On the whole, 'It Comes at Night' is far from perfect, but its impossible to ignore as well.",It Comes at Night
16,Hellmant,"It's obviously not for everyone, but if you love quality film you should enjoy it!",9,14 June 2017,"'IT COMES AT NIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick written and directed by sophomore feature filmmaker Trey Edward Shults. It's set in a future world, where an unexplained illness has wiped out a large percentage of the population (and made everyone else paranoid of each other). A family that's survived in isolation, in a secure locked up house, invites another family seeking help to stay with them (despite the severe mistrust they have for them). It stars Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Carmen Ejogo, Christopher Abbot, Riley Keough and Griffin Robert Faulkner. The film had it's world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival (in Mount Hood, Oregon), and it's received mostly rave reviews from critics. It's also been a successful hit at the Box Office so far. I found it to be a very effectively made thriller as well.Paul (Edgerton) has established a very strict set of rules to keep him and his family safe (in a horrendous, not too distant future world). When a man, Will (Abbot), comes to his home looking for help, he's very quick not to trust him. Then, after the man explains that his wife and child are also in desperate need of help, Paul reluctantly decides to let Will's family come stay with his. Paranoia and mistrust for each other soon tears their uneasy relationship apart though.Once again, man is much more dangerous than any plague or monster; that's the basic theme of this horror movie. It's got a few moments of hope, and compassion, but ultimately it's a very disturbing and depressing film. Multiple people walked out of the showing I saw of it, before it was over, and several others vocally expressed their discuss with it when it concluded. I think it's a very well made and effective psychological horror flick though. It's obviously not for everyone, but if you love quality film, especially great horror, you should enjoy it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/hAV3iy1JkJ8",It Comes at Night
17,FeastMode,my notes,5,24 July 2019,"Well made but super slow and boring movie. had a some of really scary moments and powerful scenes, but also a bunch of times it would move at a snail's pace. also i am generally not a fan of psychological isolation movies (1 viewing)

i also guessed the reveal at the end that the boy was actually lying and was the one who was sick, his parents killed the family for no reason. pretty cool sort of twist, but it's becoming annoyingly difficult to surprise me. i still took that into consideration and if it did surprise me it wouldn't change how bored i was for most of the movie",It Comes at Night

19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"This taut, tense and gripping post-apocalyptic thriller has been misjudged by most audiences.",9,12 February 2018,"This taut, tense and gripping post-apocalyptic thriller has sadly been misjudged by most audiences mainly due to its misleading marketing, which billed it as a more typical horror film when an argument could be made it doesn't even occupy that genre, and yet 'It Comes At Night (2017)' is easily one of the most affecting and interesting films of the year despite its generally slower pacing and the lull in action during the second act. It's a layered and enigmatic feature which refreshingly boasts almost no exposition and answers only a handful of its questions, a piece which uses its ominous score and unsettling visuals to create its relentlessly bleak atmosphere, a movie in which the unnervingly mundane is broken up with explosive fits of painful violence that shake you to your core. The film-making is on fine form here, with long takes comprised of complex camera work and fantastic framing that effortlessly create a growing sense of unease, and even something as simple as the aspect-ratio is used to great effect, the black bars literally creeping into the frame during the movie's surrealist dream sequences (that may or may not start to bleed into reality) to create a claustrophobic sense of entrapment and subtle subconscious dread. All this adds up to an experience that sets itself apart from almost everything else in its genre, one that gets under your skin and leaves you thinking about it for days. It's truly great stuff, even though I would've liked the pulse-pounding and heart-breaking ending to perhaps be a little more ambiguous, that represents smart and inspired film-making done right. 9/10",It Comes at Night
20,bowmanblue,"No, it doesn't",3,18 June 2019,"I watched 'It Comes at Night' all the way to the end. I probably shouldn't. It became clear by about the halfway mark that I was probably not going to like it, but, by then, I just wanted to see where it went - if anywhere. And it didn't.The world's population has been wiped out. Nothing new there in terms of modern horror films. And it was because of a disease. We know this because the cast talks of 'infection' and wears gas masks when they go outside. If you're wondering as to the hows and the whys of this apocalyptic event then don't bother - it's never explained. But then that's probably the least of of this film's sins.I saw the 'screengrab' advertising this film on a popular online streaming website and - to me - it looked like some sort of monster. I therefore thought that the hideous deformed humanoid, combined with the creepy title indicating that some sort of threat arrived after dark, meant that I'd be in for some sort of gory and cheesy monster-munching movie. How wrong I was. I think if ever there was an award for 'misleading titles' then it should go to this film. In short (and I hope this doesn't count as a 'spoiler') nothing comes at night. It's about a virus.A family have holed up in a secluded house in the woods where they do their best to cut themselves off from the rest of society to avoid contamination. However, a man arrives and pleads with them to let him and his family stay. It kind of all goes down hill from there. Although, in the slowest way possible.I said I stuck with it until the end, just because I was hoping for some sort of answers. But nothing came. What you have here is a slow burner which, by the minute, makes you more and more desperate for some sort of big 'payoff' for all the time you've invested. And it never comes. It just ends. And I'm glad it did. Avoid.",It Comes at Night
21,ThomasDrufke,Sometimes It's What Isn't Seen,8,10 June 2017,"More so than any other genre, horror films are dependent on things like cinematography, mood, color palette, and most importantly tone in order for the film to be effective as a whole. It's interesting how many horror films today don't realize that it's usually what you don't see that ends up being scarier than what you do see. It Comes at Night perfects this formula and gives A24 yet another stylish horror hit.""Imagine the end of the world. Now imagine something worse"". I love that tagline and it works unexpectedly well here. There's something very Walking Dead-ish about this story, especially because this film is predicated more on difficult moral decisions the characters have to make rather than relying on jump scares and gore. The story revolves around a small family who comes across another desperate family seeking shelter and supplies as an unknown threat conquers the outside world. In this case, focusing on the complicated relationship between these families in a dying world is fascinating. It's not often you come out of a horror film raving about the tension between real people, instead of a supernatural force and people. In Walking Dead it's not about the zombies, it's about the people. Same goes here.Trey Edward Shults does a magnificent job directing his first horror film (previously directed a comedy), and the cast all do their jobs to near perfection. Joel Edgerton, who has made his career on taking on character driven stories, musters up yet another jarring turn as homeowner, Paul. Supporting performances from Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo, Kelvin Harrison Jr., and Riley Keough are more than enough to take this atmospheric horror to the next level. It may turn some people off who were expecting a faster paced supernatural based horror-thriller, but It Comes at Night is more than your average scare-fest. It proves what isn't seen can be more emotionally powerful than something on screen when done correctly.+Atmosphere+Mood overpowers jump scares+Morally difficult questions8.8/10",It Comes at Night
22,Cineanalyst,Banality of the Unknown,3,22 March 2020,"""It Comes at Night"" is the second picture I've seen from writer-director Trey Edward Shults, the other being his subsequent ""Waves"" (2019), and I'm beginning to think his oeuvre laborious. In ""Waves,"" at least, stuff happens and not just in the opening and closing scenes. There was a consistent tone to it, too, with an exhausting emotionalism that was nonetheless appropriate to its tracking of teenagers. ""It Comes at Night,"" on the other hand, makes Lovecraftian horror out of a post-apocalyptic survival movie. The basis of the fear here is supposed to be in the unknown, but we know exactly what to fear: the viral outbreak and the consequential inhumanity of people towards one another. The grasping for tension here out of, say, a dog running away in the woods after some unseen creature, a teenage boy having the hots for an older woman, or the general distrust towards each other in an effort to protect themselves is feeble. Even the gross-out nightmares related to all of this doesn't help much. ""It Comes at Night"" is a pedestrian misfire.",It Comes at Night
23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,5,13 September 2017,"It Comes at Night The scariest thing about an infectious outbreak is being quarantined with your family.Fortunately, the isolated brood in this psychological-horror has just received some unrelated visitors.Held up in the backwoods since a contagion wiped out the cities, Paul (Joel Edgerton) has successfully protected his wife (Carmen Ejogo) and teenage son (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) from infection. He lets his guard down, however, when a young couple (Christopher Abbott, Riley Keough) with a child and livestock comes knocking on their door.But when Paul starts to suspect that one of their guests may be infected both families turn on each other.Using close quartered confinement to drive home the paranoia, this atmospheric indy does the classic horror setting an injustice by not delivering the goods. The threat is weak, the tension is tepid, and the scares non-existent.Moreover, if you don't want houseguests during an outbreak just say you have bedbugs. Red Light",It Comes at Night
24,851222,"Not bad movie for those who enjoy ""these"" kind of movies",7,9 October 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""It Comes at Night"" (2017) isn't really a much of a horror movie, sure if you think close of what we see in the movie - its a true terror for sure, but its not much of a horror movie at all. It plays more like a survival story, not very original one, far from best and far from worst. If you did enjoy movies like ""Z for Zachariah"" and other similar ""survival"" stories set in some sort of post-apocalypse world or were some unknown virus has broken or whatever - ""It Comes at Night"" works on that level, but its more of a psychological thriller then anything else.Overall, i did enjoy ""It Comes at Night"" basically because i like ""these"" kind of small ""survival"" movies. Its far from best, but its not bad either. Performances were really solid and directing was pretty good. Its a very small and very slow movie so those who are looking for some big horror / thriller will probably be disappointed.",It Comes at Night
25,Platypuschow,It Comes at Night: What was the point of that?,2,28 May 2019,"For some reason the title really appealed to me, I think it was the nostalgia as that sounds like the kind of cheesy b-movie I grew up with. Let's be clear this isn't that kind of film at all and I feel it will deceive plenty of people.It tells the story of a family hidden away in the forest during an epidemic, things become complicated when a stranger darkens their door.The film is a slow burn and I love such movies as much as they next person, provided they actually culminate with something. It Comes at Night doesn't, it slow burns to a quiet fizzle.It quickly became apparent this wasn't exactly going to be action packed and that was fine, but from a psychological horror standpoint this still fails miserably.Starring Joel Edgerton who puts in a very tired quite frankly bored performance this is one of those films where when the credits rolled I immediately questioned what the point of it wasI don't know who the demographic is but I'm not it.The Good:Nothing springs to mindThe Bad:One trope I'm absolutely sick ofNot the most engaging of moviesCertain elements are head scratching",It Comes at Night
26,nairtejas,Capsule Review: It Comes at Night,3,19 October 2017,"For a horror film, It Comes at Night is too monotonous and therefore constantly boring. A family of three led by a rugged, shotgun- totting Joel Edgerton is holed up in a ridiculously expansive house in the middle of a forest. What they fear is in the air caused by an unexplained epidemic that has already taken the elder of the house. As a precaution they keep the doors and windows nailed-locked, avoid getting out at night, and use gas masks and gloves to protect themselves. Director Trey Edward Shults introduces a couple more characters to help the family cope up by dissolving their desolation and to hook the audience, but it doesn't work. Other than a few jump scares that I can count using a noiseless clock's dial, the film does not move ahead in the first hour, and it's only 90 minutes long. The peculiar percussion score is ominous and tells you that something bad is about to happen, but nothing happens. Like the characters, throughout the film I was thinking what I was doing there. While they struggled with survival instincts and a lack of activity in a house surrounded by faulty air and impending danger, I befriended my wrist watch in an attempt to coax it to move faster. It Comes at Night tries to explore the human nature and survivalism and succeeds a bit, but that does not mean it stops being unexciting. The teen in the film is desperate to explore sexuality but the only available option is out of bounds. A situation like the one in the film can limit life's possibilities and remind us of our primal forbearers, and Shults may have wanted to express that. But using a film that moves slowly to crescendo into nothing is not the best container for that purpose. It Comes at Night is an unpleasant film that gives you a bad feeling about life and I cannot find any good reason to recommend it other than the original score maybe. TN.",It Comes at Night

29,Reno-Rangan,It's always family first in the apocalyptic world!,6,14 November 2017,"It was not what I was expecting, enjoyed it though. The trailer, the posters hints something else. So I thought it could be a horror, but it was even a terror or a thriller flick. Well, there were a few occasions where it was edgy, though in the most of the film nothing really happened. Slow but not boring. A simple storyline, limited cast and a apocalyptic theme. Surely you would have seen hundreds of this kind, so when you watch it, you won't find anything new out of it. Then remains the question, is it any worth!I liked a simple take. Just like the film 'The Survivalist'. A small family living in an isolated place, but very precautious about any outside threat. The world is infected with an unknown disease and people are dying everywhere. Recently they had buried one of their family members. So they are not taking any chances with anyone. But now after a terrifying encounter, another family joins them and how things go on from there are the rest of the tale to tell us with a small twist.Well, you won't see Joel Edgerton doing a solo film often. But this was a different, because of a small budget and the kind of narration. He did good and so the rest his co-stars. Firstly, it was not a horror film. Then there were a few intentional scenes to scare the viewers, but it wasn't anywhere near to scary. I've watched the whole film and I still don't know what comes at night. Dreams? Nightmares? Looks that's what it implies. Other than that it is a drama film with a little thrill. It can be watched nothing more than once.6/10",It Comes at Night

31,cruise01,An unsettling direction that is better than expected but may not be for everyone.,8,14 September 2017,"It Comes At Night is a psychological horror movie that is unsettling with its tone, direction and even the music score. I was very impressed with the film since it kept myself engaged to the screen through the whole movie. Even once it was over, it kind of left you wanting to talk about what just happened. This is definitely the film that is best to watch with knowing less about it. And avoid the trailers. Also, it may be hard to talk about it without giving away any details or spoilers. From what I can say about the plot is about a family that is secluded in the middle of nowhere in the forest. And a rule about no one leaving the house at night and there one way into the house is locked shut. The theme and tone of the movie creates more fear on what is outside the house or what lies beyond the forest. But the fears within themselves that is inside the house. Even when characters are having nightmares that is foreshadowing or being locked up inside may create their own madness. The direction worked so well in building the mystery suspense. The script by Trey Edward Shults that is about a family secluded in a cabin and a little backstory information about what they are hiding from and trying to survive against does create some goosebumps. The music score was also great and worked with the film. The dream sequences can be a little unsettling and making you feel unease. This is definitely the film that may not be for everyone. It will have a divide audience that will like it or hate it. It can be slow moving with nothing happening at all which some people will complain about. But the whole purpose of the film is about survival and what lies within their safe haven. The ending does leave you with something to talk about. Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbot, Carmen Ejogo, Kelvin Harrison Jr., and Riley Keough were all great with their performances. Overall, It Comes at Night is a good film. The direction and tone is mystery suspense that builds up tension to the end. The acting was great. The music score was good.

32,zkonedog,A Film With No Context,3,26 October 2017,"I'll start by saying what ""It Comes At Night"" does well: It creates a spooky atmosphere. Here's the problem, though: The film also has absolutely no context or base, rendering that atmosphere moot and any plot/character development non-existent.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a husband (Joel Edgerton), wife (Carmen Ejogo), and son (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) living like hermits in their home that is all boarded up. They were gas masks, supposedly because of some sort of epidemic that is sweeping the nation. One day, another family (Christopher Abbott, Riley Keough, & Griffin Faulkner) shows up at their doorstep. The main family decides to harbor them...but will that turn out to be a good decision in the end?This was a very, very disappointing experience for me, especially considered A24's usual recipe for success. The main problem is that the movie explains nothing and has no context...not a good mix. It isn't ""about"" anything, and very little actually happens from start to finish. I've watched a lot of these types of films (especially ones recently made by A24 itself), and I can honestly say I have no idea what the goal of ""It Comes At Night"" was supposed to be. It doesn't really develop characters, you never really find out what is happening, and while the atmosphere can be a bit spooky, it doesn't really matter because the rest of the proceedings are such a mess.Bottom line: This is the first A24 film I think I've ever seen that I'd tell people to stay away from. Looks good, a bit spooky at times, but utterly pointless and nothing to remember from the experience.",It Comes at Night
33,eddie_baggins,A well established thriller filled with mood and creepy vibes,7,23 July 2017,"Horror buffs and gore-hounds will be disappointed, but this festival darling that has unfortunately been miss-marketed as a low-budget horror experience like The Witch, is an often tense and unnerving experience that will have you hooked for a majority of its runtime, until it veers a little off the rails with a disappointing last act.Bought to the screen with the help of its leading man Joel Edgerton, It Comes at Night marks an impressive sophomore feature from director Trey Edward Shults, who wastes little time throwing us into a world in which a mysterious virus/viral infection has taken over and Shults cares little when it comes to delving into the how's and why's of what's happening and explains almost nothing as we're instead joined up with Joel Edgerton's Paul, Carmen Ejogo wife Sarah and Kelvin Harrison Jr's often creepy child Travis and their battles for survival in a world gone mad.It's an often unrelentingly bleak film, from haunting opening through to even more depressing ends but Shults does a fine job of encapsulating the terror of such a situation as no one can be trusted and survival taking the lead in every decision or scenario.The mood created by Shults is impressive and for 30 minutes or so at films start you feel like you're barely going to get a moments respite but as Christopher Abbot's mysterious Will and eventually his wife and small child are introduced into the film as a potentially threatening presence, It Comes at Night begins to lose the tightly wound tension established early on as questionable decisions are made in light of moving the plot forward, scares become non-existent and a realisation dawns on us that the characters we have been attached too aren't as likable as we needed them to be.There's certainly nothing overly wrong with any of the performances, Edgerton and Abbott in particular impress with their turns, but with almost zero backstory and a lack of growth allowed for the characters, it's really hard to care like we should and when a doomed family pet makes us more emotionally engaged than the humans, you know there's a slight problem.Final Say – When It Comes at Night clicks it creates a fiercely intense vibe that makes for initially captivating viewing but the set-up to this narrative ends up being more interesting that what actually happens and as the scares dry up and you realise not a whole lot is going to actually come knocking when the sun goes down, It Comes at Night ends with a whimper instead of a potential bang.3 ½ attic eavesdropping's out of 5",It Comes at Night
34,TheMovieDiorama,"It Comes At Night is moody, atmospheric, tense...and one of the best of 2017.",10,9 March 2018,"The film ended and someone shouted ""that was the worst film I've seen!"" and I tried my hardest not to say anything back to the stupid woman. In an age of remakes, sequels and franchises it completely irritates me when people can't appreciate good cinema just because it's ambiguous and isn't constantly spoon feeding you everything. This was absolutely outstanding. Right from the starting scene, which has enough horrible imagery for any other film, I was transfixed. My eyes did not leave that screen. This thematic piece of cinema is extremely subtle, it's ambiguous and contains hardly any exposition. The themes of the afterlife, family and death in itself are well explored; I could analyse this all day! The plot of a family surviving a global pandemic of some sort, is fuelled on paranoia. The constant shift in the narrative from being able to trust someone to then completely reverse and grow suspicious of them, it's so realistic! We hold on to every word that these characters say because of how crucial one lie consequently could result in life or death. Again, subtle performances all round where Joel Edgerton yet again shines and plays the most cautious father ever. Very precocious yet is able to convey a loving sentiment beneath the emotionless exterior. He has that authority, if he says ""don't go outside"" my God listen to the man and don't go outside! But then are his motives always clear? That's the beauty of the narrative! Incredibly directed as well, the camera constantly moves at a slow pace to create the tension. The lighting is appropriately atmospheric, particularly as the son wanders around the house holding a lantern. His dream sequences are also unnerving, some seriously creepy imagery. Some may say this is too slow, but it's intentional in order to create the dark mood and for our characters to be fleshed out. It was just hypnotising cinema and, I have no doubt, it deserves the second perfect rating of the year.",It Comes at Night
35,Tweetienator,HYPNOS Almost Got Me,1,29 August 2017,"To rate It Comes at Night just 1 is harsh, acting and production value (tv-scale) is okay to good, but this movie is/was sold as a horror or mystery movie to me. Not once I felt suspense, horror, shock, adrenaline, whatever emotion or kick. Would they have marketed me the movie as a family-drama with some flu in it, well, maybe I would have decided to give a generous 3 or even a skyrocketing 4. But, as I expected horror and mystery and there was almost none (maybe 1.5%) it is 1. In the first hour, I almost lost the battle against HYPNOS, the mighty ancient Greek god of sleep. Maybe I just should have given in to his powers, none of my dreams are that, well, boring.Whatever terror is haunting the world depicted in this movie, in my opinion, it is the ultimate terror of the ultimate boredom. A death more cruel as being burned, drowned and hammer-smashed at the same time and on top losing one's virginity to Vlad, the Impaler. Well, for an experimental short (around 90 secs) the story maybe could have worked but not for a full grown up movie. The night is full of terrors and too much time we just follow some young dude with a slim notion of pursuing a daring career as a Peeping Tom. Oh, may the world fall down, but at least give man enough women to make some more babies ;) Well, the Western society is really on the downhill, one bad movie after another, I can't remember such bad years like 2016 and till now 2017 with such much bad and redundant movie-making. Every connoisseur of fine red wine would have already switched to whiskey pronto or would quit drinking completely if a vintage year would taste that bad. Maybe I should read old books (the new ones are terrible too) and not waste my time with ""movies"". Or I just shoot myself out of pure self-defense against the ultimate boredom this planet seems to head for. And all the praise by so-called pro-critics for this mediocre and redundant movie makes me almost speechless. But wonder I should not, did my poor eyes not see a few weeks ago a list of the best horror movies of all time (based on pro critics and their ratings, if you don't believe it: BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME is the list called) with Get Out (2017) as numero uno (Shining is 75, Jaws 15, Evil Dead 22), and this on Rotten Tomatoes. This massive inflation of 8s up to 10s or 80 up to 100 percent ratings may have two main reasons: 1) most of the critics are brain-dead, 2) they get a lot of Champagne, girls (boys), and other nice stuff for their nose, aehm, ""work"". Maybe both reasons are interacting somehow - and maybe watching every day bad movies make the less bad movies Oscar material. My conclusion, there is more rotten than just tomatoes in these sad days of decadence and cultural erosion ;)Last words: I suggest just ignore my review and watch It Comes at Night, afterward watch The Road (even if you already watched The Road) and I bet you will understand me.",It Comes at Night
36,matthewssilverhammer,"""The Only Thing We Have to Fear is Fear Itself""",9,15 June 2017,"How do you review a film too challenging to blanketly recommend, but is among the best this year? That's exactly my predicament with It Comes a Night, a movie marketed as a bump-in-the-night scarefest, but in reality is a deathly serious, brutally difficult critique of fear and isolation. Unlike your basic monster / slasher flick, this will disturb you on a deeper level, something not everyone will want. It's a taut, tight paranoia drama full of stunning visuals and killer performances, in which the monster is the state of dread itself. A small family is holed-up in a cabin deep in the woods, trying to isolate themselves from a world being overtaken by a deathly plague. With the pacing of a southern Gothic tale, the plot unspools with a mysterious naturalism, in which most of the horror elements (decrepit bodies, dark spaces) occur during nightmares and visions. In the reality of the film, the foreboding intensity that overwhelms the screen comes from a skin-crawling sense more than visceral fright. The looks of people's faces. The disturbing framing of a shot. The obscure design of a tree. The impending sense of death. It really is a rare beast of a summer movie, in which the filmmakers aren't just looking for money, but are looking purpose. With flowing camera movements, long-takes, uncomfortable focus and symmetry, and uniquely brilliant lighting, Shults gives us one of the most beautiful and intentionally visual films since possibly his last under-seen gem Krisha. The performances are remarkable, with Edgerton continuing his surprising ascent to being of the most interesting dudes in Hollywood. If you're looking for escapism, you'll be disappointed; if you're looking for greatness, look no further.",It Comes at Night
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Maybe not the ""horror"" you were looking for, but haunting in its own right",7,29 October 2017,"Horror purists have to be careful not to get duped because of films like ""It Comes at Night."" With its creepy horror title, a trailer that presents like a mysterious ""cabin in the woods"" zombie movie and a solid amount of critical praise, horror fans will undoubtedly give Trey Edward Shults' sophomore feature a go. They'll be disappointed, but that doesn't mean the film is a let down.As with his first movie, ""Krisha,"" Shults achieves a more atmospheric, natural horror in this film — brutally realistic tension between humans. Using an extremely vague post- apocalyptic setup for the action, ""It Comes at Night"" terrifies because its characters are forced to make decisions that would rightfully haunt anyone trying to make them — or live with their consequences.The movie feels as though adapted from a short story. Paul (Joel Edgerton) lives in a boarded up house in the woods with his wife, Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) and son, Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). Some disease has spread like wildfire and not long after having to put down their sick grandfather, they're awoken to an intruder trying to break through the red door that must always be locked. After interrogating him and checking for sickness, the man (Christopher Abbott) explains that he, his wife (Riley Keough) and child are looking for refuge. Trust between them proves to be on the thinnest of ice.Edgerton is perfectly cast as the ruthlessly pragmatic father. Much of the stakes and gravity of the situation gets communicated through his behavior and demeanor. On the other hand is his teenage son struggles with nightmares and must learn to become an adult under the extremest of circumstances. The other family's arrival cues up the rest of the drama, as the audience's instinct is to trust them, but Paul won't give us the satisfaction.The buildup is a little slow and unconventional, and the story simple, but the short runtime gets punctuated by a pulse-elevating climax that doesn't blow the lid off the whole thing, but comes to an honest breaking point. That's one respectable element of Shults' film — he uses the premise of a disease outbreak genre movie, but ""It Comes at Night"" plays out entirely as a drama, one that highlights some brutal realities about human nature.The authenticity of ""It Comes at Night,"" that this is what might actually happen in this kind of scenario, makes it more earnestly frightening than any film with zombies and gore. The entertainment value may not be as comfortable or quite on par with movies that get more creative and play for thrills, but Shults continues to create uniquely unsettling film experiences that suggest his best is yet to come.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The woman's husband ends up shooting her dad, and buries him as the grandson looks on in horror. We then get to understand that the family is living in complete isolation somewhere deep in the woods, and that a mysterious illness has ravaged the earth. What in the world is going in here? To tell you more of the plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature from rapidly up-and-coming writer-director Trey Edward Shults, who two years ago brought us the outstanding family drama ""Krisha"". Here he goes into a completely different direction, bringing us a horror-suspense-drama that is highly stylish yet bare bones at the same time. Remembering the credo that ""less is more"", the movie's tension hardly lets up as the movie takes its time to develop. All of these things are good. And yet, given the incredible critical hype and buzz this film has enjoyed since it came out a month or so ago, I couldn't help but be disappointed a bit. Yes, that happens when expectations are quite high. Along those lines: I guess I don't ""get"" the movie's title. What comes at night that would be any different from what comes during the day? All that aside, ""It Comes At Night"" follows in the stream of a very welcome return of the ""smart"" horror/psychological drama movies like ""It Follows"" and ""Get Out"". We need more movies like that! For whatever reason, it's taken me a month to see ""It Comes At Night"" in the theater. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this a there in Cincinnati was attended okay for a movie that's been out for that long.

41,jtindahouse,Misleading title will ruin the experience for many,6,13 June 2017,"'It Comes at Night' was a strange title for this movie. It implies something that it's not, and that's a real shame. I think a lot of people are going to go into this movie expecting something very different from the actual product. I went back to watch the trailer after seeing the film just to see how exactly they had marketed this. Trailers today simply have to be avoided as much as possible because they give away far too much information about the film. The trailer for 'It Comes at Night' does imply a very differently paced film and also a much more violent and horror-like tone. I actually had some people in my theatre walk out about half way through the film. They were obviously in the mislead category.The film as it stands on its own is actually not bad. It's a patient movie that I would call more of a character study than anything else. There's some superb acting from the entire cast which is an absolute must in dialogue-heavy films. The let down in the film is the lack of creativity in the story. After you've seen the film I want you to ask yourself this question: did anything happen, at any point in the film, that felt truly original and like something I couldn't have come up with myself? The answer may be different for different people, but for me it would have to be a no. The film never delivers a knock-out blow to astonish the audience.Sadly I think the wrong type of audience are going to go and see this movie. People are going to go in looking for a straight up horror movie (with a title like 'It Comes at Night' how could you not?) and are going to be disappointed. Similarly people who would actually quite enjoy the type of film this is will never get to see it because they will be put off by the title and the film it implies.

43,jadavix,Totally underwhelming,4,6 February 2018,"With the movies of M. Night Shyamalan, the world collectively lost interest in twists. When the entire movie hinges on some last minute revelation, and then the revelation sucks, what you end up with is the feeling you just wasted an hour and a half.A movie like ""It Comes at Night"" could be seen as a response to that lack of interest. It's a movie which tells you very little, giving you a lot to work out on your own, and makes you take it as an item of faith that in the end, all will be revealed.I just didn't think this movie worked. I got the irritating feeling early on that it wasn't going to play fair with us and reveal anything of note.If a movie promises a resolution that never comes, it better leave you with something at least as good to chew on. Take the movies of Michael Haneke, for example. He is the absolute master of cinematic rhetorical questions. All of Haneke's movies feature a central question that is never answered. The thing is, though, that his movies always ultimately demonstrate that the answer to the question would be meaningless, because it could be anything.""It Comes at Night"" doesn't do that. It fails on other levels, too. You get the impression that the film is supposed to have an atmosphere of dread about it. It doesn't. It's characters are uninteresting and impossible to care about. It has very little story. It seems to resort to violence to maintain interest.I guess, on one level, it was a success: I didn't mind the lack of resolution. I was just glad the movie was over.",It Comes at Night

Joel, Carmen and their 17 year old son Kelvin live in a house out in the woods, secluded from most other people. The beginning of the movie shows Joel and Kelvin disposing of a family member that has already succumbed to the disease. They wear gas masks and gloves for protection. Infected bodies are burned and then buried, information you might need, in case you are ever in this type of situation. Then, Christopher shows up, wanting some shelter and food. He says he has a wife, Riley, and a child that are waiting just up the road a piece. Should Joel take them in? Of course not. But that's what happens and everybody gets anxious and suspicious and nobody trusts anyone and tempers flair. It's not a bad movie but you can tell it's low budget; they don't go into much detail about several things, such as the cause of the disease. Or why Kelvin has such weird dreams of having the disease, his grandpa coming back to visit him, or Riley coming into his room for a late night visit-Well, that last one is probably because he is a 17 year old teenager. It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",It Comes at Night

46,jimbo-53-186511,Atmospheric with some tense moments but it all seems to add up to very little,3,11 June 2018,"In the midst of an outbreak of a deadly plague, a man and his family keep themselves locked away in their house and follow a very strict protocol (involving keeping doors locked at all times and only venturing outside when absolutely necessary). When a stranger arrives at their house offering to trade food for water the family decide that it may be better for both families to pool their resources and agree to let the other family stay, but can they be trusted?Director Trey Edward Shults does a commendable job in terms of creating atmosphere and tension (particularly at the start of the film). The isolated setting is used to good effect and the mistrust that exists between the families is a fairly solid base in terms of creating paranoia. Unfortunately, this is really where the praise for this film ends...I think it's fair to say that Shults does a much better job as a director than he does as a writer; not a lot is explained here and much of the dialogue is either uninteresting or does very little to drive anything forward. There is no explanation of how this plague began or how people get infected? What you're left with then is a bit of atmosphere, a bit of tension and paranoia, but nothing to glue everything together and with very little in the way of a story it does make it difficult to become involved with this film - it also doesn't help that the film feels a tad repetitive at times as well.Shults is a fairly new director and I can see some potential here; as I say some of the technical aspects are quite good and he also gets some good performances out of his actors. However, if he chooses to write and direct on his next project he could do with putting a bit more thought into his next script.",It Comes at Night

This film is proof you dont need millions of dollars in special effects and cheap ass jump scares to make a great thriller/ horror film. The setting is what makes a horror movie work if its added to a decent story. It comes at night throws people off because they right away think it has to be some monster or demon that attacks at night. This has no monster it's not a slasher it's a tension filled apocalyptic thriller with a dash of horror. It's the type of film that makes you say I wouldn't do that, or dont trust him or makes you say could I do that?? The monster is sometimes ourselves and our thoughts.

48,drownnnsoda,Apocalyptic mood piece book-ended by a middling conclusion,7,20 June 2017,"""It Comes at Night"" focuses on a family hiding out in a remote cabin home in the aftermath of an apparent viral outbreak that has been eradicating civilization. One night, a man attempts to break into their home. They decide to let him, his wife, and young son stay, but to their own peril.In the vein of many post-apocalyptic horror films, ""It Comes at Night"" takes a simple and familiar premise and executes it with a considerable amount of grace. The plot is almost skeletal, but writer-director Trey Shults does a solid job at creating a pervasive sense of isolation and abandon that is quietly haunting—at times the film almost felt to me like an ode to Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" set in a post-millennial end-of-times. For a horror film rooted in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the film is remarkably quiet and the action is few and far between, but even in its focus on the minutia of pastoral life and the dynamics between two groups of strangers, the film is never dull. This is partly due to solid pacing, and largely due to standout performances from the entire cast. All are believable and the scenarios and the way they are played out ring true. I will admit that I found the conclusion to be a letdown, not necessarily on the grounds of ambiguity, but more in that the otherwise stellar pacing was throttled by an ending that felt uninspired, no matter how truthfully it may ring. That said, it's a forgivable shortcoming in my eyes as the majority of the film was legitimately engrossing.Overall, ""It Comes at Night"" is a solid horror film that is maybe more of a dreadful meditation on survival and human behavior in extenuating circumstances than anything else that neatly fits within genre parameters. Truly commendable performances from Edgerton, Abbott, Ejogo, Harrison Jr., and Keough are reason enough to give the film a go in my eyes. If you like your viral apocalypse with a heavy dose of mood, this is a worthwhile watch in spite of its pyrrhic conclusion. 7/10.",It Comes at Night
49,davispittman,Interesting; not your typical horror film,8,11 June 2017,"It comes at night (2017) is a very interesting horror-thriller film. Now let me just start out by saying that if you are wanting to see this movie based on the way in which the trailers made it look, then you may very well be disappointed. The film is not by any stretch of the imagination your run of the mill horror flick, truth be told I wouldn't even consider it a horror film at all, it's a psychological thriller. Very big difference between a horror and a psychological thriller. If you typically enjoy psychological thrillers or if you enjoy a movie that has a deeper meaning than your average movie, then you will probably like this one. The plot is centers around two families. The main being a family of three and then there is a second family that is invited to stay with the main family because they're in dire need of supplies. It is set in what I can only assume is post apocalyptic world, based on what the main characters say. There is a known disease going around everywhere and that is why everyone is so desperate and the main family wears gasmasks whenever they go out. The cast includes Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Carmen Ejogo, Christopher Abbott, and Riley Keough. The actors all give incredible performances, Harrison Jr., Abbott, and Keough shine the brightest in my opinion, Edgerton is good too, but Harrison, who plays his son exceeds him as far as a compelling performance goes. The directing is on point throughout the entire film, I commend Trey Edward Shults for his clear talent that is displayed here. The movie makes you think, it is a complex and interesting movie to watch and then discuss afterwards. After seeing this film, I want to see The Witch, another well received thriller/horror distributed by A24. 8/10 for It comes at night.",It Comes at Night

51,aidanratesmovies,"Feels unfinished, but not a bad film all in all",7,4 January 2020,"Interesting, provocative, and at times frightening, but ultimately lacking in plot, completion, or any true satisfaction- It Comes At Night's biggest problems come when it tries to figure out what it is trying to convey. The film has many interesting and great complex moments, but all at its own expense, by not being able to truly connect them to one another and proving to be more of a artsy and flimsy mess than connecting the unique plot points it brought up in the first place. As for the performances, they are for the most part rather good, with Joel Edgerton, Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Christopher Abbott being the biggest standouts. The script can be both convincing and messy, and ultimately confusing at times, with a lack of any true conclusion and or story to truly make the film worth standing out. In the end, It Comes at Night doesn't have a entire clue what it wants to be, but it is full of plenty of good moments and good performances for it to prove to be at least a mostly entertaining watch- especially for horror fans.

52,s3276169,Deeply darkly disturbingly human......,9,30 August 2017,"Upon first inspection when I heard the title of this film I had expected a creature feature replete with a monster that lurks in the darkness. In a metaphorical sense that is exactly what I did get in a starkly primal, metaphysical sense. The darkness is what we, as people, will do and become, out of love.I will warn you now this is not a film to come to lightly. Its traumatic, disturbing and yet, oddly, it has its own deeply dark beauty. In terms of acting its hard to pinpoint any one performance. This is fundamentally a very quiet film with minimalist narrative that resonates through polished visuals and the actions of its protagonists. In my opinion this is really an exceptional film. Especially when you consider its modest setting and small cast. Not everyone will like it. Its a slow burn and its not your classic horror fare. Indeed I'd say its ""miscast"" as a horror. This film is something that's hard to label but all the more remarkable because of it. Nine out of ten from me.",It Comes at Night

Then a desperate young family arrives seeking refuge.This is one of the most depressing films I've seen in very long time .
The title might suggest that this is a supernatural horror movie but it's not at all . It's definitely a horror but I think the title refers to the dreams that Travis , the son is having .There isn't much hope in this film .
It's deliberately vague about what the virus is and how it's caught but one thing is for sure , it's causing massive mistrust and that's what the film is really about .I normally like films that are deliberately grim and have unhappy endings but even for me this was a little bit too much .If you want to see a better film that Director Trey Edward Shultz has made , watch Waves that came out in 2019 and also stars Kelvin Harrison Jr who's in this film as well .

54,rgkarim,Ambiguity Comes At Night,6,10 June 2017,"Horror movies, they seem to be popping up at random times during the year. Why June 9th called for one, I don't know, but nevertheless here I am writing another review on one. Tonight, we hit It Comes At Dark, a movie starring Joel Edgerton. Based on the trailer, I was expecting a thriller set out in the woods, as our main cast remained isolated in their proverbial fortress of solitude. And with good reviews on other sites, my expectations further swelled. What lies hidden in the house? Robbie K will try to answer with another spoil free review. LIKES:Unique Twist: I use the word unique lightly as most stories have been told in the daunting flood of movies. This film though treks away from the typical presentation of the horror genre, focusing a lot more on character development instead of just on the scares. It comes at night takes a more artistic explanation, using the metaphorical devices to build up the suspense, story, and spook factor present in the film. Such an ""original"" presentation is fun to watch, as the realistic atmosphere adds a little more edge to the movie. Creepy: If you've read my other horror reviews, you know I like a movie that balances jumps with creep factor. It comes at night doesn't rely too much on the abrupt symphony blares that shatter the silence, but instead focuses on the creep factor to get under your skin. The director brought three components that helped deliver the motive. The first is the use of shadows, letting the unknown hijack your imagination and pain the picture of what lies n the dark. Have a fear of the night, or at least night in the woods, then get ready for your worst nightmare, because that is what you are going to get. Second is the utilization of subtle sounds to further tease your imagination to create an image of what lurks in the dark. And finally, the realism factor. It comes at night's twist could certainly happen and realizing the fact spices up the terror. That's right, no over the top monsters, gratuitous maiming, or cheesy over dramatic stories about possession. It's just straight up creep fest, using simple scare tactics. Nice job guys.DISLIKES:Slow Pace: It Comes At Night does indeed have a unique twist, but it also opened the movie for a much slower presentation. After a rather tense opening, the pace drops to a snails run as you watched the family work to make a living in this post-apocalyptic world. Like one of the weaker episodes of the Walking Dead, much of the movie involves sequences of chores, upon chores, uponyep you guessed itmore chores. And given the short run time, I wanted more bang for the buck. Certainly it develops character (a plus), but without that exciting finish and tension to bring it full circle, the movie dragged and left me bored at times. Artistic? Yes! Realistic Yes! Needed all the time? No!Frustrating flashbacks: This movie has plenty of weird dreams and semi-flashbacks trying to tell the story and do indeed build up the tension of the situation. What is frustrating though is how incomplete these flashbacks are in the grand scheme. The director had a brilliant idea to tease you with the unknown threats looming in this movie. Unfortunately, the flashbacks, again, never get to the final answer, and all the extra flashbacks (while a great portrayal of thought and fear) frustrated me to know end at the constant interruption of the momentum and not providing the answer. I get itthat's the point of this movie, but come ongive us something. Ending: The ending is certainly not the typical, run of the mill finish you expect in most spooky flicks. So, this reviewer gives them props for that originality and significantly hard punch in the face. Yet again, the director's obsession with being artistic resulted in an ambiguous ending that drops to black just like that. After bringing things to a full boil, the big finish fizzles out with a hasty wrapped up conclusion and a silent final scene where nothing happens. No answers to what has happened to the world. No answers to the unknown factor that led to chaos (no clear one anyway). And no satisfying ending to complete the run. So unless you just like dark, vague, finales where you are responsible for piecing things together, get ready for a disappointing ending. The VERDICT:It Comes At Night certainly defies the typical horror genre, and finally injects some uniqueness back into the mix. A fantastic use of shadows and using the imagination to fill in the gaps amps up the scares and truly colors the unique ""monster"" looming in the woods. Yet, they went a little too far with this gimmick and the incomplete ending just didn't do it for me. Abstract thoughts and artistic quality aside, I can't recommend this one for the theaters except for those who like psychological analysis of a plot. My scores are: Horror/Mystery: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",It Comes at Night

Although, I will also admit that there are also many who loved this film, finding iot to be among the finest last year. It's a film almost as divisive as ""mother!"", and the main difference with this film's divisiveness is that I cannot understand for the life of me WHY exactly it is so divisive. I thought it was a brilliant, disturbing, tense, and, ultimately, extremely tragic and satisfyingly enigmatic horror drama about the possible dangers of heavy paranoia. The story it tells is not exactly a ""horror story"" really, but I feel as if it does fall under such a category as it is genuinely extremely scary, largely due to its portrait detailing some of the darkest recesses of human psychology and what animalistic natures burst from man when he is put in a survivalist scenario such as that which is depicted in this film.",It Comes at Night
56,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of It Comes at Night,6,22 October 2017,"""You can't trust anyone but family"". So quips the character of Paul played by Joel Edgerton. Joel yields paranoia, a quarantine protocol, and plenty of firearms in It Comes at Night (my latest write-up).""Night"" is distributed by A24 as box office poison. It is heralded as a psychological horror film but doesn't really horrify you. It Comes at Night is more of a paint-by-numbers thriller. It revels in pretension with tons of buildup, a forestry setting, and imposed, Hitchcockian nuances.With its title being seemingly unclear (I never figured out what exactly comes at night), ""Night"" is one of those movies that saturates itself. It thinks it's more clever, more complex, and just plain better than it really is. ""Night's"" plot is a mere snapshot of a family trying to protect itself from a contagious outbreak that has taken over the free world. The flick's script gives us a set of rules for safety against said outbreak. Everything is taken so seriously to the point where It Comes at Night almost becomes paradoxical in nature.In truth, I wanted to experience something more like the similar- themed Cabin Fever. That film upset me and occasionally humored my psyche. Regrettably, ""Night"" gave off a vibe akin to 2004's The Village. Not my ideal. It Comes at Night ""comes"" with a scattered, mixed review.Director Trey Edward Shults (he helm-ed 2015's Krisha) provides meh dream sequences, occasional zoom shots, and some admirable tension. Yeah his ""Night"" is moderately stylish but lacks considerable atmospherics. Shults probably could've benefited from the advice of Sam Raimi, Eli Roth, or even Stanley Kubrick's resonant ghost.Bottom line: Despite a decent musical score, some tightly would guises, and some effectively cautious acting from the leads (Edgerton, Christopher Abbott), It Comes at Night is kinda unceremonious. It is abrupt cat and mouse that misleads the audience with its fearful trailer. My rating: 2 and a half stars.",It Comes at Night
57,pc95,Well Executed,7,23 September 2017,"(spoilers) Budget-Minded thriller ""It Comes at Night"" is better than average fare though with a larger budget and a little more risks and revelations in its story, it could've been an outstanding movie. Director Shults has put together a tight, claustrophobic, and atmospheric horror, steering away from gore and more on lighting, color and sound. It's fairly minimalist style. ""It"" for some disappointed viewers is not the boogieman or a strange creature, but likely rather the plague. Actors give good performances, and the only real let-down in the story was the reaction and situation with the dog - which was unbelievable and manipulated for the story. I have a hard time with first allowing the dog to get away and second, abandoning it although a possible dream or other sequence may suggest other outcomes. There are unanswered questions left, and that's OK though. Well acted and conceived. 7/10 - recommended",It Comes at Night
58,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,It comes at night?,5,10 June 2017,"I went into this knowing very little about it, after only seeing the trailer once or twice, not really even knowing what the plot was about. After watching the movie, I'm still not sure what it's about.I don't need everything spelt out to me, but there are too many unanswered questions in this tale of two families holed up in a cabin in the woods, after some undefined plague/ virus/ infection has apparently, recently, killed a good deal of humanity. A few good twists do happen, as we wonder if the seventeen years old son and the outsider's wife are getting into each other, and a good late twist makes one wonder if Edgerton's character is really a psycho, a killer, as the outsiders eventually try to leave, and Edgerton kills them as quickly as he killed an earlier man, but again, there is no real substance, or even any type of context, for me to grasp on to and invest in the movie as a whole.2015's similarly titled, It Follows, had an abrupt non-ending, as does this film, but It Follows did it much more successfully, and made it feel like a complete story had been told. This film never climaxes so much as it just stops, with no questions answered, only more questions to ask. This entire film feels like it's act two, stretched out to a full length feature, but we never get acts one or three. Quiet, foreboding, with haunting imagery, excellent sound design and subtle music, and good use of several long takes, and for those reasons, I might recommend this to see at a matinée, but a shallow script sunk this one for me.",It Comes at Night

The red door has visual significance, but the effect is a bit blah and impractical. The nightmare scenes are good, with a chiaroscuro effect using the lamplight.

60,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""It Comes at Night""- A thoroughly engrossing and disturbing slow-burn film experience, though it is most certainly not aimed at mainstream audiences.",9,18 June 2017,"It was hard not to mark some notable similarities to last year's phenomenal suspense feature ""The Witch"" while watching writer/director Trey Edward Shults's remarkable slow-burn thriller ""It Comes at Night."" Most key among these observations- this is a film that it destined to split many audiences because it refuses to play by the rules. If you're looking for a spooky good time at the movies, filled with jumps and scares and gooey monsters... you're gonna have a bad time. If you want a classic ghost story or a silent killer in the woods... you're not gonna get what you want. If you just want thrills a plenty... heck, you won't even get that.However, if you're looking for something complex. Something challenging. Something that rattles you to the core and explores the concept of ""horror"" from an altogether different direction. Well, my friend... that's what you'll definitely get here. ""It Comes at Night"" is an incredibly tense and hard-hitting portrayal of the fragility of the human mind, and an intensely disturbing tale of how paranoia and fear can turn a person monstrous. It's a brutally simplistic and deceptively straight-forward tale that hardcore and open-minded horror fans will surely love. But be warned... this is not a film aimed at mainstream audiences. Much like other contemporary classics such as the aforementioned ""The Witch"", ""It Follows"" or the incredibly captivating ""The Babadook""... this is not a movie that holds your hand, and your enjoyment of the film will come down to your willingness to let yourself be thoroughly absorbed by it, as you analyze the meanings of scenes and moments for hours after seeing it...The film is set sometime after a mysterious disease has began to spread. Highly contagious, this infection inevitably kills all who are unable to take the proper precautions to protect themselves. Society has seemingly broken down. People are struggling to survive and struggling even more to find uncontaminated sources of food and water. Out story follows the family of Paul (Joel Edgerton), his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) and their teenage son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), as they simply try to get by and stay alive and healthy. But their lives take an interesting turn when they decide to take in another family from the outside- Will (Christopher Abbott), Kim (Riley Keough) and their young son Andrew. (Griffin Robert Faulkner) Though the partnership between the six people seems idyllic at first... various forces threaten to tear them apart, including Travis' growing attraction to Kim and growing feelings of resentment and paranoia between Paul and Will.This is a film all about atmosphere and performances and indeed, that is where it excels. Writer/director Shults proves to be a very capable and complex visual storyteller thanks to his nuanced and dark visuals and incredibly subtle writing. He doles out precisely what information in needed and nothing more in a wonderfully deliberate manner to help in the ever-growing build of tension, while also allowing his characters to gradually reveal their thoughts and personalities to the audience through action and reaction in a very stirring way. This is an incredibly well-structured work where each scene reveals a crucial piece to the overall puzzle of story and character, and it's aided by some absolutely mind-blowing and gorgeous uses of composition, lighting and movement with the camera. Just a masterful piece of work.The performances are a revelation. Much like in his own directorial effort ""The Gift"", Joel Edgerton excels in an wicked and sometimes heartfelt performance. He's quickly becoming one of my favorite modern actors and gives some of his best work here. I was also very taken with Kelvin Harrison Jr., whom portrays the character of Travis in a very sensitive but also unique way. In addition to feeling the same feeling of dread and fear as the rest of his family, Travis is also going through that strange period in any person's life where they are becoming an adult and starting to experience sexual urges and thoughts, and Harrison communicates this superbly, allowing it to aid in the growing sense of threat throughout the film. Though she sometimes feels underutilized, Carmen Ejogo has enough presence to ground the film, and she seems to be a sort-of anchor for the other characters to lean on in harder scenes. Special commendation also goes to Riley Keough and Christopher Abbott, who lend a great deal to the film and are both absolutely incredible.That all being said, I do have some minor- and I do mean ""minor""- squabbles with the film that hold it just shy of perfection. A few scenes feel tacked on and superfluous in the grand scheme of things, and I do think they will be obvious for anyone who sees the film. A few attempts at genuine scares fall flat for relying on conventions such as the ""false jump."" And I do think the film could have been tightened ever-so-slightly. A few shots here and there could have a few seconds trimmed from them, and the film would flow a bit better. But these are borderline nit-picks in an otherwise near-flawless work of horrific art. ""It Comes at Night"" is not a film that will appeal to many film-goers. But for those of us who adore cerebral horror. Those who enjoy analyzing films and their deeper meanings. And those with an open mind should all give it a chance. It's a fantastic release and there are too few films of this kind being made anymore.I give ""It Comes at Night"" a fantastic 9 out of 10.",It Comes at Night
61,arungeorge13,Wrongly marketed as a 'horror' movie! [+52%],5,30 August 2017,"Admit it, there are quite a few good things about the movie 'It Comes At Night'. The title and choice of genres allocated to market the film apparently aren't some of those. If you enjoyed last year's '10 Cloverfield Lane' which turned the alien invasion storyline on its head, it is exactly what director Trey Edward Shults attempts while narrating a post-apocalyptic tale about two families. The result though, isn't as exemplary as the former, largely because the writer/director fails to capitalize on the possibilities that his basic premise offered, even on a minimalist scale.The first half hour is spent detailing the post-apocalyptic scenario that Paul's family (comprising himself - Joel Edgerton, his wife Sarah - Carmen Ejogo and their teenage son Travis - Kelvin Harrison Jr, and their dog Stanley) lives in: their house which is almost completely boarded up except for a couple of doors, how they deal with the expiry of Sarah's dad Bud (who contracted the disease) and the entry of an outsider by the name of Will (Chris Abbott), who seeks water for his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and their young son Andrew.A few jumpscares aside, there's not much in the film to brand it within the horror category. Yes, there's a bit of a tensive mood in the household since it remains unclear how much of the information Will has revealed to Paul's family is true/untrue. The viewer is left perplexed on quite a few occasions as well. The unanswered list is just a tad too big for the film to be liked whole-heartedly: there's a seemingly romantic/sexual angle between Travis and Kim left unexplored (after a certain scene), there's an episode where Paul and Will sit down over a drink and suspicion is raised when Will almost utters something that doesn't quite fit with what he'd told earlier (but this is completely ignored later on), Travis' persistent dream sequences, and the entity that seemingly attacked the dog, but left Will unharmed (when he was left outside for a whole night)..what exactly was it?Now, I do appreciate films which rely on implied horror as much as the regular ones, but in 'It Comes At Night', even the implication fades out way too soon for the viewer to feel a sense of dread, especially in the final portions. The climactic showdown is definitely not what one would expect, but all it leaves is a bitter aftertaste, not fitting into the grand scheme of things.Performances are pretty even with Joel Edgerton leading from the front. The eerie aura of the house (and its surroundings) is captured well by cinematographer Drew Daniels (the night-shots stood out!) and ably supported by Brian McOmber's music. One does feel better writing and direction could've given a real makeover to the film, but given its current form, it could still intrigue to an extent, if treated purely as psychological thriller, instead of 'horror'.Verdict: Plenty of initial promises neglected later on!",It Comes at Night

The boy was all innocent. They got separated in different rooms as families to see if there's someone inflected. And the boy was crying Travis thought he was infected. After guns pointed at each other, will wanted some supplies and go but altercation went on and wills wife had to shoot while he was trying to bludgeon his husband with the pistol. Then will shoot the kid in the distance and then the mourning mother as well. It was such a morbid scene to see the whole family got killed instantly. Then Travis turned out to be sick lying in bed and dreaming of himself leaving the house at night. And the last scene was very harsh the couple sitting at the table facing each other with the pitch black eyes, infected.",It Comes at Night

65,maurice_yacowar,Two post-apocalypse families crumble under mutual suspicion.,8,12 June 2017,"In this superbly crafted thriller two families struggle to survive a global plague that seems to have eliminated mankind. And of course humanity. The heroes are a white Roman History teacher Paul and his black wife Sarah and her 17- year-out son Travis. Their heavily secured forest refuge is invaded by a white handyman Will, who persuades Paul to let him bring in his wife Kim and toddler Andrew. Paul has the water, arms and refuge; Will can provide animals for food. After their initial violent suspicion the two men settle into a partnership, but their suspicions and paranoia are never quite overcome. The relationship explodes when Travis' dog comes home with the fatal disease. Travis and Paul suspect Andrew may have it. Will senses that fear. His decision to take his family's fair share of supplies and leave leads to a fatal shootout. The film opens with Sarah's father dying of the cankerous disease. He's shot by Paul and burned to contain the plague. In the last shot Paul and Sarah sit alone at their kitchen table, Travis's chair empty, Travis himself dead by that plague.The plot presents two plagues. The physical is that disease that claims the grandfather, his dog, his grandson Travis. Will's family is free of that disease but destroyed by an alternative plague, a psychological one, paranoia. It's paranoia that drives Paul to conclude his guests threaten his family's security and life. The resourceful teacher's irrational fear has a rational basis: his family is threatened by a fatal disease and by violent survivors. Will's sense of that paranoia drives him to pull a gun on Paul to enable his family's escape into an equally dangerous outside world. Both men are good, responsible figures simply determined to protect their families. This is a tragedy of good intentions. Both are destroyed by the poison in the air, their mutual fear as much as the rampaging disease.The film carefully avoids any particular time and situation. But one passing joke firmly establishes its current pertinence. As Will and Kim frolic in their bed, little Andrew playfully stabs his father's feet with a toy. ""The terrorist is biting my toe,"" squeals Will. He repeats the line. So that's the plague we're facing these days which the film refracts through the two plagues of blood and fear. The current swell of global terrorism has bred a paranoia and mutual fear that threatens the social fabric, the community of man. That's the poison in the air which nourishes the two respectable families' fear, suspicion, and ultimately violent defence. Paul's mixed marriage is not remarked upon. It's just there, natural, warm, an image of an unusually healthy America. Nor is there any racial tension after Will's arrival. This directs the film's conflict away from the racial difference towards an even more worrisome conflict: between families with the same values, the same concern for their own, divided by a not completely unfounded fear and mutual suspicion. This film reflects upon the climate that created and is fed by Trump's six-nation travel ban, a cold-hearted and ill-calculated exploitation of people's desire to protect themselves and a fear of any refugee, however safe and kindred. The generic title confirms that direction. What comes at night but the monsters of the imagination, the fears bred by darkness and ignorance, the enemies we create by projecting our fears upon some Other.",It Comes at Night
66,thekarmicnomad,Buttoned up tight - but not tight enough,7,21 September 2017,"A highly contagious and deadly disease is ravaging the land. A man turns his family home into a hidden fortress where they survive by adhering to strict guidelines. The father protects his family by overriding any sense of emotion with logical pragmatism. Then one day a stranger turns up.This is a well made, tense lock-in movie. The scope is very small, a handful of people stuck together under awful circumstances.The acting and production is all very good. There is a real sense of the characters being torn by the need for survival and the futile boredom of being locked away in a shelter.The only downside to this film is the sense of inevitability. When life looks like it is going well you know you are only one sneeze away from things going to hell. This is standard to the genre but it felt a bit forced, like things didn't need to be as dramatic as they turn out. I didn't really feel the sense of paranoia that is building in the shelter. I think it is because the main character is trying to act so logically that when things get irrational it doesn't sit straight.I think this s very good film that just didn't work for me.

67,rockman182,It Comes at Night (2017),7,29 August 2017,"The trailer for this film was quite minimal. There seemed to be something horrific going on but no one really knew what it was. I like when a film doesn't reveal much, this adds to the mystique and heightens the intrigue towards a film. I got vibes similar to The Witch, although that may not have been very accurate I found this to be a similarly mysterious and brooding film with something haunting lurking around the corner. The film may not be for everyone but I think it was satisfying despite being very open to conclusions.The film shows a family of three who are living in their house near the woods. They don't go out at night as there seems to be some type of illness or infection spreading around. This is very much a post apocalyptic world, where resources are scarce and survival is key. They come across another family and give them shelter. All is not what it seems as the risk of illness is heightened and it becomes hard to trust others.You have to prepared for a film that is quite bare-bones and just enjoy the ride. The film uses its shadows, darkness, and tense premise to bring forth a thrilling film that doesn't need to do much to be entertaining. The film touches upon survival (as is usually the case in a post-apocalyptic world), fear, trust, and morbid curiosity. It's pretty well acted. Nice to see Riley Keough in good roles this year.Without saying much about the end, I do feel like the lack of explanations and air of mystery make the film special. Its really not a horror film in the sense of jump scares or blood and gore, but there is a fear of the unknown and the possibilities of being sick. As a matter of fact, I'd say this is a very realistic post- apocalyptic film. Which is what makes so much of it scary. This film is not for the weak of heart because it can be disturbing and depressing but its definitely worth your time.7/10",It Comes at Night
68,joebloggscity,Low key but gripping survival horror movie,8,29 July 2017,"This has turned out to be a really good year for films so far. There's been a spate of quality films that I've seen that really give you hope for the future of films. This is one I'd add to that list, a cool and hard edged suspenseful movie.What we have is another in the survival horror movie sphere, but this isn't really derivative, and if anything is original and intriguing. We have a family having locked themselves away to protect themselves from some unnamed contagious disease, and through fate end up inviting another family in with them to support each other. However, paranoia understandably prevails and inevitably leads to some confrontations.Joel Edgerton is turning into a mighty fine actor, and as the lead man in the film, acting as the head of the family, he gives a tense and unnerving performance that is just perfect here. The whole crew, none of the rest I can recall having seen before, are excellent. It's like a high-end stage play on film, and it works.The film is well filmed, it has the odd jump, but it's about the people not about the horrors far off. The people have to fear those around them not way off. In some ways, it kind of reminds me of 'The Road' but also the original 'Night of the Living Dead' movie. They both blend well together here.I'd recommend this highly. Tough viewing at times, but a good shot in the arm for horror films.",It Comes at Night
69,dave-mcclain,"""It Comes at Night"" is a tense, taut and sometimes terrifying, but frustratingly incomplete thriller.",5,10 June 2017,"Joel Edgerton already had an interesting and diverse career even before starring in the 2017 horror mystery ""It Comes at Night"" (R, 1:31). Edgerton was born in Australia, but unlike many actors from Down Under, consistently maintains a flawless American accent in his film work. He's versatile in his film choices, having done dramas (""The Great Gatsby"", ""Jane Got a Gun""), historical films (""Black Mass"", ""Loving""), science fiction (""Star Wars"" Episodes II and III), action movies (""Warrior"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"") and even epics like ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"". Edgerton has also shown significant versatility in entertainment mediums, having done major theatrical productions (ranging from ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" to ""Henry V""), television (about a half-dozen series, including ""The Secret Life of Us""), voice work in animated films (""The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello"", which was nominated for an Oscar) and as a writer/director/actor in the underseen 2015 mystery thriller ""The Gift"" (with Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall), for which he was nominated for a DGA award. Then there's his always outstanding work playing such a wide variety of characters in those aforementioned films – with more to come. So how effective is Edgerton here? A bit more than the movie as a whole, unfortunately.Edgerton plays Paul, the patriarch of a small family living in a secluded cabin in the woods, while trying to survive some sort of deadly plague which has affected an unspecified amount of the world's population and has had repercussions which are unknown to Paul and his family. They seem to have no radio, television, internet or cell phone service. All they know for sure is that this disease is highly contagious, it manifests in black sores and major difficulty breathing and it kills fast – unless someone else puts the victim out of his or her misery before the inevitable culmination of this mysterious illness. And it shrinks Paul's little family by one very early in the movie. Paul and his 17-year-old son, Travis (Kelvin Harrison, Jr.), put Travis' grandfather in a wheel barrow and take him into the woods where they shoot him in the head and then burn and bury his body, all while wearing gas masks and gloves. Paul's wife, Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), has said her goodbye to her father (also while wearing a gas mask), but now sits in her bedroom sobbing at the sound of the gunshot which she knows has ended the old man's life.That night, the sound of someone in the house startles everyone awake. Paul and Travis race to the back door, masks and gloves in place and guns drawn. They discover a 20-something man whom Paul knocks unconscious, wheels outside and ties to a tree for the night. The next morning, with the man showing no signs of being sick, Paul takes the gag out of his mouth and demands answers. The man says that his name is Will (Christopher Abbott) and that he only broke in to the house because he thought it was unoccupied and he was looking for food, water and other supplies. Will also says that his wife, Kim (Riley Keough), and little boy, Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner), are holed up in a small cabin 50 miles away, with plenty of food (including live animals), but are lacking in fresh water and other necessities. Paul and Sarah discuss what to do about Paul. Letting him go might endanger Paul's family later, killing him would probably doom Will's family (assuming he's telling the truth about them), taking Will's family in would increase the numbers that could defend the house but might expose Paul's family to other dangers. These are the kinds of ethical and practical concerns that become life-and-death dilemmas in this film.""It Comes at Night"" is a tense, taut and sometimes terrifying, but frustratingly incomplete thriller. Take the title, for starters. The screenplay, by Trey Edward Shults (who also directs), never makes clear what ""it"" is or why it comes at night. The movie also gives us no explanation of what this deadly disease is, where it came from, when it started, why Paul and his family live where and how they do or how they learned what to do to survive. Watching this movie is like starting TV's ""The Walking Dead"" at season 2 – and with no flashbacks – except that, in this case, the dead don't morph into zombies. The film's claustrophobic nature is reminiscent of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", but with fewer answers. The character studies and the morality play that this movie gives us work well, but Shults has simply stripped too much meat from the bones of what is a very good story. ""It Comes at Night"" is creative, interesting and well-acted, but would have been more effective and more entertaining with just a little bit more. ""B-""",It Comes at Night

All we know is there's been some kind of pandemic and the plague is spread by any physical contact, everyone needs to maintain some very special precautions to stay safe. The scenes are dark with atmospheric lanterns lighting the interiors and causing a claustrophobic feeling. The film is a slow burner during the character building sections, where two families are thrown together, each are struggling to survive.

73,RussHog,Above average late night Netflix movie,7,11 June 2017,This is a post apocalyptic movie about two families in a home amid the woods - and outside there is a plague that has killed seemingly most of humanity. These character's have few answers and so the audience gets few answers as well. The two families have a brief opportunity to start a habitat unit where they could potentially create a small civilization and preserve a glimmer of hope for humanity's future - but in the end they fall to paranoia and destroy their future. There is a lot of stuff that makes no sense. The idea is that if you go outside at night the plague can get you *but people go outside anyhow? Also - early on a man hits another man in the head with a gun and he is knocked unconscious - but the idea a gun to the head can knock a character out is textbook bad writing for plot convenience. However - the acting is good - the sound fx are great - the lighting is nice - and there are some really strong moments. I think the moral of the story is that for humanity to survive we have to trust one another - and we may think the terror comes from beyond but it comes from within to destroy us.

You are waiting to see what is happening, but you do not see what is happening. To me at least, that leaves me very disappointed.The actors are very good, you can not say no. They do what they can and do it very well. But you can not help thinking, what scares you? Photography uses it well to hide things, sometimes you would like to see more of what you are seeing. I imagine that when they do not know how to do better, they use that trick to cover failures.The address, counting that I was very disappointed, that I was left with the desire.

It also has a very misleading title because after watching it, it leaves you wondering what exactly was it that came at night. The only thing that comes with this movie is sheer boredom and a seemingly endless tale of a whole pile of nothing.The people who have rated this film quite highly must have seen a completely different movie from what I watched as when I read some of the reviews they are definitely not describing a film that I had just seen. ""Skillfully directed"", ""masterpiece"", ""fantastic"", and ""extremely well crafted"" to quote a few adjectives that people have used for this nonsense.

You do keep watching because you want to see if it DOES pick up, gets more interesting or just gets better in general but alas it does none of those and watching leaves turn brown during the Autumn is actually more interesting than what happens in this movie.The only plus point for me throughout the film was that it IS well acted and the characters are all pretty believable as they are trying to just survive whatever it is that has not long happened to the world.This really is a movie to avoid truly avoid though.It Comes At Night?

what follows is a series of events more suited for a drama film than a straight up horror one. Certain threads aren't quite picked up upon (like Travis's recurring nightmares), but ultimately every thing that happens up until the ending breakdown are seemingly not related to anything supernatural but simple human paranoia and misunderstandings.Virtually every scene had me completely tense and agitated, with an unresolved ending that has all the hallmarks of a good and likely highly divisive movie",It Comes at Night
79,ronakkotian,An ambiguous psychological thriller with solid tension,8,7 September 2021,"Two years ago, Trey Edward Shults impressed me a lot with his latest film, Waves, and I've been wanting to check out his other films ever since. It Comes at Night is very different from Waves but it's another triumph for the director.It Comes at Night follows a family living in a remote home in the woods. One day, another family arrives to seek refuge leading to trust issues, fear and paranoia.What got me so interested in this film was not only because of Trey Edward Shults but also the divisive opinions on the film. It's clear that the marketing was way off in terms of getting across what the film was actually about. To be clear, this is NOT a monster movie. I'll be hesitant to even call this a horror film as what plays out is more of a psychological thriller. Shults creates this world and gives information about it without revealing much. We get a basic outline of the living conditions these characters are in and only know as much as they do. Limiting our knowledge of the film's outside world was a great choice by Shults as it allowed us to connect with the characters and the situation they're in. The level of questions Shults leaves up to interpretation in relation to the state of the film's world enabled me to feel the same level of fear and paranoia the characters were going through. What added to the tension was the amasing score by Brian McOmber. It was haunting to listen to and managed to instill a level of eerieness to the atmosphere which felt very necessary and purposeful to the overall story. Another element, which Shults used heavily in Waves also, was the changing aspect ratio. The aspect ratio changes play a huge role in understanding the characters' state of mind, particularly Travis's, and becomes very important towards the fantastic climax.The film is small in scale and has very few actors but every single person delivered a strong performance. Joel Edgerton was fantastic as the paranoid father in the family. I loved Kelvin Harrison Jr in Waves and he puts forth another terrific performance as the troubled son, Travis. Christopher Abbott was another standout and played the role of a suspicious person very well. Carmen Ejogo and Riley Keough were also really good as the mothers of their family. The only real issue I have is the use of a jumpscare in the beginning which felt like a cheap way to get a scare out of the audience.Trey Edward Shults is proving to be a very promising director in my eyes. It Comes at Night is a very polarising film that leaves us with few answers but it's that exact ambiguity that kept the film engaging and fresh in my mind. By making two polar opposite films, It Comes at Night and Waves, Shults has not only shown his skill as a storyteller but also his versatility.",It Comes at Night
80,CineMuseFilms,a chilling dystopian tale of inner demons,7,10 July 2017,"Of all genres, the dystopian horror film has the greatest potential to disappoint or disturb. Supernatural or science fiction demons might be temporarily unnerving but films about unseen terror can reach deep into our psyche. The film It Comes at Night (2017) is an example of how less is often more in cinema: a low-budget film that avoids the usual digital spooks to focus on primal fear and survival.The storyline and setting are minimalist. Without any narrative clues, we abruptly join a panicked family in an isolated forest cabin about to dispose of a family member who has broken out in some form of disfiguring sickness. We hear heavy breathing behind masks and follow a still conscious body being dragged through claustrophobic cabin rooms and narrow hallway then outside to a shallow grave. It takes several scenes to piece together what just happened, and all the time the danger remains unseen. This terror atmosphere is maintained throughout the story as we watch a family fighting to survive a futuristic biological catastrophe. The father Paul (Joel Edgerton) has boarded-up and sealed the cabin and everyone must follow strict rules about exposure to the outside. He does whatever it takes to protect his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) and rebellious 17-year old son Travis (Kevin Harrison Jnr.) from the contagion. When an intruder breaks in he is dealt with harshly until Paul takes pity and allows him to bring his wife and child to share the cabin. The new family brings deadly risk and eventually chaos.Rarely do we find a horror film so focused on the nature of fear itself. The ""It"" of the film's title lies more within the human psyche than outside. It's a whirlpool of night shadows, Travis' coming-of- age nightmares, and the imagined and real danger of contact with anyone outside of the family. The untethered camera-work accentuates the claustrophobic isolation, interspersed with close-ups shots of wide-eyed fear that is palpable. We only know what the camera lets us see and the narrative withholds explanation or backstory, leaving viewers to their imagination. The acting performances of Joel Edgerton and Kevin Harrison are uniformly excellent and allow events to unfold from completely different points of view.If you are a horror fan expecting blood and gore you will not find it here. Some will still be waiting for the big reveal until the credits and not realise that this is about atmospherics and unseen inner demons. This film works both as a narrative about responding to a dystopian threat and as a psychological study of human potential for destruction. When Paul takes primal laws of survival into his own hands it challenges the viewer to walk in his shoes with a loaded gun and ask ""what would I do?"" So many horror films fall limp at the finishing line but the final scene of this one will send shivers down your spine.",It Comes at Night

They encounter a young family that needs help, and after some initial mistrust, Edgerton's family takes them into their home. Things seem good, but an incident leads to an atmosphere of fear and mistrust that erupts in violence. This is a very good, slow burning thriller that could have been a masterpiece of sorts if it didn't try to be a horror film too. Horror elements are introduced by a bunch of dreams that Edgerton's son has that are a fairly transparent mechanism for introducing false suspense scenes into a slow building narrative. It's apparent very early on that these are just dreams and have no bearing on the film's reality, so they really just serve as a distraction and a device for introducing empty-headed jump scares. I wasn't too annoyed by them, until the film pulled the old ""I have woken up from dream ... oh no! it's still just a dream!"" crap and then I was more than a little annoyed. After a really emotionally devastating climax, the film lands on a manifestly incoherent conclusion that maybe is supposed to be covered up by a possible dream sequence ... only it's not.

83,Mike_Devine,What comes at night?,5,2 January 2018,"There has been an onslaught of post-apocalyptic films in the past decade, with some garnering more success and viewers than others. This trend has transcended budgets of all sizes, from gargantuan studio efforts like 'World War Z' to indies like 'It Comes at Night.'The latter of which was made for a minuscule $5M yet stars some acclaimed actors in Joel Edgerton and Carmen Ejogo. The setting - a boarded up house in the woods that is removed from inferred death and destruction that is ravaging the globe in the form of a sickness that infects and ultimately kills its hosts. While this is not the most original premise, it certainly shows promise.With such a small budget and cast, it's imperative that the story and acting are strong enough to carry the entire film. 'Night' hits on a few solid points, from its filming style to its use not just of sound, but silence, as well. The Edgerton and Ejogo do respectable jobs, but it is perhaps their on-screen son Travis (played by Kelvin Harrison, Jr.) who has the biggest impact. The 17-year-old is a typical teenager who wants to prove his worth but is consistently held back by his father out of fear of injury or infection. When a young family comes into their safe house, it's clear Travis' innocence is juxtaposed with his father's skepticism, and age is clearly a driving force between this.There is also a fair amount of symbolism in 'Night.' The use of the red door - the only way in or out of the boarded up house - as seen in dream sequences is one element that is recurring throughout the film. The relationships between the families are also very important to the overall progression of the film, but something just doesn't add up. As seen in the climax of 'Night,' it's as if there was a missing link in the chain - and what results is pretty underwhelming to viewers.'It Comes at Night' is not a horror film. It's a psychological drama, and the mis-marketing of the movie is likely what left many dissatisfied.

The talented Aussie is perfection in the relentlessly unsettling ""It Comes at Night"".Edgerton plays Paul, whose soul purpose lies in protecting his wife and teenage son from a never-named source of sinister sickness which has evidently ravaged the planet. When another family moves in to their backwoods home seeking water and refuge it all goes quite swimmingly for a time. However, peace and harmony are eventually obliterated by fear and volatility. Relationships are questioned, frayed and then...well, you'll have to see for yourself. Trey Edward Shults wrote and directed here. His feature debut, the 2015 domestic drama ""Krisha"", left this reviewer less than impressed. Still, there were within certainly elements of promise for Shults's filmmaking future.

85,Ramascreen,The great paranoia horror,8,28 May 2017,"""It Comes At Night"" is an incredibly chilling hitchcockian paranoia horror that creeps up on you. Filmmaker Trey Edward Schults whose feature directorial experience prior to this was only ""Krisha,"" brilliantly follows the regular rules that come with crafting an effective character-based psychological thriller while at the same throwing curve balls every now and then, so that at the end, the threat from within becomes even scarier than the outside threat.Starring Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo and Riley Keough, the story is about a family (husband, wife, and teenage son) who's closed themselves off from the terrors of the world where a certain disease has infected the general population. But their reclusive existence gets put to the test with the arrival of a desperate young family seeking refuge. What starts out as a harmonious agreement turns into suspicion and distrust which then leads to protecting your own family at all cost.I think Trey Edward Schults does an excellent job of building the tension, slowly but surely, because halfway trough he kinda flips things over from the concept of us against the world out there into us against each other. So it's written in such a way that from the start is already giving the audiences warning signs to be alert even when the characters seem to have their guard down. It's character-driven, it's performance-driven, and thanks to the unsettling cinematography and how it plays in the dark, you're on your toes the entire time. In a lot of ways, it reminds you of '70s paranoia thrillers but it's also the kind of suspenseful film that M. Night Shyamalan probably only wishes he could make.Fear is a great motivator that can drive you into committing unspeakable acts, that's pretty much what Trey Edward Schults is going for with ""It Comes At Night.""-- Rama's Screen --",It Comes at Night

The name and the poster of the movie immediatly feels like some sort of gory creature slasher. But it couldn't be further from that. Literally nothing comes at night. However, if you manage to oversee this weird marketing mishap, there is a decent movie here. The overall atmosphere and the cinematography is really solid. There is this inviting ambiguity created about the world that they are in that made the movie feel very realistic and interesting to me.A family of three shelter themselves in their cabin in the woods in order to be protected by an unknown virus.",It Comes at Night

88,gavinp9,"Well-made, unique, human thriller",7,2 January 2018,"'It Comes At Night' is technically a horror film, but there's no standard horror stereotypes to be found, other than a good use of darkness and lights/lanterns. It's definitely more of a mystery/psychological thriller, with a hint of 'Outbreak'/'Contagion' thrown in. It's nice that instead of following the pandemic, you don't know what it is, what caused it or what's happening around the world - the film stays with just the one family: Paul (Edgerton), Sarah (Ejogo) & their son, Travis (Harrison Jr.) in their house in up-state New York.When another family - Will (Abbott) & Kim (Keough) - form a truce with Paul, they all seem to be making the best of life in the post-apocalyptic world. However, things aren't always that simple and there's plenty of moments where you question some decisions, but wonder if you would act any different in the same situation?There's a great score, building tension and action when needed, and great use of light, especially in the forest. No spoilers here, but this is certainly not your typical thriller/drama, with a pretty unexpected ending. While there're not a heap of scares, there's plenty of pressure built up and some interesting twists. All five of the actors are great, with Harrison Jr. being particularly good as the teenage son trying to cope with the new world.",It Comes at Night

There is a suspense almost all through the film and you kind of expect 'it' to appear or to be named, but that is not the case.So, it comes at night - but what is that? The film feels rather half spoken. I do not see this as a horror film, it is more psychological thriller - as the fear of it seems irrational though, of course, you are aware that there is something out there... But again, fearing that it might come or you might inhale it while, on the other hand, you do go outside...I guess the film could have been better if - only if flashes - the background story have been explained or even just hinted...

The title insinuates something Supernatural or animal coming at night to attack, but nothing like that happened. The family Homestead was attacked twice, once was the guy who ended up bringing his family to live there, and the second time may have been something Supernatural, we don't know it was just possibly the dog coming home tattered. So we never saw or had any evidence of there being anything Supernatural or animal. And Beyond Doomsday the only thing otherwise was some sort of virus, and they never did go into any sort of explanation as to how it was transmitted what it was how it was created, what was going on in the world at Large, it was like they were completely cut off from society! This movie completely lacked any sense grounding in reality because of this. Without at least touching days on society, you don't know if this is real or not.

And some work with just accepting where we are and move one. But this one does neither. It explains nothing. But it doesn't move forward either.It does succeed in creating an atmosphere of sickness, claustrophobia and madness, but without direction.

93,trublu215,It's Decent Enough But Far From Great,6,4 June 2017,"It Comes At Night tells the story of a family who is desperately seeking refuge from an unknown entity only to stumble across a family who takes them in but soon discover that their fear and paranoia may get the best of them all. Ever since this premiered at the Overlook Film festival, this has been on every horror fan's list of films to see, including my own. After finally getting to see the final product, I was left riddled with confusion and anger over the film but I couldn't hate it. First off, anyone who is a fan of slow burn horror will probably like this film immensely. Even though the film is 97 minutes, it moves at a snail's pace sometimes. Director Trey Edwards Shultz proves that Krisha was not a fluke here but he also proves that storytelling is still a bit of a weak point. It Comes At Night suffers from the same things that Krisha did. It has a weak and thin script but a strong enough idea in it to float it. Despite this, Shultz does a great job with his cast. Much like Krisha, had any other cast been chosen, I doubt this film would be half as good as it is.The film's cast is extremely strong and small enough so that you actually care about these characters which is hard to find in horror. Starring Joel Edgerton, Riley Keough, Chris Abbott, Carmen Ejogo and Kelvin Harrison, Jr., the film is electrified through these actors and you can absolutely tell. The story is paper thin but mysterious enough to keep a mild interest. When you combine that with this cast, you have a decent enough horror film that is slightly above your average Netflix fare.Overall, It Comes At Night was a bit of a disappointment considering the hype it has. The final product is muddled and confusing but still well acted nonetheless. Joel Edgerton leads a fine cast that gives us some truly terrifying performances which elevates the very thin plot. If you are a fan of slow burn horror films like last year's The Witch, then you might enjoy this one.",It Comes at Night
94,songod-95003,We're Doomed,5,1 September 2017,"It is painfully evident after watching a boat load of post apocalyptic movies and TV shows that humanity is done for.Whatever causes our way of life to end, be it war, disease, the walking dead; or some natural disaster that wipes out our infrastructure, power grid, and well just about everything we depend on these days; we're screwed.We are not going to come together as one and work for the common good. We are not going to reach out and lend helping hands. True, groups will form (more like packs I predict) and those who are survivalists who have been preparing for some kind of end -of-it-all will have their enclaves with ""shoot on sight"" rules to keep anyone else from coming in. They'll outlast everyone but eventually, maybe years after the cataclysm, inbreeding or short supplies will waste them away, too.I suppose the government bunkers (which I have no doubt exist and have since the cold war) where the elite of our government and scientists will seek shelter in might save the human race from extinction. Yet, spend too much time underground, and people become Trogalytes!This film shines a light on a small group of people, two families, who band together in a good sized cabin in the woods to make due as best they can while the outside world succumbs to a nameless plague. Yet even with small numbers, fear and mistrust raise their ugly heads.The message is we are our own enemies.

One night, Will enters their home with the intention of finding drinking water for his companion and their son. Paul hesitantly decides to welcome them under his roof. Except that little by little, suspicions and paranoia settled.The brothel (in its true sense, is understood) is always very popular in horror and it is stirring with quite a lot of success on the screens in recent times.

In the good average. The hick, at any rate for the amateur of the genre, is that this feature, although anguished to wish and effectively carried out, does not really stand out from the point of view of the narrative - in spite of its touch ""zombiesque"" and its Suspicion of gore .On the other hand, it is beautiful (how to speak) to see how well the characters, well encamped in the first part of the film (there is the dream and the nightmare) remain faithful to themselves: their reactions , Even desperate, are always coherent with what is known about them.To interpret them, a fair distribution led by Joel Edgerton - who had appeared magnificently Machiavellian in The Gift (which he had also written and directed).And then there's the artistic ""family"" that Trey Edward Shults is already forming: his accomplices from Krisha to music and photography, Brian McOmber and Drew Daniels, are new adventures.The soundtrack of the first, which raises the tension up to the treble and which disappears when it is necessary in order to let silence fall on a scene like a screed of lead, is diabolically orchestrated.

The villain of the movie is fear and paranoia of becoming sick and dying at the hands of an unknown virus. It drives the characters to turn against each other and become monsters.
Along with that, there's still the mystery of whether or not there was actually something out there. I mean, what was the dog barking at anyways? Who opened the door? How did the dog get so mutilated besides just being infected? When audiences say ""nothing comes at night"", they're very wrong. The anxiety and fear running rampant through the characters was what came at night and also, a possible unknown force. It Comes at Night is less of a film like A Quiet Place and something more like a modern take on Twilight Zone's ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" but if it was 5 times darker.",It Comes at Night

This movie it's not for everyone. If you walk into it expecting a traditional horror film you will be very disappointed. The movies greatest strength is its ability to manipulate the viewers expectations. In many ways this film riffs off horror cliches and turns them upside down. The movie was very well shot and directed! The post apocalyptic story had a simple set up, but worked well to slowly build suspense. Entire film you slowly wonder what is happening and what is to come. The film's main draw was it's depiction of psychological trauma and the extremes people will go to when civilization crumbles. This may not sound like traditional horror material, but the film constantly creates a feeling of dread that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The film is by no means a traditional horror film, but it brought up so many questions it demands multiple viewings.

104,Otkon,It bores at all hours of the day.,2,1 September 2017,"Holy crap, this movie was entirely hype. It is clear that all the critical acclaim and buzz were because of how art-house freaking slow and minimal it is. And people still falling for the fallacy that ""less is deep"".But long pauses and characters staring forever at each other, the woods and the walls don't make for good, suspenseful and/or poignant horror - let alone interesting drama. This movie has such non-descript characters - I think one had a limp and was once a teacher or something. That is the entirety of any backstory. There is nothing to make the characters relatable to the audience in the dramaturgical sense. Therefore, their plight is moot. And none of them have any developmental arc because when nothing happens, nothing changes. Plus, for the stylistic choices this movie made in avoiding conventional horror, there needed to be a strong underlying metaphor. There is not. Is it ultimately about race? Or sexuality? Animal rights? The socio-economic pratfalls in a post-Tito Yugoslavia? Nope. In fact, I can't tell you what the movie was trying to say about anything that The Walking Dead doesn't say on a weekly basis. Case in point: The Witch (2015) had a similarly stark atmosphere. But ultimately it was a story about feminist teenage rebellion. And Satan. This movie's sole purpose was to lead up to a baby being shot as a really cheap ""climax"".

However, the things go awry when they discover the kid of a stranger's family opens the door and contracts the disease, and it just destroys everyone ultimately with the disease.The beauty of the film, is that even a small mistake, or a mistrust is going to cost their life. They should not have allowed the stranger family, but they thought otherwise. Even if they allowed them, the owner(""Paul"") should have established even stricter rules, which he did try, but it is difficult to control whole lot of new beings. Can you? At-least the stranger family should have taken care of their kid, by making sure he does not venture out unnecessarily. So, in these situations, you really cannot expect others to be as strict and as serious as you are.

Beautiful darkly lit images, moving, sometimes dreamlike camera-work - in particular the slowly panning shot of the painting filled with demons while the camera pulls away to reveal the long dark hallway and the red door at its end. There isn't enough of this, or it's not illuminating enough. What little mystery there is doesn't come through as much as the film thinks it does - it's maybe not up to more than it is.The final scene is a well finessed tension overload. You know what's coming but you can't help but dread its inevitable conclusion. The slowly shrinking aspect ratio adds heaps to the claustrophobia and the focus - I didn't notice it was happening until the scene was over but immediately understood its impact.

109,bastille-852-731547,An Exceptional Feat in Horror Filmmaking,10,8 June 2017,"Trey Edward Shults' second film is a simple--but phenomenal--horror film that creates an unique and tense feeling of existential dread. This is what makes the film truly scary, rather than cheap jump-scares. The plot centers on a family and their guests living in a cabin. A disease has wiped out much of humanity and they are living off the grid in this cabin to try to protect themselves from the it. At one point, a stranger shows up. From there, the film grabs its audience and never lets go with an unrelenting feel of tension. While the film is very bleak and may feel nihilistic to some, its darkness is intended to be a point on the depraved abilities of mankind in extraordinary situations. The film's acting feels so real and raw that viewers often feel the urge to ask what they would do in the situation the characters are in. The ability to mirror real emotion also makes the film--and its writing--highly intelligent. All too often, viewers of horror films feel almost insulted by the stupidity of the characters or the decisions they make. Such stupidity is usually used as a plot device for those characters to be terrorized and/or killed. Thankfully, this film realizes that the people watching it have brains.What makes this film truly exceptional is that it is one of the very few horror films I have ever seen that exclusively relies on a genuine sense of dread to generate suspense and terror. Many horror films create some sense of dread, but it often feels cheesy or rushed. In this film, the emotions experienced by the characters are very real. While the film (and especially its climax) can be devastating, its unique depiction of mistrust and fear is just unmatched by anything you normally see in the horror genre. Additionally, the film's performances and aesthetic qualities are superb. The cast is uniformly excellent, and their performances are quite thoughtful. The film's cinematography is excellent as well, with a mix of dim lighting as well as natural photography and wide shots. Finally, it wouldn't be a horror film without a score that can really get under your skin. In this movie, the simple but tense score absolutely does.Taking almost every problem with modern horror movies and fixing them, ""It Comes At Night"" proves that Shults likely will have a great career as a director ahead of him. It seems to me like future horror films will have a new standard to live up to. 10/10",It Comes at Night

Rampant with fear and paranoia, we slowly learn of how this family got to this point still alive and the obstacles they face when a desperate young family comes seeking shelter.

A stranger breaks in looking for water, and the father (played by Joel Edgerton) decides to trade water for some of the stranger's food. They apparently bond so well that the stranger and his wife and young child move in Edgerton's house. For a while they all live happily like a hippie commune until an event brings the possibility of disease within the house, an event that is never fully explained and is one reason why this movie gets a low grade. From this point on, some of the worst natures of people in times of crisis comes out, mostly from Edgerton; and this is what ""It Comes At Night"" is truly about, the monstrous nature of people that lie dormant, waiting for the right moment to emerge.My most memorable, movie moment of ""It Comes At Night"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Edgerton is tracking a mother and her young son, finds them, aims his rifle at them andThe extremely misleading title of ""It Comes At Night"" will frustrate many viewers because the title and trailers leads us to believe there is a monster out there stalking people at night, which is not the case. The lack of info on how the disease is transmitted, and several plot holes will further aggravate the viewer, as is proved in the overwhelmingly negative reviews in so many outlets.

So I watched, I waited, I watched some more, I waited some more and, after doing this for the entire film it was suddenly over. I was so annoyed by this time as I had completely wasted my time watching a film that had absolutely nothing happen in it. It didn't have any horror or mystery aspects to it at all and, it gave absolute Zilch, Nada, Zero information about anything.A film normally starts by 1) setting the scene, (2) introducing the characters and (3) delivering the crunch of the story through to climatic end. Not so with this film! I cannot understand why this was even made and worse still, why it was released at all! It was like a case of, ""Once upon a time, they lived happily ever after...The End"" and you have no idea of what time...what's going on and who the heck were they who lived happily ever after?If you don't mind losing important personal time trying to make a silk purse from a sows ear - as it is said - then by all means watch and decide for yourself.

It literally never even suggests what it could be. Don't get me wrong, sometimes not knowing is good, but when the entire film is made pointless because of a gaping hole in the viewer's knowledge, then that's just plain pathetic.Plus, considering this was meant to be a horror movie, there was very little to be scared about, and most of the film was taken up by large silences or muttered conversations that had little relevance to the plot.To conclude, it was a complete waste of my time and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.",It Comes at Night
119,danielharden,Misleading Marketing,7,14 July 2017,"I would argue that we are living in the golden age of horror. In recent years, filmmakers have began to really understand what Alfred Hitchcock knew all along; ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it."" The Conjuring, It Follows, The Babadook, The Witch, Don't Breathe and most recently Get Out, are just some of today's horror films that have proved that just because a film is a horror film, it doesn't mean it has to be loaded with jump scares and have a poor quality overall. 2017 especially looks to be a very good year for horror fans, yes The Mummy wasn't good and Saw is set to return, but with Get Out being one of, if not THE best film of the year, as well as, the rave reviews Annabelle Creation has gotten, and the hype the new IT adaptation, this year is shaping up to be one of horror's finest.The most recent horror film to get the big thumbs up by critics is none other than It Comes At Night, the film has been praised for its bare bones story and fear of what isn't on screen, and has been considered, like Get Out, as one of 2017's best films. Everyone else however, begs to differ. What is perhaps most interesting about It Comes At Night is the drastic disagreement between critics and audiences and that the films marketing is said to be misleading. Having now seen It Comes At Night I can see both why people love, as well as, hate this film. It Comes At Night is a hard film to review and one I'm still not really sure how to feel about, but what I do know is that film is extremely well made, even if it mislead its audience and went for an preferred reading that is widely not taken and is a bit of a stretch.Firstly I'd like to address the argument that this film is falsely advertised, as this is where i believe a lot of the negative responses from audiences came from. Having seen the posters and the trailers, I completely understand why people will feel cheated and tricked when actually seeing It Comes At Night, as the film is not the one implied in its marketing. I attribute this to the fact Universal are involved with this film, and so have to market to attract an audience. Thus what is advertised is a mysteriously unnerving, Joel Edgerton starring, 'Don't-open-the-red-door-at night,-or the-unknown-night-monster-will-kill-you' movie. The film is not the same film that is advertised, but to be honest, I don't think Universal could've sold the film that It Comes At Night is, or at least not in a way resulting in successful box office returns. For me the big issue with the films mislead marketing is the films title. It Comes At Night is a cookie cutter horror movie name, that if you look back at every horror film ever, would allude to an unknown creature that comes out and kills at night That is not the case with this title. Director Trey Edward Shults has stated that it is a metaphor, but no one really seems to know what metaphor that is. Is the 'it' in the title meant to be paranoia, fear and distrust of others? That's the only thing I can think that 'It' is. But then again IS 'It' an unknown creature that kills at night? Because, SPOILER ALERT, who killed the dog? And who brought the dog back to the house and opened the red door?This all being said, the film is well crafted even if it lies and teases the audience. The suspense was excellently crafted in this film as you are left to feel on edge for the films entire run time. Part of this suspense is due to the lack of answers, and so in a way that is successful in making you feel the suspense and paranoia of the characters. As well as the suspense, the theme of paranoia was explored brilliantly mainly due to the fact that it is the smallest details that characters question, such as; the door being open, Andrew sleepwalking, Andrew keeping his eyes closed, Will's brother etc. To an extent, the lack of answers helps fuel the paranoia, not only in the characters, but in us the audience. But it's only the little things and minor questions that work by being unanswered. Also, say what you will about the film, but the acting is definitely brilliant. The film's small cast do a great job and Joel Edgerton once again proves a brilliant actor, having shone as writer, director and actor with The Gift in 2015, Edgerton pulls off another great horror film performance, this time the exact opposite of the calm and calculated Gordo.To conclude, It Comes At Night is a confusing movie, one that is hard to put my finger on, but also one where I can see every person's argument. It's essentially the Blurred Lines music video (except not offensive), the director has stated that the text is one thing, while the audience collect evidence to say otherwise, rejecting and hating what the director has made. The films cookie cutter title and mysteriously gripping marketing clash with the directors overall goal and have left audiences disappointed in Trey Edward Shults because of this. This isn't Shults fault, however his efforts have not helped to extinguish the blaze of negative responses from the average movie goer. Marketing aside, It Comes At Night is a well crafted film, that excellently creates suspense and paranoia in the audience, unfortunately a bit too well for some audiences. The film offers far more than it delivers as it simply wants to be minimal, which I can appreciate, but it's just a shame that the marketing team did such a good job at the expense of Trey Edwards Shults vision.",It Comes at Night

121,joshbarton15,Paranoid humanoid,8,8 July 2017,"As a production company, A24 has made an almighty splash in Hollywood with powerful independent films, Moonlight, Room and Ex Machina just being a few of the many major successes they've had. Showing faith in an array of filmmakers and their visions has paid dividends so far, and it continues to do so with Trey Edward Shults and his psychological horror It Comes At Night. In a post apocalyptic world ravaged by an unknown threat, Paul (Joel Edgerton), his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), and their teenage son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) have secluded themselves in a cabin in the woods. When a young family arrives seeking refuge, their way of life is put to the test.Horror has seen somewhat of a revival in the past few years with new and exciting filmmakers making it clear that the genre can be so effective when you opt for more than just jump scares and loud noises to scare your audience. It Comes At Night takes place within a cabin and a section of the surrounding woodland and Shults utilises natural lighting and silence incredibly well to create an unnerving experience in such a confined space.This is a well crafted film with some beautiful cinematography from Drew Daniels and a brooding score from Brian McOmber, both accentuating the mystery of the film's narrative. Shults makes It Comes At Night a film where nothing is spoon fed to the audience, instead leaving it for them to make up their own minds, right up until its powerful final moments.Coming to the performances, It Comes At Night is driven forward by the feeling of paranoia that grips the characters and the cast are all on fine form here. We know the qualities that Joel Edgerton can bring to a film and he certainly delivers again here. It's Kelvin Harrison Jr. who I was impressed with the most as the film progressed, his sense of fear and uncertainty really showing through his facial expressions.My advice would be to leave any expectations you have at the door and just watch it unfold because this film took me by surprise.

It's about this family in what is probably a post- apocalyptic future with some contagion that forces them to isolate and then they discover this other family so will there be a peaceful life or will the human nature take over?There's so much more to this movie than what I just said. I can't even fit it properly into any genre. I guess it's kind of a horror movie, but in a different way than you would imagine. There are no spooky monsters or anything, just the horror of human nature. But there is still more that's left for us to interpret and provide food for thought. You definitely won't grasp the whole story on the first viewing. You should probably watch it first time to figure out the main plot. And then you should watch it the second time to try and pick up some signs the director left there for us.At first, I was really unsure about my opinion about this movie. I just had no idea how to rate it. But this ended up being one of those movies when the more I think about it, the more I love it. It's gorgeously shot and just by the way it's shot you can tell the director left many symbolisms in there. It's very ambiguous, but it's a good kind of ambiguity.Try to go into it with no expectations at all. Or even if it doesn't turn out to be what you expected, try loving it for what it is.

125,paulijcalderon,Tremendously suspenseful and visceral!,8,30 June 2017,"A good suspenseful horror film that doesn't follow the usual trend of jump scares, found footage or ghosts. I walked in completely blind knowing nothing of the plot and it turned out to be a visceral experience from beginning to end. This is not your common movie either. There's no moment where everything is explained to you. It really leaves you thinking.Before the movie started I saw the trailers for upcoming films like ""IT"" and ""Annabelle: Creation"". They made me worried because of how laughably typical and clichéd they seemed to be. The style of horror in those just looked annoying (f you enjoy them then I'm happy for and I wish I could feel the same). I feared that I had taken the wrong the decision by checking out this movie. But, man.. I was wrong. The horror depicted in this movie is realistic. It's about human nature and how far people will go in desperate times. There is a survival sense as well which makes you think how you would act if you were in the same situation as the characters. It gets extremely intense and I was very immersed many times watching it. We are also treated to some surrealistic sequences which at first felt a little out of place, but later they fit a good purpose in the story. I preferred the more linear plot that was going on, but I can see a lot of horror fans really liking the surreal elements.Don't expect a typical horror film at all. This is more in the lines of ""The Road"" meets ""The Shining"". It's very grounded and simple, but the stakes for the characters have never been higher. It's difficult to describe this one, but it got under my skin at several points. In the end I have to agree that the horrors that we humans are capable of doing is a thousand times more scarier than any monster.

He pretty much bombs every movies he's in with his heavy-handed attempts at being a character actor. This movie hints at some things that may be lurking under the surface but those things never emerge because the writer doesn't know what they are. The young black kid, Kelvin Harrison Jr. is good but he's not given much to do. We never find out how or why the world is the way is.

With this movie, Shults shows a lot of promise as a director. He has a strong command of the screen, and delivers on excellent visuals. However, I can't say the same for him as a writer. Most my problems with this movie do stem from the screenplay. Not every movie needs to explain everything that happens in it. I take issue with giant exposition dumps, such as in The Mummy. What fun is there in a film like Inception if every little thing is spelled out for you, not leaving any room to question or contemplate. But there is such a thing as explaining too little, and being elusive to a fault, which is what It Comes at Night does. It throws a whole bunch of stuff at you, and doesn't explain anything. It was so elusive that I had no idea what this was supposed to be at all.

132,joker-4,What comes at night?,6,28 October 2019,"An unnamed apocalyptic event forces two families to survive together in Trey Edward Shults' It Comes At Night. The rules are simple. The front door remains bolted shut. Only go outside in pairs. And never at night. Naturally, all three commandments are blatantly dismissed yet none of those transgressions lead to a building of a frightful drama.Beautifully shot with horrific claustrophobia, unfortunately the narrative is more snoozefest than thriller.It Comes At Night crawls at a zombie pace yet unlike the unstoppable undead there is no face to this fear and in this film's case, the imagined threat is lacking.Joel Edgerton stars as the father figure of a small family barricaded in a large house on a seemingly larger property. He slowly accepts Will (Christopher Abbott) and his equally-small family into the house in order for both to survive on their meager-yet-sustainable resources. As with any tight-knit thriller, paranoia grows as the threat outside encroaches. Yet neither truly happen. The perceived external threat is as solid as vaporware; the interior a masochistic misunderstanding that is more laughable than despondent.Shults has all the ingredients of a successful genre-breaker lined up in his editing suite. Tightly-wound characters. Internal and external threats. Fear of the unknown. And a cute dog. His photography is on-the-mark creepy and the Bernard Hermann-esque score by Brian McOmber is truly fitting. What got lost in the process was a moving script. The characters do nothing. The perceived threat is no more menacing than a New England garden party. And too many unanswered questions resulting in a shoulder shrug rather than a what's next zinger. More Lucy; Less The Thing.What comes at night? Perhaps the realization of mankind's fallacy with the reliance of late-night pizza delivery. Other than that, only Shults knows.

135,RMurray847,"Marketing and title do this psychological, post-apocalyptic thriller no favors. Come with an open mind.",7,8 January 2021,"This movie was done no favors at all by its marketing and its title. Both imply this is some kind of horror film. IT IS NOT A HORROR FILM (at least, not in a more traditional sense of the word). I had read enough reviews to get some idea of that...but the folks I went to the film with were expecting something more along those lines and they were perplexed and disappointed.The film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a germ/disease of some kind has wiped out most of humanity. Paul (Joel Edgerton) and his family (wife, son, father-in-law) are holed up in their home in the middle of the woods and have a thought-out process for survival. Nonetheless, the film opens (so not really a spoiler) with the father-in-law dying from the disease. The family has essentially hunkered down. They are good people, but the stress of the loneliness and fear has made them tight, tense and a touch paranoid. But despite that, after some reluctance, they invite a young family (husband, wife, child) into their home when their paths cross.The movie is about tension and distrust. The two families can work together for their mutual safety...but we also know that to each person, their OWN family is most important. In our ""normal"" times, we are able to help others without fear of death. Someone has car trouble on the highway. We may help them without much second thought because (as long as we don't step out into traffic) we won't die because of it. We still ""look out for #1"" but have plenty of space in our lives to help others. In IT COMES AT NIGHT, the survivors have the INSTINCT to help, but will it be overshadowed by the instinct to survive (and in this case, ""survival"" means family survival)? Our human tendencies to ""help each other out in crisis"" (as we often see during times of natural disaster) comes into conflict with our self-preservation and paranoia.It is Paul's house and he has laid down the rules he best feels will keep everyone safe. When others slip...are they doing it to be spiteful or are they careless? When every sound from the outside engenders fear (especially at night), when no one can sleep because of the tension and bad dreams and when people who don't know each other must live together under the most dire of circumstances...something must break. And it breaks in a major way (at least for these people).The movie is tense, tense, TENSE. You spend almost every moment breathless, not knowing what comes next. There is the not knowing, and then there is the director's insistence on not telling you everything you want to know. You have to guess or infer. Most movies spoon feed you things: what just happened, what does it mean, what do the characters think about it and how are they reacting to it. These are the things we get from most movies. Director Shults keeps these things from us way more often than we are comfortable with...and this heightens our tension and lack of ease. We become uncertain of the motives of characters...in particular the ""new"" family. They SEEM nice and normal and helpful. But ARE they? What really happened that night? You get the point.The ending of the movie has been controversial, and I agree that it is dis-satisfying. It is great in some ways, but again, it leaves questions unanswered. It's frustrating, because we don't get the release of tension we crave. It's also shocking. But I agree it is perhaps more than we should be expected to patiently endure.The film is low-budget and has limited sets and scope of location. That works for the story, but there's no getting around the shoe-string budget. I'm okay with it, but as is often the case in low-budget, claustrophobic movies...the pace can drag a bit. The cast is fine but just fine. Star Joel Edgerton is always a bit problematic for me...he can be quite good (WARRIOR, MIDNIGHT SPECIAL) or quite bad (GREAT GATSBY, THE GIFT). Here he leans to the plus side, and is fairly convincing...but he's not so much commanding as he is simply on screen all the time. It's mostly told from his point of view, so arguably a better performance would have made the film more compelling.But in the end, it's all about the tension...and this film has it in droves. If you like to have your tension measured out in tolerable doses, with a good catharsis at the end...keep looking!",It Comes at Night

142,TokyoGyaru,Very well acted.,6,7 March 2021,"I'm not sure what they mean by the title, but I get the impression that the movie is just one family's story out of a possible million or billion, considering whether this takes place during an epidemic or a pandemic. Therefore, there doesn't need to be the kind of story that we would expect, of people working to find out the cause and/or the cure, of working to reach a military base or some other government power. Instead, it's focused on families that try to have some kind of normalcy and how they have to adhere to the rules of this new world. Some people won't like that there aren't monsters that are the cause of things-though something is implied in drawings and dreams-nor will they like the fact that there are a lot of loose ends and questions (Why did the guy lie about having a brother? Why did the guy seem so bothered by the men getting shot? Why did they linger over the men who were shot as though it was significant? Was the baby really sick? Who did the son see in the woods when his dog ran away? Who was the dog chasing?), but those things weren't really the main focus. It was interesting enough to keep my attention, and I was particularly impressed by the acting, from the main family in particular. It's slow-paced, but that's perfect for a lazy, overcast day at home.",It Comes at Night

All the actors did their given parts well. This movie showed us that we don't need zombies or ghosts to bring out the horror and mystery in a movie but it can be done with the help of a good script and some good directing and acting.

144,jake-179,Good but misleading and disappointing,4,18 June 2017,"I felt a bit fooled by the trailer on this one. Before I get in to spoilers, I will say that the performances are solid and the movie is tense throughout. The movie subject matter is brutal and unapologetic. This is a low budget thriller movie about survivors in the woods waiting out a biological apocalyptic event. The trailer (as well as the title) lead you to believe that there is going to be a super natural antagonist of some kind that ""comes at night."" SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT FORWARD There is NOT a supernatural element. And the movie misleads you to believing that there will be some kind of monster revealed at some point. What the movie is really about is the old survival question: you are in your bunker with limited supplies. A family in need comes knocking at your door. What do you do? This question is extremely heavy if you delve in to it. Do you take in the strangers? If so, you risk the fact that they will contaminate you, or use up your supplies, or steal your supplies and slip away in the night. Do you turn them away? Now that they have found you, they could come back with friends and overwhelm you. So do you kill them? How do you mercilessly kill a helpless family just because they stumbled up on you? Will you become a monster like that in the name of survival? These are all the questions that this movie seeks to address, and it does that very well, I think. But the movie suggests that there is an impending, hidden, malevolent force and seems to promise a reveal and a confrontation. The movie does not deliver on that promise, and I think that fact is going to hurt the over-all reviews and reception of this movie. When the movie was over and the lights came up in the theater, I could hear audible groans from the theater-goers around me. It was obvious to me that the audience was disappointed by the third act. The final part of the movie is quite brutal and sad, and, as I said before, it does address the ultimate conclusion of the survival question. But it leaves you wondering what was the thing in the woods? What was it that ""comes at night?"" The sickness? The disease? Disease comes at night? The movie makers could no doubt claim that, but it is confusing because of the situation with the family dog. At a certain point, the dog hears or senses something deep in the woods, and runs towards it and disappears. Later, the dog magically re-appears in the house - at night, of course - and appears to have been gutted. But I guess the dog was only sick? That was not clear. And it was not explained how the dog got back in the house. We are misled to believe that there is something out there in the woods stalking the survivors in the house. And that plot point is absolutely a false lead. So, it makes for a very disappointing movie watching experience. Very unfortunate since the rest of the movie is pretty good. If they had just only concentrated on the conflict between the two families or maybe fleshed out the menace in the woods, this movie would have been much better.",It Comes at Night

149,daniele-iannarelli,Lacking in resolution...,4,9 June 2019,"Another ""Bird Box"", but without as much left-wing political propaganda. Having said that, is it now Hollywood policy that in *every* movie there *must* be portrayed a mixed-race marriage? Now, I don't have a problem with that as it's up to people what they do and who they marry. However, what I *do* have a problem with is its portrayal 'just for the sake of it', for political correctness's sake. There is, though, a seemingly loud left-wing anti-gun message being delivered here. Perhaps it tries to demonstrate how guns may lead - in certain scenarios - to vigilantism, to kangaroo courts, to lawlessness...? This is all as boring as the movie was.The film itself - although adequately acted - gives no final resolution, nor does it give any indication what happened to Stanley the dog. The impression I get though (and I could be wrong), is that whatever it is that 'comes at night' manifests as a disease through the dreams/nightmares of the victim. Having said that, how did Stanley become diseased? What happened to him in the woods? There is just no resolution anywhere... and not least in the sexual tension created with Travis's (Kelvin Harrison) youthful crush/lust for Kim (Riley Keough). Seemed quite a pointless inclusion.Overall, although the film is watchable, it does lack substance, hence why it's considerably overlong... padded out with a lot of boredom so as to reach feature-length time.As referred to at the beginning, the theme of this film has been done before... about 50,000,000 times and mostly better (except that nonsense ""Bird Box"".The IMDB 6.2 rating is way too high on this movie, and I really despair about the lack of critical thinking displayed by many IMDB reviewers who - by awarding a 10/10 - seem to think it lies at the same classic level as (for example) ""Gone With The Wind"" (1938), ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1940), ""The Apartment"" (1960)... etc.My rating?

These data are much more depressing than the movie itself, IMHO.I am in my 60s (born 1958) and I totally understood the desperation of this movie.
A teacher (a colleague of mine, BTW) and his wife try to keep safe their family, their son, from the dangers outside, only to lose him after a useless struggle with a younger poor couple of common people like them who lose everything, including their lives. What comes at night? FEAR comes at night.I barely understand the reason why this movie has the tag ""horror"".
Hey you there: it's the drama of being alive in this world each day of our life. In another great post-apocalyptic movie ""The Road"" (2009) the Woman kills herself because she doesn't bear the situation.
That's the miracle, folks: why do we keep going on living?
Why does the couple in the movie go on? In the painful last scene we see them without their son, their hope. Having children is like throwing a message in a bottle to our future selves. Life is totally meaningless to people with the bottle broken. I'd kill myself immediately if something happened to my 15-years-old daughter.In ""The Road"" last sequence the Man dies and the Boy is adopted by another family which is a ""happy"" ending compared with It Comes at Night tragic conclusion.Hope this may be useful",It Comes at Night

There is very little action, no zombies, very little blood and gore, and very little to the story.Yet I did watch the whole thing AND was interested thru-out AND enjoyed it. (The end was heartbreaking). Id like to give it 7.5 if I had that choice but went with an 8 since I do believe there is a fan base out there for this movie. We are just in a minority.I was impressed with the acting. It was so very natural. That in itself, could be another turn off for many movie goers. And I enjoyed the old fashioned darkness and shadows, eerie sounds, scary music and the ATMOSPHERE that was created!! I suppose it is a lost art and an even more of a lost art of appreciation for leaving things up to the imagination. I also enjoy movies with characters realistic. With the capability of both good/bad. So yeah, I cant argue with the people who reviewed this movie badly and did not enjoy it....I understand why. I believe it is just the type of movie that a particular and perhaps older group could enjoy.On a side note, this story is sorta similar to a VERY VERY REEEEEAAAALLY (times a hundred), watered down version of another movie where human beings spiral out of control titled ""The Divide"" what ""It Comes At Night"" didn't provide, ""The Divide"" makes up for in spades.

155,johnplocar,This movie will be loved by some and hated by most...I'm in the minority.,9,24 September 2017,"""It Come At Night""...WOW...I am truly in awe of how this film handles tension. Easily one of the most suspenseful films of the year with its pace at a slow burn and its atmosphere oozing through the screen.I went into this film blind, really only seeing the teaser trailer and maybe a few small blip ads, but for the most part I knew next to nothing about this movie going in. Coming out of it I was very satisfied with the payoff. This isn't the run of the mill horror movie or post-epidemic film we have seen time and time again. While it takes certain tropes from modern day horror movie, it puts a unique spin on them in a way that actually benefits itself rather than feeling like a needless studio note that only hinders the film's intensity like most do today. This movie goes against the norm with its storytelling and scares. The scares don't come from what is shown or even known, but what is unknown. What isn't seen is what supplies the frights.In order to go a little further I suppose I should give a brief synopsis of what this movie is about. Taking place some time after a form of disease has seemingly infected the world's population, we center on a family in the midst of the aftermath of whatever epidemic may have occurred as the reside in the middle of the forest alone. Alone at least until a strange family comes to live with them and they learn to work together in order to survive. From there I do not want to say much more if anyone plans to see this film.Again, I feel the need to reiterate that this is not a conventional horror film. If you are not a fan of a slow burn and ambiguity then this movie is not for your. Do not expect jump scares left and right or a quick pace to its plot. The writing takes its time and gives just enough throughout to make the viewer well aware that there are dangers, but from where is left open ended. It plays with the audience's perception a bit with what is really going on; whether certain people are lying or not, if someone is actually infected by this virus they're all afraid of, how this virus actually effects the person or persons that contract it. It is all very open to interpretation, yet at the same time gives enough information that someone can make up their own mind on what may have went down.This is a fantastically well done film with a terrific cast to carry its story; Joel Edgerton, like always, knocks his performance right out of the park. The story is slow, but well worth the buildup. If there is any sort of complaint I may have with the film, I suppose the ending. Not that it's bad, it's not bad at all. In fact the last act contains some of the most intense and gut punching sequences in the entire movie, but it does feel as though the film just abruptly ends. Only slightly, not to the point that I would ever really mention it if someone were to ask my thoughts on the movie but it was enough to notice it a little. I don't want to delve any further into it because I really do not want to spoil anymore about this movie since I believe that this is worth seeing. If you're tired of seeing the many modern day horror flicks that think all they have to do in order to frighten someone is to make loud noises for an hour and a half while displaying spooky ghost face every so often then give ""It Comes At Night"" a shot because it's basically a middle finger to all of that. Seriously, if you want something a little different from the norm that provides its scares with an intense atmosphere full of dread instead of showing you upfront what to be afraid of then this is for you.",It Comes at Night
156,poc-1,"Disjointed, confusing and unresolved.",4,18 July 2017,"I am a fan of post-apocalyptic movies and for the first 20 minutes this film shows promise, good visuals and mood. But then it crawls repeating the same shots and mild shocks until after the hour mark. At this stage you are left wondering when the real story is going to start. Plot elements are started but then abandoned. A little mystery is a good idea in this genre, it heightens the fear but at some point you need an actual narrative to draw it all together. The ending did force a climax but it seemed botched somewhat by the director so you are left wondering exactly what happened.The biggest failing is I didn't feel interested enough in the characters to care enough about them during the attempted resolution.I understand that the budget would have been small but that is no excuse. The camera work was fine. The frights were well done and the tension was well maintained but it gets boring when repeated. The actors did a good job though some were miscast.

It's ""The Thing"" without a monster. It's the distrust we have of everything outside, even the outsiders that are inside.

Are you tired of watching dumb characters making bad decisions and getting themselves killed? Or those that could have survived but eventually died because of their careless moves? Or those predictably loud and annoying jump scares that you have seen in countless horror films and wonder if there could ever be that one movie that would avoid everything mentioned above. Lucky for you, this is that film. It Comes At Night is a psychological horror/thriller/drama that brilliantly avoids a typical, predictable horror cliché and shifts itself into being an anti-horror film instead. The characters here are precisely smart, brilliantly developed, and powerfully acted along with the simple, yet twisted survival concept and atmospherically creepy setting, I would seriously pee my pants​ if this film is shown in VR format, and proving that sometimes, what is left unseen and untold can be scarier than you might expect. These are what make the film so intriguing to watch as it slowly hooks you to the suspense by squeezing the fear, paranoia, suspicion, and survival instinct of our human nature out to their worst nightmare, which all results in this nail-biting, thrilling final act that will cringe shudder you until the credits roll. Again, this film aims at making the audiences feel desperate and unsettled while piling up their fears from something they don't know or see. So if you are looking for a jumpy scare with loud or random creatures popping up in your face, then this movie is definitely not for you. Overall, with its unusually smart characters, intriguing performances, atmospherically creepy dystopian setting, and suspensefully constructed plot, It Comes At Night is an anti-horror film that effectively succeeds in avoiding all the horror cliché, both character and story wise, and easily placing itself as the best and smartest horror film so far this year.>>A<<TWITTER: @moviesmaniaCX",It Comes at Night

162,RLTerry1,"Emulates Shyamalan before ""The Visit"" and ""Split"" and after ""Lady in the Water""",6,9 June 2017,"The 'Doore' of Red Death. A24's highly anticipated horror film ""It Comes at Night"" by writer- director Trey Edward Shults looks beautiful and beckons for attention, but fails to live up to the storytelling and payoff of A24's The Green Room. Another A24 film in the vein of It Comes at Night is 2016's The Witch, which was ultimately a failed attempt to capture the magic of a horror/mystery film and leave audiences with too many unanswered questions. The only ""terrifying ambiguity"" (to quote The Huffington Post), in this film, is just how terrifying it is to realize you just dropped money on a film that works better for Netflix, and the ambiguity comes from the plethora of underdeveloped plot elements. Essentially, It Comes at Night reminds me of a bad M. Night Shyamalan film (before he made his comeback with The Visit and Split). Like the aforementioned, the wind up is excellent but the delivery lacks any emotional impact and you're left with realizing that you never truly cared about any one of the characters. Character development is lacking and the third act is incredibly weak. However, there is something in particular that I find very interesting, and after reading other reviews, it seems to be something that has escaped most (if not all) the reviews at this point. That is the striking similarities between this film and the timeless classic short story The Masque of Red Death by the brilliant Edgar Allan Poe. From the painting on the walls of the house depicting the bubonic plague to the ominous red door, there are quite a few parallels between It Comes at Night and The Masque of Red Death.Nestled deep in the woods is a secluded boarded up house belonging to a family of three seeking refuge from an unknown threat. Whatever has caused this family to live off the grid and fend for their very survival is tasteless and odorless. Forced to wear gas masks whenever venturing out into the woods and even around their own home, the family is forced to take drastic measures to ensure there ability to avoid coming into direct contact with the disease. With only now way in or out of the house guarded by a red door, the family has stopped at nothing to protect themselves. One night, the family's house is broken into and they must decide what to do with the man and his family. Having dispensed with courteousness and generosity in order to guard against any and all possible threats, the family must decide whether to listen to the man or kill him right then and there. Their decision will spark a fire that spreads into their deepest fears.*spoiler alert* But, the analysis is fascinating.Okay, now I know that the preceding program describes what should be a brilliant horror film, but the problem lies in the film's excellent premise that is greatly flawed by poor storytelling, development, and realization. Lack of connection to any one of the characters is also partly responsible for the lackluster experience of watching this horror-thriller with a hint of mystery and dystopia. The only saving grace the film has is the connection to elements of Poe's Masque of Red Death. For starters, the camera draws the audience's (and diegetic POV) attention to a painting of a depiction of the bubonic plague (or black death). At first, I was puzzled as to why this painting. Then as I go through the movie, I realize why. Between the constant reference to and runtime spent on talking about and showing the red door, it hit me that this film reimagined Poe's short story and set it in a dystopian or post-apocalyptic time and place. If you are unfamiliar with The Masque of Red Death, then I encourage you to read it or watch it on YouTube. It is allegory on the inevitability of death no matter how  hard you protect yourself, how much money you have, or how powerful you are. It also contains allusions to the seven deadly sins and the fate of those who party in the wake of mass death among a lower class of people. Although I find the short short to be a stronger narrative than Shults' variation on this reimagination of the classic tale.Both the short story and this film contain people hiding out in a fortress. Whereas The Masque of Red Death's Prince Prospero is held up ins abbey with his wealthy and noble friends while the red death is killing off the rest of the kingdom, A24's It Comes at Night features a typical American family living off the land and secured in their rather tutor-looking mountain lodge. Like in Red Death, the family in It Comes receives an uninvited guest one night. Here's where we see some difference. In Poe's story, the guest is dressed to attend the masquerade ball and in this film, the guest attempts to break into the home. Although both stories take different approaches to the second act, once thing is in common. And that is the taking in of an outsider. All through the second act, there are hints at something not being right--a constant uneasiness. That apprehension and anxiety regarding the unknown works in the respective stories favors. The emotional impact and psychological payoff differs between the short story and film. Yes, the endings are very similar but feel incredibly different. You'll just have to read The Masque of Red Death and watch It Comes at Night to know for yourself.If you're searching for a thriller to watch this weekend, as it is rain in many parts of the country, then perhaps you should watch Universal Pictures' The Mummy instead. However, if you are curious about how well It Comes at Night parallels Poe's short story, this definitely check it out. Not entirely sure why it's rated R, but in case that's important to you.

A few brief scenes at first seem to be in the horror movie genre, but they are quickly revealed to be only the bad dreams of the teenage boy. I think you're more likely to enjoy the movie if you understand all this going in. This is a low budget, minimalist movie. Almost the entire movie takes place in and around one house in the woods. Probably 2/3 of the scenes take place in the dark. You see a lot of scenes with characters wearing gas masks creeping around in the dark with lanterns or flashlights attached to the end of gun barrels. I never could figure out why they wore gas masks some of the time, but were not worried about removing them at other times. There is relatively little dialog or character development. I didn't have much sympathy for any of the characters. There isn't much suspense unless you consider people pointing rifles at other people to be suspenseful. And not much happens.

166,aquascape,The drama of an unknown virus,6,5 April 2018,"Joel Edgerton excels in independent films and in ""It Comes at Night"" outshine the movie itself, as it turns out to be a bland pandemic horror film that Joel and the rest of the actors sublimely carry.""It Comes at Night"" is about an unknown outbreak of a deadly virus. To escape the virus' effects, Paul and his family live secluded deep in the woods, where they have enough supplies to survive for a while. One night, an intruder breaks in their home and is confronted, captured and tied up by Paul. The intruder later tells Paul that he has a wife and son of his own and they need a place to stay and survive. Paul, played perfectly by Joel Edgerton, is a decent, trustworthy man and is convinced by his family to bring the others in. That is when the trail of terror started to develop and affect everyone's lives. The screenplay lacks details on how it started, where it began or what the virus was, dealing only with the troublesome family's survival. The action is slow and dragging, feeling more like a filler episode of a lengthy television series. The only thing that makes it worth watching is the terrific acting of the cast, as they gave sense and meaning to their struggle with the unknown disease in a desolate future.""It Comes at Night"" is more of a drama film with horror undertones that just doesn't deliver in the end.",It Comes at Night

The ones that don't need anything more than good writing and good acting. It Comes at Night fits the bill.The movie was able to convey its plot effectively without providing any backstory, which is hard to do. Yes, the viewer will have questions. But the viewer will also be so caught up in the moment that those questions won't interfere with the viewing experience. The acting, especially, was very well performed by every member of the cast, which is quite rare for a lower budgeted movie. I also must commend the writing for delivering a simple, intriguing plot and making the experience both entertaining and insightful for the viewer. And the director tied it all together nicely.Excellent movie all the way around. 8/10- acting was top notch.",It Comes at Night
168,tkell31,So that happened,4,21 September 2017,"I enjoyed it to some extent. The setting was pretty good and the whole slow burn approach was enjoyable, but it suffered from trying to be needlessly clever. Some examples:How does a dog get through a locked door? How do people hugging and kissing their kid not get infected when he got infected simply by holding a kids hand? How long has this been going on? How many people have the killed already because they are far too ruthless to be new at it? Is the kid slow or do they just treat him like he is?Yeah it's nice to have somethings left ambiguous, but dogs getting through locked doors isn't a mystery you can dwell on and come up with multiple plausible answers. There are no plausible answers. The other part of the problem is I didn't like the characters at all. Which is fine if they are well developed, but just unlikable, but that isn't the case here. They are just figures to execute the plot and nothing more.In my opinion it was a good idea that was just very poorly executed with a director who was trying to be a little too cute.",It Comes at Night

To be honest this film is waaay better than the reviews got. This is a great psychogical thriller between 2 families and their safe haven from a plague that had ruined the world.Why did people hate this film? The trailer mislead even me to thinking this was a creature feature. In the reviews there are questions on what IT in It Comes At Night really is.How I see it, The IT in the title is the paranoia and fear caused by this newly developed black plague. This, through a series of nightmares, shows the main characters fear of whatever's happening beyond the house. This provides many scenes unexplained events in the dream and real world giving this film nightmare fuel.I give this a 7/10 for it's well crafted plot and storyline and it's acting.

""It"" is the folder where we place all things foreign and discomforting. But It is not the enemy here. It only sets the environmental conditions for distrust and insanity. People are people's greatest enemy, and It is merely a botched vaccination. Sarah and Paul are parents who have caught all the right breaks, and still have their son, Travis. Isolated in their wilderness mansion, the boy feels trapped in candle-lit wood interiors, especially at night. He dreams of the horrors that scamper in the forest. He fears what he feels but cannot see. Even his desires to secure a mate are tarnished by bloody wet dreams.Paul desperately attempts to maintain any semblance of patriarchal poise, but the shift of the world has rendered him powerless. He has constructed walls, but they are inadequate borders for the plague has spread indiscriminately. A red door remains as the central exit and entrance of their abode. And evil will enter unnoticed. Evil always comes as a welcomed guest.Sarah sits at the lantern-bathed dinner table clutching her husband's paw. She looks into him like an anchor piercing a riverbed. Their survival has been built on brutality, and they forgive each other every night. Supper is the last moment of living in the present, for their beds reek of reflexive demons. The stillness of covers and sheets swallow them in hauntings from the past.They have made excruciating calculations and split-second amendments to be alone, but their solitude feeds their empathy. The silent family secretly seeks opportunities to level out the scales. Their existence begins to be shaped by morality, and this change in policy makes them more vulnerable than ever.An apocalypse. A family in the woods. Compassion. One of these is the killer, and the murderer will know their title all too late. Community was the final bastion of civilization in this world, but It has taken over the ceremonies of communion. The only common meal being broke in this cabin is conspiracy. In a posh certainty, Paul declares, ""You can't trust anyone but family."" The tragedy is that Paul can't even trust himself.",It Comes at Night
174,mancinibrown,Liked it more after the movie than during,6,24 November 2017,"It Comes at Night is hurt by a few things. First: the title. The title clearly makes it seem like it will be a straight horror/monster movie. 2: The trailer. The trailer makes it seem like a downright scary horror movie. 3: The first scene. In the opening scene we are shown a father and son having to kill a grandparent who is very clearly sick with some unknown disease.All these things together make one think the movie is going to be something it's not. The movie is in fact a drama played out over how to survive in a post apocalyptic world. Do you trust anyone? How much can you trust? How do you handle a situation. It's then given horror and thriller elements that go with it.While watching the movie I was upset by what it wasn't. Thinking about it after, I'm more OK with what it was, but it was still somewhat disappointing in its ambiguity.",It Comes at Night
175,damorejj,Bad Title for the Script,5,17 December 2019,"I understand what the director was going for with this film. He was going for a psychological horror, and the movie performed decently, though not as well as some critics are raving, but the title, which I read came to the director early upon writing it as a metaphor meaning fear, paranoia, distrust...that's what comes at night..was a horrible decision.The title implies something of actual substance will arrive in the night, but nothing does. The movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where some unknown disease has ravaged the human race. Very little information is given in the movie was to about the origins of the virus, or how many people are left in the world. We are also left to guess at most of the symptoms and how long the virus takes to kill a person.I believe many directors like this feel less is more, that leaving questions unanswered makes their film more mysterious as thought provoking, but I feel it's a cheap way out of telling your audience you really haven't thought of the plot that well as a writer.The tension builds in the movie after a very long and slow build up, as the two families begin to worry over a situation where the door was left open. But the director decides never to explain it, only hinting that Travis' dreams or visions could perhaps have been a memory and maybe he left the door open. This honestly ruins the movie for me. I don't want to think about how it happened, I want to KNOW how it happened.This movie tries hard to be a think outside the box psychological thriller, but it fails flat due to a slow script and way too many unanswered questions.",It Comes at Night

Contrary to what others may say, I love that some things are left open-ended-- by not defining the 'what', the viewers' imagination is left to run wild and imagine the worst possible outcome.

We were so pumped - the preview trailer looked great, seemed spooky (we love horror movies old and new). We both hated it. We hated every minute of it. Easily the most pretentious movie of the year. The point I emphasized while having our post-movie drinks was this: this movie takes itself way, way too seriously. Jesus Christ, come on man. Everyone is sooooooooo serious. Everything is life or death. Come on, get over yourself. It tries too hard, and it's obvious that it does. Another beef I have is that this is yet another short turned into a feature length film - it's got 15 minutes of content in a 90 minute movie. 75 minutes of filler.Which brings me to my final point: It's boring. Nothing happens. Super, super boring movie. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, about the plot...nothing made me care at all. This movie sucks. I am amazed at the praise heaped upon it from critics. Are you kidding me?! First year MFA students could have done better if they had the same budget. Get the hell outta here.Everyone involved with this turkey should be totally embarrassed and ashamed for being in any way connected to it. And man, I really like Joel Edgerton...he must have had urgent bills to pay because it's hard to reconcile him being in it. Worst movie of the summer.

181,afrodome,A Different Kind of Horror,8,9 March 2018,"I went into this movie semi-blind: I read bits and pieces of critics' reviews and watched the teaser trailer. I was sold on the teaser trailer plus the rave reviews was icing on the cake. With that said, I unhinged my own expectations as I had a feeling that this movie was going to be more of a mood-piece as opposed to another monster movie. I'm so glad it didn't go in the direction of monsters. In regards to the polarization this movie caused with its viewers, I am a little confused as to why people thought this movie implied the presence of zombies in its trailers. The movie obviously implies a 'plague': a virus so contagious that survivors must do everything they can to protect themselves from any potential carriers. The theme of fear and paranoia are expertly interpreted with eerie visuals, sounds, and a stellar performance by every actor in the film. We have all been in situations where we were apprehensive about the presence of certain people. It Comes at Night takes that idea and amplifies it to levels that certifies it to be labelled as horror. When the film ends, there is a horror that's felt; not one of being startled, but one of realization. The paranoia and fear that you carry is brought to light and the reasons are more sobering and grounding than what had been stirring in your imagination; arguably making them even more horrifying.

However, there's something missing - you keep waiting for ""it,"" but as the movie creeps closer to the end, you're increasingly asking what the point of the movie is.The ending is really abrupt, and anticlimactic. I suppose the director intended for the ending to be so quick to leave people wondering and thinking, but all it did was annoy me.Oh, there's a big hole in the story to: why would the people in the house bring in another family, when they've constantly hammered on safety and ""you can only trust family""?

185,ksgillihan,What comes at night? Disappointment does,3,31 August 2017,"The hype was real (so it seemed) for this one and I eagerly waited it's release date. What a missed opportunity!!! I'm not exaggerating when I say the trailer was better than the entire film. Not joking. The biggest tragedy here is that this movie had all the parts it needed to truly be a refreshing new horror. Summary: A man and his wife and son live alone in a post apocalyptic world where some virus has ravaged mankind. They live in the woods in seclusion but that seclusion is broken by a man getting into their house. This new man is taken prisoner and explains to Paul (the main guy) that he is only trying to get food and water for his family. Paul agrees to help the man and they go off to get the new family. There are some other things that happen but are honestly not important. The new family arrives and all is well. Paul's son continues to have nightmares (premonitions?) about various things: his dead grandpa, the virus etc. The son's dog randomly runs off barking into the woods one day and the son chases him. There is an implied presence that the dog finds that seems to be right up over the hill everyone is standing near but nothing is shown. Kind of like this whole movie. The dog returns only to have major damage done to him by something and he is apparently sick also. The dog is put down and paranoia sets it. Soon after a ""nightmare"" the young child of the new family is thought to be sick and so the two families stay apart for a day. The next day Paul's son says he thinks the young boy might be sick. So Paul and his wife go to check on the other family and a tense standoff happens. Outside Paul and the other man fight over a gun and Paul's wife ends up shooting the other man. The other mother runs off with the young boy and Paul thinks this is a good time to murder them both, which he does. After this it's shown that Paul's son is infected and I guess he dies (it's not clear) and the end of the movie shows Paul and his wife staring at each other across the table, possibly sick themselves. So what comes at night?? Nothing. Nothing does. This movie could have used the tension so much better than it did. Also there is implied heavily that there is some creature or something outside the house but it's never shown or resolved in any way. What a huge disappointment this movie was. Never should have been made.",It Comes at Night
186,ReelLifeReviews,A genre all its own,8,9 June 2017,"It Comes at Night - I could call it uncomfortable, claustrophobic, creepy, or disturbing. Any one of these would do, but I'll go with excellent.How would one categorize this film? Labeling it as Horror sets an incorrect expectation, but there are definitely scary moments. Going with Thriller wouldn't match the pacing, but my heart was beating faster in this movie than in any other in quite some time. Would Mystery or Suspense be the most appropriate? You're not really wondering what will happen next, but rather hoping that what you think will happen, won't. Maybe this is an introduction to the Apprehension genre.I loved how this movie was shot. Rather than big sweeping establishing shots or use of vivid color, the focus is right on the characters. The frame is often filled with a character's face; the movie not allowing you to back away from what they're experiencing. You're a fly on the wall that just can't get away.Joel Edgerton is the driving force of the story. He plays a father that puts aside his own morals and humanity in order to keep his family safe. Almost all of his actions seem cold and unforgivable if looked at individually. How they are done in context of the film, however, make you wonder what else he really could have done.I could see some people calling this movie slow. I would submit that it is patient. The pacing is perfect for the subject matter and there is no break in tone with this film. From opening to close there is a feeling of unease. I could also see people say there are too many loose ends. I would say this adds to the despair. Not every point is clear, not every piece introduced gets a pretty little bow.

187,lukas-ingel,It was so close to being amazing!,5,17 June 2017,"My feelings about this movie is very blend, but let me explain it without giving away any spoilers.First off, I will say that you should know that this is as much an apocalypse movie and psychological thriller as a horror movie. I do not think that the part of the ad campaign I had seen before watching the movie had made the apocalypse thing that clear to me. However, did this not affect any of my feelings about this movie as I love those genres as well – I just don't want anyone to go into this thinking it's something it's not.Visually the movie is STUNNING. The actors and characters are great. The scores and all the sounds were well played. Actually everything was really, really good until like, the last 15 minutes. Without giving anything away – of course – I will say that the movie really closes in on itself and in those last 15 minutes you just wait hopelessly for something meaningful to happen that will bring any reason for you to watch it, but it doesn't happen. I've been trying for hours now after the movie ended to come to a conclusion on what the purpose of this movie is, but there just isn't any. Things just happened without anything REALLY happening. Things went down, things went down, and it felt like we didn't move forward in the story at all and then that's it. The movies ends. It left you feel empty and disappointed, which is so sad because a proper ending could have made the overall movie amazing. So close to being there, yet so far away.Truly sad to say it, but I do not recommend it. At least don't waste the extra money to see it in the cinema if you're absolutely going to see it, because It Comes At Night does not have the payoff.",It Comes at Night

StorylineDramatic opening, immediate sense of mystery, costumes are also used effectively.From the first minute, darkness and heavy breathing sound effects hook you. Good signs for things to come...Shadows in darkness are clear, and noise from surface contact almost echoes making you sensitive to every event.
Even the setting is spooky and traditional. Images fade into one another, creating striking visual displays.Time is used well to raise suspense. No event occurs without a chilling build up. Lighting is consistently dim, hiding exactly what the writer chooses.It was a shame nothing truly shocking happened, for the mid-parts of the film. It felt a little more action would have helped showcase the great special effects even more.The ending was very thought provoking. The storyline could've been developed from middle to end, to unravel more of the mysteries from evil presence. I feel a little too much was left open ended for the film to be considered great. A shame for such a great beginning...GenreDarker themes are immediately evident, with lighting and sound effects from the off... Unfortunately, with a lack of actual horror depiction, things never truly build up to the climax of the horror genre. Many mysteries are apparent throughout, so perhaps ""dark thriller"" or ""mystery drama"", may be better genres for this film. Overall though, I guess a slightly letdown horror is how it appears.CharactersStressful voices and breathing, immediately reveal emotional depth to main characters. Character tone of voice and visible expression from the word go, gives you empathy for their roles. A combination of stress, sympathy and shock is felt.
Sufficient time is spent in dialogue, to understand the situation well enough to unravel plot events to come. Relationships develop well in a believable way, introducing more positive themes, not always seen in horror movies.MusicMusic is a series of clash-style notes, which immediately elevate tension. Sound effects and volume are combined in tense moments, lifting the entire experience. Music is kept quiet, where background sounds are important. Both work together very well... Music in happier times, was kept jaunty.Summary""Entertaining and tense till the middle, Peters out after that"".Follow us: Reasea dot org for more movie reviews",It Comes at Night

They appear to be successful in this, until a stranger arrives at night and threatens their fragile existence. The negative comments surprise me a bit, as it's not that bad a movie. There are no big stars but that's probably a good thing as you really feel for these desperate people. Its probably too slow paced for a lot of audiences and the seriously downbeat ending may upset some viewers but it's still a pretty good movie and doesnt deserve some of the negative comments.

Because we-as viewers don't know and can't see what might be there.Secondly, this film scares us because we know that nothing is more scarey than human beings, particularly strangers that we might marginally trust and that trust seems violated.What else works: the pacing is slow which ratchets up our anxiety.

All that's left is the desperation and struggle of a dysfunctional team trying to beat the odds. 
But to enter a world where we aren't handed answers, where we're asked to simply feel the growing fear and dread we need to be truly immersed. We need to believe that the 'red door' truly is the borderline between safety and peril. 
For me, none of the actors had the gravitas to carry off that kind of immersion. The direction, editing and score all worked well but the performances (and script) needed some heavier weight behind them. The development of friction between the characters was too slow, and then too fast with a resolution that felt rushed. 
And the devil in the details don't do the film any favours. That red door should loom large in the narrative. It should be iconic and awesome. They should be slaves to it. They talk it up. It stays closed. There's only one key. But it's apparently a key they never use, trusting a couple of bolt locks that'd be good for the chook shed but no so much for keeping the end of the world out. And the gas mask thing is maddening. Apparently this deadly virus can be avoided by sometimes wearing a gas mask inside...and sometimes outside. So in other words, just wear it whenever.
I love where this film aimed. It should have been a tense, ratcheting up of fear and paranoia, but it really failed to find its groove for me.

200,patomartinezfgo,A very different summer movie,9,6 July 2017,"Most people have found the movie ""It comes at night"" disappointing because of its trailer that makes you believe that the movie will be about something different. I was lucky enough to have a friend tell me that the movie was mis-marketed, so I walked into the film without any expectations and thus, I was able to appreciate the film in a way I would not have been able to if I was expecting something.It comes at night has become my favourite movie of the summer. Trey Edward Shults has a bright future ahead of him. I was completely fascinated by this movie and loved almost every second of it.Let me talk about the cinematography, because its great. The camera moves in such a beautiful way and the shots are perfect. Also, the camera creates a lot of tension in some very good scenes.The color grading is great. The whole movie is pretty dark which makes you feel vulnerable to what lurks in the shadows. Some people might be bothered by that, but I loved it. talking about darkness, the lighting was amazing and looked really natural.The performances are pretty great, and almost all of the characters were very good. I say almost because I believe that the two female characters sometimes didn't have anything to do, but that is just a nitpick.This movie puts you in the point of view of the characters, which I loved. You don't know what is going on in the the movie and it doesn't give you the answers. I loved that this movie was brave enough to not give you the answers and actually lets you wonder.The themes that this movie explores are great. It explores how paranoia can get into someone's head and mess with him, and this creates a lot of great scenes full of tension.The movie also has a lot of dream sequences, which were important to the story, but I believe could have been handled a little better, again, its just a nitpick.And finally, another small problem I have with the film is again, concerning the ambiguities or ""plot-holes"". They aren't really plot-holes, they are just things that are never explained. The director says that the answers exist in his head, and I believe him. I just think that it would be a lot better if he could have left some puzzle pieces here and there so that someone smart enough can figure it out, just like with ""Enemy"".In conclusion, I loved this movie. Is it perfect? No, but I believe that it is a very good movie that every horror fan should watch. Also, if you are not the kind of person that enjoys slow-moving movies, you will hate this one, because it is slow.",It Comes at Night
201,PubHound,An interesting focus on human nature,8,14 November 2017,"8-Behind the mask of a survival flick lies even more, as this ""It comes at night"" is basically a visceral and accurate analysis of human nature. No one is safe in determined situations, and thin trust between individuals can easily leave space to paranoia and suspicion all of a sudden. We fear others will try to deceive us, steal our goods, kill us if necessary to survive, and this threat looks so real that it spreads like a disease. This ""disease"" relates a lot to the one shown in the movie, and for this reason the ending can be interpreted in two ways.It could be that the child was really sick, and so he infected Travis who then ended up infecting his parents, or maybe he just wasn't. He was crying, his parents decided it was not safe to stay there anymore ( the child crying would sound suspicious to the other family ), Travis and Travis' family misinterpreted the situation and ended up killing all of them. Then the disease spreading on their body meant nothing more that the blooming of their paranoia and distorted way of seeing things",It Comes at Night

205,sherylchilders82,Philosophical Horror,7,4 January 2018,"This is quite a heavy film, definitely not meant for pure entertainment purposes. I am still a bit perplexed by the title, but perhaps it is meant to conjure up a number of common superstitions of mythical things that come out at night (aliens, monsters, zombies, etc). I admit that I am pretty uneducated when it comes to art, so I had to do a quick bit of research about the paintings in the film mentioned by another reviewer (by the artist named Bruegel). A quick search reveals that, like many of his time, he was a humanist (but in a different sense from the current definition). But, it leads me to believe that the producers are trying to convey a humanist message through horror, making it kind of an artsy horror movie (being open to interpretation more than your average horror about a murderous bad guy, evil aliens / monsters, or supernatural phenomena). Humanism today is a secular idea, which in simplest terms, is basically the Golden Rule. It also emphasizes rational thought and science over dogma and superstition - basically a moral philosophy not based on religion, but on reason. It's certainly done in a roundabout way, though, as there is no mention of religion in the movie, although the father does stress the importance of having rituals (eating together and staying busy). There are numerous examples of superstition, however. The dog barks and runs at something mysterious. They don't go out at night. They always stay in groups of two, even to the outdoor bathroom. We the viewer don't think much about this. After all, there is a mysterious illness and desperate people on the loose trying to survive. So, we think they are just being safe. ***Warning: Big time spoilers***As a pacifist, I found myself very critical of this movie from the beginning. Why must the father be killed, rather than allowed to die naturally? And in such a cruel way? Must they have wheeled him out to his grave before they executed him? Again, we can justify it in our minds without thinking too much. He is ill and they don't want to spread the infection. He is suffering, so they are killing him out of mercy. But, for me personally, I found the whole thing quite cruel, and was not at all on board with this plot. In the final horrifying scene, when the father murders the innocent woman and child, the morality is probably not an issue for most, I'm guessing. At that point, all would agree that his actions were immoral and unjustified, no matter the intention of protecting his family. Ultimately, the parents are still alive, but at a terrible cost. The son dies anyway. The question of morality over mortality is one that man has been grappling with since the beginning of our existence, and is the basis of all religion. It is what makes us human. At what moral cost are you willing to pay to keep you and / or your offspring alive? And, what is that line which we as a culture can agree is not mutually beneficial for society as a whole? At what point do we protect ourselves over humanity? These are the basic questions I believe this film was trying to address.",It Comes at Night
206,Icedooitle,What do you really see?,8,6 August 2017,"The immediate question I had to ask myself after watching It Comes at Night was, ""What did I really see?"" Certainly there are horrific images and dangers beyond the superficial; but the true fear didn't come from tangible figures, it was evoked from filmmaking that makes the fear personal to each viewer. Whether you are predicting monsters lingering out of frame, or feeling feverish on behalf of the characters, this film has the guts to require the audience to engage. Earlier this year I was pleasantly surprised by the sequel to Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane. Rather than expanding the story to global catastrophe, we entered a very intimate setting with only 3 characters. In that film we knew what waited outside the bunker, making it an emotional game of duality, prison or sanctuary? Somehow, It Comes at Night accomplishes something very similar, without a prequel to add any suggestion as to where the terror is derived. In a remote woodland, in a boarded-up two-story cabin, we again have three characters that have secluded themselves from an unnamed horror. Paul, Travis, and Sarah don't go out at night; they wear gas masks at the slightest foreign element; and seem prepared for anything. Paul (Joel Edgerton) is a hardened man, shouldering the desperation so that his wife and son can live rather than just survive. His son, Travis, is in his late teens and has just buried his grandfather. The grandfather's death, from an unspecific disease, is both a red herring and catalyst for what we begin to understand is an isolated life amidst an apocalypse.The nature of the threat, beyond a sickness, is maddeningly hinted at. Can we expect zombies? Might there be mutant animals in the hills? The ambiguity of the threat could easily become a cheap plot device, if indeed the movie were about the threat. The real story begins when a second family ends up on Paul's doorstep. They are a mirror to Paul's family; a husband, Will; wife, Kim; and child, Andrew. Will's family is younger, and in greater need. Paul sees it as a duty to save those who can be, but makes it clear that his obligations go no farther than that.Social graces work juxtaposed to desperate measures so that politeness is relegated to curt respect. Nothing is free in this environment so harsh rules are accepted without question, and hard work is an expectation. Andrew is only 4 years old and Travis becomes the bridge between this young family and his stern father, breaking protocol for the sake of harmony. The protocol of safety is broken down on the first day. Gas masks are to be worn under strict conditions; the only entrance to the home is under Paul's control, and trust is a privilege that will ride on a razor's edge.The performance that carries this movie is from Travis, Kelvin Harrison Jr. He is the ""us"" in the movie and expresses every human emotion the setting deprives from others. Travis is a teenager almost non- existent in horror films. He loves, fears, but never shows that he is trying to prove himself. His character in almost any other suspense thriller would be gunning to live up to his father's expectations, and add to the divide between the two families. We find from his mourning over his grandfather, and horrible nightmares of suffering the same fate, that he is a child appropriately acting his age. He lusts after Kim, but doesn't create untoward drama. He dotes on the young Andrew, and respects Will. We feel his misery as he watches the humanity in his home unravel.Always in the margins of each scene is the implied horror. I found my speculation for what it might be waning steadily to the film's conclusion. Some might find the ending cheap, or anti-climactic. I can't imagine it ending any other way. The final moments are a subtle reveal that make the earlier climax all the more heart wrenching. If you feel that you missed something when the credits start rolling, you were looking for the wrong monster.",It Comes at Night

211,littlemankazoo,"Light on answers, heavy on paranoia",8,21 February 2018,"There's perhaps no feeling that causes more pain, hardship and bloodshed than fear. The gateway to fear, however, is paranoia. And paranoia is certainly the feeling explored in 'It Comes At Night', a film that is rather interesting in many respects.This film initially was released to rave reviews but was thrashed by general audiences, mostly down to the title and advertising misleading people to believe this was some sort of zombie film or creature feature.What this film REALLY is, to temper your expectations, is a psychological thriller that deals in the mind and our greatest weakness as humans; paranoia. Perhaps, in that sense, the film's misleading advertising preyed-upon our minds and our fears of what we couldn't see.That, or it was just horribly mis-marketed.All of that controversy aside, this film is actually an incredibly well-done thriller all in all. This film succeeds in what it DOESN'T tell you, and DOESN'T show you, which is perhaps why it frustrates so many people who have viewed it and expected something solid.Instead, we get no true answers. We are not provided answers to the many mysteries the film poses, and leaves us with more questions than conclusions...but as I've learned with many good horror films in my day, sometimes the ones that provide the least answers are the most disturbing, and this film certainly falls into that category of ""good"". This film is GREAT, even.The cinematography in this film adds to the hysteria, as much of the film is naturally-lit (Typically by EXTREMELY creepy lanterns) and gives off an ever-present feeling of dread hanging over the entire film. Angles and shots look exaggerated and stilted at times, as if something straight out of a German Expressionism horror film. I would say it comes off as dream-like, but it's far too unsettling to ever describe as such.The performances are serviceable, though Joel Edgerton's leading role certainly carries the weight of the drama. He plays his role perfectly, and adds to the mounting hysteria that he feels, his family feels, and we as an audience feels as well. We see these events through his perspective...though, by the end, we have to wonder if that's a GOOD thing...The minimalist approach the film takes it perhaps the only thing that both aids and hinders the final product, in the end. Strong as it is in its simplicity, the film suffers from that double-edged sword, and left me wanting more out of the experience I was given. That said, what I was given was CERTAINLY more than enough to satisfy my appetite for goosebumps.Also, a fun little nugget of filmmaking about the film that I DID NOT notice until the very end: Watch the dimensions of the screen as the film drives towards its climax. When I realized what they did, I got undeniable chills down my backside.An extremely, extremely well-done thriller that is worth checking-out if you're willing to give it a chance.",It Comes at Night

So much so that it is totally missing the correct audience for it. I sat tonight in a theatre full of people expecting horror and/or mystery and saw them start to get restless halfway in and crack out their phones out of boredom. This movie is about a family that has isolated themselves in a remote area to try and survive a bubonic plague like illness. They meet another survivor with a family and their humanity is tested as they decide whether to help him or protect themselves. It then explores their changing behavior as they think at first they have done the right thing, then later begin to doubt it. It's about how ordinary people behave in a claustrophobic, high stress environment. Violence is minimal, there are no monsters, the plague isn't anything supernatural, there is no psycho, nothing at all to warrant a horror category. There is also no mystery at all. Nothing unexplained happens and the story is linear and takes place over a few days. There is less than ten minutes of suspense in the entire movie. Once could argue it is a drama, but honestly that is stretching it as well. A study in the psychology of people under stress is what it is. It is extremely well acted.

216,roblesar99,"Engrossing, Haunting, and Stunning",9,11 June 2017,"""Do you have any idea what's going on out there?""Early on in director Trey Edward Shults' It Comes at Night, Joel Edgerton's Paul asks Christopher Abbott's Will this question. All Will can do is shake his head. For the majority of the film, the audience is left in the dark as well, with Shults refusing to provide easy answers and instead forcing the audience to grapple with the world and moral dilemmas that he introduces. Set in a near-future where a virulent disease has ravaged the country, Shults' film focuses on two families struggling to survive in the wilderness as paranoia runs amok.It Comes at Night has mistakenly been marketed as a horror film. Make no mistake, while the film certainly produces some effective moments of dread and terror, it plays more like a marriage between a psychological thriller and a family drama. Guessing from the initial reactions from the audience in my theater, I have a feeling that the film will play like last year's The VVitch. Not only did audience members walk out halfway through, but as the credits began to roll, I could hear some of them saying ""What the f**k?"" and ""That was underwhelming."" While audience members might have been expecting a film more akin to say, The Conjuring, as a result of the film's admittedly stellar trailer, Shults forgoes conventional jump scares and instead successfully mixes bone-chilling tension with a disquieting atmosphere.Continuing with the comparisons to director Robert Eggers' The VVitch, which was coincidentally also by A24, I found that I preferred Shults' work. While both are armed with lavish cinematography and fantastic performances all around, something about The VVitch did not click with me upon viewing. I found it to be a film that I admired more than I enjoyed in large part due to its achievements in the technical departments. Perhaps it is Brian McOmber's score that makes the difference, which truly shines in Shults' film. Eerily effective, McOmber's score works perfectly in tandem with Drew Daniels' gorgeous photography to create an unsettling feeling throughout the course of the film.However, the reason the film works rests solely on the shoulders of the performers, who sink themselves entirely into their roles. Joel Edgerton is the standout here, continuing to impress with every film of his that I watch. Edgerton adeptly portrays Paul, a father whose only goal is to ensure the survival of his family. The way in which he pursues that goal, however, is what lends Paul depth, allowing for riveting observation into the way in which he handles the increasingly tougher circumstances around him. As the film goes on, Edgerton brilliantly communicates the fear and paranoia required of him. Kelvin Harrison Jr. portrays his son Travis, and I was equally impressed by his performance. Despite Edgerton receiving top billing, the soul of the story lies with Travis. By allowing us to see his dreams and capturing his moments alone in the attic, Shults imbues Travis with a melancholic spark of humanity, as he wrestles with being a teenager in a world gone wrong. Additionally, the moral dilemmas that the film explores always keep Travis in mind, using him as the balance between the two families.While Carmen Ejogo delivers a great performance as Paul's wife Sarah, Shults' screenplay falls a tad short when it comes to her characterization. While Paul and Travis both feel more realized as individuals, Sarah feels more one-dimensional, which stands in contrast to Riley Keough's Kim. Keough herself, who I first saw in Mad Max: Fury Road continues to impress and she does so again here. Lastly, Christopher Abbott does a stellar job as Kim's husband Will. An early interrogation sequence that features him as the one answering the questions left me shaken, in large part to his performance. Much like Edgerton's Paul, Will's only goal is to ensure the survival of his family, but Shults expertly manages to create tension arising from the irreconcilable differences between the two families.Many have complained about the film's seemingly abrupt ending, but I believe that Shults ends it just as he should. The final shot is silent, yet haunting, as the framing communicates more than any dialogue could.Shults does not deal in black and white, only in gray. There are no heroes and villains, only regular people struggling to survive amid an unspecified event that has brought humanity to its knees. Straightforward in its storytelling, free from unnecessary twists and turns, the film nonetheless manages to get under the skin. If you have not seen the trailer for Shults' film, but wish to see the film, then do not watch the trailer. However gripping the trailer might be, I am glad that I did not watch it before having seen the film. Go into it fresh, and you will be rewarded with one of the most thrilling films of 2017.Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)",It Comes at Night

222,Lugodoc,A Beautifully Made Empty Box,3,10 October 2017,"This qualifies as art-house because it is very well made but has no plot. And by ""a plot"" I mean a series of causally connected events, not a bag of non-sequiters and loose ends. It irks me, and I suspect I'm not alone, when a film raises my curiosity with intriguing puzzles and then blows a raspberry in my face gloating ""you'll never know what killed the dog and it only annoys you because you're a knuckle- dragging Philistine who can't handle artistic ambiguity and has to have everything spelt out for them!"".Okay, I can see how the two families might be a metaphor for Mankind's history of conglomerization and the pitfalls of uniting tribes, and the two guys we met for two minutes might represent bandits preying on civilisation, but I wouldn't have to be thinking about this if these two characters had any history or context as part of a plot.Did Will actually know the two guys? Why is Will inconsistent in describing his family? What are the rules of the plague? How do you catch it? Who opened the red door? How did the kid get in Grandad's room? Was he actually infected? If he was, how? Where did Will get the pistol? Why did no-one have a radio? It's not clever or fair to raise interesting questions like these and then just forget all about them. It makes me feel that I was conned into emotionally investing in the film.",It Comes at Night
223,YellowTea,Travis and His Nightmares,6,11 October 2021,"A decent, but ultimately uninspired and predictable movie. The premise has been done before, to say the least - a family holed up in a house while a pandemic of some kind rages outside. I'm thinking 28 Weeks Later, Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland, just to name a few.Now, just because a concept has had many iterations doesn't mean that it's off-limits and can no longer be done. This movie is still enjoyable, at least if you can't find anything else to watch on a lazy Friday night, or any night of your choosing...Now, let's get into the nitty gritty and let me give you some of the pluses and minuses.Joel Edgerton and Kelvin Harrison Jr. Do a particularly good job in their respective roles. Joel Edgerton plays the hard-assed, perhaps rightfully-paranoid step-father, Paul, to the timid, defeated, and socially/sexually-frustrated Kelvin Harrison Jr, Travis. Carmen Ejogo plays a very muted third-wheel, Sarah, between the two aforementioned characters and barely says a word or two throughout the film. She's totally forgettable and could have frankly been swapped out with any other actress and no one would have noticed.The family eventually invite Christopher Abbott, Will, and his family, Kim, and Andrew, into their home, against their better judgement. What follows is a typical slow-brood of the inner-dynamics between the two families: they get to know each other, like each other, then distrust ensues after little comments over drinks - Will accidentally tells Paul that he's an only child after already telling him that he had had a brother. Soon enough, the dead grandpa's dog re-emerges in the house after disappearing - one of the very predictable elements of the movie - covered in blood and ""sick."" The two families relegate themselves to different rooms as a cautionary measure. Before you know it, practically in the next scene, Travis wakes up his parents and tells them that he believes Andrew, the other family's child, is sick, after eavesdropping on them. Paul and Sarah arm themselves and go to the room. Will doesn't open up at first. When will finally opens up he flashes a pistol and disarms Paul - another very predictable moment. Within a few minutes, Will, his wife, Kim, and their son, Andrew, are dead. The film closes with Travis dying from the infection in a symbolic way, and his parents sitting at the dinner table clearly sick and dying too. So the ""twist"" was that it was their own son, Travis, who was sick all along. I didn't see that coming...The movie felt rushed, predictable, and didn't devote the necessary time to build the characters. I feel a movie like this should really be a series to adequately explore the various vistas and corners that it needs to. But, it's starting to sound a lot like The Walking Dead at this point.In reality, the only thing the film had going for it that made it impactful were the two emotional plot devices, which were the dog dying (what's Hollywood's obsession with showing animal cruelty and death lately?), and the child not only dying, but being killed by Paul. So, to get around the lack of character development, they inserted the two aforementioned plot devices for shock value, which is something that I guess films can superficially rely on to drum up a reaction; a negative reaction is better than none at all in the eyes of the publicity team.Give this movie a watch, but don't expect great things. I wouldn't toss it in the ""garbage"" pile, but I wouldn't delicately place it in the ""masterpiece"" pile either.",It Comes at Night
224,LaLaLandSucks,The Worst SJW/Crybaby Complaining Movie I've Ever Seen,1,10 June 2017,"This writer director wrote and directed this film based off of his father's death from cancer. Boohoo, who cares. If you are going to make a 90 minute movie complaining about your father's illness, then you are a big and weak baby. There are millions of children dying in Africa with no water or food. Your father was just one human being get over it. This movie is completely mis-marketed because he knows the general audience doesn't care about his father and wouldn't want to watch a 90 minute complaint. For 90 minutes, it is another pretentious and clichéd drama with racist stereotypes all around. All the black people in this movie have the worst acting compared to the whites. Clearly, the director intentionally did that so he can start controversy about white power and whites being better than blacks. The movie ends abrupt with no questions answered. The truth is, this movie is about the illness of paranoia and what it leads to. The message that there is just bad and good in the world has been done over thousands of times in other movies. There is nothing original about this film, it just copy cats sources from other scripts. The direction was shoddy, especially the inconsistent lighting and continuity errors. At one point, the director forgot to even use the 180 degree rule. The cinematography was pretty bad. A lot of repetitive camera movement and every framed look like a bad student film. Not a single frame looked like a painting. People should boycott this movie and sue this guy for plagiarism as well misleading his film in the marketing department. 0/10.",It Comes at Night

Let me also say that the title and marketing were a massive mistake, and I don't blame audience members for being ticked off. The movie promised by the title and trailers is not the movie presented.Once you get past these issues, the story itself is quite good. The main characters are believable, and while the premise isn't wholly unique, the film presents a world that is frighteningly realistic occupied by characters worth rooting for. In essence, this is a post apocalyptic film about a plague that has wiped out the civilized world. Our main characters live in a cabin in the woods, getting by. Then another couple with a young child arrives, and things get morally complicated. Who do you trust in that situation? What do you do to protect your family?We watch the characters struggle with these questions, and the stakes are always as high as can be. There's some ambiguity to the events in the film that make it rewatchable, and the ending is as sad as it is shocking. This one has stayed with me since I saw it in theaters.",It Comes at Night
226,gatsby601,Critically Acclaimed Sleeping Pill,4,1 September 2017,"'It Comes At Night' is another survival horror entry that focuses on a family attempting to ride out a plague that has seemingly devastated most of society. The critics and other reviewers on this page have made much out of the camera work etc., etc., but this is just an excuse to have something nice to say about a very familiar idea executed in a not terribly original way. I won't even pick on the fact the film has been marketed as a horror when it's really just a think piece about values. Anyway, the story focuses on a family of three waiting out the fall of society when a second family joins them. And that's it. We do have a few plot points come up, the son has 'special feelings' for the newly arrived female and there is a little 'can we trust the others' but these issues are barely touched on and go nowhere. The final act is such a hysterical downer it feels like it was made deliberately shocking in attempt to justify the 60 minute wait it took to get to it. In the end, I didn't care about the characters, the tension felt forced and I am sick of this Walking Dead thing where people make only passing references to things that should be paramount in their lives i.e. 'What's happened to the world?' and 'What are we going to do about it?' (Besides hide).",It Comes at Night
227,christian-larson,Phenomenal Horror Movie,9,1 July 2017,"It comes at night stars Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbot, and Carmen Ejogo, and its the story of a family that takes shelter at a desolate home in the middle of the woods. I am not going to say anything else since I went in the film knowing nothing about the plot and this made the experience even better. Watching this film I'm glad that I didn't knew what was it about. First things first, the cinematography, lighting, production design, and the music were all amazing. The cinematography was subtle enough that it wasn't obvious and it was expertly crafted throughout the film. The way the camera moved was great since it fitted with the paranoia the characters felt. The lighting was brilliant. Since most of the film is set at night, the sequences when there were nighttime was so real and surreal that it took me off guard. I am so glad that they really thought about every aspect of the film since there are a lot of movies of this genre that don't even give a sh*t about their presentation, their only concern is to spook the audience with jump scares and what not. The production design was also brilliant with a lot of subtle references to the outside world. The direction was phenomenal as it wasn't obvious and it was very subtle. The information given and what was not given was so refreshing since it never explains to the audience what exactly is going on on the outside world. You can easily infer it and it is not painfully obvious nor was it very vague. A movie that did this wrong was World War Z and a movie that did this right was Shaun of the Dead. It is so incredibly rare to find a film that actually respects its audience and actually makes them think when the film ends. You can say whatever you want about the miss marketing but the film itself is very clever. The script was great as it took its time with its characters and the story was not forced in a way that you wouldn't be interested in it. It lets the characters blossom first, then it tells its story. The characters are so real and their decisions are very clever. There are so many scenes where the characters are interacting and its so tense because you really do care about them and because its really well made. The tension-filled scenes are fantastic and really elevate this film. Not only are they incredibly made, but they were subtle enough that the audience can't really tell what will happen next. The ending is really great as it leaves a lot of things for interpretation and it doesn't give you all of the answers you wanted, and I love when a director makes those types of decisions since it is really ballsy. The acting throughout is stellar except for one character. I thought that the mother in the film really had no purpose and she didn't really act very well. She didn't convince me that she was a mother nor that she was scared. The film is not perfect. There is one sound effect that took me out of the film and there is one decision made in the second act that contradicted the characters previous choice. The character of the mom wasn't really well developed and she really couldn't act. Nevertheless, this is one of the best films of this year and it is still debatable if this is my favorite horror film of the year, but it is a damn great one. 9/10",It Comes at Night

232,NormanCroucher,The film's title is misleading...,6,9 October 2017,"An intimate and reasonably involving thriller that isn't about what its misleading title and marketing campaign imply it to be about. This is a somewhat derivative tale about a 'viral outbreak' that we have seen in various forms throughout the years and it treads familiar ground by exploring genre-standard notions of paranoia and survival.What 'It Comes At Night' manages to do better than most films of its ilk is to maintain an unsettling atmosphere of foreboding pretty much from the word go and all the way through to its rather shocking climatic moments, which is genuinely palm sweating stuff. This is thanks largely to a degree of mystery and ambiguity surrounding the context of the 'outbreak' and its origins. Not knowing what exactly is happening, or why, helps to distinguish the piece from other films with similarly small scale gritty takes on the end of the world. Writer/director Trey Edward Shults makes good use of his arena and isolated woodland location, managing to evoke a palpable sense of unease while showcasing his skills in building tension. It's a shame the screenwriter side of his brain couldn't match the precision and originality of his promising directorial talents.The biggest draw of the film is Joel Edgerton. He turns in another one of his put-upon everyman characters - something he has become an expert in portraying - and the intensity of his performance keeps the disappointingly pedestrian story alive. The rest of the cast lack his fervent energy and their characters feel flat by comparison, but that is mostly due to how they have been written. Consequentially, it is difficult to fully invest in their plight and fight to survive. You don't want anything bad to happen to them but you're not desperately rooting for them to live happily ever after either. Perhaps Shults wanted everyone to feel as real as possible to reflect his matter-of-fact presentation style, as if we were watching a slice of post-apocalyptic life, but some more personality and definition to the characters would have gone a long way.All in all, this is a well made 'infection' thriller with a compelling lead performance by Edgerton, plus a good level of suspense and mystery, but it falls short of being something truly special on the account of its uninspired story and listless characters.",It Comes at Night

There was obviously no monsters or villains that came at night in the movie although the title implies it. I think perhaps what comes at night is the sickness described throughout the movie.

There were no bad guys here, just depictions of people with families on the edge, trying to survive with the threat of a horrible death lurking literally at the door, 
I found the 17 year old boy's character especially well done. To be a teen growing up in such a world while dealing internally with that fearful horror along with hormones and curiosity and even the simple love of a pet dog would certainly give cause for the kind of nightmares he was having.
 A tense, bleak nightmarish thriller/horror all told.",It Comes at Night
253,FallonTimberlake2016,An underrated masterpiece.,9,20 September 2017,"It Comes at Night has been bashed by most people who went to see it for two reasons: Either because they were expecting a zombie horror film with jump scares every other scene, or because they simply didn't understand the message. I believe that It Comes at Night is an overlooked masterpiece that gives an unflinching look into the human psyche.When many heard the plot, it seems like many of them instantly thought this had something to do with zombies, but it is never really made clear in the film's narrative that that was what the characters are dealing with. We do know that some type of virus is spreading across the world, and it is a problem for the main characters. The film doesn't even give us the context of the title until the third act. (No spoilers)Most films of this genre have characters that make uncommonly stupid decisions throughout, but It Comes at Night thankfully avoids that. Every decision that the main family makes is completely justified and makes sense in the context of the situation.The film also doesn't overstay its welcome, with a nice and short ninety-one minute runtime. This is not a movie that requires thirty minutes of character development in order for us to understand what the protagonists are going through.A special shoutout deserves to be given to Kelvin Harrison Jr., who gives an incredibly complex performance and whose character is the subject of debate for many people who viewed the film.The big reason people are confused by It Comes at Night, if they got past the fact that it's not a horror movie, is the ending. Without giving anything away, I will say that the ending is ambiguous. The film never gives you a clear answer to the overbearing situation, but that is why I love this film. It never cuts to a compilation of news footage that tells you what happens or even tells you anything at all. Everything that you know is everything that the main characters know. If the main characters don't have a grasp on the science behind the disease, then why should the audience? The ending sticks with this philosophy, and most viewers hated not knowing anything and gave the movie a two star review on IMDb without thinking of the deeper meaning.I'm not going to get into the meaning because you'll have to watch it to find out, but overall I think that It Comes at Night is totally underrated and should be seen more as long as people go in expecting a psychological thriller. I give It Comes at Night an A-.",It Comes at Night

The only small positive part of this film is psychological part, there is a person whom elimited 2 fimilies cause of his/her sickness, and for sure it is all about mind. Better to say psychology.
The director do not need to prepare these scenes to say these meaningful story. This movie has only last 10mins which need to watch. Make viewers eager for a monster to coming out is good, but only if the monster comes out. The director was a tiny man/woman, some how ..beeb..
I vote 4 cause i do the same for all these kind of movies. But i like to vote 0. Not even a tiny ghost inside, no fear, no mystry, no horror.
Better to say Crime, drama. There is nothing to fear from, but daddy likes to kill. Some people said ""nothing comes at night"" but i say ""the people whom has psychological sicknesses will be alone soon"" and dear director, with blood and a person whom is killing everyone you can not make horror movie.

257,mrstrangerjones,I'm So Conflicted,9,9 June 2018,"A24 has had a slew of horror movies that were all critically acclaimed, which include ""The Witch"", ""Green Room"", ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"", ""The Killing of A Sacred Deer"", and (most recently) ""Hereditary"". However, some of these have been less popular with general audiences.
With ""The Witch"", I fully leaned towards critics. I thought that it was a fantastic film that just slowly creeped up on me and got under my skin.
However, I didn't feel that same way with ""Green Room"". It was a fairly good (and EXTREMELY violent) film, but it had a slightly thin plot and fairly stupid characters.
Despite A24 being one of the best film studios in our day and age, I haven't been fully towards or against them. And no movie has expressed my confliction more than ""It Comes At Night"".It should be noted that there were things in this movie that I loved, as well as things that I didn't really like.PROS:
All of the lead performances (considering the fact that there are only 9 people seen throughout the entire film) are really good. Joel Edgerton really sold me on his character (when has he not?) and was probably the strongest part of the entire film. The actor playing the young child in this film was also quite impressive; I'm not saying that we have another Jacob Tremblay on our hands, but I am saying that he didn't seem unrealistic (then again, he wasn't really given that much to do throughout the film's runtime, so he didn't have enough time to get annoying)The cinematography was quite nice.Like ""The Witch"", this film was also able to creep me out quite a bit. Both films barely relied on jumpscares (which is a big breath of fresh air).CONS:
There are so many elements of the film's plot that are left ambiguous, that it just infuriates me. There is a major plot point introduced around halfway into the film, but the film ends without it being resolved. In fact, the director has stated that he doesn't even know whether or not he will disclose the answer to this plot point. What makes me so mad is the fact that this is an extremely important plot point that basically leads to the entire last half of the film. The director is morally obligated to disclose this information.Overall, this movie had big potential, but squandered it for the sake of ambiguity.",It Comes at Night

Instead of ANYTHING RESEMBLING CLOSURE or even just ONE SLIGHT HINT AT ANY SUBSTANCE, Hollywood just ends movies completely unfulfilled and abruptly.. and then chalks it up to ""art"". The plot to this movie is actually really interesting. Joel Edgerton is great. The atmosphere is quite terrific in terms of horror. And then... nothing. This movie was completely anti-climactic and so many questions from minor to earth-shattering are left unanswered and DELIBERATELY unexplored. Screw this.

260,rtbradford,Somewhat Misleading Title,6,15 September 2017,"*Spoiler alert*As many, many reviewers have noted, nothing scary actually comes at night, despite the title and trailers that suggest otherwise. So as a horror movie, this one is right up there with the original Blair Witch Project for being a complete let down.As a psychological thriller, it wasn't all that bad. It kept me on edge until the very end and left me with many unanswered questions. For example, were the teenage boy's dreams an indication that he was infected? If so, maybe the dreams are what came at night.And was the teenage boy was already infected when he touched the little boy? If so, he infected the little boy, rather than the other way around, which would be an interesting twist.The acting was very good all around. You really had a sense of this small isolated family struggling to balance self protection with the desire to connect with and help others. There was plenty of suspense throughout the flick. If the title wasn't so misleading, I think people would have liked the movie better.",It Comes at Night
261,imdb-936-837144,Nightmare on the dirt road,9,12 June 2017,"The film opens on a dystopian future in a makeshift isolation room. An old man Bud (David Pendleton) is delirious (""Can you hear me?"") as he is consumed by plague. His daughter Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), her husband Paul (Joel Edgerton), and their son Travis (Kelvin Harrison, Jr.) wearing gas masks and rubber gloves trans­port Bud to his final resting place. Sarah doesn't want their 17-year-old son to see this, but Paul needed his help loading Bud into and out of the wheel barrow. This film is so R rated that even the actor playing the 17-year-old should be kept from seeing the scene he's in.From a later dream sequence we gather the disease is sexually transmitted, as well as by air and by body contact. Further­more, worries about the dog getting loose give us to under­stand it can jump species. It's no wonder the authorities are not called—what authorities?—and the family tries to avoid people—what people? By and by, they team up with another trio: Will (Christopher Abbott), Will's wife Kim (Riley Keough), and their toddler son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner). They figure the greater number will help them stand against outside trouble that's sure to come. How­ever, Paul advises his son Travis, ""You can't trust any­body but family, good as they seem."" This premise is going to be tested.Precious little info is given us on their previous lives, although we learn that one of the men had been a teacher of history. I hate history as much as the next guy, but this hints we might learn some­thing from it. Because of the apocalyptic scope of their troubles, I'd want to try biblical history. Let's look at the after­math of the deluge.The old world was beset by sin and violence passed on by a corrupted seed; however, (Gen. 6:9) ""Noah was  perfect in his generations."" His wife also presumably came from good stock, and they and their three sons Shem, Ham & Japheth along with their three wives were saved from the world­wide punishing flood by riding out the rain in an ark. Noah was 600-years-old and his wife 100 years older when that happened, so she'd quit bearing by when the time came to repopulate the earth, and perhaps a good while before then. Since the mother of Shem and Japheth is mentioned in the book of Jasher, but not the mother of the youngest Ham, speculation has arisen that the latter's mother could have been a hand­maid according to custom, perhaps not of the best seed. At any rate Ham failed the test Noah gave him, but Shem and Japheth passed. (I've elaborated in my review of ""The Dinner."") Noah blessed Shem—from whom came the Semites—and also Japheth—whose name means enlarge, and whose offspring settled all over—saying, (Gen 10:27) ""God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant."" Canaan was the youngest son of Ham who failed the test, the judgment being delayed for a number of generations.Paul in our movie has a namesake Paul in the Bible, a converted Jew self-described as ""an Hebrew of the Hebrews."" Sarah's biblical name­sake was Abraham's wife. Will and Kim raised goats and chickens and show a fondness for onion soup an ethnic food, so they represent Japheth who spread all over and was to dwell in the tents of Shem (the Semites), as we see here Will's family dwelling in the house of Paul. Canaan included the tribe of Gibeon who in fact became (Joshua 9:23) ""bond­men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water"" to the Israelites, this being preferable to complete annihilation. In this movie hewing wood and pumping water were the two farm tasks shown giving a sense of normalcy.Here's the interesting part. One of Ham's other sons (who would also inherit servitude) was Cush, Hebrew for black, who went and settled in Africa, providing a sort of eventual justification for Negro slavery. In ""It Comes At Night"" Paul is white, and his wife is black but could pass as white if one doesn't look too closely. Their son Travis, how­ever, through some trick of genetics, has pronounced Negroid features, so that when his (white) dad orders him around, it looks like a white man bossing a black ""boy."" But Travis is kind of stupid, so our sympathies are that he needs bossing. And this is not politically incorrect, for his dad married a black after all, and pc is based on Thomas Jefferson's all men being created equal, not on the story of Noah. However, racism is based on that story, so from that perspective the film is racist. Racist and politically correct at the same time. Go figure. I give it kudos for cleverness.Anyhow, it you're black and you're looking for a film to help make you feel good about yourself, there are plenty of offerings in theaters, which will do just that, but this isn't one of them. Instead, it's mind bending in its simplicity and one I enjoy for what it is. If you like dark films, here's one that might appeal to you for added variety. If you like more upbeat Holly­wood fare, go see something else.The acting worked, but was nothing outstanding. The sets and background were elemental.",It Comes at Night

I kind of felt tricked into watching this movie thinking it would get better, thinking that something would come out of the plot, like some great reveal. I felt the movie was more of a drama than a horror/mystery. I felt the plot was very one dimensional. There was really no background given on the situation the characters were in. It was pretty annoying how the directors made it seem like something ominous was really going to happen only for nothing to ever happen. It was really full of jump scares.I thought all of the actors did a great job though. This movie had potential. The plot was just disappointing.It's not a bad movie, it just drags.

After watching the first 10 minutes, the tension made you thought it is going to be like The Walking Dead. You thought maybe it is a monster movie. But half way through, nothing! It's just the two families talking. The dialogue is not boring though. But still, you expect something sinister to come at night.The scary bits are all dreams. Dream sequences pss me off. Because most dream sequence are not real. Just a cheap way to scare audience.So, there's no 'It'. 'It' doesn't come at all. If you want 'It', wait for 8th September.

264,theta30,It comes at night,5,17 June 2017,"There are not many special effects or means to create these, except the guns. There is a painting by Bruguel, whose paintings appear as a reflection of human condition in films by other directors (say, Solaris). We see Paul's family reading books. That hints that there is a reflective sub-tone of the movie.Travis acts as a catalyst since his spontaneous reactions often are followed by more misfortune.He does not have the down to earth mind of his father. Travis is a teenager who builds up fear and frustration. These reappear through his drawings or dreams. The dreams become more and more elaborate. Here the director appeals to a trick, which becomes a theme. He tricks us into believing his dreams are real and the horror fodder that we are used with (such as the scene where Kim spurts blood out of mouth). This deceptive method reminds me of Haneke. In this sense I found the final interesting, since it still could be partially Travis's dream. And here comes the other, encompassing deception: not only dreams are deceiving, but what is suggested as reality might be an appearance. Who really was the ""sick"" one? What really happened on the night when the red door was opened? And of course, what happened at the end? Alternative scenarios could be construed and we are not given the answers that we might crave for. Interesting indeed.I can't say I was much thrilled (maybe because of seeing too many movies recently) and felt like the movie lacks some salt and pepper, despite the good intentions. Thing is the more you think about the movie, the scarier it becomes. Perhaps what comes at night is some basal, primitive, terror. The naturalistic, simple scenery in which the action takes place suggests that. There are some plot points that might be discussed (they put off and on gas masks or wash their hands, usually sloppily, to fend off some unknown pathogen-a kind of blind protection; why did they accept strangers when they distrusted them so much?; and so on).",It Comes at Night

267,nadeeshantennage,Simple but clever adoption of apocalyptic concepts,8,10 May 2018,"'It comes at Night' is a gut wrenching portrait of how basic human qualities which comes with humanity can be overpowered by 'human survival instincts' at desperate times.
The greatest assets of the film are its compelling script and convincing performances.
specially by Kelvin Harrison who plays Travis who with his conflicting poses and looks can make the flow of the plot seem even more convoluted to the viewers.
The tension between Paul played by Joel Edgerton and Will played by Christopher Abbott also affects the continuously kept momentum in the film which in turn helps the viewer to get invested in the flow of the story.
The director Trey Edward has ultimately managed to keep the suspenseful resonance of the film with several conflicting dream sequences which revolve around Travis.
If you are a fan of movies made on apocalyptic themes this is a must watch for you.
But don't expect it to be filled with blood and gore all throughout as usually how it is in the genre but instead expect a movie which works out just fine with much tender suspenseful plot points and emotional resonance.

Without using much dialogue we understand the situation every character is in, which is quiet impressive film making.However, the most impressive thing about the movie is how the dream sequences and the real life sequences are slowly blending into each other. Directly at the same time, the tension is picking up without realizing until a final confrontation, which, in my opinion, is one of the hardest to watch confrontations ever.

273,petersaarloos,Good piece of craftsmanship on a low budget,7,26 June 2017,"It Comes at Night is tagged a horror film, but is more a psychological thriller about two families who meet after a mysterious disease has spread across the country. They know little of the situation, resulting in a very realistic sense of isolation and paranoia that is effectively conveyed in the movie.I was impressed mostly by script and the actors. It Comes at Night does something I like a lot in movies: it tries to be natural and real and doesn't resort to cliche's in the script. It conveys the characters and their relationships through their actions and keeps them down to earth and emphatically convincing. Perhaps it was the ambition of the script to make its audience not want to scream at the screen when the characters do something stupid to drive the plot.Yet while It Comes at Night delivers on these points and is carried by a phenomenal cast of actors, it fails to deliver on its plot. It never quite becomes a horror, doesn't dwell on the psychological conflict enough to be a proper psychological thriller, and the 'twist', while interesting, isn't really capitalized upon. There seems to be no real point to the film either, which reminded me of the ending of Lynch's motto ""Silencio"": sometimes the point of a film is simply to watch, and isn't conceptual. Yet although It Comes at Night as some appealing visuals at times, it is never quite as visually stimulating as other feel-bad films like Mulholland Drive or Requiem for a Dream.Altogether, I didn't dislike this film, and what they did on the <5 million dollar budget was definitely impressive.

The first half hour or so was a claustrophobic paranoid induced nightmare of atmosphere. The camera never stood still, the music was continuous and spine tinglingly good. I was thinking at this point that we had a masterpiece of the genre on our hands, hoping upon all hope the film could keep it up. The second half goes for an even more languid change of pace (that stops in time before it becomes laborious), and turns into a physiological drama that is emotionally driven that always keeps the fear in your mind, reminding us that what goes unseen is scarier than what is shown.The least said about the plot the better, although everything in the film is left a bit ambiguous it does not feed you explanations and at times here you wish you had a little bit but it's up to you for conclusions.It comes at night has certainly been mismarketed and will undoubtedly hurt audience reactions.

This is definitely not the typical jump scare, absolutely horrifying film. Its a great and unique physiological movie about a post apocalyptic world that has crumbled civilization​ but I loved how they never show the outside world but rather we learn little knowledge from the characters. There are two families living together which are very fleshed out and have many good scenes together which I loved they did. But this movie is not all glitter and kittens. We as an audience, go on a very well made journey to witness how anything strong can crumble as time progresses. I am definitely going to be in the minority as I loved this film. My other family members hated it, but like I said they thought it was going to be completely different than what it really is supposed to be.

277,jpsimmons-72015,Lack of substance is what killed this movie.,5,11 January 2020,"The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete waste of time in my opinion is that it keeps you genuinely interested with intriguing scenes for a majority of the time and the solid performances from the actors, even though they didn't have much to work with. What ultimately kills it though is the lack of substance behind the writing and directing. My first big problem was the characters silly actions (mainly the teenage boy). He doesn't act his age whatsoever, he comes across more like a 7 y/o, not 17. He makes thoughtless action after thoughtless action to the point where I was questioning if he was mentally handicapped. The other characters made weird, illogical choices from time to time but for the most part they were forgivable, except in a couple of scenes where the main female character had multiple opportunities to save her husband by shooting a man (she barely knows) that was about to kill him, but instead she decides to hesitate for no good reason.My second and last huge problem with this movie is that it is a little too vague. We are told absolutely nothing throughout the entire film about what ""Comes at Night"", the disease people catch, how many people are estimated to still be alive, and when this all started. We basically end the movie where we begin, there is no message or complete story told. Again it's not the worst movie ever if you're watching it for free because it it has a lot of potential in a few areas but it is nothing worthy of paying to see. At the end of the day it kept me interested the entire duration and that's more than I can say for a lot of movies, so if you're on Netflix, demand, or a free movie sight and you want to see a dark thriller (this is not a horror) and kill some time with friends/family but also want to stay entertained and yell at the tv a little, throw this on.

The movie stars Joel Edgerton as Paul and Christopher Abbott as Will, they both have a wife and a son. You see how they both handle this apocalypse in a different way but they both want to protect their family. Paul protects his family by killing everyone who is infected around them. Will flees if somebody who is infected is around them.Joel Edgarton is so good in this movie, you don't even notice it's him. All the performances are great from everybody. But were this movie really shines is the directing and cinematography, every shot is so beautiful. This is the second feature film of Trey Edward Shults the director, and I have got to say that this director can be the next big movie maker that's how good it is.Try to stay away from the trailers, it looks like a horror movie and it definitely is that but it is more a fear full, dark and depressing movie with great performances. If you wanna understand it fully I would recommend watching this multiple times. It Comes at Night is a fantastic movie and one of the best of the year so far!",It Comes at Night

The viewers could have been given at least a little of what they expected. But no... viewers were made to believe that it was going to a mystery horror, just to be smacked in the face by a drama instead. This angered me so much so that I was tempted to give it a 1 star too, but to be fair, this would have been great as the first 2 episodes of a series. It did build up plenty of suspense, but all the build-ups led to nowhere: Who murdered the dog? Who were those guys shooting at them? Why was the boy in Travis's grandpa's room? Who opened the door?It baffles me why someone would write a script which aim is to apparently mislead the viewers all the way till the end...",It Comes at Night

281,lougadou,"A tough theme, presented well but left unresolved",7,17 September 2017,"I'm not sure if the message of the film is nihilism or what. The characters don't grow or change, the struggles exploited in the film are left clinging to life by the end and you wonder what the director was really trying to say. If the purpose was to make you feel the hopelessness that the characters felt in their difficult situation, then fine, that's a great message. But the development of the characters is so lacking that in the end you actually don't get to experience that. They make poor choices and you don't understand why. The motives are very weakly executed. Fatal flaw. There is no intimacy with their actions, no empathy, at all. They are just strangers that you don't know. So while you are watching something with fantastic cinematography, tackling an important topic with touches on the darkest, furthest borders of human experience, you're left just watching it from the outside, not ever getting the sense of what the characters are feeling or thinking. There is no lesson. You don't learn from them. You don't want to because there is nothing special about them. It's like watching a stranger make mistakes but not caring because its none of your business. Except that in my opinion, a well crafted film should make you feel like it IS your business. I love the stark, hopeless theme, but it's poorly executed. Check out the Road if that's what you're looking for.",It Comes at Night
282,alex-mott,Moody and convincing,6,3 January 2021,"'It' doesn't come at night - not exactly. There is no monster, evil presence or even just a psychotic animal terrorising anyone in this film. It's a psychological drama - and the title could be alluding to the fear that comes with living in a post-apocalyptic world intensifying after the sun goes down. There are no police, hospitals or back up. You're constantly on guard, sleeping with one eye open and every single decision you make is centered around survival, has to be carefully planned and quickly weighed against a dozen potentially fatal outcomes - this could be something as innocuous as driving a few miles to fetch resources or sharing your home with strangers to spread the workload.

The film title.What you get here is a tense, raw, powerful movie - a close knit family are forced to make life changing decisions - Joel Edgerton who plays the father is truly proves he is a solid terrific talent.There are no monsters - loose plot -- a deadly virus has broken out (presumably worldwide) and a family of three are living in a big log cabin out in the woods - security is paramount. Gas masks, gloves are worn regularly. Presumably the virus is not airborn and can only be passed on through touch. Another family join the household and that is where things get a little trickier - they both try to bond yet paranoia is in the air. They cannot trust each other 100%I suspect this film will not profit, or be watched because of all the negativity but if you are a true film buff I hope you check it out and appreciate what a special piece of work this is.Think Fear The Walking Dead/Cabin Fever.... no monsters --- a few very good jump scares and the film should keep you on edge throughout.

HR Giger's creations are infinitely scarier and more entertaining than this rambling nonsense written and directed by Trey Edward Shults. This is Shults' sophomore feature outing. He won acclaim for his debut feature Krisha in 2015 which promised great things to come from this new screen-writer and director. Sadly It Comes At Night is not it. Billed and advertised as a horror movie, full credit has to go to whomever edited the trailer which sold this as something scarier than it is. In reality, an encounter with the Daleks is scarier.The story focuses on a family holed up in a house in the woods, hiding from an external threat which we later find out is a plague of sorts. It's not a zombie plague, which would have been a major misstep, it's more of the boil and pestilence kind. They encounter a young family one night when the father breaks into the house. Both families decide to live together and make a go of survival. Tensions rise. Paranoia increases and things don't go too well. The film dribbles towards an ending.Joel Edgerton plays Paul, the patriarch of the house, married to Sarah (Carmen Ejogo, who we last saw in the excellent Selma) and they have a son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr) who wanders about the film in a perpetual catatonic state. Christopher Abbott is the father of the second family and is married to Kim (Riley Keough). They have a three year old son, Andrew. Roles and motivations are simple. Back-stories are scant. Futures look bleak.Act I has Family No. 1 living in their house in the woods, burying their father/grandfather and eking out an existence until they meet Family No. 2. Act II has both families learning to live and work together and protect each other but never quite trusting each other. Act III see the paranoia set in and they decide to part company with devastating results. An episode of The Walking Dead is better written, has more tension, scares and drama than this.There is nothing to see here. Move along.1 out of 5",It Comes at Night

If you watch movies to be entertained and you want to have a good time then I suggest you skip this one.

One of the sons, Travis, has bad nightmares and insomnia. Everyone wears gas masks and gloves and the doors are locked at night. There might be something out in the woods, but it's unclear. I won't say anymore specifics, but by the end of the film not everything is tied up in a neat bow and there are a lot of holes left deliberately open -- it's not a perfect, circular film. This is the type of film where you rush to Reddit to read all the fan theories. There are a couple of jump scares but this movie is more interested in what goes on in our minds when we hear a bump in the night, how we fill all the blanks. There's something wordless and imageless that exists in the depth of our imaginations that's connected to fear -- a movie monster is always less scary once it's on screen and out of our imaginations -- and it's that something that It Comes at Night tries to tap into, and pretty successfully too.

The film does a great job of building, and sustaining, tension. Atmosphere and setting are good. Acting is competent. Cinematography, lighting, etc. are all nicely done. Even the pacing is good.The story revolves around a mysterious ""sickness"" that has presumably crippled civilization and we are introduced to a small cast of characters struggling to survive the epidemic.

There is no idea what this plague is or where it comes from, a germ, a monster, Jehovah's Witnesses? The film is little more than a day in the life of a family facing an unfortunate situation. It's ugly, unpleasant, and it amounts to little more than looking through a neighbor's window to see a few minute of a fight.

*Which kid let the sick dog back in the house?

This movie isn't about the infected coming to kill the well, it's not about gory zombies eating you up, it's about how a family would survive (but never thrive) under an end-of-the-world scenario. And in that respect, it hits it out of the park. Unfortunately, this film was marketed as a horror, which understandably left some people hoping for something else unhappy. It's more of a drama or even thriller, but it's of the human--not undead--kind, and it's very gripping. I wasn't bored, I was't disappointed, maybe partly because I didn't read up about it before viewing. When I read reviews that say I didn't pay $13 to think about a movie then I just have to believe that that person will never understand this movie and it just isn't for them. If you'd like to imagine a real-world scenario about a pandemic or post-apocalyptic world, check this out. Keep an open mind.",It Comes at Night
325,mduquenoy-1,Nopey nopey nopeface,2,4 October 2019,"No joke this is absolute tripe. Dull, laboured, indulgent and ineffective. One of those films where the credits rolling takes you by surprise as you don't honestly believe that could be the ending because you feel so cheated. Well it is and actually it means the boredom has ended.",It Comes at Night
326,bljdwalker-1,You Probably Won't Like The Ending,3,28 December 2017,"I first thought that the title sounded very juvenile. Reminds me of amateurs who put up a billboard that says, ""IT is COMING."" They smile to themselves but give only consternation to their target audience. But of course, this year Stephen King's movie AND this movie have proven me wrong because you apparently don't have to be very creative with your title to reach the masses.Still...THE PRODUCERS HAVE BETRAYED MY TRUST AND I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR MOVIES!As other's have said, nothing lives up to the title. Nothing comes at night. 
Aside from the deceptive marketing by the greedy producers, there actually are some good qualities. Basically, they pulled off a very good, low-budget depressing drama.It is good for what it is. I am old enough to remember all the hype with The Blair Witch Project. My friends and I were having lunch when a reviewer on the radio said, ""This is an amazing movie and to think it was made my college students!""
We all said, ""Enough! We give in. We will go see it right now.""
Well, when the house lights came back on we just sat and stared at each other and the others around the theater and said, ""You're kidding. We've been had!"" This isn't an amazing film for being produced by a bunch of college students. This is EXACTLY what a very good college film looks like! Are the critics so out of touch with reality that they don't know what a college student film looks like?The same thing with The Evil Dead. It is not an amazing film on it's own rights. It is just a very good indie film by a young Sam Raimi college student. Or take the movie Open Water where the scuba divers are stranded. It is not an amazing film. It is just a very good low-budget indie filmAll of these films had no real story and no satisfying ending.
Another example with a bigger budget and an excellent writer and director is Frank Darabont's The Mist. Just proves that those of us who want a climactic, heroic ending can be victims of advertising. All of these movies failed to live up to my expectations because of the false hype and unsatisfying endings.Now, if you changed the title from IT COMES AT NIGHT to IT COMES FOR EVERYONE that would have been a little more truthful.
Not that the title change alone could save this movie. There were too many unfulfilled expectations.SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS.The boy sees something in the woods and it is never resolved.The dog comes back-- a mystery that is never answered.We are invested in the characters, and receive no reward for our investment.To be fair, there are clues as to what the director was trying to tell us.
Apparently we are supposed to deduce that the boy opened the door and therefore got infected by the dog. Which ultimately leads us to the depressing ending of the infection spreading to everyone and the last couple sitting at the table waiting to die. But there is a fine line between telling the audience too much and not telling them enough. This is a good character piece, but not a movie for people who enjoy a good story. A case in point: I was amazed that the Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy movies Before Sunrise and the sequels got such high reviews. I realized that for some people there doesn't need to be a story so much as vicarious involvement in engaging characters. Personally, I prefer a good story. There was a lot of buzz about The Sixth Sense. It had a new writer and director (Night Shyamalan) and an excellent performance by Haley Joel Osment. But the reason people went back to see it a second time was because of the fulfilling story with a satisfying pay off. The same thing is true of The Orphanage. And more recently, the movie Get Out. Which arguably also has an unimpressive title until you actually watch the movie. These movies have stories that give you a payoff. Yes we should as a culture be mature enough to watch a Greek Tragedy once in awhile. But you should not be set up to expect a creature thriller.",It Comes at Night
327,rail-40-145912,Worth expectations,8,29 August 2017,Maybe it's not that wow. But the script is very good quality. Camera and filming are on a good level. Something to watch years later for sure. The script takes all the attention and you don't even notice actors which are good as well. Very easy to watch at that very slow developing pace. Very nice done background music. It's 5.8 +1 for the script + filming and +1 for the easiness that all of the works bring to the movie.,It Comes at Night
328,nickrissmeyer,Interesting take on the genre.,7,13 October 2019,This was a very refreshing and interesting take on the genre. It's more depressing anxiety ridden horror rather than jump scare gore fest horror. The character development was superb and the acting as well. The whole film had a thick layer of uneasiness that made me feel like I was more than just a viewer.,It Comes at Night
329,SciFiandScary,"Fantastic post-apocalyptic drama. Not a horror, though.",7,19 July 2017,"It Comes At Night was a great post-apocalyptic drama that tried too hard to give itself a false-horror feel. It was that trying to add horror that wasn't already there portion that made it fizzle a bit. The movie just outright felt like it didn't know what it wanted to be.It Comes at Night was well-acted. The cinematography was fantastic.  The dialogue was sparse and fitting. There were moments of quiet that really set the atmosphere. While there were a few lulls, it was for the most part paced well. I will note, however, that part about the pacing is from my partner. I, personally, was bored to near tears frequently, but as that's more because I have the attention span of a flea, I'm not going to take it out on the movie.Basically, if it had promised what it actually was, instead of trying to be something it wasn't, I think the reception would have been a lot more positive.  It Comes at Night had so much going for it.  From the aforementioned cinematography to the excellent actors, it scored a lot of high points. I loved the fact, too, that the family was multiracial and... well, the family was simply multiracial. The husband was white, the wife and son were not. It was simply there, and it never played into the story. Not even one tiny bit. It Comes at Night had moments of delicious ambiguity. We left the theater with a lot of questions, and no good answers for them. It wasn't really clear how long the problem had been going on. I initially thought months or years. But then it made it sound like it had only been weeks. I liked that. And, for once, I can't even gripe about the ending! It was pretty much perfect. It didn't spell things out, but you knew what was going to happen. Lovely, really.I loved the red door in It Comes at Night. It wasn't subtle, it wasn't even necessary, but it made for very striking imagery. Especially since one would think they didn't paint the door red just when the feces hit the fan, but that it was probably already that color. And it says so much. You know when the danger comes, wherever it comes from, that door is how it will get in. I felt like this movie was set up to fail, though. From the misleading marketing of It Comes at Night, clear to the fact that it was only receiving extremely limited screenings at the theaters. Our local theaters only showed it once a day at 4:55 pm. Who exactly rushes to see a 'horror' movie at 4:55 pm? Nobody! We had to arrange our schedule specially just to go see it!",It Comes at Night

This film is a fantastic study of paranoia, isolation, and an utter lack of hope.It clearly went over quite a few heads, and that's okay. Some people need film to be constantly linear, with undeveloped characters taking one action after another in a drudging serialism until an ending is reached that answers all of their questions real tidy. If you are one of those, don't bother with this film, the next quarter billion dollar Avengers movie is just around the corner.However, if you can appreciate pacing, subtlety, and a filmmaker who respects you enough to allow you to dwell on the ending and maybe even come up with your own answers, dig in.

Every ""tense"" moment in the film is in the trailers and it all escalates to absolutely nothing. They say there is an apocalypse, but you never see it. They say there are monsters, but you never see them. It Comes at Night is a weak family drama that tries to pretend to be a post apocalypse horror film but just isn't.The acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography, score, etc is all well done and they clearly wanted to make a good movie which on a technical level they achieved. Sadly, if only they had a better screenwriter it could have been a great film.

After that the story becomes painfully drawn out and maintains a very slow pace throughout. It doesn't really go anywhere and by the end I kicked myself for wasting all that time watching it. I guess I must have really hated the ending. On the plus side, the acting is excellent, cinematography and directing also very good.But it started to feel like the real horror was how the writers could extend the important scenes over such a long period of time. The entire movie script should have been condensed into 30 minutes, it really was a short story with no defined beginning or ending. There are much, much better short stories out there from a writing perspective so, yes, I've just realized it was definitely the writing that was the weakest link in this production.

335,ZephSilver,A Small-Scale Title with Bigger Implications.,7,17 June 2017,"It Comes at Night is a film that discards typical horror movie tropes in place of actual craftsmanship. There are no big revelations being made here, no grand ""aha"" moment that would have you giving a standing ovation. All it offers you is a general sense of paranoia that's fostered under the right set of circumstances. Using different aspect ratios (letterboxing) to insinuate the differences between reality and a delusional dream state was not only a clever bit of extradiegetic storytelling but also a great conversation piece once you get to the finale. By playing with the subconscious understanding of these aspects and the simple mechanics of the world created, you basically get a film that demands a rewatch upon completion or at the very least, a proper discussion of the events delivered in the 3rd act. All the performances were fantastic. Even the younger characters were believable. In a short period of time, they all became flesh and blood people, with none feeling gimmicky or poorly placed.Perhaps this film was too subdued for its own good. As was the case with 2015's The Witch, this film's dedication for a higher pedigree of horror movie storytelling may have effectively deafened its acceptance from general movie goers. With that being said, this is basically another shoe-in for cult status territory.",It Comes at Night

Joel Edgerton delivers a masterful performance as a father who is desperately trying to balance protecting his family and preserving his own humanity. The small cast around Edgerton are similarly excellent, specifically Kelvin Harrison Jr. who plays Edgerton's son. Harrison Jr.'s portrayal of an awkward young man immersed in a tragic world is truly eye-opening; he is definitely one to watch out for in future films.The cinematography is truly excellent throughout, with a great number of hand-held shots that add to the realistic feel. Tension is heavy and present from the first frame of the film to the last frame of the film. Credit to director Trey Edward Schults, another talented name to look out for in the future.One negative, if you could even call it that, is that the film is so tense and somber throughout that some viewers won't find this to be an enjoyable watch. In this way, it is reminiscent of 2004 post- apocalyptic drama The Road. Also, It Comes At Night is being marketed as a horror film, which it is not. While the film is scary at points, it does not fit the traditional conventions of a horror movie.Be forewarned; this movie isn't for the faint of heart.

356,andrewcaniglia,Great ORIGINAL movie that probably isn't for everyone,9,19 December 2019,"When the trailers were just being released for this movie, everyone and I included thought the ""it"" was going to be some sort of supernatural being that kills indiscriminately. In other words, it seemed like it was going to be like Bird Box or A Quiet Place, even though neither of those movies were made yet. When the truth came out that there's nothing supernatural about it, or there doesn't appear to be, then that inevitably left people annoyed which is why there are so many low ratings.However, I reckon this movie will stand the test of time better than Bird Box and even better than A Quiet Place. This movie I believe was shot with more auteur intent than either of those films, as the way Travis's lantern penetrates the thick darkness is an image that will stick with me.Sure, this movie is a slow burn, but at one hour and twenty five minutes there isn't a single wasted moment. Yeah, there are some questions left unanswered, but there isn't a single unanswered question that can't be potentially answered if one were to closely look at the film.I gave this film a 9 to offset the ill informed low reviews. It's still really about an 8. I believe the people who hated this film expected a cheap action thriller instead of the glorious post apocalyptic drama we got. For example, nearly every review says ""nothing comes at night"", but that is just not true. Something does come at night. It's just not what one would think.I found a lot of the low reviews to be childish. If you want to watch A Quiet Place, watch A Quiet Place. If you want to watch something more psychological but still as visceral, watch this film. In this landscape of reboot and remake after reboot and remake, this film delivers deep visceral original horror in under 90 minutes.",It Comes at Night

This is the best Horror/Drama of the year.",8,18 November 2017,"It Comes at Night is a film that came out of nowhere for me, I hadn't Krisha or heard of the director. Although as soon as the poster was released I was very intrigued and mesmerized. Like any ignorant person, I believed that this film was going to be about an entity at night due to the poster. I knew that I didn't want to know anything going in, therefore I avoided all information about the film, as well as all trailers.However, as I looked on the Odeon page, I saw the family with gas masks, which surprised me and changed what I thought the film would be, I was more intrigued.The little information I received was enough to make me desperately want to see the film, I traveled from Dorchester all the way to Yeovil just to see this film. And simply, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.It Comes at Night is the best Horror/Drama I've seen this year, the film is emotionally wrecking and brilliantly crafted. Almost every aspect of this film is flawless.The acting from every actor was exceptional. They all perfectly conveyed human trauma and anxiety through their subtle performances, adding layers to their characters, more than what's explicitly shown.The style of this movie was perfect to ensure the intended emotional investment. We are not explicitly informed on the source of the terror, instead we're experience as the characters experience, we know as much as they know. This benefits the film, by placing us in the same situation as the characters.The music was very beneficial towards the atmosphere and development, conveying the emotion and gravity audibly.I don't have anything varied to state other than praise, so I'll simply state that every other aspect complemented the film, ensuring an emotional and tragic experience.If I had to list any problem I have with this film, that would be the response. If there's one film I've seen in my life where I can't for the life of me understand the criticism, that's for this film.SPOILERS BELOWPeople need to perceive the film for what it is, rather than the schlocky monster movie I anticipated from the title. By first glance, the title and poster definitely conveys that, although they're not misleading, in-context with the film the poster and title make perfect sense. The 'It' in 'It Comes at Night' refers to the conflict, much of the conflict in the film occurs at night. The 'It' also refers to the dreams, the dreams seem to predict the conflict. Characters in the film refer to one becoming ill as 'them coming', which could emphasize that Travis became ill from the dreams.Do you recognize how varied these potential meanings are? That's part of the intrigue with this film, the film's answers are very varied, they have multiple conclusions. They may be more than one, although there is a conclusion.My advice to those who don't understand the appeal of the film is to watch the film again.8.5/10",It Comes at Night

I even loved the simple set. But the parts here are MUCH larger than the sum of the whole. This is one of those rare movies that lacks a single idea of its own, which is a feat even much worse films can scarcely achieve. Think Refuge to end of society movies, think Mutants to zombie films, think the Amityville Remake to ghost films. Thank kind of deal. The drama is fine, but what is typically an expected subplot of any apocalyptic, house-fortress film (as far back as the original Night of Living Dead), resolved in twenty minutes flat in approximately the exact same way, is here an entire film. And it is not for exploration in depth, it is not for a new eye that examines in new ways and warrants the run-time.

364,arenaf-28381,I've stopped trusting Rotten Tomatoes after this movie,1,15 April 2020,This movie has an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I decided to watch it and it was the biggest waste of time. Any horror or thriller movie that has unecessary sex scenes is a warning the movie will be crap and is attempting to makeup for this with sex. The summary states the second couple frequently get intimiate and of course we have to see and hear this although it contributes nothing to the plot. I decided to keep watching and was terribly disappointed at how lackluster the ending was. The only 'scary' scenes were the dream sequences which of course is a cheesy way to convey true horror. Anyone can do a cheap jumpscare dream sequence that offers nothing to the plot. It's just an excuse to scare the watcher when they can't do it with a decent plot. Horrible movie.,It Comes at Night
365,ftonks,"Not your average ""horror"", watch if you're a slowburn fan.",7,8 July 2020,"I'm a huge slowburn fan, I watched Hereditary 3 times, Midsommar 2 times, and a bunch of others. I was very excited when I heard of his film, although i'll admit I hyped it up a but too much. I think the main reason this movie was hated was that it was mismarketed, meaning people went into the film expecting some epic and tense new horror, and got a slow, apocalyptic instead. But I feel like nobody is actually critiquing the film for what it is, they are only giving the film a bad review because of what it isn't is. what I mean by that is all of the one star reviews never bring up qualities of the film, like it's acting. The only real complaint about this film I have seen people write is that it wasn't what they wanted, and that it hadn't lived up to the hype. So i'll try my best not to write a review not complaining how it ""wasn't as the trailer made it look"" and actually list my negatives nd positives, let's begin.
I thought the film was superbly acted, brilliant performances all around, mainly carrying the movie. It was a joy to watch the actors give it their all.
I thought the film mainly succeeded in it's slowburn style and I was still failry gripped throughout, although some parts not so much as the film did decide to drag them on a fair bit. Some of my negatives may be it's ending, like I know, arthouse films are like that. But I feel like they could've made it a bit less ambiguous, without spoiling the story, but still making the viewer guess instead of them going ""ugh that ending makes no sense"", so quite a big negative there. But you get the idea so i'll write my verdict and grade
Verdict: While it may be too slow at parts, It Comes At Night maintains suspense and has some powerhouse performances, worth watching for A24 fans.

There's a certain air of mystery from the opening scenes, right through to third act where information is meted out sparingly, leaving viewers to wonder what exactly is going on here.It's fresh, and doesn't try too hard to impress you with gore or insane visuals. The story plot holds up well, even after second or even third viewings. The cast performs exceptionally well, even though some characters are annoying due not their poor acting chops, but the actions their characters take during the film.There's also a feeling of isolation that accompanies the story, adding to the tension that if anything goes awry with our characters, they are truly alone and left to fend for themselves.I was pleased to discover that this film doesn't commit to any horror cliches associated with ""cabin in the woods"" stories.

The plot is predictable and all the characters are unlikable. I really did not care at all about what happened to these characters at the end of the film. Also the dialogue is generic and repetitive.

The ""monster"" of the film is nothing more than the paranoia and distrust of others that exists in a post apocalyptic world where most people are dead from a very deadly disease.Wanna know what I thought was coming at night? ANYTHING!!! The trailers for this movie that were out before it's release, and look on YouTube or read the reviews here (I'm betting someone else mentions this) showed a series of scenes that gave the impression that this was a creature feature, monster movie, whatever. It could have been aliens, demons, cannibals, whatever... from what I was shown I was sold a completely different film than what I got. Add to that the fact that THE TITLE GIVES THE SAME IDEA to people and fed in to the misleading trailers and you walk away feeling ripped off plain and simple.If it had been marketed as a film along the lines of The Road or a darker less religious (maybe even atheistic with how devoid of any hope the film is in the world it creates) Book of Eli and I totally would have walked away liking it. In a world where society has collapsed it does a great job of showing just how untrusting, un-neighborly, cruel and selfish (more so the 2nd family than the central) people can really be when they cast aside the rules we live by. I just don't see what explanation the filmmaker could possibly have for going with this title, and by doing so, it makes it impossible for him to avoid suspicion and claim innocence regarding the misleading, false-advertising trailers. Sorry, can't blame that one on the studio, your title fed right into the deception.And btw, if that's the intent and you think audiences ENJOY being tricked, ask Trey Parker how that kind of crap works and if he has any regrets over the early years of South Park. We don't like being the butt of the joke or somebody's lab rat. Making sure to check the directors name so I never watch anything else of theirs like ever.

384,wemme,"Set all your expectations aside, and enjoy this masterclass in horror.",8,12 July 2018,"Horror movies more often than not are easily defined by having a monster that sets out to kill the protagonist of the movie. Whether it's ghosts, zombies, demons, murderers or simply a natural disaster. Often we know very little of these monsters - we don't know what they are, how they can exist, how they came here or why they want to kill us. We can't argue with them and seldomly can we escape. The reason we fear these things so much is because humans fear death itself. Death is intangible, unidentifiable and uncanny. We can't stop it, we can't argue with it and it lurks around every corner, threatening to consume us relentlessly.To me, that is what makes this movie so utterly horrifying. There IS a monster in this movie - we just can't see it. We know absolutely nothing about what is trying to kill this family. We don't know how to stop it, we don't know what it is, what it wants - we can't even see it! The disease seeps into the very foundation of their existance and neither we nor they even so much as notice, much like any other disease. It Comes At Night lures you in with a genre-typical theme, but then makes a diversion by making a controversial, trope-breaking and honestly refreshing take on horror. In modern horror cinema, we have been conditioned into expecting shocks, sudden jumps and overstimulation of the senses. They are like roller coasters, filling us with adrenaline and huge rushes of emotion. But in reality, it's not really the pit fall of the roller coaster that truly comes to terrify us in the night. It's the knowledge of our own mortality and fragility. The bleak, empty dread of this movie stuck with me for days. Few movies that I have seen have ever captured that sick, hollow feeling of realising that you will die one day. In this movie, death breathes these characters in the neck and turns them into paranoid, vile creatures.This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but with a wimper. With that said, this is not a particularly exciting movie and I do understand the criticism of those claiming to be disappointed and feeling tricked. I recommend going in with a clean slate, not watching any trailers and don't watch it on a movie night with friends.",It Comes at Night

388,LWSheffield,A missed opportunity,5,13 September 2017,"**contains spoilers** Was this titled before it was written? I expect by the end of a movie called 'It Comes at Night', that I would be able to describe what the 'it' is, and would have seen something which made it clear to me why it wouldn't also come in the day. I am still trying to understand how the title relates to the film as a whole. It feels like the title of a spooky story a 9 year old would write, and I think when the immediacy the title suggests is not found in the film it juxtaposes what the viewer expects with what they get and ultimately creates a let down.There are some good points to this movie.I've no problem with the ambiguity of the post-apocalyptic world. It adds an intrigue and is testament to the quality of the screenplay that there is no awkward expositional discussion about it. I think the pacing is good up to a point and the jump-scares are used sparingly and effectively. I think this movie comes apart in two places, which both feel as though they move too fast. The first is the introduction of the second family - this is too sudden. there is a real tension building on the way to get Will's wife and child with the 'is he / isn't he?' suspicion around the guys they meet in the woods and whether Paul can trust him. I feel like the abrupt cut back to the house and the family arriving gives a hard resolution to what could have been a sustained mystery. The second is the ending. We've seen it all before - the infection is in, and the infected must die. Again, no issues with this series of events, I've seen it a thousand times and it can rouse some emotional weight if the audience care about the characters. The trouble here is we don't. The bleak, stark isolation of the movie which has so wonderfully set the tone throughout becomes its own undoing. All of this is happening in a bubble, and we as the audience have only seen anything from within the bubble and so we are invested in making sure it doesn't burst. Paul has to kill Will and his family to preserve this and we are fine with that because we never got to see anything from their perspective. What becomes of Travis is the kicker, but there is a lack of real purpose to his character throughout which undermines this death. In the end you find yourself looking back at a series of half-explored plot lines (what did the dog chase? how is the infection spread? who opened the door at the end? were Travis' dreams relevant or foreboding, or were they just nightmares because they live in a post-apocalyptic hell where he recently had to destroy his mutant grandfather and he would have still had the same dreams if he lived to be 90?) There was real potential with this film, but it felt as though there wasn't a real vision of how the ideas needed to be explored.",It Comes at Night

It seemed like they were going for more realistic characters, but I just found that boring. And no, that one awkward conversation about bread pudding and pies didn't quite win me over.Also, I'm fine with the fact that the titular 'it' is a subversion of expectations and that it's probably about how the fear that comes at night makes us do terrible or stupid things... but what kind of hackneyed plot is that? Sorry movie, but six+ seasons of The Walking Dead beat you to the punch on that one. Not to mention it's been done a million times before that. Part of me is kind of glad that a terrible looking cgi monster didn't show up at the end to go ""a- bloogy-woogy-woo"" and cough on everyone, but just being left with a tired moral and having everyone die at the end did not help this movie endear to me.Personally, I found ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" more engrossing (notwithstanding the ending). Probably because that movie was centered around an interesting character driven by an amazing performance that constantly kept you engaged and wondering what was really going on.Well anyway, it is just a movie after all.

The actors are all very good, especially the young man who plays the 17 year old son who is the focal point of the film. Good direction, music, and a nice pace as well. Other than a a couple of dream sequences and one jump scare jolt, THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. I'm glad I saw it but would never want to see it again. I cannot imagine it has much rewatch value.

399,benthelazar,Refreshingly dark horror,8,10 June 2017,"David Lynch meets Cormac Mccarthy in It Comes at Night, one of the bleakest horror films to come out in recent memory. Like many great works of post apocalyptic literature, this film is at it's best when it is ignoring the flashy set pieces and instead focuses on an all encompassing feeling of dread that slowly consumes the characters. The few missteps into exploitation and zombie inspired horror can be forgiven because of the feeling of complete loss that we feel throughout the film. Like 28 Days Later, The Road and (ugh) The Walking Dead before it, It Comes at Night is about family, and how the definition of that word would change depending on what the world allows. The film opens with the Paul (Joel Edgerton), the patriarch of a small family, killing a sick man and disposing of the body with his son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr). The killing is a brilliant way to set the tone of the film. It is almost clinically depicted, instead we focus on Travis' fear and pain, and on Paul's unstoppable drive to protect his family. We see the more of the same ideas and images when a scavenger, Will (Christopher Abbott), breaks into the family's isolation. Will has a wife and young son as well, and eventually Paul's family grows to include them. What's great about this movie is that the paranoia doesn't let up. Director Trey Edward Shults fills the film with disturbing dreams and darkness, never giving us enough clarity to be calm and satisfied. Many have expressed anger at this, saying that Shults opens too many doors and has no solutions for how they got that way. I personally loved it. This is a kind of film where it doesn't really matter why things are happening, what matters is what they are revealing about us. What Shults reveals is a deep seated fear of death and hell. At times the film feels surreal; like the characters are all dead, living out a nightmare scenario, trapped forever to live a pointless and painful existence. The gray and black color scheme alone conveys a dulled, trapped existence, similar to the one in Lars Von Trier's Antichrist. That was another film about human interaction in the face of great adversity, and the ultimate failure that comes with it. Shults' camera sells this as well, it moves through the family house like a ghost or god, quietly observing and following light but never drawing attention to itself. The cinema makes us voyeurs, and that is agonizingly clear in this film. Only as the film draws to a close do the cameras become hand-held and the spell begins to break. The ending here is so satisfyingly bleak that saying anything about it would ruin it. I'll say this: it is so so satisfying to watch a film with confidence. Often when a movie threatens us with egregious violence we feel safe in knowing that ""they wouldn't show that, they couldn't"". It Comes at Night is not such a film. This is a dark, disturbing, confident film, one that is deeply watchable and continues to prove that a simple story gives the audience so much more to think about.",It Comes at Night

I don't think it's from the advertisements, as ambiguously vague they were, but that I felt like there was something so unspeakably brilliant that no one would put it to words in their reviews.It was interesting how much of this movie, in hindsight, I start comparing to the Blair Witch Project. You go into it relatively incapable of knowing what it's about other than the fact that it is a horror movie and there is a basic plot available.Where it starts to diverge from Blair Witch is that this movie starts to turn in on itself where as Blair Witch slowly revealed it's hidden narrative.I would rate this movie a 3/5 for suspense, but couldn't consider it a horror movie. It's just too bland. There are some interesting dynamics and Edgerton does his best to put on a good game face for the unripe plot.I feel like this should go down as the engine that couldn't, because every time I was ready for it to go for it and sock it to me, it just puttered out and went to bed after some warm milk.There are dozens if not hundreds of movies I would recommend to someone along the horror/thriller Genre before something like this would get my vote so if it's your hard earned money, or the only night you get to yourself, give it a pass.",It Comes at Night

""It Comes At Night"" starts with a family in their house looking for safety with a spread of a Harmful disease with no cure for It, ""Paul"" the father ""Sarah"" the mother and ""Travis"" their son with his dog all are locking themselves in their house to stay away from the disease, when suddenly they hear someone trying to break into the house, they catch him later and tie him, the guy is ""Will"" and ""Paul"" asks him some questions of why he's here, he said that he wants to get water for his family but ""Paul"" was very carefull and very protected of his family.The cinematography of the film was really good with some good shots, the soundtrack I think were a very good fit for this film, it makes you concentrate more in the film and it was terrifying, there's not many scary scenes in the film which I think is the reason why many people didn't enjoy the film, actually I only remember one scene that really scared me. The performances were not great but very good for a horror film.Advantages: 1- The cinematography 2- The soundtrack Some scenes were really well made and it had a really special feeling to it and not only jump scares like most of horror films.Disadvantages: I really don't know what's the director thinking, there's really no problem with not showing ""IT"" or that thing the monster but the question is there actually a monster in the film or not !!! I guess that was most directors like to do to leave the audience wonder and that's actually the most thing I like in films in general but unfortunately not in this one.Overall: I liked ""It Comes At Night"" and despite all it flaws I think it's a really unique horror film that I will sure remember.Advice: if you want to see the film thinking that it will scare you with jumpscares scenes just don't watch the film it's not A Ghost or Zombies film, watch another film instead.",It Comes at Night

All the supernatural/evil stuff you see in the trailer is just cheap, jump scare ""dreams"" the kid is having and nothing related to the main plot at all. And they blow their whole load by revealing all the scares in the trailer itself, so they have no impact when you're watching the movie. I expected much better from Edgerton, but I don't think even he was making the same movie that was advertised.

421,musukogoji,"""You know what happens when people get desperate.""",4,25 June 2017,"I will admit that one of the reasons I was disappointed by It Comes At Night was that I was expecting a creature feature set in a post apocalyptic Earth, but that's not what I got. I spent 2/3 of the movie's run time waiting for ""It"" to show up until I finally realized that it never would. So, this isn't the movie I thought it would be. Is that any reason to hate it? No, absolutely not. I have to judge the movie for what it is and what it is is a jumbled mess.The film takes place, as previously stated, on a post apocalyptic Earth where many people have been killed by a rapidly spreading disease. A father, a mother, and a son have taken shelter in an abandoned cabin in the woods to escape the chaos, but eventually, they're persuaded to invite another family into their home. Things start off well, but tensions begin to rise and everyone is left with the question of who to trust.One thing I have to say is that on a technical scale, this film is wonderful. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is amazing, and the pacing (for the most part) fits the movie nicely. It's clear that the writer and director, Trey Edward Schults, has immense talent and is putting so much effort into making this film. If I were just judging the craft of the movie, then I would give it a 10/10. However, I must take the plot into account. This film's plot is really nothing new. Everything that happens is pretty much by the numbers for any post apocalyptic movie or TV show. As Doug Walker said, ""It's The Walking Dead without the walking dead."" If I had known that this would be the movie's plot, I could probably tell you everything that happened before I even saw it. The family comes into the house, they start off friendly, then they don't trust each other, and bodies start dropping. We've seen this done a million times, and with the glowing reviews this movie has been getting you'd expect it to try something new but it never does.As I said before, the acting is good, but the characters are nothing special. There isn't anything really distinct about them. They're just people living in a house. But that's kind of what I expected for this film.A huge problem with this movie is the number of unanswered questions. Who left the door open? What injured the dog? What do Travis' nightmares mean? Was he dreaming at the end? Who were those guys who attacked Paul and Will? Why did they attack Paul and Will? Is Will's brother dead? If so, then why would he lie? Why was Andrew in a different room? Did he open the door? Why is this movie called It Comes At Night when there is no It? Many important questions are brought up during the film and none of them are answered. It's fine to leave some things ambiguous to the audience, but it seemed like these questions were building up to something that never happened.One scene that really bothers me is when Will and his family are killed. Not because of how disturbing it is, but the amount of things that just don't make sense. First off, the filmmakers are trying to make it debatable as to whether Andrew is sick or not, when he clearly is. Why else would Will want to leave the house? And why does Paul opt for killing Will's family when they're pretty much already dead? He says he's afraid that they'll come back and steal from them, but they're going to die! Nothing they do will change that. But even when Travis reveals that if they're sick, then he's sick too, Paul doesn't even bat an eye. And guess what? Travis gets sick and everybody dies. The End. The ending is a convoluted mess only because they wanted to make it a really depressing ending, no matter how many problems it had.In conclusion, It Comes At Night is a wonderfully crafted film, but doesn't deliver in the sense of its plot. The characters are boring, the story is cliché, and it doesn't deliver what it's posters, trailers, and even the title promise.",It Comes at Night

424,quentinwharton-70401,"Fearing the Unknown, A Misunderstood Film",6,23 December 2019,"(Rating as a movie) It Comes At Night is a very interesting film to say the least. A lot of these A24 films defy expectations perpetuated in their advertising in a way that frustrates the general audience, which makes it all the more tragic when good movies like this get trashed by people expecting something that it's not supposed to be. Did I think this movie was scary? At some points, yes. There was always a feeling in my gut that something wasn't right, despite the sense of security that the film was trying to create. That feeling was paranoia. This film portrays paranoia in a way that I'm not used to seeing in the modern horror genre, generating fear around things that the audience can't see. The cinematography is top notch, and the main characters were pretty likable for the most part. This film also has a lot of dark, tight corridors that really feel claustrophobic. The acting was really good, which made the characters pretty believable. I'd say my biggest criticisms are with the pacing of the characters. Characters team up and become best friends literally only hours after meeting one another. They could've easily fixed this by making it so that these two families were living side by side from the beginning, that way they wouldn't have to establish trust because they'd already have been in the picture prior to the events of the movie. I'm not going to be one of those people who gripes about nothing really coming at night, because I actually liked the whole concept of this invisible force ravaging this family, and the whole fear of the unknown, it's a lot more threatening than ""oh no! Zombies!"". I'll admit that this film is very slow burn, and if you're looking for an intense horror film from beginning to end, this is definitely not the film for you. I'm gonna give this one a 6/10. It's closer to a 7 than a 5.",It Comes at Night
425,shea765,New take on an old premise.,7,22 June 2017,"This film certainly delivers something different, creatively misleading the audience and breaking expectations. The set-up is pretty simple, intending to recall a host of recent movies in our zombie-filled entertainment climate: a disease has killed off a decent chunk of humanity, with the survivors living in isolated patches off the grid. We follow a family struggling to maintain their existence and sanity, understandably cautious of anyone they might encounter in the absence of lawful order.Where ""It Comes at Night"" goes from there is difficult to discuss without giving anything away. What is safe to say is that the film displays two attributes of quality scriptwriting: the characters behave in a logical and understandable manner given the circumstances they face, while at the same time the story feints and distracts, leading the audience down an unexpected path. The film's very title is meant to suggest the question ""WHAT IS IT that's coming?"" which the filmmakers treat as an opportunity to deny anticipation by avoiding straightforward answers.In the end, this film is really an exploration of human character: who are we really once the veil of society and culture that protects us from our innermost insecurities has been lifted?

I consider 'The Road' as a much, much stronger example of a film that blends horror and psychological drama - in exploring the limits of humanity & family in an apocalyptic setting.It's nonetheless a well-made film with fine performances, but I came into the film expecting...something great, which it wasn't.

He wants you to use your own imagination. I think Man should be more afraid of himself than anything lurking in the woods. When the apocalypse comes mankind is his own worst enemy. Instead of working together to find a way, mankind kills off each other in a futal attempt to secure his own family and things. That never seems to work does it? The red door is a metaphor between life and death for this family. It keeps out the bad, and keeps in the good. It keeps out the disease, but does it, the grandfather just died. Maybe the son Travis was already infected by his grandfather. Maybe he opened the door in one of his nighmares looking for the dog and he is the one who infected the little boy. My take is that Travis was already sick from his grandfather, thus the vivid nightmares, or gets sick retriving his dog, and doesn't remember wandering around at night and leaves the RED DOOR (safety door) open. Once the door is open Hell is unleashed, thus the red color used on the door. Man thus creates his own hell on earth, turning his back on mankind, brother killing brother to protect his own, sounds biblical??? Just my take on this movie, use your imagination a little more, love this director!!!

The minimalist story is not a typical genre thriller, according to Shults, but, as he said (quoting Mies Van Der Rohe), ""Less is more."" The second man who brings his family to the remote cabin seeking haven and the necessities of life is headed by Will. Will is played by Christopher Abbott, who was excellent in ""James White."" Will's wife, Kim, is played by Riley Keough (Elvis' granddaughter, ""American Honey"") and his small son Andrew is played by Griffin Robert Faulkner.Despite the best intentions of both families portrayed in the film, paranoia and mistrust fester and erupt as the horrors outside creep ever-closer, awakening something hidden and monstrous within Paul as he learns that the protection of his family comes at a huge cost.Shults said, during a Q&A following the film's showing in Chicago on June 1st, that he was fascinated with questions about topics like genocide. He is definitely focused on death and man's mortality in this film, which is not about zombies or monsters, but is every bit as horrific as he examines the lengths people will go to to protect their own.Since the original impetus for Shults' film came from helping his own father through terminal pancreatic cancer, the mood of the film is grim, grimmer, grimmest. Shults has said that, following his father's death (they had been estranged for 7 years prior), he sat down and wrote and ""It just came spewing out of me."" He's certainly in good company in musing on the temporary nature of our existence on this planet. But Shults has made this film as scary as anything you'll see this summer. What lengths will a man go to to ""save"" and protect his family? What would happen if we were facing an unbeatable disease with no modern medicines or hospitals to help us? Many in the world are facing these questions right now, in real time, but Shults is still struggling with the deaths of two close family members, with memories which clearly haunt him to this day.The uncomfortable subject matter of ""It Comes At Night"", says Shults, is ""drawing from heavy personal experiences and placing it into a fictional narrative, hoping the same emotions come through. At its heart, this is a movie about mortality.""The script for ""It Comes At Night"" was actually written before ""Krisha."" When ""Krisha"" was a big hit at SXSW, Shults got a 2-picture deal from A24. This is that second film, but he has been learning from the best since the age of 18, working on 3 Terrence Malick films, starting with ""Tree of Life"" in Hawaii.The film is beautifully shot and paranoia is justified and created with the skillful use of camera, sound and light (see my interview with Trey Shults on www.TheMovieBlog.com for details). This is a riveting, horrific picture of a future we can only hope never becomes a reality. I am still thinking about it today, four days later. Yet Shults resists calling it a horror film, and believes it is far more about psychological horror than a genre flick with monsters or things that go bump in the night (as they literally do in this one.)For some, the questions we are left with as the film ends will cause criticism. There are times at the ""end"" of a piece (remember the finale of ""The Sopranos""?) when viewers feel they have been shortchanged or cheated by the ending. For me, this was not an issue, as it was pretty clear what was probably going to happen next. Still, I understand those who want more of a ""Breaking Bad"" type of ending, where things are wrapped up neatly and some characters live and some characters die (and spin-offs are even made possible by the ""concluded"" feeling.)Two other things that may cause Shults criticism from some sources will be his intentional intermingling of the dream sequences with reality. They will say (truthfully) that it is sometimes difficult to tell what is a dream and what is reality.Again, this did not cause me any problems. After listening to Shults explain why this was intentionally done, it made sense. He explained that he saw the dream sequences as a way into Travis' mind. (And Travis = Trey). It is Travis' point-of-view through which we see the story, even though it is his father, Paul (Joel Edgerton), who is dictating the terms of Travis' young life.And last, some will say, ""Why is it called 'It Comes At Night'?"" Shults explained that night is the time when he is at his most creative and it was a title that sounded good. Hopefully, he said, it helps put you in the heads of the main characters. It is not a literal interpretation of what occurs in the film but more a metaphor.The beginning of a bright future for a gifted filmmaker.",It Comes at Night

It kept the suspense up until the very last minute, but then disappointment sunk in.As every other review has said, nothing comes at night. The title itself is, in my opinion, to keep the suspense up as you're waiting for the thing that never arrives.It's alright as a mind game movie I guess. Although if you read these reviews it'll probably all be lost on you, because you know the title is frivolous.Anyway, 4/10 because it kept the suspense up, but feel like it was a waste of time in the end. I wish they at least explored the characters a bit deeper. I mean Wills ""my brother did this"" ""I'm an only child.. oh I mean.. my brother.. is my wives brother.. because we're close"" was obviously leading you to think Will was dodgy, but they never touched anywhere near that ever again.I'm pretty sure the whole point of the movie was to build up suspense.

Too many plot holes that make you go, ""wait a minute...hold on"".Examples:-burning the ""infected"" bodies but trying to avoid being detected.-why are people shooting at each other? I get that this story might be ""post-apocalyptic"" (is it? it never reveals anything about what is happening) but why are people just randomly shooting at one another? Wouldn't it be more believable if they were just avoiding each other to not get infected? Again, we are never told the extent of why things are the way they are.-Everyone is afraid of being ""infected"" and wear masks except for the dog. So you are lead to believe that the dog wouldn't get infected but then they discover that the dog is infected. If the characters were so concern about infection, then they would never have a dog around as it presents a risk. The same goes for the goats and chickens.-The last time we see the dog, it is covered in blood..why is it covered in blood? Also, it appears that the dog might have been ""stabbed or beaten""...but this is never addressed.-If the house if boarded up, how did the dog get back into the house?-If the father/mother have the ""only set of keys"" to lock/unlock the main door to the house, how did the child open the door? Did the father want the child to be infected to get the man and woman staying with him to be infected? If so, then why the heck would he try to save them in the first place?-It is never fully explain why they don't go out at night. ""it's just better that way""...why???And there are more but I think you get the point.The director is trying to build tension and set the mood but the only mood being set isn't ""fear"" but ""bored"". Even the actors seemed bored with this movie. None of the characters are believable except for the son, the child and the dog (hense the two star rating). I get that the director wanted to go a certain way with the film but with a small cast and a simple story (which I am not exactly sure what the point of this story was trying to make), you would think that the director would see how many holes there were in this story but yet failed discovered or correct. To leave it up to the audience to assume is just poor delivery.By the way...there is nothing that comes at night or during the day.

What this sickness does we never find out because it never fully develops before the sick person is killed.Some dude breaks into the house, gets caught and knocked out, left tied up outside all night and guess what, nothing came for him at night.And it's like this the whole movie, you are just waiting for what ever it is to finally show up with some kind of fight for survival but it never happens then it ends with so many unanswered questions.What is the sickness, what does it do, who were the two guys in the woods and why did they attack them, what happened to the dog it looked like it was attacked by something.The whole climax looks like it could of so easily been avoided if people weren't such arseholes and trigger happy. I mean they just wanted to leave so let them.The most disturbing part of the movie were the sons dreams. I wouldn't even classify this as a horror.

471,alinstroming,It Comes at Night... And it's haunting.,10,22 August 2017,"I went into this movie with no expectations or standards. All I wanted to see was a generic horror movie. But to my dismay... I was wrong.It Comes at Night is atmospheric and tense in almost every single possible way. The cinematography is tense, the character interactions are tense and the score is atmospheric. This movie NAILS the essence of horror: tension, which is almost never broken.==== SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT ====If you wanted to see a good old ""oh no there's a monster, right there"" then you'll be disappointed. The movie has no monsters, unlike what the trailers show. Do not go into this movie with expectations, or else you'll be disappointed.Plot: The story essentially takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where the mankind or at least most of it has been killed off by a mysterious disease. A family living in the middle of a forest are held under strict conditions, which are upheld by the father, Paul. One day though... A family pleads to get inside.What I like about the plot, is that there is little to no exposition. Most people hate it, when everything is delivered to you through dialogue, which could've been used to something much better. The director and screenwriter Trey Edward Shults made fantastic job on keeping the audience under mystery. What is the disease? What does it do? Where are all the people? Where is this cabin? It might also annoy, that not everything is explained, but few small nuggets of info let us know, that the things are as the characters say they are. This also allows us to choose, whether to believe the characters or not, which creates suspense in an already tense situation.Acting: For a indie movie, I was surprised that this movie had some talented people working on it. Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo... Their reactions and behaviors in this movie are pretty close to what people would usually do under this circumstances. Kelvin Harrison Jr. also made a stunning performance, as a teenager, who has been introduced into the brutal and cold world. Cinematography: I'll keep it short. Long, static, or creeping shots make some of the scenes anxious to watch. Especially during the woods, where you can expect anything. What Edward also succeeds at, is to decide what to show, and what to leave for the audience's imagination. This is probably my favorite thing about this movie. Not showing enough is what keeps our imagination running, and Shults nailed it.Score: It would be a crime to say, that the music has no relation to the movie whatsoever. During tense scenes, the score starts to creep up... slowly towards an unknown crescendo, that keeps you biting your nails. While using rapid sounds to create anxiety fueling nerve racks to keep you in your seat. Although, I think some scenes could've been better without an music, but that's is minor nitpicking. The score is amazing.Horror: I'm usually a easy-to-scare individual, and I hate jump-scares. One thing that keeps me from watching horror movies, is the annoying use of subtle noise and scary face to create horror. Edward knows that is played out and... well uses tension to create suspenseful moments of dread and terror. I was taped to my seat especially during the scenes, where Travis walks around the house during the dark. The surrounding darkness around his lantern creates paranoia, that something might lurk in the shadows... when there isn't. There is though ONE minor jump-scare, but it is built up so well, that it actually is a well deserved jump-scare.Ending: Not a lot of movies tend to shock or amuse you with it's climax, but It Comes at Night jabs you straight in the gut, during the last 20 minutes of the movie or so. When the credits rolled, I was frozen. I literally was shocked, at how well Edward managed to mess my head. This same thing happened during the screening of Logan, where it left a two week-depression feel. Here... Damn. I just... Overall: It Comes at Night is one of those movies, that like the 1982 The Thing will become panned for what it isn't, but loved by what it tries to tell. As the first horror movie I've ever witnessed, it sure left me good impressions about the genre. There may be cheap, cash in horror movies in the rough, but there certainly are some diamonds too. I adore this movie, and it gives me more ideas and inspiration. I rate it 9/10. Amazing.",It Comes at Night

or
...Will and Kim (the visitors) had sinister intentions/ a dark secret/ a troubled past which would be unravelled by someone of the family (Paul/ Sarah/ Travis)...
or
...Will and Kim were just stool pigeons and there were going to be more people out there in the woods coming after the family's belongings and supplies...
or
...Andrew had been kidnapped by Will and Kim (hence his sleepwalk and Kim's strange reaction to it) and they tried to hide that he wasn't their son...
or
...It's all about Paul's schizophrenic paranoia and its impact on all his family, the whole virus-apocalypse thing never actually happened - or at least not to that zombie-like extent...
or
...Travis or his mom would wreak havoc after Paul killed Andrew...
or
...the ""thing that comes at night"" had nothing to do at all with a virus but with human's evolution...
...but... in the end...NOTHING.I loved the cast and their performances. The plot was something we've heard of sooo many times already... but could have become a new and different approach to the virus topic thing - which honestly would have been awesome!The movie builds up suspense to an extent I haven't been experiencing for a long time. And I love that it is playing with the viewers munds and imagination rather than overuse cheap shock moments with exaggerated sound effects every few minutes. I also don't mind endings that aren't actually endings, I like finals that leave you with questions and lead to discussions.However, in this movie all the suspense, the presumptions, alleged innuendos and questions blow up during the whole movie only to eventually erupt into a dissapointing unsatisfying ending.To those who claim it's an allegory on humanity or today's society or whatever: I can understand that point of view too. I also like movies with some deeper meaning. However, does this mean a lack of logic and omitting any answers and explanations are requirements for a movie with superior importance nowadays? And does this mean that all the people who gave bad reviews lack profoundness? Just because they expected something else from a movie that's considered to be a horror movie? I don't think so. I'm a fan of a clever, thought-provoking plot that goes beyond the usual shocker flick. This wasn't one of them. This was a wannabe philosophical mystery something that makes me ask why they would call it ""horror"" movie in the first place? If you don't know how to connect pensiveness and fright, at least don't classify it into such a strong genre like horror (with a heavy with meaning title) and make the viewers expect something that never really happens.",It Comes at Night

482,johnfg-83353,Humans are idiots,8,16 January 2018,"I have seen many reviews from idiots that read something similar to '' nothing comes at night'' and that makes me ashamed to be human. When horror films don't have cheap jump scares they are immediately found to be boring and therefore bad. Hell. I even saw one review that complained about nobody getting eaten by a monster. I admit the marketing for this film was misleading but it's really a sad thing that nobody will watch a fantastic film unless they are tricked into watching it. Anyway on with the review. This film was fantastic it made me feel genuinely frightened and nauseated with the way tension is built using the superb lighting and uneasy camera movement, the score also adds to the tension. The main theme of the film is paranoia, therefore many questions aren't answered. A lot of people have complained about this but they fail to see that leaving the questions unanswered helps us associate with the sense of paranoia the characters are experiencing. The performances were inconsistent sometimes good sometimes not. My favourite actor was the teenage kid he really had a breakout performance and I'm looking forward to seeing him in other things in the future. Everyone else was fine, nothing special. They use a lot of dream sequences to get scares which I think is a bit lazy and at one point in the film the aspect ratio changes weirdly. However those are my only problems. One really admirable scene in particular is this POV shot closing in on the red door, I loved the sense of dread and the sense to can't escape. Really well made horror scene. On the whole I loved this slow paced but enjoyable film and can't wait for this directors next work, watch it.",It Comes at Night
483,bearsharetv,Disappointing,4,8 March 2020,"Despite a very good cast that I really respect and a quality production crew from director to grip; this movie just disappointed in so many ways. Another thriller filmed in low to no light making it most frustrating if not impossible to see whatever is happening in many scenes; a little bit of this is to be expected in a horror/thriller/mystery but way overused in this film like so many others; it's a poor practice in my opinion. The story wasn't bad at all; however, the story and title are not cohesive; congruent, another frustration I have with the film.On the positive side, the performances were decent, it was suspenseful even though predictable way too often for me. Dismiss the title if you watch it and it will be a better movie although this doesn't help the poor lightning while shooting some of the key moments!",It Comes at Night

Spoiler: Nothing Comes at Night! I'm not sure why it's even called that. We learn essentially nothing about the characters, not much interesting dialog, there isn't a plot, we don't know what they're afraid of. We never know or learn whether there are monsters, aliens, terrorists or just one sick raccoon (to be clear there is not a raccoon that we know of or anything else). There isn't even a hint. In fact, the one time they broach the subject near the beginning ""Did you see anything?"" the main character asks and the other guy says no. Alrighty then. We never know and never find out. We learn for some reason that one guy seemed to be lying about having a brother. Maybe that is the plot. We never find out why he lied and its just bizarre but in a stupid way not creepy.

503,virake,A good movie that fails,6,14 March 2018,"I want to preface this review by saying that I don't have a problem with horror movies that don't scare me. My general expectation is that if something is in the movie, then it has to 'work' and make a point. That's it.What we have here is definitely not a horror movie in the traditional sense of the word. It mostly consists of drama that is *enhanced* by horror. There is some frightening imagery, but no jump scares - thankfully. Sometimes intense music played during sequences that didn't contain any horror, which was confusing. Horror elements in general are very subdued here, the focus is on uneasing the audience as opposed to outright scaring it.Horror can be used to tell a story in a different way, from a different perspective, to hint at what the characters are feeling without explicitly showing it, and so on. The makers of the movie do this to great effect, but the core elements of the story are not very good, so the effort is wasted.The opening arc is actually done well, it sets up the world and the characters perfectly. We are shown how dire the situation is, and that it brings out the brutality in people. The general tone of the movie is rather grim.There were very few actors, and the sets were also few, bare, and claustrophobic. This instilled the feeling of isolation, further enhancing the horror aspect.About halfway through I started to get a feeling that something wasn't quite right, that something really bad was going to happen. As trite as that may have sounded, it actually goes in line with what I explained previously: it's what the characters are feeling. Unfortunately, plot development got slower and slower as the movie progressed, and when it finally reached the climax it turned out predictable and underwhelming.And then the credits rolled, leaving me confused and disappointed. It genuinely seemed as if I only watched half of the movie, since many of the critical plot points were not explained by the end. Some movies try to purposefully confuse the audience as a mean to unnerve it. Here it works on a basic level, but since the plot doesn't go anywhere, it actually makes the general impression worse. The drama aspect wasn't good enough to carry the entirety of the movie on its own. As a result, plot holes significantly detracted from the experience.Overall, the movie was definitely not boring to watch. In fact, I'd say it's pretty good, if only the buildup wasn't wasted by the lack of payoff. I can recommend this movie is you've got some time to kill, if you're interested in unconventional movies, or if you want to see what works and what doesn't in a movie. Otherwise - skip it.",It Comes at Night

SPOILER: The director tried to pull off a ""make your own ending"" type of movie like Inception but failed miserably. You never find out what ""comes at night"" or if there even is any lurking evil. You never see any monsters, any plague, or anything at all to explain what this movie is even about. Sure, it can be fun to explore the human psych in desperate scenarios like they do in The Mist or Lost Boys but this film fails to give us an actual foundation to explore this psych. There is no plot, no antagonist, and an unsolved mystery. Leaving an opened ending is fun but making a movie with half a story and dragging it out over two hours is meaningless, especially when there isn't a single scary scene in a ""horror"" movie.

508,merlinsenthil,"Don't look for a ""horror"" film; look for a good film.",8,22 December 2017,"If you can hold back your questions and curiosity, you'll taste the brilliance Shults conveys through the naked eyes of a scared teenager in a world of mysterious woe.
 
Joel Egerton is one of my favorite actors. So, I'll try to examine this film as unbiasedly as possible. Nevertheless, its his, among others', performance that holds the film together for an impacting impression. 
 
It Comes At Night is not a film that will answer all of your questions. It isn't as much about the world, as it is about the people. This world is unfamiliar, but humanity is digestible, even when pushed to its darkest limits. 
 
Horror is defined differently in this film. This film lacks jump-scares and graphic violence to wet the tongue of gory-hungry fans. Nevertheless, its horrific nature is conveyed through the fearful mind of Travis (played by Kelvin Harrison Jr.). As well as the phenomenal acting of Joel Edgerton and Carmen Ejogo. The placement of this family in such a dark, mysterious world changes everything, yet changes nothing. It only furthers the strive for a happy, successful life. Except, in this world, normalcy is far from achievable. 
 
I admire the dynamism Will and his family adds to the story when joined with Travis' family. The skepticism in us, just like Paul, constantly questions Will, and his honest intentions. Since its a horror film, in a horrible world, we expect it to be replete with horrible people. Nevertheless, its not the people that are horrible, but the situations they are placed in. 
 
Many people disagree about what actually comes at night, but, I think, its pretty clear that Travis' dreams are what comes at night. I noticed that the screen ratio is thinned, intensified during Travis' dreams. In addition, I noticed that the final scene, is also thinned and intensified. At first, I considered that the ending was one of his dreams, and not actually reality. However, that doesn't exactly fit with the the formula of the ending. Leading me to believe that this ratio change is done to show that Travis' worst fears, nightmares had become reality. What came at night, just as a dream, had come in the day, for real. 
 
The cinematography, color, and acting, create an image on screen that, I think, accurately exemplifies the vision of Shults. Its not the most perfect film, but it keeps you interested in each scene, constantly curious, yet satisfied. Not with answers, but raw talent (Joel Edgerton) and luckless situations.

You follow along Travis' apparent dreams and how things eventually end in tragedy, and then roll credits. You will be like everyone else in wondering why the movie ended so suddenly, and feeling disenchanted because the ""it"" that comes at night was never revealed.However, watch the movie again, this time from Will's perspective. You stumble into a house looking for supplies for your family. After weighing your options, you decide to bring your family over, you follow all of Paul's rules and get a little comfortable living there. But at the back of your mind, you wonder...***********************
*SPOILERS*
***********************
The ""it"" is literally what the movie shows you is happening every night. Travis is having some kind of hallucinatory fever dream. That is the It. The It is a symptom of the disease.Although never explained, it is highly theorized that Travis was the one that actually infected Andrew. And Travis was infected by Stanley, who got it from Bud. One of the symptoms of the disease is hallucinations, like Travis's fever dreams or Stanley barking at something that is not there. All diseases can mutate so maybe Travis' symptoms progressed slowly, and Andrew's faster because he is younger.Whether those theories are real, or not, this movie is not about a contagion. The main thing in this movie is: distrust. Paul is proven to react fast to ANY threat. He killed the two men who shot at him without any doubts. He similarly killed Will and his family without hesitation. This is what is most scary of all. Paul's inability to trust a little, is what ended so many lives. Why can't he just let Will and his family go? Instead he destroys someone else's family and his own.******************************************

551,statixsc,"Well, i guess im not seeing the 9/10.",3,24 August 2018,"So many people explaining how this film is breaking new ground. So many people explaining how this film delivers on SO many levels. So many people saying if you don't like this movie or 'get it' you are a bit of a movie zombie. So what have I just watched as I don't agree with any of the above.
I don't think im stupid, but when I come to IMDB to see 'what did I just watch' I know the movie just didn't do enough.Fair enough the movie wasn't a total waste as I watched it to the end and was always thinking, ooh here it comes. Nothing came though. This is the best I can say for this movie. 
So here's the 'review' from someone who I guess is a movie zombie because no matter how many films I've seen, hoe many games I've created and how many stories I've developed, I guess I just don't have the imagination. Most of the people on this site are telling me my opinion is wrong.So here's my wrong opinion I just want to share with you.There is nothing more irritating in movies these days as dreams or flash backs which are crafted to have you not be too sure if they are real or not. This film does this without giving you any real context. No. Using my imagination isn't why I paid to see a (smacking of lips), Film. If there is an adaptation of a film based off a book, or a film created off the success of a book. I read the damn book first. My imagination runs wild. Then I will most likely watch the film when it comes over on (insert favourite watch film pay monthly site) and agree if it was done justice. So with that out of the way, oh yes, about the film.I suppose the opening scenes get you. What is this thing? The idea interested me for about 8 seconds when I realised the room the old man came from was plastic sheeted, they all word gas masks, there were legions on the mans skin. They burned him. Hmm. I wonder what's happening here? The story continues I suppose trying to build suspense and of course the next device is the breaking in to the house. Hmm. Who could this be? Weve been conditioned to understand what might happen if there is an outbreak like this, everyone will kill for food, water and medicines. So what is the difference with this situation? The other reviewers will have you believe this is the most genius thing ever crafted to screen. Im not getting it. The main father even says to his lad 'you can only trust family' This is the golden line of the film. This is all what needed to be said as sure enough the film shows continued suspicion of each character to another and in the end it is the generosity of one man to gain an advantage for his own family which ultimately killed them all. By bullet or by virus it didn't really matter. Where is this deeper meaning im missing?So. The film wasn't very good at all. I've read some reviews which are so off the boil I wasn't sure if I was reading the review from the same film. Its not that good, its not scary, its not horror and its not really psychological as this is probably the fate of everyone given the situation the film has you in. people have given this film a 9/10, are you telling me this is in the top 10% of all the films you've seen?

552,leloupbleu,What comes at night? The end.,7,4 February 2018,"End of the world premise, carried out fairly realistically. No action heroes in this film, regular people trying to cope with a desperate situation none of us have ever been in before. I've seen other reviews asking, ""what happened?"" ""Too many plot holes."" ""Nothing happens"" ""No questions were answered""--------------------SPOILERS-------------------
To those people, I ask them to ask themselves what does actually happen at night? Perhaps they were expecting some monster... and no literal monster appears. But in a sense the monster is them. The whole movie oozes tension... it sets up the expectation that something is going to get them at night. At night, the paranoia intensifies, and no matter how normal you try to tell yourself things are, it doesn't take much... one little inconsistency, and all doubt returns and intensifies at night. When you are away from your routine, where your thoughts or dreams, start demanding your attention that much more...The movie is interesting because it shows, very well, how when all norms of society collapse, and your continued existence is threatened, a whole new standard of social interaction occurs. No more ""Hey, how's it going?"" Now it's a rifle butt in the face first, and ask questions later. It's also extremely nihilistic.

556,dvspindl,Lots of good stuff here,7,19 January 2018,"First of all, the low ratings of this movie generally seem to be from people who went into it expecting to be dazzled by a gory horror movie, which isn't at all what this is. This is an artistically rendered film about human nature, especially when under duress. I came away from it haunted and sad. It's not a movie you watch to cheer yourself up, but it's well done and its overarching message is disturbing but also true: Despite our gift for higher reasoning, we fundamentally are animals of survival like every other creature on the planet.My main issue--and I didn't have many--with this movie was the way the female characters were portrayed. The older woman, Sarah, is a key character--she could've been the central character--but she wasn't given many lines aside from expressions of distress and exasperation--and the camera often finds her in the peripheral view. The younger woman, Kim, is traditionally sexy, ""pretty,"" flirty, and cute. And the film is so generous as to let us hear her have a breathy orgasm. Ultimately, between the two female characters, we get to experience Madonna-Whore in real-time, which YES is a little bit offensive. However, I think it's just a case of a dude not knowing how to write three-dimensional women, or at the very least wanting to write three-dimensional women and struggling with it. This is absolutely a male-centric film, which is fine, but it could've been stronger if the female characters were more three-dimensional.Overall, 24 hours later, I'm still haunted by this movie. Strong story, haunting imagery, deft acting, fairly skillful writing. It's not uplifting, but it has depth and import, especially in these precarious times. This movie shows us one very possible realization of our future.",It Comes at Night

This thing is - at best - a thriller, and would be best classified as a drama. You keep waiting for that ominous threat out there to crest the top of the hill for the climax, but it literally never comes; it's barely even implied. And once you figure out the script's point of view, it's not really all that hard to see what the ending will be - I figured it out (much to my great disappointment) about 10 minutes into the film. About halfway through I was hoping that this is one of those films where all of the action and ""good stuff"" happens in the last twenty minutes. You know, one of those films where the monster is always offstage until the very end? Well...uh...nope.

561,horrorfaninusa,Bad Title,2,4 May 2020,"In my opinion, the main reason why a lot of people are angry for watching this movie is because the title is almost a perfect example for a click bait and the trailer is cut in a way perhaps deliberately, to mislead people into thinking that what they're paying for is a creature or supernatural fiction.Unfortunately, this movie is none of that and that's why people are furious. Literally, many genre fans including me are TRICKED into watching this film. Otherwise it would have been an average flick which many wouldn't even have noticed that it existed.The story revolves around a family with a husband/spouse and their teenager kid. It opens up with the dad putting the grandpa out of his misery in the backyard for catching this ""mysterious"" disease that we're never explained. We don't know the rules so we're just left out in the dark wondering how the contagion mechanism works which the writer obviously never intended to bother with.One night, they wake up to a breaking and entering and catch some guy who claims he's there to seek water for his family. Everybody calms down and the next day they go where the guy's wife and kid is to pick them up and bring them back home in exchange of water against their livestock.Things don't go as planned, they get attacked and the dad saves his own life the last minute. When he asks the other dude if he knew the attackers, he says no in a way that you think he's lying. Unfortunately this sub plot goes nowhere.So they get the wife and their little kid and move into the house. Nothing happens for a while, other than the 17 year old teenager showing signs of voyeurism watching the other dude's wife discreetly. The wife also acts in a way that she could be into him. However, that sub plot also goes nowhere.The writer doesn't bother at all to help you understand what's going on out there. There's literally zero world building. You know there's a disease or a virus (we don't know that either) that makes people sick but how or why is never explained.Now, does it really matter? I don't think so. This movie is so minimalist that I seriously believe the guys behind it just wanted to make a low budget movie. Most likely the distributor show an opportunity for a hype that didn't exist and took a home run with it.I'd say the acting is okay and that's the only positive aspect of this feature. Score is bland, nothing to remember. Minimal plot and poor story-line with dead subplots that go nowhere.Overall it's a huge gimmick to trick people into watching it.

Grandson is going through some grievance over the death. He's a 17 yr old kid so reality hits hard. The family lives in a boarded home in the woods, far outside from the hustle and bustle society. During a dinner scene, they are eating a small amount of food. So this says they are low on food, at least it hints at it. Things happen when a stranger breaks into their home. A lot of trust issues and stranger danger. Some trading happens and offer of truce. Things start to look up but then more bad things happens. In the end everyone dies because this infection > human. I think the movie tries to portray the kid as going through trauma over the death of his grandpa but he could also be getting sick.

But then you start thinking about all the mistakes, all the issues, all the questions, all the ""plot-holes"" and everything. And you start reading theories online, discussions, and interviews with the makers. And then slowly the movie opens up to you with all its multiple layers, all its depth and all its miracles. And you realize there is much more to it, than what you thought in the first place.
Sure thing, the movie is far from the best dramas ever made. But I think it is most probably due to the senseless choice of genre. This movie is as far away from horrors as one could be, yet the director insists on forcing all the clichés, all the boring suspenses, darkness and jump-scares down in your throught. And they do not add value to the story. They are admittedly secondary, merely the set to envelop the real story. But then why bothering to put purposeless cheap horror ingredients in a perfectly shaped drama soup? I believe if all the efforts of making the ""horror"" of this movie were, instead, converted back into the real focus, the drama of this film, it could have easily been one of the best drama pictures of the decade, with truly deep messages to humanity. Now it is just a shallow shade of its potential. Something you watch once, think about for 30 minutes, and then you live on your life.",It Comes at Night

This is a monster movie, but of the internal kind: the monsters that we can be when afraid and desperate. 
The title is apparently the most misleading issue for most viewers I think...but it is accurate. It just happens a little more metaphorically than physically.
The acting, direction, and pace were excellent and I thought the entire story was grimly realistic. I think where it went wrong was in the packaging and marketing - if you sell it like a creature feature, that is what people will expect.
It is The Walking Dead without zombies. Take a family desperate for survival in an apocalyptic world, a regular, loving, moral family. Now set them in a landscape where they do not know who to trust. There are no heroes nor villains; there are no all right or wrongs. 
I can't say I enjoyed it -- it was too psychologically disturbing for that. But it made me think, long after the credits ended. So, in my humble opinion, that is the sign of a job well done.",It Comes at Night

That particular beast is hiding in the human heart. That monster is especially powerful at night, when a person is alone with his thoughts. The monster feeds on fear. It feeds on mistrust. The more it feeds, the stronger it becomes. A heart full of fear and anxiety will take command of the brain and make a person believe it is possible to escape death. What will a person not do to escape death when death comes calling? This is not a film for viewers seeking simple escape from reality. This film pushes the viewer's face deep into an ugly and inescapable reality. Reality is a scary place.In these reviews, I've read complaints of ""unanswered questions."" I must disagree. All questions are answered; many, in the first scene. The viewer must be willing to pay attention to details in the photography and dialogue, remember, and analyze. I understand many people do not enjoy this kind of experience. This is their prerogative and it is not my privilege to judge. I will say that this is the reason Stephen King makes more money than Cormac McCarthy.If the viewer is the kind of person who read Hemingway's ""The Killers,"" and was left confused, I suggest this person watch the super hero film in the next theater.

If your 90 minutes of your life is valuable for you avoid this movie.This writer and director Trey Edward Shults should die next year, this way he can not continue making such empty movies and make people waste their precious minutes and money.These Animal Kingdom and A24 film companies fool the audience with the trailer and movie poster. When you watch the trailer you think it is a cool horror movie but unfortunately it is not even close. But there are a lot of irrelevant dialogues, no explanation for anything, no details and there is no It. All you get is dark woods, some noises and a boy's meaningless dreams. Even the dreams of the boy scarier than the movie itself. There a lot of unexplained and unanswered questions and events. Obviously, stupid writer of the film could end it in 20 minutes but instead he extends the time of the movie with silly conversations, silly dreams, silly sounds and silly images so he can glorify himself: ""Oh, I made a movie. Now, I can go and suck my boyfriend's member."" I even can not believe how Joel Edgerton is part of this mess.Overall, this is an empty movie.

614,robhardy112,A genuine work of horror,8,21 September 2017,"I watched a matinée showing of this at a cinema in the middle of summer and it cast such a shadow over the day that it took the rest of the weekend to recover from it. I had no expectations going in, knowing only that a friend had heard good things about it and it is supposedly part of a new wave of low key, post-horror movies.I'd recently seen The Witch, and thoroughly enjoyed that. Only later did I find that they'd been distributed by the same company but the similarities are clear: slow paced, brooding and atmospheric, mysterious and ultimately bleak. However, while The Witch was pretty dark, it had a sense of playfulness to it and the fantastical and supernatural elements of the plot meant it wasn't tied down to reality and served as a bit of escapism.It Comes at Night is what I would consider a genuine horror film. Whereas most films in the genre are fast paced, contain periods of action, rely on jump scares and are sufficiently removed from reality to be entertaining more than horrifying, It Comes at Night is firmly grounded in reality, is relentlessly bleak and actually horrifies. The closest comparison I can find is the cinematic adaptation of McCarthy's The Road.Among the films many strengths are the complex and deep characters and subtle and tense relationships between them. Also, the oppressive but not intrusive soundtrack brilliantly builds tension and puts the viewer on edge throughout. The acting is understated and convincing with Kelvin Harrison particularly compelling as the young and confused idealist who has to watch his own family become increasingly ruthless, paranoid and morally questionable in their actions. That the film is shot through the eyes of this lonely young man makes it all the more compelling and unsettling when the other characters unravel. 'Nothing comes at night', as an army of negative reviewers seem keen to point out. But of course, that's just a title and really has little bearing on the contents of the film. But also, much in this film does come at night, the creeping paranoia that consumes the characters, the horrific dreams that haunt the main protagonist and the potentially infected visitors who wish to bang down the door.This film is indeed a horror movie. No movie I've seen in a long time has been so horrifying. It isn't an easy watch and you don't have to expose yourself to it if you don't want to experience something so persistently grim and bleak. But as a film that sets out to disturb and unnerve its audience, it does an excellent job.",It Comes at Night

626,JohnnyBreeco,Not a horror at all... but a VERY REALISTIC and EXTREMELY WELL CRAFTED post apocalyptic film,9,14 June 2017,"The first thing worth mentioning about this film is that it is not a horror film at all. The film was completely mismarketed as another run of the mill horror film on purpose. This did two things. It secured the film a nation wide theater release which it surely wouldn't have gotten otherwise, and it baited in a larger, more casual audience that was expecting the exact opposite of what it was.Basically, going to see this movie is like ordering a greasy double decker burger with fries and a soft drink... but instead you get an exquisite entree of fresh garden vegetables prepared by a three star Michelin chef. Very few of these people will have the palate or taste for it, in fact most of them will be upset.This film is probably the most realistic post apocalyptic story I have ever come across. Anyone who knows the frequency and probabilities of solar flairs and what they would do to our civilization has probably played out scenarios in their head that are almost identical to the plot of this movie.It is this highest degree of realism in the unfolding of the plot and what happens between the characters that makes this film so engaging and captivating. As a work of craft, the film is a remarkable. It is so beautifully shot and the acting never drops below A+ quality for a single moment.

629,frehley-21102,What comes at night?,1,1 September 2017,"Bad title. Interesting concept that leads nowhere. There is no imagery to decipher, it's just a bad movie and waste of 90 minutes.

The cinematography and soundtrack are worth mentioning as above average, but 1 star is all this deserves.",It Comes at Night

631,nickworkman-42007,Gritty Yet Delicate,8,12 November 2020,"While this showstopper may not have regal appeal that say Mad Max has, nor the terror intensity that something like the Cabin in the Woods could provide; it is nothing short of a masterpiece in its own right. I would recommend this to those that are into film, as it doesn't really have all the traditional elements that some might be used to. ""Gritty Yet Delicate"" pretty much sums up this intense yet slow burning post-apocalyptic thriller though. The potency of this flick stands in the realism. Due to the plot line, acting, and cinematography, it directly connects with the audience, and puts them in the characters' shoes whether they like it or not. Not only does the movie itself feel real, but it doesn't for one second have you thinking that it couldn't happen in real life, which these days is a huge plus for me. The cast is small which allows you to get to know the characters and grow with them as the film progresses. Another word that could describe this piece is quaint. It's not necessarily something you'd bring a group to or even watch with the family. That being said, maybe a night in or rainy day viewing with the spouse or alone could trigger some major emotions and be immensely pleasurable if you're in the right mindset. It gives off a similar vibe that ""The Invitation"" did if you watched that or even one of my most recent watches ""Blue Ruin"". While this movie doesn't seem to be shot on an outrageously large budget, it does exactly what it came to do.. and it does it well! It doesn't just grip you, it makes you re-evaluate that which matters to you most in life. This quality is difficult to come across, but if it doesn't constitute a good movie, I don't know what does.",It Comes at Night

What it has to do at night time is beyond us. There was really no point to this movie at all. It was 1.5 hours, that felt like way longer, that we will not get back of our life.

633,cherrycollllla,"Overrated, just like ""Don't Breathe.""",6,11 June 2017,"The fact that this movie was written and directed by one person is impressive (that's a lot of work for one person), so kudos to the creator. Though I give the creator ""kudos"" for the massive amount of work he must have put into making this creation, I wasn't blown away by it--still it wasn't awful either. The film has an absorbing atmosphere, and it started out promising, but by the end of the film I felt let down.My view: Pros: Pretty scenery, good acting, absorbing atmosphere.Cons: Extremely simplistic plot (not too much happens), a theme that has been used a million times in ""Walking Dead"" episodes (what will mankind succumb to in perilous conditions), and the writing of the movie felt ""sneakily lazy."" The story felt simplistic. Also I felt like the author took the show ""The Walking Dead,"" and using inspiration from that show, created a similar universe and used the same themes. Also the writing of the film, to me, felt like what I call ""sneakily lazy"" writing.What do I mean by ""sneakily""? What is it that I call ""sneakily lazy writing""? I use these three words to describe writing that has a simplistic story that nearly anyone could come up with, and yet has vague ideas, or implications, or ideas that allow the viewer/reader to come up his/her own ideas on the film that make him/her feel smart--thus making the viewer like the film more, because if a film makes you feel smart for liking it, then oh boy you're going to like it! I felt like the film had just the right amount of plot holes to allow speculation causing a viewer to feel smart, and it had a theme one could latch onto thus allowing the viewer to say: ""This film makes a social statement (the statement: people will do worse things in bad conditions than they would do in good conditions), social statements are a smart people thing, and by seeing and agreeing with the social statement I'm super smart! Hurray for me!""Sorry if I sound like a jerk, I really do prefer to be a nice person most of the time... and I sound like a condescending tool here, but... I mean this is really how I feel... These are my uninhibited opinions. I believe their are sneaky tricks in writing that make the viewer/reader feel smart, but at the same time don't take that much brain-power or intelligence on the writers part, and I feel like that's what the author of this movie did. He wrote a simplistic plot in a way that allows reader's pride to be aroused, thus allowing him to get away with lazy writing.Me, personally, I'm all about plot. And I found the plot of this too simple. Maybe plot isn't what your brain's taste buds are about, maybe your more of an ""atmosphere"" kind of person when it comes to movies. Movies/Books are all about subjective taste, and just because I don't like it doesn't mean I think someone is stupid for liking it. I hate the vegetable beats, they're disgusting to me, but I understand your tongue is wired differently than mine, so if you like them it's okay. I know there are people who love, or will love, this movie--and that's awesome--I'll be glad they got more out of the movie than me.That being said, I wish I spent my money to see ""The Mummy,"" even though that film got horrible reviews. I think I would have found it slightly more enjoyable than this. That being said, give this movie a shot, maybe you'll like it a lot more than me and think my opinion is silly. My opinions are simply my own personal tastes attempted to be justified by my logic, and I don't think I'm anyone special. Honestly, I don't think my review is worth any more than a dog turd on the side of the road; I'm just some dude spouting off my opinion. Are any of our opinions really worth that much? I don't think so, and mine are no exception... I'm simply explaining, that me personally, I didn't get as much as I wanted to out of this film. And a lot of my lack of enjoyment comes from my own tastes not fitting what this film provides. Your brain's taste buds might be different than mine.To me this movie is a 5.5, but since it's written and directed by one guy which is a lot of work for one guy, I'm going to round up rather than down. So it gets a 6.I thought ""Don't Breath"" was about the same (a 5.5, didn't like it that much), so if you love ""Don't Breath,"" I want you to assume I have no idea what I'm talking about, and I want you to go see this film. It's 100% possible you'll love it, and see me as a guy with highly different brain taste buds than you. Good luck with your movie experience, may it be filled with joyous popcorn and highly carbonated cherry coke and may your soul be nourished by the nirvana of watching a movie with snacks. =)",It Comes at Night
634,thethirdval,Big Suspense With No Payoff,2,13 June 2017,"This movie was sorta suspenseful and the cinematography was decent, but that's the best I can say, The plot doesn't kick in until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The other 80 or so minutes make you feel like you'll see conflict or something, but nothing really happens. The character are very flat and the actors rarely get a chance to actually act. Most of the movie is just the people being silent and staring around. I felt that I could not connect on a basic human level with any one of the six characters.With the whole ""It Comes at Night"", nothing comes at night. People expecting some kind of an antagonist or monsters are going to be very disappointed. There is no opposing force that is trying to get them. The title and the trailers are very misleading. I went to see this movie with my friends and all 7 of us , expect for one, said this was the worst movie they've seen. It had very little entertainment value. Don't waste your money.

The pacing of such films builds to different peaks with an ultimate climax that is unexpected, yet enjoyed. ""It Comes at Night"" failed in this department. With incredibly strange pacing, the viewer was left waiting for something that was ultimately never given. The ending summarized is essentially ""don't trust anyone who's not family, because they will bring a disease into our home and kill the character the audience most relates with.""And some point after the film, I realized that the filmmakers intended for me to feel sad at the end. Sad for the nice family who was killed, sad for the baby that was shot, sad for the nice boy who got the disease, sad for the mother and father for having to kill him. But the only time I genuinely felt sad was when the dog died. And that's saying something",It Comes at Night

That's how annoyed I was with the lenient ratings.This is a film that promises so much, not just at the beginning but in the middle and even at the end too. The suspense builds throughout making you believe something bigger and better is about to happen, yet it never does.Other than a director's or writer's want of stardom or creative freedom (and obviously money), why would anyone make a movie that essentially tells the audience that a family is surviving in the woods, defending themselves coldly against others whilst something mysterious lurks in the surroundings and yet not providing the actual climax? It is ridiculous.The acting is fine, don't get me wrong, and that's why it doesn't get one star, however, the overall point of this movie is not an education in acting but an education in how to put out a supposed horror film when you can't actually finish the story or provide the actual horror.As cinematic releases go, this ranks up there as one of the worst I have ever seen, beating the likes of ""August: Osage County"" and ""Evil Aliens"".",It Comes at Night

642,jhmerkel,"Lazy writing pandered as ""deep hipsterism""",1,17 October 2017,"The film was absolutely awful. There are several issues the film maker's and his fans try to cover up with more excuses much like the plot to the film, which is so full of holes that Stephen Hawkings black hole theory held more water. Spoilers ahead.The general story is that a man and his family are trying to survive an outbreak of some sort. His son is shown to have some seriously deranged but not entirely unexpected dreams and participates in voyeuristic tendencies. A guy breaks into their house and they beat the hell out of him and tie him to a tree, three days later they go pick up his family to move in. Inevitably this doesn't work out, the dog gets messed up by something, which is unspecified, and then conveniently brought back to the house for the family to find. In the end, everybody dies due to either infection or gunshot. The fact I can accurately relate the entire plot with such a vague write-up should be sign enough that the writer didn't want to put in the work of an actual story. The excuse he wanted everybody to interpret the film differently and fill in the gaps with their experiences is ridiculous as 99% of the hipsters positively rating the film find the hardest thing in life is opening their organic, all natural, vegan friendly, non-gmo, 0 fat tofu frappe without exerting more effort than absolutely necessary. The false marketing was also tasteless and was sadly done better by the more recent movie Mother!, which actually had a plot, leaves room for interpretation, and even closed up all the nagging little questions one may have all on it's own without a poor excuse of basically ""imagine your own movie plot and call it mine"".",It Comes at Night

Thats the reason so many people disliked the movie, it wasn't because they failed to let their imagination free it was because the movie left so many dead end, constantly leading you think otherwise.The movie starts off with their grandfather dying from a ""disease"", they kill him and burn his body which leads the audience to believe it must be a contagious virus or disease. Then some guy breaks into their house, they ""quarantine"" him for a day to make sure he's not ""sick"" stating that their dead grandfather died within a day of being ""infected"". Further leading the audience to believe theres some type of contagious infection. But what does this have to do with the night? Well, the father keeps hinting that night time is more dangerous stating ""we only go out in night in extreme emergencies"". This leads the audience to believe the ""infection"" must come from something outside at night, hence the title.The father then offers to help this family who is savaging and barely surviving which gives the viewer the assumption that this ""infection"" must've killed a lot of people as there aren't many survivors. They then get ambushed by two strangers literally minutes into their journey, who were these guys? We will never know, nothing comes of it. Next thing he's back home with the strangers family. Everything is fine and dandy then the dog sees something in the woods, what is it? Who could it be? The dog runs off and in good horror movie fashion Travis goes chasing. After running forever he stops and you hear what you could only assume is the dog either being captured, killed or infected by either a monster or a group of survivors. Either way, YOU NEVER FIND OUT. This makes the audience think that there IS something out there.Up until this point, I had been enjoying the movie.Travis wakes up to find the strangers kid sleeping on the floor groaning. He wakes him and leads his to his parents bed where he leaves him. He then hears crashing and thumping coming from the entrance door. He proceeds to investigate to which he finds the door opened thinking its his father inside. A loud bang from within the room spooks him and he runs to get this father. Whats in the room? Its the dog that ran away but now its severely bleeding, its whole belly is soaked in blood, something attacked it for sure, but what? And how did the dog get into the room? YOU NEVER FIND OUT! It gets worse.The father questions why the entrance door was open, no one knows even though he's the only one with a key. No ones asks about the dog, how it could've returned like that or what happened to it, nothing. At this point your lead to believe. A. That there is some super natural being involved because not only the door magically opened but apparently the kid is infected now because of it.....? Or B. That someone from inside opened the door and the kid got infected another way? The father asks if Travis touched the kid, if he had his mask on, all of which he didn't. Travis states ""you know if he has it, then I have it"" as his mother proceeds to hug him.At this point I'm confused. The way in which this ""infection"" is being transmitted makes zero sense. Without going too deep the only possibility is they, themselves do not know and are just using masks and gloves because thats common practice for diseases. But how can you expect the viewer to decide that.They wake up to find the kid crying. All the sudden they want to leave? They get into a huge fight about wanting to leave peacefully? At this point I just wanted to fast forward to the end. The movie starts with them wearing suits/masks around the infected grandfather, the movie ends with mother sitting unprotected above her infected son.....

If you watch this film, please be open minded to it.I will say that I gave it a 6 because some of the acting felt disingenuous (although Kelvin Harrison Jr. is fantastic), there were a few plot points that I know were left intentionally open but I'm not sure that benefited the story, and while I thought the dynamics of the main family were well-explored, there could've been better character development for the mom and the other family, as well as better exploration of the other family's dynamics.This movie is meant to talk within the space. Please listen.",It Comes at Night

679,jillsoren,What comes at night?,3,9 July 2021,"I expect a certain amount of bleakness in post-apocalyptic films but this was too depressing even for me. The story begins as it means to go on, with a poor virus-infected grandpa being shot in the head and burned in the woods. Things do not get more upbeat. The remaining family of three - mother, father, son - live in a heavily fortified farmhouse with surprisingly flimsy locks. When a stranger breaks in (at night!) in search of water, their awful little world of isolation and paranoia is upended. After overpowering the stranger and torturing him for a few days, father decides to join forces with him. It's either that or kill him, because it's too dangerous to allow anyone to leave the farm alive. The stranger could return with others and try to take over their home. The family has a ""kill or be killed"" mentality, along with ""shoot first, ask questions later.""The stranger has a young wife and little boy nearby. They all come to the farmhouse and live like prisoners. Tensions ease for a bit, then explode into chaos. Unexplained events happen:1. The dog runs away and comes back bloody/dying.2. The doors (always locked, flimsily) are left open in the middle of the night.3. The little boy gets sick? Maybe?The young family decides to leave this nightmarish existence and are prevented from doing so by the paranoid psychotic father. He literally executes the young mother and child. It's horrible. Then the remaining 3 family members all get sick and die. The end.Even The Road was more uplifting.",It Comes at Night

The dark, bleak ending echoes true to life, since that's pretty much how it would turn out in reality, I imagine. This was a glimpse of how we human beings and our survival-mode paranoia, sneaky scheming against those different from us in a dire situation, can ruin lives---perfectly executed view of human nature in its rawest form.I always highly respect the fledgling filmmakers and seek out hidden gems like this and was very pleased with this outing. After reading reviews on here, we had a discussion about how you can measure the intelligence level or age of each reviewer based on the headline and rating.A few others mentioned movie-goers these days and how they need everything force-fed and spelled out in the most blatant way in order to be enjoyable---so much agreement with that sentiment. Some fella in one of these reviews says, 'I didn't watch this to think...' or something similar---well we wouldn't want that, good heavens!What gets me is it sounds like folks did watch the trailer and were disappointed with the end result of the film. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can usually pick up a story line in a trailer (if your attention span can muster up 2 and 1/2 minutes) and I personally try to avoid them for that reason... go in blindly, you see?
 
Did you 'unimpressed' lot see any done-to-death zombies (so much pun intended) or ghostly apparitions of little girls flailing about with their lame jump-scares? I didn't. Yet, you're surprised none of that was present here? Before you call this movie 'stupid,' just take a quick look in the mirror. It Comes At Night was well shot, well written and makes great use of atmosphere with a small cast and a tight location.

There were several times when certain events in the story could have been made to be more interesting, but then those events fizzled out and were a dead end, and we were left confused, disappointed and, frankly, bored.

I loved him in ""the Gift"", and the vagueness of this title along with me not seeing its trailer, excited me.""What is it? Why does it come only at night? What does it do? Where does it come from? How do we protect ourselves from it?"" were some of the questions I was looking forward to getting answered last night, when I sat to enjoy this with my girlfriend.It was night, the setup was brilliant, the movie started with a punch. It kept on building up, tension among people in a post-apocalyptic scenery, with not much information. None was actually needed, as the acting felt so appropriate and genuine. It kept going like that for 40 minutes or so when things looked that they are about to happen. When ""it"" will come in play.But no. After all the suspense and build-up, after another 40 minutes of movie, nothing came. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I am talking about a complete lack of information as to why people are getting sick, if this is caused by a particular ""it"" or a virus, how this started, what are the effects (other than the blackened eyes and wounds on the body), if there is a possible cure, if anyone is immune, if other people are alive and where are they. Nothing. The film ended anti-climatically (if such a word exists), leaving us both shocked to our 1.5 hr wasted. We felt disrespected as viewers, like we were tricked into watching something that wasn't even worth the electricity of our system. Did they run out of script paper? Was their budget cut short? Did IT come and killed them before finishing production?! I do appreciate that this is more of a take on the reaction of people for survival, how maddening fear can be of an unknown enemy, especially one that you cannot see, such as a disease. I do appreciate that this is not your ordinary jump-scare horror movie, but rather a survival-suspenseful-family-protecting-doing-anything-for-them kind of thriller.

It portrays trust-issue in the condition where trust outside of your own family is scarce. The monster here is not the ink-blood-vomiting zombie, but it's how we deal with our own issues.

714,alestier,So what?,6,8 June 2017,"This review contains spoilers.I'm not going to spoil moments, but I just wanted to very briefly talk about the overall premise.This film is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and the sound in particular deserves specific notice for being immaculate. The only area that I think this film didn't deliver on was the script.Something terrible seems to have happened to the world, some unknown pathogen has people questioning everything. When one group encounters another at first it's all harmony and good will but then it begins to break down and trust soon withers and ultimately dies.So at the end of the film I find one question stands alone: ""So what?""There have been numerous films covering this topic and I kept waiting for this film to stand out in some way. Any way. Alas, it did not, it was simply about paranoia and literally 'nothing' else.I couldn't help but feel robbed, like the filmmakers really couldn't be bothered to put enough thought into what message they wanted to convey that they just decided to leave it up to the viewer. Which is fine for some films, provided sufficient pieces are provided. This one did not. I feel in addition to the age rating, it should have come with the warning ""assembly required"". The next logical step from here in filmmaking is you pay your 13$ and you get a camera, some film stock and some actors and have to make your own movie.Why should I care about any of this? It was (I feel) aptly described as ""Blue Ball Cinema"" by a member of our party and I couldn't agree more. The Witch was a much better example of this exact same subject matter which ultimately was able to land on a point or at the very least, a climax.The construction of the film is very conventional with dream sequences starting off with a droning sound and a fade to black. After the third repetition it was difficult not to regard this as the filmmakers placing parenthesis around superfluous moments to be more easily subtracted from the 'actual' events within the narrative. I was unable to help from thinking to myself ""well, none of this counts"" each time they did this.Over all there was very ""et cetera"" sort of feel as one moment was protracted and lead into another, ultimately dithering away 90 minutes.Very pretentious filmmaking. I expect the critics shall be gushing over this one for the remainder of the year.6 out of 10, because any less would be insulting to everyone else who did their jobs expertly, but this was just not worth the time.",It Comes at Night
715,safron148,Flattest movie of the year,4,9 June 2017,"Although I won't give away any particular sequence or plot device, this review can contain spoilers. ""It comes at night"" is a good example of how the critics' market works. Because this film tackles a genre in an allegedly *new way*, many people greet it as the new wonder movie although the *new way* is empty and sterile. All people *in-the-know* will say this movie is a masterpiece for two months, and after that, everyone will forget about it. We have seen that many times before.Other people have pointed out the good things of ""It comes at night"" in their reviews. Yes, it has good photography, good acting, good sound atmosphere... but the script is poor because it has not any subtext. What you see is what you get: no deep discourse about human nature or about fear. Everything is an automatic cause-effect relationship, which makes the movie absolutely boring. Some people have pointed out that the real fear is the fear that comes from human distrust. Well, if you want to build a discourse about that, you have to confront the characters with a situation in which they can choose to trust or to distrust. The situation deployed in ""It comes at night"" is so bad, that only truly insane people wouldn't feel distrust. So, where is the fear in seeing very flat characters behaving in a very sensible way? They are not destroying themselves because of their human flaws. It is because the situation they are in is impossible to deal with. The situation is destroying them. And it is very difficult to feel fear when there is no suspense. The outer elements of suspense (noises, open doors...), are just an excuse to throw some thrills, but they have little real effect on the plot design. These people are scared because they are in a pretty bad situation and their behavior cannot be scary as it is very understandable.As other people have also pointed out, this is a very slow pace movie, which fills up time with subplots that go nowhere, i.e. the relationship between Kim and Travis. Also this is a movie that abuses of the dream device to create a scary tone that cannot be achieved, it seems, in any other way. Anyway, the worst thing to me is how flat it is. It is scary how movies have less and less layers of meaning.",It Comes at Night

First of all the trailer is very misleading and *spoiler* nothing comes at night(only boredom from watching the movie). Its a movie where nothing happens, nothing is explained, it has no beginning or end or even a plot. It has no special effects(its a 5 million dollar movie, supposedly), it has no suspense, it has no story, it has nothing special about the way its directed. Its a movie that you have no reason to watch. I was watching it hopping that something would happen at some point, but guess what, NOTHING happened.

718,ryan-shivdasani,Huh??,10,11 January 2020,"This was perhaps of the most profound and disturbing horror movies I've seen. Even if you don't appreciate the loose ends (which were clearly deliberate), or how dismal it was (it became... VERY.. uncomfortable to watch) it was incredibly well acted and shot. Even if you disagree, I'd argue that it's definitely not a 'bad' movie. I'd never heard of it or the director but thought it seemed interesting. After watching it, I looked it up to see what people were saying because I was so impressed.And it IS horrific. It builds up some very intriguing and relatable characters and then tears them apart in front of your eyes. The loose ends make it even more unsettling, which might be part of what accounts for something this movie did very well: you felt like they were real people who you were along side, experiencing things as they would, without even the comfort of answers or understanding- so not as an observer, but as prey. It was also brimming with subtleties, which is a just plain smart story telling. It had an extremely modern, boundary pushing feel, yet nothing about it was hokey.One thing they did that might account for the bitter taste left in a lot of reviewer's mouths, was focus the story around people who turned out to be appallingly antagonistic, while the ones you liked and rooted for were more supportive. The one connecting character was the final tragedy. For the most part, you never saw the ones you wanted to see get what was coming to them while instead everyone you felt something for went down in flames. This is not common as it can be a turn off in terms of entertainment and, particularly in this instance, leave you feeling somewhat assaulted, unsatisfied, and stripped of your humanity.. it could in that sense be compared to movies like Funny Games, Hostile, or Irreversible, which in turn could be thought to cross a line that separates art from offense. This kind of harsh realism can come at the cost of stylistic expression as well, including comic relief and dramatics, which are fun and engaging aspects of great movies. But it was also interesting.I didn't have to dig for the reasons to like it, though. They only came in hindsight. While watching it, I was simply intrigued (albeit morbidly. If you don't like extremely dark movies, you certainly won't like this.)",It Comes at Night
719,z-benny,"Excellent film, befuddling to your average Transformers fan",10,19 September 2017,"I'm only really writing this because of the astounding amount of negative reviews here. And they are all really encompassed by a thing said by the guy who has the highest rated review.***SPOILERS***""Nothing comes at night. If you read the positive reviews for this movie they like to pretend you should imagine what would come at night. I did not pay $13 a ticket to imagine anything."" Props to this guy for managing to so succinctly sum up everything that is wrong about the big movie business brainwashing people enough that they can't be bothered to imagine anything, enough that they need everything to be served up on a platter and it preferably being baby food and it preferably being McDonalds baby food. This film performs quite the amazing job of tightly illustrating the corruption of one's humanity in a film. Not only that, but said corruption happening inside a family dynamic.The mysteriousness and lack of clarification of the film serves as the fundament for building an allegory. This is not a film about an apocalypse per se, you don't get any nitty gritty details about what the virus is, where it comes from, how many it has killed, what the news had to say about it. This is a film about a family having to withstand a powerful destructive force coming from the outside, and how they are trying to protect themselves from it. This is the reason why everything is left vague, for the purpose of generalization, for the purpose of allegory, for the purpose of allowing the spectator to fill in the details themselves with their experiences. The vagueness allows for a much larger array of empathy. Should the film fall short in terms of execution, then it would indeed fall flat, and the allegory would dissipate. This film, however, is very carefully calibrated, and it is the audience that disappoints, not the movie. It disappoints through unwillingness to process information and sensations by themselves, but rather being locked into a mode in which they just expect everything to always be explained to them so as they can be entertained and not use their brains. The film begins with the execution of the sick grandpa. The following discussion is about how the 17 year old son should not have to be exposed to such atrocities. The very first issue in the film is about protecting the son. However in the night, the son keeps having the worst nightmares, mostly about corruption in one form or another, about getting diseased. His first nightmare begins from a painting of Breugel's, then in another scene we see another painting of Breugel's, Hunters in the Snow, a painting with a rich history in cinema. Tarkovsky used it in Solaris as the peak of the sensation of humanity desired by the astronaut's clone-wife. Lars von Trier burned it in Melancholia as the humanity in that film was being consumed by disease as well. The director here uses it knowingly, no doubt, to reinforce the question of one's humanity. The disease in the film is irrelevant. The disease can be whatever you want it to be, it's Trump. If you wanna know what comes at night, the IT, well it's Trump, OK? It's the corrosion and corruption of today's world in regards to our humanity. The family dynamic is organized in such a way that what is of utmost importance is to protect the son from the disease. From the Trump disease. From the terribleness-that- is-in-this-world disease. The vagueness of it all was not satisfactory for me either for the majority of the film. When it really clicked, however, was right at the very end, as the first time that the son shows that he has the disease is right after his father shoots the child and the mother. Then he gets a nosebleed. Then he is infected. This film is quite spectacular for having illustrated this paradox of organizing your life around protecting your son, only to have that very organizing be the thing that ultimately corrupts your son. It is a highly potent tragic allegory. One that requires a minimum amount of thought and effort to feel. Something that is far too excessive to ask of an audience nowadays apparently. The film offers no solutions, it just offers the proposal of contemplating this paradox, one that I am sure most of us are engaged in, in one form or another in our lives as well. This is why this film is so potent, because if only you would think for a moment you would realize that this paradox of protection is universal, and it doesn't need an apocalypse to occur. It just needs one to be such virtuously illustrated.",It Comes at Night

723,hilli_industries,False advertisement & the wrong audience´s critique,10,13 September 2019,"Now that is one of the best psychological horror drama movies I have ever seen. I loved it after the first time I watched it and the more I think about this movie the more I like it.BUT!It was poorly advertised. The trailer shows a typical horror movie in a house with ""something"" outside like zombies, a monster or something like that. The trailer makes a lot of boom, is fast paced and looks like the movie will have some cheap jumpscares. I thought it will be just another OKAY horror film.But then I saw this carefully created masterpiece about survival, mistrust, family and fear. This movie is not for everyone. It doesn´t answer every question directly. It is subtle, thoughtfull, smart and somehow phylosophical.If you´re tired and you just want to watch a simple movie with a simple plot, don´t watch ""It Comes at Night"". If you just miss some details, it could easyily happen to you that. after the end of the movie, you´re going to say something like ""What comes at night?"" or ""Nothing happened. What kind of movie is that?"" or ""horrible movie"".And that explains all the negative critiques, since a lot of viewers thought that this is going to be a simple horror movie with a typical action third act like thousands of other movies out there. But this movie here is just something completely different and that in a good way.So how does one watch ""It Comes At Night"" without being biased by reviews, the trailer or anything else? Well just don´t expect anything. Just watch it, like you don´t even know what the title of the movie is. Don´t even think about my review here. Erase as much as possible, drink some coffee, turn of your phone and be 100% there, just to watch this movie.",It Comes at Night

725,thomas-mendolia,We're all human beings.,8,24 September 2017,"I don't normally write reviews on here, but I saw all the negative feedback and I felt like I should show some love for the film. First of all, this film was sold as a Horror film, which was a huge mistake. People who go to see those movies aren't really into thinking very much, they just want the jumps and scares, which is fine, but this movie is not that. It doesn't try and scare you, just to scare you, it tries to make you think. I unfortunately have to quote one of the bad reviews on here that says, ""I didn't come to the theater to use my imagination"", which is extraordinarily sad in my opinion, but a truth that filmmakers and marketing directors need to adhere to. The person who goes to see horror films, doesn't like to use their imagination, and this film requires that to some extent. Or maybe it's just that one guy.The film is centered around a family of three, locked away in their house in the middle of the forest due to a ""sickness"" that has plagued the outside world. That's all we know, and that's all we need to know, because this isn't the 10,000th zombie apocalypse movie, we all know that movie quite well. This is the movie that deals with human psychology and the paranoia that inflicts us all during a time of crisis. That's the story the director set out to tell. The family is joined by another family, and the paranoia unfolds, with who is sick, who's not sick, who's dangerous, and has a very grizzly ending. Not trying to give too much away, but this is extremely similar to the Crucible, or the Hunt, both great stories. The poster design and the trailer were deceptive, I did think I was going to watch something terrifying, but I believe that I did watch something terrifying. The scariest thing in the film wasn't a bunch of zombies trying to break in, or a big monster outside, but rather the humans, what they're capable of, and the negative power that imagination can have on us.",It Comes at Night

Let me start off by saying this movie is not a monster movie, it's a suspenseful drama. The movie is advertised as a monster horror film, so I can see why people would be annoyed after seeing this movie. But these people are just angry because they didn't watch the movie they wanted to see. It Comes At Night is fantastic. The performances are great all around especially Joel Edgerton. The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in recent movies. The climax of the movie had my heart racing to the point where I was almost shaking. Trey Edward Shultz uses different aspect ratios to differentiate between the dream and nightmare sequences. When the real world slowly becomes ""a nightmare"" the aspect ratio slowly closes in.People are also annoyed by the unanswered questions. But I really enjoyed that. The movie doesn't guide the viewer and help it answer certain questions. The audience is left by themselves to figure out what is happening, which adds to the atmosphere. I could discuss this movie all day and try to figure out the mysteries of this film. Go into this movie with no expectations. Don't be persuaded by any negative reviews.

That is the only person or scene in the movie we didn't hate when it showed the dog and out of boredom we were both like wow cute dog. I am thinking these sites are taking money to ramp up the ratings or something because the general consensus is this is a horrible waste of time. I NEVER write reviews on here but I was curious what this movie was rated since it was soooo bad and then low and behold almost 7 I call BS on that.

739,Endatkush,Why is the score so high? It's the most boring movie ever.,1,11 October 2017,"This movie was a total waste of time, nothing scary happens. What happened to society? Who knows. What comes in the dark? Who knows. There are no monsters or evil creatures to speak of, just a bunch of delusional bumps in the night.My theory, there was no doomsday and and the only few people in the movie (a cast of like 9 people, a dog, 6 chickens and supposedly 2 goats we never see) are just a bunch of paranoid preppers who are hiding in the woods drinking their own pee and pulling guns on each other.There is some sort of mild ""sickness"" that is probably treatable in this new thing called a hospital. But it's never understood what the sickness is or what happens to those afflicted because the very minute someone is thought to be ""sick"", they are shot in the head and burned with gasoline by the protagonist.At the end, we're led to believe that the ""protagonist"" is totally justified in the heartless murder of the family who just wanted help because they are suspected to be ""sick"" but showed no signs. What did the family really do wrong? They just wanted to leave after they realize the protagonist is crazy in the coconut. So, in front of everyone, the protagonist shoots the father in the back for trying to protect his family, then the baby in front of the mother, then kills the mother while shes screaming over her dead baby and husband.. The movie fades out with the protagonist crying into his crazy beard next to the one person he has left in the world, a wife who is too passive for her own good. He's not crying because he just slaughtered a family without even blinking, he's crying because he's about to kill his step-son while the wife (the kid's mother) says nothing. He probably kills her too after she exhibits a sniffle from cutting onions. Some hero.Why the hell are critics giving this movie such a high score?

748,upscyfees,One moody story that constantly reconsiders the boundaries of right and wrong.,8,16 September 2018,"The film quickly set the mood for what is to come (yes, it was predictable). A disease has sparked fear within humanity and people try with indecent ways to survive. To the first - time viewer the strict order of the family (father, mother, son) is disturbing and far-fetched. The fatherly figure becomes a sick, hateful and violent man that viewers strongly dislike. Once, we are introduced to the first main dilemma (whether or not the family of the house burglar should stay with them for precaution), we feel disgust towards the situation and especially the handling of the father. Of course, when we realise that everyone is going to get sick, we see that the father's fears came true, and killing the burglar, the violent solution was the necessary one. That part is also when we realise that we see most of the film through the eyes of the son (and therefore we understand how the characters see that difficult situation). The final act, which the burglar's family is murdered by the host family, is another thought provoking moment. Should they have let the other family leave (sick as they were) or should they kill them ? In fact, it didn't matter because the measures had not been taken from the beginning and everyone was already infected. Hence the boundaries of morals were already streched to a worrying extent.",It Comes at Night
749,cordero0013,Suspenseful but mismarketed film that lacks depth...,7,13 June 2017,"It Comes At Night is a perfect example of the modern day marketing machine doing a phenomenal job of misleading the customer in order to sell a product. If you haven't seen the trailer for this movie yet, do not watch it. The trailer was tremendously crafted as a straight up horror movie, but as you can see from much of the backlash from moviegoers, it's not really a horror movie. If you go into it with that assumption, you'll be furious when the credits roll. Consider it more of a paranoia suspense or thriller with some family drama mixed in and hopefully you'll be able to digest the film properly instead of shouting ""what the f*** was that s***?!"" like someone so eloquently exclaimed in the showing I attended.It Comes At Night is a psychological study of how we change when the circumstances around us change, and simultaneously, the potential loss of innocence that accompanies those dire situations.The closing shot, which many people hated but I really enjoyed, is a bleak and hopeless picture—husband and wife, distance between them at an otherwise empty table and an empty house, sitting in silence. Not expressively sad, happy, or angry. Perhaps they await their almost certain fate from the unnamed disease. Perhaps they cannot cope with the loss of their child. Perhaps they are relieved to have eliminated the threats to their physical wellbeing. Like many questions in this morally ambiguous realm, the answer is muddled.Despite not being a ""horror"" movie, the film does an incredible job building and maintaining suspense, creating an atmosphere that's unsettling and uneasy for nearly its entire duration. Each slow dolly move towards a door increases anxiety and though we never get the big jump scares that normal moviegoers would expect, we're never left off the hook. It's like a chick that you're texting who claims that she always wants to meet up and each time you make plans, she cancels at the last minute. After the first ten botched dates, you think you'd know better. Nope. You keep asking her to get drinks and keep getting rejected.While I do like films that don't spell everything out, the script is so paper-thin that some details would've been nice to support the actions of the characters. Starting a film in media res can be a powerful storytelling tool if executed correctly, but here it feels like an excuse to not explain things. I wish we could've seen the family dynamic, even if just for one flashback, before the disease hit. It could've provided some extra depth and contrast to their present-day personalities because for all we know, they could have been paranoid, gun wielding people before the disease plagued the country. If their horrific actions are a result of their environment, seeing how they've changed since their environment changed would've been immensely beneficial. Another bothersome technique that weighed down the movie was its reliance on Travis's dream sequences to either fill time, provide more tense moments, or to help with the horror style trailer. We get itTravis has nightmares. And rightfully so —the kid just watched his damn grandfather being burned in a hand-dug grave. But those nightmares should motivate Travis to take action in some way. Otherwise, it just feels like a rinse and repeat.It Comes At Night is good. It's not great and it's not bad—just good. The film deals with powerful contemplations about humanity's desire to survive by any means necessary, and what lengths humans will go to achieve survival. It's a microcosm of the isolationist mentality that seems to be plaguing our country under our current regime. Unfortunately, it's not a new story and this film does not offer any additionally valuable insight into that discussion. It's tense as hell, shot beautifully, and has a wonderful soundscape, but it also lacks depth, asks many questions and provides virtually no answers. I still don't know what the title means; I'm assuming it means Travis when he's dreaming of Kim in his bed.6.9/10",It Comes at Night

If you are disappointed that nothing came at night (and gave it a bad rating for that reason) you need to chill. Real horror doesn't have to be shown anyway; the fear of the unknown is far more potent than just seeing some monster.

A24 has been really upping their game lately (especially with Moonlight) and I had high hopes for this movie. Sure enough, it turned out to be a masterful suspense film. As you watch you immediately get a sense of isolation and loneliness. The world that the main characters are living in is empty and quiet...too quiet. The cinematography is absolutely perfect in helping to really create an eerie, dark environment for the plot to unfold. The performances, character building and writing here are also highlights for me. I don't want to get into any detail about the film because it really should be viewed without any knowledge. There are so many twists and turns and I can honestly say that I don't think I ever looked away from the screen once.",It Comes at Night

At the end of this well filmed waste of time, the 6 other victims my husband and I shared the theatre with laughed. All six. Laughed. At the end of a horror movie... Spoiler Alert: Nothing happens. People get a contagious disease. Nothing ever really happens, they don't become violent. They do not eat babies. They just get sick and the disease spreads. In order to survive (which they don't do very well) they periodically wear a mask and rubber gloves with porous cotton clothing. They take their masks off frequently while exposed to the pathogen because everyone needs a good thrill and there doesn't seem to be a roller coaster near by.

I can say i never took my eyes off the screen once and was always extremely interested in the plot throught the movie. I expected a more ""cliché"" movie or an actual monster, but i think what i got was much better.
As someone with anxiety, this movie speaks to me on another level. The thing that actually comes at night is the insecurity, fear, strangers, the unknown of the world outside and inside your mind. That is much scary than any monster or creature in my opinion.
The characters actually felt real and like the events of the movie were actually happening, by the way they reacted to things (sometimes without thinking).

The unknown can ramp up the horror.

761,cajohare,"Suspenseful psychological thriller, unfairly marketed as a horror",6,19 July 2017,"This is a tense and quite gripping psychological thriller that centers around two families struggling to survive after the outbreak of a highly contagious sickness. How widespread this disease is, its symptoms, and even the cause of the outbreak, is left essentially unexplained. The film contains little in the way of expository dialogue, opening with its main characters burying and mourning the last victim of the sickness. This seems to be the main criticism from those who dislike it, but I think they are missing the point of what the film is actually about. In fact I think the film's lack of exploration of the disease itself is its greatest strength. Far from being some zombie pandemic horror film, 'It Comes at Night' is more interested in the tension that builds between the two central families as they struggle to survive each other, as well as the world they live in. The film is much more of an exploration of the internal ideas of fear, suspicion and paranoia, than a paranormal scream fest. There are a couple of jump scares early on that I personally could have done without but the overall mood is more of a sense of unease. There is some nice ambient music and the photography is quite sleek. The best points for me were a couple of almost Lynchian dream sequences involving journeys down dark corridors. The performances are also pretty solid, particularly from Kelvin Harrison Jr.In my opinion this latest effort from Trey Edward Schults doesn't touch his transcendentally moving debut 'Krisha' (but they really are very different films). Probably worth a watch for fans of the genre.",It Comes at Night

766,nikosd-95838,I went before it came,9,4 February 2018,"Do not worry, no spoilers here: I went before it came. Yes, I sneaked into this movie, without a ticket, and while bouncing around the theater as more and more crowds soared in. Honestly, even though I was warned by a fellow movie goer, I did not believe the projection could be sold out. This movie is obviously lightning years ahead of its time, not to mention the distant past. I did not expect 'normal' crowds to appreciate it... Anyway, like I said, when I was forced to give up the last remaining seats to money-paying customers, I had to go before it came. The reader however will be surprised to hear, this did not make one bit of a difference. This excellent work of art shines through and gives itself away before the plot (which is eventually insignificant) has a chance to unfold.The heroes seem to be a family of assholes, to put it mildly, who do not hesitate to kill their own kin as well as a random stranger, bringing them no harm but merely seeking refuge, and this only in the first few minutes of the movie. Furthermore, even though it comes at night, whatever 'it' is, the family seems to insist going out of the house scouting AT NIGHT looking for 'it', while giving each other unnecessary random scares for the sake of amusement of the audience. Whatever 'it' is, 'it' is hard to be found. This brings the viewer in unprecedented levels of frustration. This, coupled with dopaminergic spikes of gratification caused by the movie's highly predictable story line, make this an intensely emotional film. The director 'insistent zooming', as I like to call this new school of pioneering camera work, leaves the audience stupefied and amazed. It is mainly applied to doors (although it can work just as well on other objects) and works as follows: It works like this: A door. A door, close up. The color of the door. And finally: A dark screen, leaving the door's molecular structure to the imagination of the viewer.All things considered, this is, objectively and by all standards, a controversial and thus good movie.

769,yasvw,An imaginative movie to open up your mind. (THEORIES),8,30 August 2017,"This film is incredibly understated, however, undermined by an array of misleading marketing and conventional trailers. To those of you who were expecting a simplistic horror movie filled with gore and post-apocalyptic madness, you will be disappointed. This movie is a mind-bender. I have seen so many crazy theories and explanations to this movie, and I have my own.*SPOILERS AND THEORIES BELOW*I will try to cover as much as I can, but this is what I thought.Travis - It is clear from the opening sequence in which the Grandfather dies that Travis doesn't handle things well emotionally, expressed by his mothers concern for him having witnessed the death. We then go on to find out later in the film in a conversation with Will's wife that Travis cannot remember how long he's been having issues with sleep, a clear indication of the sheer confusion of reality and fantasy caused by his insomnia, being driven mad by fear and paranoia. The aspect ratio is, what we seem to perceive, as a clear indication of a dream sequence. However, going by the aspect ratio (and music) being used in the final, very much real scene in which Will and his family try to escape, an overlap occurs. Perhaps a symbolic indication of Travis' nightmares being embodied in the now reality, or perhaps evidence of the constant confusion of what is dream and what is reality? What I am really trying to say is we cannot trust Travis' perception, what may be a dream, may in fact be a reality and vice versa.The Door - Okay this leads me on to the big scene, the central focus of many theories. It is made clear upon the arrival of Will's family that the only way in and out of the house is via the keys that remain in Paul/Sarah's possession. It appears that they are on Paul's nightstand at this point. It seems odd that Andrew could get the keys and in fact reach the locks on both doors and exit the house entirely, thus, letting in Stanley, and subsequently get the illness. What seems more probable is that the dream sequence in which Travis leaves the house to find the dog, was, in some respect real. He got the keys from his parents, took the lantern to find the dog and brought/left the door open for the dog to return (Paul noted that Stanley knew his way home). I cannot pin point a reasoning behind Andrew being in the other room, a mere coincidence? However, I believe that it was not Andrew who was actually sick, but Travis, having perhaps made contact with Stanley, or whatever is capable of spreading the illness.The Monster - Another big question, what is 'it'? Is there a monster out in the woods? what was the dog barking at? Now I noticed another comment referencing the 'monsters' that Travis was drawing. Indeed they are monster-like, however, the faces, in my opinion, look awfully like gas masks. Perhaps there were other people in the woods, enticing Stanley to bark at them. Another group maybe? We know there were 2 men within a short distance of the house. And in Travis' dream like state, it is likely he would have seen them on his travels. I also think these 2 men were the reasoning behind Will having his own gun, we know Paul was shot at, however Will said the men had nothing in their possession. Overall - I think in the final sequence, Travis and his family were in fact infected. The way in which Travis 'walked' out the red door symbolises his death, notice the marks were not on his skin anymore. This could indicate perhaps entering into the unknown, facing his fears or dying. Whatever you perceive the door to represent. I think the disease itself manifests within the water, with 'dirty' being written on the water container and Will and his family didn't choose to simply go to a local lake. They relied on the water purification system. The painting is also a clear focal point, it seems to me that the painting is the best representation we have of what is happening beyond the door. The ending is very bleak, sad and realistic. The protagonists focused too much on routine, trust and not enough on the reality of the situation.",It Comes at Night

782,spookygrey,"An ambiguous, Lord of the Flies movie",8,10 June 2017,"The only problem that stood out to me with this movie was that it was another psych thriller poorly advertised as a monster flick. That said, I wouldn't blame the ads as much in this case because, for one it COULD be a monster flick and secondly the people in the theater with me that had complaints about the movie were all playing on their phones/talking etc. Which brings me to my point really. THE HORROR IN THIS MOVIE IS CHARACTER AND ATMOSPHERE BASED ***Begin possible spoilers*** The movie gives us an apocalyptic feel with a distinct character to represent humanity's past that is being abandoned (the grandfather) a character to represent the ambiguous, potentially non existent future (Andrew) and an in between character that's caught between both and therefore, the best representation of the present in my opinion (Travis). Along with this we have a dog for innocence and two couples of varying age groups caught in the middle and arguably the most affected by it all in the end. I compare this movie to Lord of the Flies merely because it takes a group of humans raised in society and then examines what would happen if that security was ripped away from them. They also, like in Lord of the Flies have a ""monster"" in the woods that drives their fear and leads to them turning on one another in an attempt to restore some order. The reason I say this was an atmosphere movie is because it intentionally makes you feel uneasy and trapped and gives you that fear of the woods that is never even justified. That said, in my opinion and like others reviewers mentioned, we are really just taking a front row seat in Travis's mind. Despite his parents seeming to be the most paranoid, you see Travis's perspective and his facial expressions the most and most importantly, his nightmares. The nightmares are very relevant because they, once again create atmosphere. This group of people feel so unsafe that the sickness is seeping into their minds slowly, starting with their subconscious. Notice Travis is much more expressive in his dreams that in real life at first but as things unfold he becomes paranoid in his waking life as well. Overall, as I left the theater, I looked forward to firstly thinking it over in the car ride home but more importantly, going home and taking a shower. Not only does it give you the 'creepy thing in the woods' sorta feeling but also the 'literally everything and everyone is contaminated' feeling.

Marketed as a true horror film and convincing its viewers that there is some sort of monster to be discovered, this film takes the viewers' expectations and flips them on their head. ***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***This film revolves around a family of three holed up in a rural home turned makeshift base: father Paul (Joel Edgerton), mother Sarah (Carmen Ejogo), and son Travis (Kelvin Harris Jr.). It begins with Paul taking his very sick father in law out into the woods and shooting him, then burning his body while his son Travis looks on. The unceremonious burial and Paul's apparent indifference to the burning body set up a continuous lack of sympathy and regret throughout the rest of the film. Not too long after the burial, a man attempts to break into the house and is interrogated by Paul.He tells Paul that he was searching for supplies for his wife and son in an abandoned home about fifteen miles away. After confirming that this man is not sick with the plague that has wiped out unknown masses of people, Paul agrees when Sarah suggests he go and find the stranger's wife and child and bring them back to live at the house with them.Paul returns home with attempted robber turned friend Will (Christopher Abbott), his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner). Things start out normal, but even though both families seem content with the situation, the viewers can't help but feel unsettled by Travis's recurring nightmares involving his dead father-in-law, walking down the dark hallway that leads to the front door and jolting awake, and when the other family moves in, Kim approaching him in bed only to end up vomiting an inky black substance onto his mouth.On top of these nightmares, Travis's dog Stanley manages to snap his leash and runs off into the woods one day. Paul assures Travis that Stanley will come back eventually. Paul and Will share whiskey in Paul's study and begin talking about their lives before the sickness started to spread. Will tells Paul that he was an only child, which raises a bright red flag because, when Paul was interrogating Will when they first met, Will had told Paul that before he and his wife had found the abandoned house, they had been living with Will's brother. Paul mentions this, obviously tense, and Will back peddles and explains that they stayed with his brother-in-law, Kim's brother. The viewers are left with an uneasy feeling as Paul grabs his bottle of whiskey and tells Will he's going to bed. The families fall back into their routine with each other until one night when Travis is again woken up from a nightmare. Travis then finds Andrew asleep in his late grandfather's room, apparently having sleep- walked from his own family's room. Travis wakes Andrew up and takes him back to his room. For a moment, everything seems fine; until Travis hears scraping noises coming from the entrance hall. Going down to the door and finding it unlocked and slightly ajar, Travis races back upstairs to inform his father that someone is in the house.After the whole house has been woken up, Paul and Will walk into the entryway to find Stanley laying there, on the verge of death, wheezing, and covered in blood. Paul shoots Stanley since he is evidently sick with the same ""plague"" that infected Travis's grandfather. The families convene at the dinner table and Travis tells everyone that he found Andrew first, then found the door open, insinuating that it may have been possible that Andrew sleep-walked and opened the door. Tensions rise quickly, as does the paranoia that either Andrew, Travis, or both have been infected. Each family closes themselves off in their respective rooms and goes to bed.Travis wakes up to hear Andrew crying, and he overhears Will telling Kim that they need to leave. Travis wakes his parents up to inform them of this. There is no room for humanity or empathy in the world that Shults has created; Sarah and Paul immediately come to the conclusion that the entire family must be killed if they truly are sick. Travis is told to wait in the bedroom while Paul and Sarah put on their gas masks and go to confront Will and Kim. Conflict inevitably ensues; attempting to get Will to open the door, Paul is confronted with a gun that he didn't know Will had and forced into their bedroom. Will insists that Andrew is not sick, none of them are, but at no point can the viewers see Andrew's eyes or hands (two places where indicators of the sickness can be seen easily), and Will tells his son to keep his eyes closed. Will tells Paul they want to leave and want half the food and water. While trying to lead his family to the door and keeping the gun pointed at Paul, Sarah appears and tells Will to give Paul the gun. While Will is distracted, Paul manages to get his gun and knocks him on the head while Sarah goes after Kim and Andrew.Will, Andrew, and Kim are all shot without the viewers knowing for sure if they were truly infected. Shortly after, Travis wakes up one morning to find that he has been infected, and the movie's final scene showing a bloodied Paul and vacant Sarah sitting at the table with Travis's seat empty leaves viewers feeling hollow. ""It Comes at Night"" is an art film in every sense of the word that explores the ideas of humanity and paranoia and leaves its viewers tense from beginning to end.",It Comes at Night

Spent the first hour waiting for the climax, for the horror to start, for anything interesting to happen, and the last 30 minutes wondering what the point of the movie was.The movie is very slow. I guess the idea is to leave you wondering or for you to fill in the blanks (what happened? why are people getting sick? what's out there?), but instead it disappoints. I can not recommend it. The acting is decent, but the story is weak, at best.",It Comes at Night

Nothing comes at night-as a matter of fact- nothing comes ever! As near as you can figure out, some kind of unknown disease is spreading around, and this is a few days in the lives of 2 families living in a house in the woods. They take showers, they eat, they chop wood, they act like a horde of rabid undead rhinos could kill them at any moment, and then....AND THEN... NOTHING f*cking happens-ever-at all. Tons of neck tightening melodrama to watch 6 A-holes camp in the woods. If you want a similar feeling without driving to the cinema, take $10 and ball it up very small and then throw it away. Next take a semi comfortable chair into a dark room with a closet. Open the closet door part way and stare into it whilst sitting in the chair.

What little does happen makes you regret the time you've lost in your life that you'll never get back again. I suppose I was expecting a horror movie but that never happened. As a journalist, I told a friend of mine who saw it with me at the 20 minute mark, if this were an article my editor would start cutting the story about now because there was very little going on beyond that point.

800,mattlaccetti,Worth Seeing,8,15 June 2017,"I think Director Trey Edward Shults perfects tension in this bleak setting. The basis of the movie isn't necessarily about finding the answers on the outside, but rather question the relationships and emotions of those who are on the inside. Paranoia drives this movie from start to finish, and those who leave the theater unsatisfied are missing the point of what Shults was trying to create. With a budget of just 5 million dollars, he challenges our subconscious to extend the visual. My girlfriend and I spent the thirty minute dark car ride home dissecting the underlying theories of the film. This carried over into my sleep with eerie consequences. It was the imagination of possibilities that made it that much more terrifying. I thought actor Kelvin Harrison did a masterful job of relating his fears into a character you not only rooted for, but worried about. It was also proper length which made for an enjoyable watch, one that is hard to erase from your mind.",It Comes at Night

To not give away much of the movie for anyone who is insistent on seeing this movie and wasting 2 hours of their life that they will never get back..... I will just say this in general. This is not a horror film. This is not a thriller. This is not a suspenseful film.

This really takes away from the credibility of IMDb. I will never ever look at IMDb in the future. It was meant to be a joke, it was not funny. Lets get some things right, the movie was horrible. There was no point to it. The movie name had nothing to do with the movie or the senseless events in it. If the reviews and ratings were meant for cheating people, then rest assured, you succeeded.

This movie was one of the largest pieces of garbage I have ever seen.*Spoiler*Nothing comes at night. If you read the positive reviews for this movie they like to pretend you should imagine what would come at night. I did not pay $13 a ticket to imagine anything. On top of that, one of the main characters is left tied to a tree through a night or 2 and guess what... Nothing comes to eat him, make him sick, or even tickle his toes. We saw this movie at the Alamo Draft House and I was very confused when they started handing out checks as that usually happens after the climax of a movie, and this movie never had that. To sum the movie up, his grandpa is put down like a sick animal at the start of the movie then nothing happens for about 20 minutes. Some guy shows up at his house by breaking in, they go to pick up this guys family and some goats. While on the road, they run in to a couple of guys who they beat up and kill. At this point, they lead you to believe the guy who wandered up to his house knew the people in the forest, but they just ignore that and bring the guys family and goats home. Then you spend another 20 minutes with nothing happening and then the dog runs away. What did the dog run away to chase? You never find out. The dog shows up sick a few nights later and some how this ""door that only the dad has a key to gets unlocked"". How did that happen and why did everybody blame the kid when the dad has the only key? Well, if you asked that, you will never find out because they just go ""Oh well, lets all go to our separate rooms"". While in their rooms the mom hugs and kisses her kid, the kid who touched the other little kid. Why did the kid die at the end from the disease and the mom not die? How is the disease spread? Nobody took proper precautions to prevent the spread of a disease. Putting a mask on for a few minutes doesn't protect you if it's airborne as you are all still hanging out together. Hugging and kissing your kid who may be infected is also an easy way to get the virus, disease, whatever it was. Save your money, this movie is full of plot holes, almost no story and just plain sucked. I am disappointing I didn't go see the house instead. That one got bad reviews, but at least I would have known that going in to it and wouldn't have been lead to believe this movie was going to be good by a bunch of lying hipsters.

This is one of the worst movies ever. First of all I think IMDb should remove all the fake reviews and have some kind of control with these users who write positive critics just to induce people to watch this film. IT IS A RIP OFF. Don't get excited by the trailer and promotion of this film because you will be deluded and probably expect a great horror film when actually it seems that this is only a huge marketing campaign focused in catching the people's attention with the mere intention of dragging them to the cinemas. The film starts as any other apocalyptic film and gets to nowhere. The characters try to protect themselves against a menace and hide inside a cabin but in fact you never get to see anything at all. The whole idea for this film is nothing new and this could be a very bad spin-off of ""Contagion"".The plot is quite basic and dull. There is no any twists or surprises during the film that could keep you at the edge of your seat. The script is quite simple filled with meaningless and irrelevant dialogues. I went with my partner and both of us felt really ripped off even before the film had finished. Just when you see the ""awful and lame"" ending you just lose the will to live. You feel better when you see that it is not only you but everyone at the screen. The whole audience started complaining in utter astonishment as they were expecting the film to change somehow at some point.We consumers have to start being more critical and severe with this kind of industry as it seems they think we are stupid and easy manipulable and that we will feel satisfied and entertained with any crap like this. We pay a high price when we go to the cinemas nowadays and this quantity of money should be reflected in quality products. Why does this industry allow this kind of rubbish films to get this exposure when they do not deserve it at all? It is probably interests and corruption...In conclusion, do not waste your time and money to watch this film as you will be really disappointed.

He sees the paranoia, he can't sleep, and the building tension that keeps bubbling up from the possibilities of what is actually out there are enough to drive him insane. What's interesting to me is that each of his nightmare's contains someone that is ""sick"" and he has one about himself. The movie is a little bit slowww but that's alright.

820,julezrclp,"Not an easy movie to watch, but a stunning one",8,20 March 2019,"As i've hardly read any reviews that even remotely cover my view of the movie, i decided to do my very first one.
First of all, the bad Rating is both (un-)justified.
On the one hand, it's unjustified because the movie is absolutely awesome and works amazingly well.
On the other hand, it's justified because the advertising of the movie was completely misleading. This is not a horror movie about some monster. It doesn't even really need that much in it that you could call supernatural.What it achieves, is accuracy. It's supposed to be completely realistic, and the characters are meant to be as human as they can be.
We don't get that many obvious goofs as in most other movies of a similar genre, although we get one major one.
The major goof is that, no matter how you put it, the red door being opened doesn't add up. Joel's character, Paul, says in the beginning that he has the only key to that door. The movie however only gives us two possibilities: Either Travis opened the door and lied about it or didnt remember it because of sleepwalking or anything of the kind, or little Andrew did it, supposedly also sleepwalking. The latter seems to make the most sense, but it really doesnt matter which of the two you choose as your version, since you have the same problem in both cases: Why did they have the key to unlock the door? This is also not correctly addressed when the families meet afterwards, where Paul having the only key is just completely ignored. The door seems to have unlocked all by itself, so either Travis or Andrew were able to open it.But that is only a minor fault, compared to what the movie does achieve: It shows us how inhumane humans can get when it comes to defending their loved ones in a hostile environment. And the plot always lets the characters do what they are supposed to do, there are no faults in the logic.The plot seems realistic because it develops the way it develops and does not care about anything like traditional schemes. It ends abrupt, but with all being said that had to be said.All in all, i'd gladly give the movie a 10/10. But that one major plothole wont close, no matter how hard i think about it.

834,crottsc,Don't waist your time,1,3 September 2017,"First off the title of this movie is very misleading. The first thing I said after watching this was, ""So what comes at night??"" I will tell you now, nothing comes at night.There were so many questions left unanswered. We are lead to believe that the guy they let into the house is lying about not knowing there was anyone in the home and by saying he was with his brother when later he reveals that he is an only child. Do we ever find out if he was really lying? Is he a bad guy? Who knows!! Why were they all supposed to wear gas masks but then are all outside chopping wood without them? Not very consistent. Who was the dog barking at? Who brought the dog back in the house? Who unlocked the red door? How did the little boy get sick? The most annoying part for me is that we watched this on our firestick and had to keep waiting for it to reboot. Waisted so much time trying to watch a movie that has no freaking point!",It Comes at Night
835,reneekalliokoski,What a misleading title....,1,3 September 2017,"The title ""It comes at night"" leads you to believe that there is SOMETHING, or an ""It"". Instead the closest you get to there being anything out there is the dog barking, running away, and going quiet. The whole movie is based on some mysterious illness, that never gets explained, with the story line never even leaving the house. It was no where near scary, and wasn't even a good post apocalyptic movie. What a waste of time! I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.",It Comes at Night

A complete waste of time because nothing happens at all. There's literally no story line, nothing happens, nothing comes at night or during the day. There's maybe one part where you almost get scared, but don't quite make it. We don't know why a virus started or even what happened to anyone. This is just so bad.

It's not your typical horror or thriller film. It is done in such a way that only the essential information is given, but by doing so it still creates this incredible tension and suspense. I think this is one reason his film has gotten unsavory reviews. Some viewers will want questions to be answered. Once you accept that this film is about what happens in the house not outside of it, you may enjoy the simplicity of this film. Some even have issues with the title and critic the fact that they think nothing comes at night. It's not true...nightmares, fear, bad events...those all come at night. Anywho... I enjoyed this film.

Well nothing came at night, maybe the urge to switch off, roll in stinging nettles, testing if the live rail on the train tracks or letting some air out of your car Tyre and try blowing it up with my mouth. The film could have been condensed into less than 5 mins, credit to the director for managing somehow to fill the other 85 mins with waffle, dreams, in-consequent scenes while skilfully managing to miss relaying any back story and avoiding any character attachment and story-line. If boredom does not send you to sleep then you find yourself quickly wishing for the virus to kill everyone immediately so the film can end however it plods onto an inconclusive end that leave you all a WTF look that will bound you and all that watched with you for life. 5 million budgets on a wooded house in the woods, a pickup truck, 9 actors and a dog, 3 of which die early on along with the dog soon after.

851,jimijhendrix,"An underrated, misunderstood, & masterful work of art",9,25 September 2017,"Let me start off by saying that I completely understand why this film got so much backlash & received the kind of negative reaction that it did upon release. I'm not the first reviewer to bring up the film's marketing & how It Comes At Night was promoted. Editing trailers is a dream job / passion of mine & I'd love to edit/cut a trailer for this film. The problem is how the studio sold this film. This is a film that was presented & made to look like a post apocalyptic monster horror/thriller that is actually a psychological drama/thriller that's an intense character study in human nature. This is a spoiler that I think most people that are viewing this piece for the first time will benefit from knowing; No, nothing comes at night. At least not physically. In reality, there is no monster. Nothing is out in the woods that wasn't there before this unexplained virus surfaces. What really DOES come at night is fear, nightmares, and paranoia. While pretty much every character experiences these psychological demons in some way, the male character are plagued by it the most. These are all good people who were good people before this apocalypse struck. They are people with families and who only want to protect their family and do what is right by then and what is necessary in order to survive. Everything falls apart when accusations are made, certain comments are read way into, and guns are pulled on one another that stuff really starts to go south. Despite the circumstances that our characters are facing aka the apocalypse and a deadly plague like virus everything and folds in an extremely grounded and realistic way there is nothing even remotely unrealistic about the film or what happens to the characters what we are seeing is exactly what would happen to any individual who found themselves in this situation so anybody who's looking to find scary monsters or outrageous action scenes of horror and violence this is not the movie for you even if it potentially was made to look like it was. the entire cast give gut-wrenching performances and the film is quite Bleak and end on a very dark and depressing tone. so if you want to watch a film that will unsettle you that has captivating performances and an amazing setting go watch this film just know that the only monsters in the film are human.",It Comes at Night

Thought provoking? No. Intense and intimidating? Not even close. Waste of 87 minutes. You betcha!! Props to the actors who played parts well. But the delivery of this story line could have been so much better by not withholding as much and asking the viewer to fill in the blanks (read make up a story). The eventual breakdown of social order did not, as some will allude to, have us on the edge of our seats, nor did the climax of the movie have us wound so tight we were almost shaking, in fact the final scene was promptly followed by my wife and I looking confused at each other then spending the next 20 minutes discussing what a waste of time it was.

Sometimes it works. This is definitely NOT one of those times. The ending isn't unresolved, the whole movie is. Absolutely no back story at all. People in cities started getting ""sick"". That's literally all you learn through the entire movie. What comes at night? Is it some sort of virus? Zombies perhaps? Hell, I would take aliens even.

It is different from other films in this genre because it can't use its theme of psychological deterioration as a placeholder for quality filmmaking.

875,failsafegamers,A slow moving and paranoid thriller.,8,27 July 2018,"One of the biggest things I see with other reviews of this movies is that people seem upset that there is no payoff to the title of the film. The title It Comes At Night makes it seem almost as if there is some grand greater monster or enemy that comes in the night. In reality the title is about the creeping fear of paranoia that comes in the night and not some scary monsters or zombies or anything like that. This movie is very slow moving at times, it is an incredible slow burn about a family that is stuck in some kind of disease driven apocalypse. It is never expressed how it started, how it is transferred, or what it exactly does. This will either be something you like or hate, personally I love the feeling of putting us right in the story of the end of the world, in a world that already far beyond hope of saving.It Comes At Night isn't a movie about saving the world or being brought back from the brink of death, in fact it cements itself hard in the other direction. We never know anything about this virus or if there is a cute, we spend the movie with a family that is just trying to survive instead. Where other films in the genre might focus on hope and finding a cute It Comes At Night stands out as not trying to tell that story. Rather it focuses on the intense paranoia of a single family just doing their best. I thought the performances were great, as it is a very slow character driven movie, the acting really is what holds everything together. You're able to relate and really understand this feeling of being anxious and paranoid, especially with the son. I appreciate that this movie doesn't sit down and explain every little thing to you, it shows you character through actions instead of just telling you. Overall I would absolutely recommend this if you are looking for something with a tense, slow build. If you want a zombie or action flick with a monster, this is most likely not the choice for you.",It Comes at Night

There was no ""it"" that came at night. No monster, no zombie, no ghost. The only scares were from ""jump scares"" which startled me due to the sudden loud music.I gave this two stars because it did tell a good story of how paranoia affects you, but overall not a great movie. Skip this even if it's free!",It Comes at Night
883,shinxcreate,Why make this movie,2,2 January 2020,"There are so many other things they could be doing other than making ridiculous horrible movies like this, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the cinematography, other than that this movie is below 0 stars, it's so bad.",It Comes at Night
884,rajahdre,"A bait and switch title, that's good for 1 viewing.",6,11 November 2018,"If you came expecting to see a horror movie, you'll be sadly disappointed; however, if you don't mind psychological (mini) thrillers with a script that's basically 1 page or less long... You got it, with this movie. There's just lots and lots of nature shots and character close-ups of their emotional states to really try to remind the audience what's going on? But in all honesty this is just a run-of-the-mill ***SPOILERS***, zombie survival game encounter (without the zombies, thus the ""bait and switch"" title), where the player triggered a ""Game Over"" by inviting a bungling/clueless survivor family into your home with absolutely no parenting skills to either; watch their kid, or teach it the basics of germ control.",It Comes at Night
885,rrestringer,skip it,2,4 March 2019,"I hated this movie. Those who rated this movie highly are criticizing others by saying that the movie was a slow burn and that it doesn't matter that nothing comes at night because the fear the movie gives you sets in, and you can use your imagination as to what comes at night. let me say this movie is no burn, not slow burn. I found it confusing because the fear was non existent. I'm fairly easily scared and this did nothing for me. I very much appreciate movies that create suspense and tension through a movie over time instead of relying on jump scares, but you have to create suspense for this to work, or else you end up with a 2 hour movie that has its audience in total confusion of what they've just watched. If i wanted to use my imagination to scare myself i wouldn't have watched a movie. its the movies job to create the horror, not the audiences to imagine it. overall this was a boring waste of time and i don't recommend anyone watch it unless they are having trouble sleeping.",It Comes at Night
