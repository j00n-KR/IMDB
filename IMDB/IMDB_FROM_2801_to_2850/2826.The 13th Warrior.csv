0,Leofwine_draca,One of Hollywood's best Viking movies,7,14 November 2016,"I really got a kick out of this old-fashioned adventure yarn which features a band of heroic and noble Vikings battling an army of cannibalistic inhuman warriors. Maybe it's the epic-feeling spirit of the film, the worthy dialogue or the strong and just characters which reminded me of a Cameron Mitchell Viking movie on a big budget, or Jerry Goldsmith's sweeping score. Despite tons of post-production difficulties (Michael Crichton having to re-edit the film and Goldsmith re-scoring the original music), the film looks and sounds spectacular and even more impressive in some ways than the following year's GLADIATOR. The plot is effectively simple and in some ways recalls THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN: a band of heroes are brought together to protect an ageing king and his town from an unknown enemy.The fact that Hollywood hasn't made a film about the Vikings for decades gives this movie a freshness often lacking from modern-day adventure yarns; the mostly Norwegian cast also helps to add to the authenticity. Of course, audiences wouldn't bother watching this film without a familiar face or two in the cast, thus we have imported star Antonio Banderas in the role of an Arab forced to join with the Vikings and take up arms again a seemingly indestructible foe. Banderas is reasonably good in his part, and walks a fine line between being friendly and likable and tough and heroic. Also appearing is Omar Sharif, although for name value more than anything else (he only appears in the film's prologue, helping to explain some of the story).The best thing about this film by far is the photography, which is simply magnificent. The landscape is all misty forests and rolling hillsides and the colour is lush and beautiful and always stunning. In fact this is one of the most beautifully-shot films I've ever seen. Even the night-time sequences are lovely to look at, with the actors lit by shimmering red glow from the flames of their fires. I love the mystical aspects in the first half of the film, with the hidden enemy being portrayed as monsters, and the mysterious ""fire dragon"" which appears spookily out of the mist to menace our heroes. I love the eerie descent into the bowels of the earth which is great stuff and evokes an almost Lovecraftian atmosphere. The action scenes, too, are impressively rendered and follow in the recent trend of Hollywood's historical epics by offering plenty of graphic gore and violence to add to the movie's realism. There are more than enough reasons to watch and enjoy this movie, although surprisingly it wasn't a hit; I find it to be perfectly acceptable viewing with the only minor flaw being that it's perhaps not as exciting as it could have been.",The 13th Warrior
1,SnoopyStyle,fish out of water action thriller,6,14 August 2015,"Ahmad Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) is a carefree poet in Baghdad. After falling for the wrong woman, he's banished to the barbaric far north as an ambassador. His caravan is attacked by Tartars and is rescued by a passing Viking longboat. Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) is his loyal companion. He is shocked by their customs. An ancient evil that must not be named threatens the Vikings and their seer prophesy that 13 warriors must be sent. The 13th must be no Northman and Ahmad is pushed into joining.I really like the idea of a cultured Arab trying to fit in with the crude Vikings. It has a bit of fun with the fish out of water concept. Director John McTiernan is too in love with the dark muddy battle. Most of all, the Vikings don't stand out as individual. Thirteen is probably too many. There is a long cinematic tradition with seven. If the group could be reduced, some of them have a better chance to stand out.",The 13th Warrior
2,kosmasp,Warriors ... come out and ...,7,22 December 2020,"Ok using quotes from a completely unrelated movie that don't make any sense with this one? Check. Hopefully you haven't turned your attention elsewhere yet and give me or rather this a chance to go into the movie I watched here. Because this is quite well made and has one of the most notable ... I'll call it gimmick or trick I've seen in a movie. I'm not aware of another movie having used this trick before or after to be honest, but since I can't claim to have seen all the movies ever (no one can really), there might be one or more out there.What am I talking about? The fact that our main character learns to understand what others are saying even if it is not english they are speaking. And how do we and him get to understand and see this progress? By slowly turning the words others are saying into english. Genius move by the movie and its filmmakers.Apart from that we get quite the Viking action. Well made stunts and a story that is interesting and gripping enough for the viewer to follow. I rewatched this the other day and was still entertained by it",The 13th Warrior
3,gavin6942,I Guess I Really Do Not Understand This Film,4,2 July 2006,"From the director of ""Medicine Man"", ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Predator""... and the writer of ""Twister"" and ""Congo""... comes ""The 13th Warrior"", starring a Spaniard as as Arab.When I watched this film, I had been drinking and talked through much of the movie. Also, it was on a dubbed VHS tape so the picture quality was not optimal and made the darker scenes a little less easier to follow. However, I still think the film was rather weak.If you want action, with swords flying, fire burning, arrows and horses doing back-flips, you will probably be a fan of this film. There certainly is a large amount of swordplay and epic battle. But in almost every other category, there is much to be desired.I did not find there to be any comedy or romance, very little suspense and the plot seemed absurd. Vikings are in Baghdad looking for an Arab to fulfill a prophesy to fight an ancient evil. This is already odd, but then as the film continued, the ancient evil seemed to be something that could have been defeated with any common army - no Arab necessary - and the movie never explains who they are (although I understand the book makes this very clear). Never mind the fact an Arab can learn fluent Norwegian in a matter of days.The only scene I really enjoyed was with two Norsemen having a duel. While it seemed unrelated to the plot as a whole, I think it added more to the characters than anything else in this film.As I said, if you like a lot of swordplay, this might be a good film to see. But otherwise, I think you would be better off renting something else... this is certainly not the best film from McTiernan, Crichton or Banderas...",The 13th Warrior
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Nice To Look At, But Story Is Only 'Fair'",5,26 August 2006,"I found this wasn't a bad action film and certainly better than the national critics would have you believe. The best feature of the movie is the cinematography and the 5.1 sound. Story- wise, it's so-so, about a bunch of Norsemen along with Arab (played by Antonio Bandaras) fighting some Mongol invaders. The film could have used some humor, some better character development, and perhaps even a love interest . It also could have been better had it been 10-15 minutes shorter, but that's a common complaint of movies. Othersise, despite all that, it was still fairly interesting with beautiful colors and scenery.",The 13th Warrior
5,rmax304823,Here's To Níðhöggr.,6,28 September 2016,"A nice, high-echelon, young Arab (Banderas) is sent as an emissary to the Bulgars in 922 AD. At the time, the Middle East was the center of civilization. While Europeans were living on a flat earth, the people of Egypt were measuring its circumference. They invented soap. They also invented algebra, for which may God forgive them.Banderas is more or less shanghaied into joining a band of Norsemen returning to their home to protect it against the people of the mist, the Wendlos. I don't know if the Wendlos existed or not but they do in this movie.Banderas is revolted by the slovenliness of the Vikings. And who can blame him. They pass around a bowl to wash their faces in, but they also spit in it and one guy blows his nose into it using the one-nostril side slip method. But, like a good cultural anthropologist, he adapts to the ways of his hosts without trying to convert them to his religion or his customs.I was watching this on YouTube and at this point, Disney blocked the middle third of the film because of some copyright dispute. Therefore, it appears, I missed Diane Venora, which is a damned shame. Although, come to think of it, they could have used Mia Maestro because they look so much alike. I wonder if they are one and the same person. Has anyone ever seen Venora and Maestro together in the same room at the same time? No? I thought not.The ending is a sword-slinging bash in the rain and the mud. The Wendlos are all bundled up in bear costumes and whatnot so it's hard to tell whether they're supposed to be human or not. Someone has suggested they were Neanderthals but that's out of the question. It's out of date by some 50,000 years for one thing.Guess who wins the slogging match? RIGHT, the Norsemen and Banderas, fighting the enemy together, drenched in blood. The Vikings were pretty destructive when you get right down to it but they left us a few souvenirs -- ""skiff"", ""shirt,"" ""Thursday"", ""Friday,"" and so on.",The 13th Warrior
6,ma-cortes,Terror and action with an excellent Antonio Banderas battling killer marauders,7,27 March 2006,"In the Dark Ages , AD 922 Ahmad Ibn (Antonio Banderas) an Arab nobleman is banished by a wrong love to the Barbaric north . On his way he encounters Turks in Central Asia and Russian and Varangians (Volga Vikings) . As a diplomatic person he meets an experienced Arab (Omar Sharif) and befriends a group of Vikings Norsemen (Vladimir Kulich,Dennis Storhoi..) returning their homeland . Shortly after , he is enlisted to battle a mysterious evil force, creatures of the mist (though never explains who the ravenous-hunger ""mist monsters"" actually are and in the novel, they were the descendants of the Neanderthals) attacking by night as supernatural head-cutters (Wendol) and devouring human flesh that threaten the village existence .This epic movie initially titled ¨Eaters of the dead¨and subsequently ¨The 13th Warrior¨ begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise and winding up with continuous struggles against the body eaters . The picture packs great loads of action , special effects abundant , horror , breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Based on the historic character : Ahmed Ibn Fadlan who traveled as an emissary to the land of the Volga Bulgars to convert them to Islam , he returned in 923, and no record after this date refers to him. Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . The movie was slated to be released as ""Eaters of the Dead"" in 1998, after the film was considered unwatchable during test screenings , then Michael Crichton took over the project , and he made some important changes .The film gets an impressive control of the crowd scenarios with a climatic and overwhelming finale battle . Exceptional and colorful cinematography shot in Canadian outdoors by Peter Menzies . Musical score by the veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith is extraordinary and spectacular . However , Graeme Revell had composed a complete original score , but Revell's original soundtrack was scorned , and brought in Jerry Goldsmith to rescore the movie . The film is based on Michael Chricton's (also producer) novel :¨Eaters of the dead¨ inspired by medieval poem ¨Beowulf ¨ and the authentic travel realized by a scout Arab towards Northland . The film was shelved during years for disagreement among director (McTiernan) and producer (Chricton) . The motion picture was beautifully executed with phenomenal production design (Wolf Kroeger) and well directed by John McTiernan . The flick will appeal to adventures cinema buffs and Antonio Banderas fans . Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average . Well worth seeing for numerous action battle scenes which have you on the edge of your seat.",The 13th Warrior
7,Coventry,WOO-HOO!! Viking-Violence!!!,7,20 January 2004,"I'm really wondering why there aren't making more movies like this! What is in more interesting than the history of the Scandinavian countries? What is more fascinating than the tales of Northern myths and their legendary Gods?? Well, in my personal opinion, nothing is and that's why I was so enthusiast when I first heard about this Thirteenth Warrior being released! And even though I'll admit the film is flawed on several levels, I enjoyed it very much and I'd like to encourage as much people as possible to find out more about the North men and their intriguing history. Co-producer Michael Crichton who also wrote the screenplay bases the 13th Warrior on his own `Eaters of the Dead' novel. It's a tale of a banished Arab man who joins twelve North men on a conquest against an ancient form of evil. He learns their language and becomes a warrior during the journey, he fights along against the `Wendol'These are giant bear-like men who're extremely violent and savage. The good thing about The 13th Warriors is that it contains multiple impressive battle sequences and extremely interesting characters. For example the leader of the North men -  Buliwyf -  who's a truly overwhelming personality. The costumes and geographical settings are breath taking and perhaps even the most succeeded aspects in the entire production. And, of course, you can't tell a Viking tale without the use of explicit violencethe battles are pretty gruesome and the shed of blood is enormous. I didn't have a problem with that, though. I even love it but it might be something to keep under consideration when you have a weak stomach and you're planning to watch this film. Yet, it's only fair that I name a few of them negative elements The 13th Warrior suffers from. The largest parts of the script  and especially the dialogues  are very poorly written. The film also desperately tries to insert humor that is painfully unfunny and even embarrassing at times. Even the entire last battle scene may have been skipped since it's too heroic and a bit too much. Terrifically shot, though. Antonio Banderas will never be a class-A actor, neitherluckily for him, the accent works out well enough in stories like this. Nonetheless, The 13th Warrior is good entertainment and the background of it is food for education! Vikings rule!!",The 13th Warrior
8,hitchcockthelegend,Cow Urine?,5,13 January 2013,"The 13th Warrior is directed by John McTiernan, who also co-adapts the screenplay with William Wisher Junior and Warren Lewis from the Michael Crichton novel Eaters of the Dead. It stars Antonio Banderas, Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhøi, Daniel Southern, Neil Maffin, John DeSantis, Diane Venora and Omar Sharif. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Peter Menzies Junior.10th Century Arabian emissary Ahmed ibn Fahdlan (Banderas) joins a band of Viking warriors to do battle with the Wendol, a band of human flesh eaters.A financial disaster for Touchstone Pictures (it lost close to $100 million), The 13th Warrior was beset with problems from the off. Sitting on the shelf for nearly two years before finally getting released into theatres, the version put out was heavily re-edited by producer Michael Crichton; and it shows! Something clearly went wrong in production, where McTiernan, director of two of the finest action movies of the 80s, apparently lost his way. This is if you believe Sharif, who was so upset by the script and direction on the film he proclaimed he was quitting making bad movies; only to then make stuff like Shaka Zulu: The Citadel (2001)! The music department also had its problems, with Graeme Revell having his score rejected and Jerry Goldsmith brought in to, err, put his Wind and the Lion score inauthentically over the top of the film, loudly!Us fans of historical period epics have been fed on scraps in the new millennium, more so for those who have a bent for Viking flavours. The 13th Warrior is not a disaster if you are prepared to just indulge in a thrill ride for an hour and forty minutes. It very much resembles an over extended music video, lots of loud slashing, chopping and thunder with guys dressed up in mud and blood period attire. Evidently this was Crichton's attempt to salvage the movie! Striping away its story and leaving characters and sub-plots resigned to being mini casual observers. It also at times for the dark/night time shots looks murky, Menzies' cinematography barely able to put life into the many action scenes or vividly realise the Canadian locations. Would a new Blu-ray release now improve upon this? Unlikely, though a chance to see McTiernan's original cut would be most welcome...It is a mess of a movie, one that lacks brains and hurts the eyes and the ears, yet it does have its supporters. Lurching from one action scene to the next works for some, they don't care about brains to go with the brawn. But swords and shields film fans deserve better than this personality free tosh. 5/10",The 13th Warrior
9,Theo Robertson,Avid Merrion Stars In A Crap Film,3,26 July 2004,"I saw THE 13TH WARRIOR immediately after seeing the surreal and funny comedy show BO SELECTA and I couldn't help noticing that Antonio Banderas voice resembles Avid Merrion . I couldn't help laughing every time Banderas's character Ahmed Fadlan opened his mouth to add narration to the story , when he said "" We traveled to the lands of the north "" I kept expecting him to say "" So I could meet some really sexy blonde ladies , ah really really lurve Abi Titmuss "" Seeing as this brought amusement to the proceedings I'm glad I was reminded of Avid Merrion because that's the only entertainment to be had by the first hour of this movie whose narrative is entirely taken up by Ahmed traveling with a group of viking warriors to the lands of the north which is even less exciting than it sounds . The lack of involvement for the audience isn't helped by a ridiculous revelation that Ahmed can understand the viking's language after all and up until this point we have to watch large sections of the movie where no English is spoken . Wouldn't it have been far better to have the characters understand each others language right from the start of the film no matter who illogical this would have been ?So after an hour where nothing of any interest happens the film settles down to its main plot of having the Avid Merrion soundalike and his multi-lingual mates protecting the Nordic people from an army of cannibalistic redneck scumbags . Again I don't want to give the impression that this sounds exciting in anyway because it's not . Director John McTiernan at the time was well regarded because of his work on DIE HARD , THE HUNT FOR RED October and PREDATOR and is probably now best remembered for the debacle that is the ROLLERBALL remake you get an idea how variable his can be . The battle scenes in THE 13TH WARRIOR are probably the worst action scenes of McTiernan's career , they're badly edited and so darkly lit that it's almost impossible to see what's taking place on screen . Compared to Ridley Scott's work on GLADIATOR and most especially Peter Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS the battle scenes here are very poor indeed and I'm at a loss to understand the relatively high rating by IMDb voters . I give THE 13TH WARRIOR three out of ten",The 13th Warrior
10,zardoz-13,"""The Thirteenth Warrior"" Is A Winner!",8,24 September 2008,"Thirteen turns out to be a lucky number for Antonio Banderas in ""Die Hard"" helmer John McTiernan's adventure epic ""The Thirteenth Warrior,"" Banderas' first movie since ""The Mask of Zorro."" This spectacular sword & sorcery saga about an ostracized Arab poet (Antonio Banderas), a dirty dozen of rugged Viking warriors, and a mysterious tribe of cannibalistic pagans clad in bear skins who devastate a helpless Scandinavian village resembles ""The Magnificent Seven""plus sixcrossed with ""Conan the Barbarian."" Derived from producer Michael Crichton's grisly novel ""Eaters of the Dead,"" ""The Thirteen Warrior"" emerges as a larger-than-life epic that should enthrall guys.When he wrote ""Eaters of the Dead"" in 1976, bestselling ""Jurassic Park"" novelist Michael Crichton obviously had ""Beowulf"" on his brain. ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" deconstructs the legend that most college freshmen have to suffer through in English Literature. If you recall, Beowulf was a famous Scandinavian warrior who responded to King Hrothgar's summons to slay the flesh-munching monster Grendel. After dispatching the vicious brute, Beowulf invaded Grendel's cave and butchered his beastly mom. In Crichton's spin on this saga, a savage horde of headhunters, who masquerade as demonic beasts and attack without mercy under the cover of darkness, have replaced Grendel. Like his literary counterpart, Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich of ""Red Scorpion 2"") wins his reputation by spearheading a search and destroy mission behind enemy lines to axe the female chieftain.""The Thirteenth Warrior"" takes place in the 10th century. As Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, Banderas portrays a well-bred Persian noble exiled from the medieval court at Baghdad for sexual indiscretions with the Caliph's wife. Ibn wanders the earth now as an emissary with his faithful manservant Melchisidek (Omar Sharif of ""The Burglars""), who acts as his translator. At a river crossing in Russia, they meet a rough-riding band of Viking marauders. Commemorating the death of their former leader, these stout-hearted Norsemen celebrate the promotion of Buliwyf as their leader.A weary messenger from King Hrothgar (Sven Wollter) stumbles into their camp with news about 'a terror that must not be named' that has besieged his kingdom. Buliwyf consults a soothsayer. Although he has assembled twelve of his best fighters, the old crone warns him that the thirteenth warrior must be 'one who is not from the North.' Before Melchisidek can translate the oracle's words, Ibn realizes that he has been conscripted. At first, the Vikings scorn Ibn, so some of the suspense is lost, while Banderas' narration covers those points not immediately obvious to audiences.The William Wisher & Warren Lewis screenplay keeps us in the dark about the cannibals. Indeed, in their refusal to unmask the villains, they cheat us out of the satisfaction of knowing exactly who these predators are. Instead, the filmmakers confer more artistic ambiguity on this medieval swashbuckler than it needs to measure up to its formulaic promise. Evilin a senselooms as something greater than any man-made incarnation.""The Thirteen Warrior"" is a visual feast. ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" lenser Peter Menzies shoots these brigands through gauzy filters so they look like titans. Horror movies usually delay unveiling the monsters in much the same way that McTiernan waits until the final quarter hour to expose the cannibals. The sequence where Buliwyf, Ibn and the Norsemen infiltrate the enemy lair and storm through a maze of caves to kill the female chieftain is in the same league with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" The free-for-all excitement that Menzies' fast-moving cameras impart enhances the atmosphere and suspense.Director John McTiernan helms this movie with a heavy hand. Alternating stunning battlefield footage with straightforward expository scenes about the characters and their enemy, he sacrifices anything approaching romance. Doom hangs palpably over ""The Thirteenth Warrior,"" so moments of frivolity are ephemeral. Clearly outnumbered by hundreds of cannibals, the Vikings and Ibn feel as if they are living on borrowed time. Indeed, with broadswords shrieking through the air and decapitated heads flying off amid spurts of blood, McTiernan stages the combat without the same gladiatorial verse that Mel Gibson brought to ""Braveheart."" Aside from Banderas, the cast consists of little-known and unknown thespians whose characters are also eminently expendable. The Scandinavian cast rises to the occasion as the battle-hardened, suicidal Vikings. Second-billed actress Diane Venora as Queen Weilew utters a couple of lines. Venora's role appears to have been pruned along with the court intrigue, which is only hinted at in a scene where a Viking challenges one of Hrothgar's champions.Sometimes, ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" seems almost too glum for its own good. While McTiernan and his scenarists exploit the cultural differences between Ibn and the Vikings for the bulk of the humor, this blood-drenched saga focuses more often on high-octane action than subtle nuances. The Viking hygiene scene is hilarious, but the humor is far too intermittent. The breathtaking scenery and the impressive battle scenes overshadow the clichés. Your breath will catch in your throat when our heroes confront the cannibals on a rain swept battlefield for the final engagement. Veteran film composer Jerry Goldsmith of ""Breakheart Pass"" pumps up the action with another of his booming Wagnerian orchestral scores.If those hordes of dubbed spear & sandal epics that the Italians produced in the early 1960s appealed to you, ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" qualifies as your kind of movie!",The 13th Warrior
11,Boba_Fett1138,Lacking movie...,5,20 March 2005,"This movie is seriously lacking. With a story like this you would expect something way better than this pretty messy movie.Especially from a director like John McTiernan you would expect something way better. The movie however is seriously lacking tension while the story itself on its own is pretty tense and mysterious. With ""Predator"" McTiernan showed that he could mix hard-action with science-fiction. Then why can't he mix adventure with action? The characters are heavily underdeveloped and I seriously can't tell who is who in this. Antonio Banderas however is good and believable as the anti-hero this time.The sword fights are also somewhat disappointing. The movie is just way too dark and you can't really tell what is happening the whole time. Also the fights are pretty short themselves. There however are some good gory scene's. A normal functional male while still find some pleasure in watching this movie.Also the pace feels just completely wrong at times and the story never really becomes completely clear. The story itself reminded me also a bit too much of other stories and movies like ""The Magnificent Seven"". Yes, they could have really called this movie ""The Magnificent Thirtheen"".McTiernan really messed this movie up.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The 13th Warrior
12,view_and_review,Beats Me,5,16 December 2020,"If you want to watch this simply for the medieval epic battles with swords flailing, arrows flying, slow-mo kills, yelling, and blood, then have at it. If that's all a movie is to be rated upon, then this movie is a ten. If you want the whos, whys, and whats, then this movie is severely lacking there.I can't begin to say what the plot of this is other than an Arab named Ahmad bin Fahlan (Antonio Banderas) was thrust into an army of twelve warriors where he made the 13th. Their enemy? A foreign army of men akin to Native Americans. Who they were fighting for? I don't know. Between the interspersed foreign languages and the thick accents I couldn't gather anyone's name or their cause. It was all very confusing. What I gathered was that the Muslim Arab had something he could learn from the pagan white men, and the pagan white men had something they could learn from the Muslim Arab.",The 13th Warrior
13,anaconda-40658,13th Warrior and They Still Haven't Done This Right.,2,3 September 2015,"The 13th Warrior (1999): Dir: John McTiernan / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Omar Sharif, Vladimir Kulich, Clive Russell: Savage blood bath of fear as cannibals behead victims in all its gory detail. It doesn't make one bit of difference what number Antonio Banderas is. We know he is suppose to fight off these cannibals and basically kicked their asses. These warriors come across a village that live in fear of cannibals known as the Eaters of the Dead. They attack when the mist is out and take the heads of the victims. The warriors realize that they may have to seek out the cave of the enemy. Predictable, repetitious and extremely graphic. The visual elements succeed and director John McTiernan provides tension. This would seem fitting material for him, having previously made Predator. Both films are similar in that faceless warriors are killed by a nearly unseen force, and it boils down to one person to make the difference. Banderas labors under flat material. He never emerges as a personality. He fears, trains then goes out and fights. During this retaliation more warriors are slain in graphic detail. Diane Venora, Vladimir Kulich and Omar Sharif are wasted in cardboard appearances. This film is so relentlessly graphic that it is about as much fun as witnessing a live birth.

15,Wuchakk,Good Viking Adventure -- Could've Been Great,6,11 March 2014,"The story of ""The 13th Warrior"" (1999) comes from Michael Crichton's novel ""The Eaters of the Dead"" which combines the legend of Beowulf with a historical account of an Arab diplomat who meets and dwells with the Vikings after being banished from his homeland due to an adulterous liaison.Antonio Banderas stars as the Arab while the hulking Vladimir Kulich heads the Viking cast in the Beowulf role of Buliwyf (pronounced in the film BULL-vie). Speaking of Kulich, he would've made for an excellent Mighty Thor back in the day!The plot of the film is great: Once Banderas meets up with the Vikings, they run afoul of a mysterious brutal tribe from the deep woods. Banderas is selected as the lone non-Viking to assist the 12 Norsemen in ridding the communities of the threat, hence ""the 13th warrior."" The cast, characters, story, locations (Campbell River, Vancouver Island), sets, costumes, score (Jerry Goldsmith), and cinematography are all of the highest order.At a little over an hour and a half the film moves along briskly with a lot of action. Make no mistake, ""The 13th Warrior"" is a Class A film, but some story elements seem to be underdeveloped. This is probably due to the conflict Michael Crichton had with director John McTiernan. Crichton insisted on reshoots and cut at least 30 minutes of McTiernan's work, reportedly important character-developing scenes.We see this in the very prologue of the film: The story of Banderas' banishment from his homeland due to his indiscretions is literally relayed in a matter of a couple minutes. And at the 8 minute mark we are introduced to the Vikings with very little mystery and zero suspense build-up. The contrast of the sophisticated Arab culture with the coarse, rugged Norsemen is great, but I would have enjoyed seeing these characters fleshed-out a bit more. After all, the more we know the individuals, the more we care about what ultimately happens to them.Which brings us to the final 30 minutes of the film involving Banderas and the Vikings infiltrating the malevolent tribe's stronghold and a final attack on a Viking village. The visuals of these scenes are awe-inspiring but they fly by so quickly that the viewer is left disoriented and strangely uninvolved, not to mention unmoved by the story's outcome.All this reveals that ""The 13th Warrior"" COULD have been an outstanding 140-minute Viking epic, along the lines of ""Troy"" (2004); instead we are left with a brisk, action-oriented, near-throwaway Viking popcorn flick. I would love to see a Director's Cut some day but Vladimir Kulich opines that it will unfortunately never happen.Nonetheless, I appreciate the film as is. It's a good Viking adventure flick that's professionally done, despite the post-production problems. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing, probably because everything flies by so quickly on initial plays.Despite it's flaws, ""The 13th Warrior"" isn't too far from rivaling Kirk Douglas' brilliant 1958 ""The Vikings"" as one of the greatest Viking films ever made. A Director's Cut could possibly even topple ""The Vikings"" from its lofty, coveted perch.The film was shot in British Columbia: Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Williams Lake and Pemberton, British Columbia.GRADE: B-/B.",The 13th Warrior

There's much fun to be had watching authentic warriors slay the predators, and the film etches itself into your brain with a supremely heartfelt and triumphant ending. 7.5/10",The 13th Warrior
17,=G=,"Poor man's ""Braveheart""",6,28 December 2001,"Banderas plays the 13th warrior in this clumsy adventure flick about a bunch of badass Vikings who duke it out with the mysterious Wendol....yeah, right. The story is ill-conceived and poorly laid out with some dialogue shuffling in the beginning to get everyone speaking the same language. Fight sequences are tightly shot and poorly staged and overall the film is lackluster.  No sex or nudity...just a lot of blood & guts. Nonetheless, there is a certain masculine charm about the devil-may-care way the Vikings live to die which makes this worth watching if you need something to go with your popcorn.
Footnote: I was surprised by the number of user comments for this flick on IMDB.com. Prior to Tivo'ing it, I'd never heard of the movie and assumed it was one of those low budget losers.

18,851222,John McTiernan's Last Great Flick,9,20 September 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The 13th Warrior"" (1999) was always one of my favorite movies of John McTiernan. Maybe that's because i've seen this movie when i was 15- 16 years old, and i saw it like 5 or 6 times, yes, loved this film at the time. What still strikes me the most is how superbly atmospheric this movie was. Set design was superb, you can clearly see many objects build specifically, and they weren't just cheap sets. Actors were all superb and did a great job for this material, only wished to see late Omar Sharif more on screen. This movie plays like a adventure movie (in the beginning), later it becomes like ""Predator"" and at the some sort of ""Siege"" movie. All genres clicked in here, thus creating this superbly involving and brutal world.Overall, ""The 13th Warrior"" was the last great flick of the great John McTiernan, who's carrier after this movie basically went into oblivion (but not because of this movie). Shame. Having this skill of creating superbly involving, intense and plausible looking entertaining movies, he should definitely would be still very helpful around. ""The 13th Warrior"" is the proof.",The 13th Warrior

20,johnnyboyz,Rambo with swords and shields but even that is too much of a compliment.,4,22 January 2008,"When adventure films are good, that usually means they are fun. Indiana Jones and The Mummy are good examples of adventure films from recent times that have withstood the short test of contemporary time. Action films cannot help but impose upon additions to the genre; but when you see a bad adventure film, you know it's bad when the narrative is dull and routine; when the action scenes are short and unspectacular and when certain events that occur happen because the genre demands they happen, rather than because the film is trying something new and original.In The Mummy, from the same year; there were these ancient Egyptian beetles that were reminiscent of piranhas only they weren't constricted to water; in the Indiana Jones films, we were given good, constructive bad guys who we enjoyed seeing get pummelled and beaten by the hero; we like the special effects in both films, the characters and the beauty of the locales. In The 13th Warrior, surely the now obvious 'beginning of the end' for director John McTiernan, we are given grubby looking cinematography set amongst a backdrop of boring and uninspiring settings; we are presented with action scenes so dull and unimpressive we actually feel cheated; we are presented with some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters ever committed to an action film and we are insulted with a narrative so plain and so uninteresting that to even repeat it would waste time and insult intelligence.That is to say the actual narrative for The 13th Warrior is just bland and routine. Antonio Banderas plays an Arab with a Spanish accent among a group of Vikings who are portrayed in an equally insulting light. Banderas' character's name is even so long and such a mouthful that it too could be seen as insulting toward the typical Arabic name, in fact it's so long one could assume the writers were playing for laughs more than anything else. Action heroes need a short and sharp name, something cool and sharp to reflect their persona: Han Solo, James Bond, Indiana Jones; hell, even Rick O'Donnell would do but we are given ""Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad""? It's no wonder the Vikings laugh at him as we are doing the same. After a very young boy travels the length and breath of the land (the length it takes to learn a new language), seemingly on his own, to deliver a mere message that they are under attack from 'monsters', twelve Vikings take it upon themselves to travel and help out but with one catch: the 13th warrior must be foreign. If you can get past the fact this little ancient 'rule' still seems like a necessity to be included in a time of crisis, then you might miss how very handy it is that Ahmed was even there; otherwise who else was going to go? Omar Sharif's character? I'd like to have seen that.Ahmed goes on a journey with these Vikings whom are portrayed as big, disgusting troll like people who wash themselves in each others spit and happily kill one another over the last piece of drumstick at meal times. Likewise, the Arabs seem to have a certain class; a certain sort of swagger that can only be put down to Hispanic Banderas' good looks and Spanish elegance. In the film, Banderas has another opportunity to swish and sway enemies with his sword, just as he did in The Mask of Zorro a mere twelve months earlier. But this time, there is no class nor is there the feeling of adventure or excitement; unlike that film, The 13th Warrior heads nowhere bar an abyss of horrible action set pieces and boring logic. The 'monsters' of the piece turn out to be nothing more than bears with swords and shields, how dull and that's when we're supposed to truly believe that they're monsters. What Banderas discovers that no one else for the hundreds of years that they've been attacking the Viking villages is that these monsters are actually men, black men; in costume. Yes, racism starts to run a little thick and a little fast here. Boring, faceless, seemingly voodoo obsessed black people who are able to not only control the weather but live in an underground system of caves and such, during which they can survive and develop utopias of rope bridges and democratic systems that govern who are the fighters and who are the leaders: they are like human ants who every now and again, like to pop up to the surface and start a bit of bother. Their 'kind' have been doing this for centuries, might I add.And then the genre movie kicks in. The Vikings and Ahmed lie in a circle as the monsters approach but nobody decided to give Ahmed any training with the Viking sword that he clearly cannot use but that's only established AFTER the first fight scene. He says so himself he is no warrior but he drops a few of these monsters no problem. The fights are frequent, dark and unintelligible when they're at their most mediocre. The film descends into a Warcraft style narrative when the characters have to visit some crazy old woman who speaks more sense than she looks like she's able to: ""Kill the leader!"" she exclaims. Yup, that might work. After seeing off hoards of the monsters who were armed with torches and swords and whom could so easily have taken the allied camp in one swoop if they really tried to, the Vikings and Ahmed make a counteroffensive into the lair; something nobody thought of in centuries gone by. A final word on the closing battle scene: absolute crap. A three minute montage of swishing swords and funny faces in slow motion and it's over, as is very briefly after the immediate ending, the audience's will to live.",The 13th Warrior
21,filipemanuelneto,"A good movie, damaged by a mediocre script",4,22 November 2016,"This movie is a bit contradictory to me. It's a movie worth seeing if we just want pure entertainment, but it does not have enough quality for us to think of it as a really good movie. The action centers on the participation of an Arab ambassador in a Nordic military expedition, sent to protect an isolated village that was being attacked by some sort of evil creature. And the weaknesses of the plot begin to appear before us: what would motivate an Arab sultan to want to maintain diplomatic ties with the tribal peoples of Northern Europe? They could never help in case of war because they are too far away, and commercial relations were impracticable at that time because of the enormous distance between them. It seems the idea did not come from the script, but from a novel in which the film is based, but it does not matter. It's still hard to swallow. Another point that drew my attention in the negative is the portrayal of the Norse as an illiterate people who needed an Arab to write their own story. The writer certainly forgot that the Norse are the inventors of a particularly well known writing system, the runic alphabet. Even for an age where teaching was rare, it is believable that Beowulf, as a prince, had at least some notions about this writing system, thus not needing a foreigner to ""draw sounds"" for him.The strong point of the film is the combat scenes. They were thought out in detail and deserved the attention of the technical team. The idea of ​​""bearsmen"" is also good, but it is difficult for me to believe that the Norse, warlike as they prove to be, believed in that story of the creature of fire. There is a huge contradiction latent in that: if the Norse are bellicose and bragging, why would they flee from an army with torches thinking it is a hellish serpent? In the first attack it is quite evident that they are men, not frightening creatures out of our worst nightmares. There's no sense in really believing that.António Banderas is literally the man of the movie. He appears, he shines, he makes a good participation. Omar Shariff also deserves an honorable mention for his fleeting appearance. He's an old-timer, with excellent diction and he is perfectly at ease in the role. The sets and costumes are good, they make the audience feel truly Northern Europe and the Viking environment. It's a shame that the script has not been reviewed and improved, as this would have made this film substantially more positive.",The 13th Warrior

24,southdavid,Lucky for some.,6,9 March 2021,"Another film that jumped into my list with the arrival of Disney Plus' ""star"" channel. ""The 13th Warrior"" is a film that though starting to show it's age a bit, was reasonably entertaining despite it's troubled production.Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is an envoy of the Byzantine empire, sent North by his King. He falls in with a group of Viking warriors, led by Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich). Buliwyf and his men are requested to head home, to defend a village from a supernatural enemy but before they leave their seer tells them they must be 13 Warriors in order to succeed and that Ahmed must be part of their group. They bond over travel and as language barriers are overcome, but they are not prepared for the threat they will face.Based on Michael Crichton's novel, which apparently is loosely based on Beowulf, the test screenings were apparently so bad that reshoots were ordered and Crichton himself was allowed to make changes. The only place I feel you can really experience that is in the ending, which I felt was rather anticlimactical, so who knows how bad McTiernan's ending must have been. Up until that point, I thought the film was pretty solid. The battle scenes were fine and somewhat gory, the reveal of the story and what the Northmen were actually up against was well done. There are some subplots that I supposed were hangovers from the original version, which revolve around the leadership of the kingdom going forward and the present King's son, who just disappears once he suffers a setback, I assumed he was going to betray his village somehow, but he just leaves.I liked Banderas and in particular his relationship with Herger, played by Dennis Storhoi. I also enjoyed seeing Tony Curran and Clive Russell as two more of the Viking 13. It's the sort of action set piece film that appears now to have been totally relegated to ""straight to DVD"" hell as producing them has become cheaper over the years but up until it's underwhelming ending, it's alright.",The 13th Warrior
25,FiendishDramaturgy,Occasionally gritty but boring throughout,2,22 January 2005,"This is one of over-compensating attempts which tries so very hard, and goes over the top. It so wanted to be a blockbuster ticket-seller, but in its attempt, it really just left the audience feeling deflated, as if all the life had been sucked out of you just for having watched this long, boring mess.Now don't get me wrong, there is adequate grit and gore, but those moments are all too fleeting, as Banderas drones on ... and on in an almost hypnotizing way, which succeeds not where intended but in settling the audience into a nice, peaceful slumber.You notice right away that something does not set right. Banderas' narrative commences, and while you realize he is speaking in a normal pace, you also realize there is something missing, as you're suddenly in the thick of things, and are not sure how you got there.The story is therefore weak and forgettable. Let's face it, if a story has no rhythm, it grows boring. The second half of this work (the Norse half, we'll call it) was actually interesting. I wouldn't mind seeing a ~real~ movie surrounding this subject matter. But this just wasn't it. I must honestly say that this is John McTiernan's most useless attempt.It doesn't really even rate a rating, but since I must, I'll give it a 2/10 from...the Fiend :.",The 13th Warrior
26,elshikh4,"It's not (The 13th Warrior), rather (Dozen of Warriors.. And Their Sidekick) !",5,14 January 2008,"The title's character (Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan) was nobody, but that naive inexperienced young man would be educated by a bunch of warriors whatever he needed to understand all about the real warrior's nature who makes his own luck, regarding that he was a runner from a battle at his country (actually it was the hunt of his lover's parents). Hence, we had a boy who was in his journey to be a man. So what were our problems with this very journey exactly?!How in God's name Mr. (Ibn Fahdlan) did manage to learn the language of those warriors that easily, and only by observing them for a very short time?! It's not genius inasmuch as a miracle, or supernatural power. So instead of this kind of capacities, which even superman himself doesn't have, it was simple to make him know their language from the start!The love story of (Ibn Fahdlan) during the journey was done so hastily, with no solid anything, to not be good or bad love story; it wasn't one in the first place! It was a meaningless thing, like they put it just to assure that (Ibn Fahdlan) was not gay or something. But I got really angry when I saw once some photos having (Banderas) and (Maria Bonnevie) in some unseen scenes. So the love story was there, but they got to delete it. Maybe there were problems between (Bonnevie) and the production company, or maybe they deleted them for some shortening.(Omar Sharif)?!! On the poster in Egypt, we had his name right after (Banderas), with no more names. I don't know about the posters in other countries, but I must tell you: that was so provocative, since (Sharif) had such a tasteless role, with no special value. Ok, so he was here just as the guest star, however without any echo unless his popularity at the middle east, so the intelligence of using him, specifically his name, was for the commercial profits at certain nations. By the way, his character's name was (Melchisidek), as I dare anyone to remember it with the too short appearance!The hot ultimate rally by strong zoom-ins, stirring soundtrack, and fervent performance for the climax's hard battle of a few good men against a huge army of hungry cannibals finally cracked like an empty balloon! It was the silliest joke, the dullest scene, and the coup de grace for any action to end it by these idiot snap shots. It looked like a 75% of an ad about a detergent which would clean all of those combatants afterwards plainly and quickly. In one word, this battle was a loser!The movie was ruled by so tepid spirit all along, from the treatment of the story, to the lazy sequences of the lousy ending. And at last, you would feel that the real hero wasn't anyone but (Vladimir Kulich) as (Buliwyf), or (Beowulf)!, who was the proficient mentor, the one with the most powerful personality, and the one with the most effective scenes too. He was more respectable than (Banderas)'s character which I didn't notice well its transmutation into an actual hero, let alone the languid performance from (Banderas) as well. So, eventually, it could be named (Dozen of Warriors.. And Their Sidekick)!Undoubtedly, 1 thing here was perfect: the atmospheric and enthusiastic music of (Jerry Goldsmith), albeit it's not one of his best!So, do you want to know what was the real calamity of this movie? I'll tell you; it's the abbreviation. The abbreviation of how the title character knew the warriors language, loved the girl, became a hero, won a big fight against cannibals. And I just can't decide who's to blame: director (John McTiernan), the 2 scriptwriters (William Wisher) & (Warren Lewis), (Michael Crichton) who redirected some scenes, as I read, or the production company which maybe edited this movie destructively?At any rate, this is not ""An Extraordinary Journey"" as the deceiving tagline says.

In this incredible epic, as narrated by the exiled lover of princess Shaharazad, the storyteller, an Arab poet, is appointed ambassador to the Nomads in the far-away Barbar country. On route, he is accepted as the thirteen warrior and invited to join a group of adventurous Vikings who are requested to return to the mother country to defend the villagers against a monstrous flesh eating peoples called the Wendol. (Also known as the Vendall or Cannibals) In the process, the fearless Vikings learn as much about the courageous Arab as he learns about them, their language, customs and their military skills. Antonio Banderas, plays Ahmed Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad and is convincing as the curious, but knowledgeable Arabian envoy. Vladimir Kulich, plays Buliwyf, The 1st Warrior and is capable and extremely formidable in his chieftain's role. With Dennis Storhøi as Herger the Joyous and Daniel Southern as Edgtho the Silent, the group encounter the Vandall, their leader and their mother. Although they fight to protect the Viking people, they in-turn risk their very lives against hoards of bear-face savages, who use both Witchcraft and horn blaring attacks. With nail biting action and mysterious drama, the film proves exciting and memorable. A great film for Banderas' fans. ****",The 13th Warrior
28,kevin_robbins,I have always felt this was a fairly underrated must see movie,9,6 November 2021,"The 13th Warrior (1999) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a noble man who falls in love with the wrong woman and is sent to another kingdom on assignment. On his way he encounters some norsemen who are on adventure. The norsemen get bad news on day of their homeland under siege by legendary creatures from the mountains. They ask the gods for direction and they are directed to send 13 men home to defend their lands and kill the invaders. Unfortunately for the nobleman, he's selected as the 13th warrior to go with the norsemen. This movie is directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard) and stars Antonio Banderas (Desperado), Richard Bremmer (Harry Potter), Tony Curran (Thor), Erick Avari (The Mummy) and Dennis Storhøi (Nobel). The storyline for this has so much depth and twists and turns. The depiction of the two very different types of people is well presented and executed. The lands, settings and backdrops for this movie are so beautiful and captured with wonderful cinematography. The action scenes are excellent - every fight, kill and battle is intense and unpredictable. The monsters and their mystery is well executed and you can't wait to find out what's going on and if they have any hope as an audience. The cast is very well selected and the acting hits the mark. The dialogue is also very good with a nice infusion of humor. Overall I have always felt this was a fairly underrated must see movie.

Be still my heart!,7,5 March 2000,"A group of twelve gruntin', scratchin', wandering Vikings is called back to its home by a child oracle to fight a deadly band of attackers. The oracle states, however, that there should also be a 13th warrior, one who is not from the north country. Enter Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas), an Arab who's just passing through and is already disgusted by the slovenly habits of the Vikings. So off goes the troupe. They're attacked a few times along the way, in the middle of the night as the fog rolls in (eerie!), and are stunned to find no casualties of their attackers, even though several were killed during each skirmish. Hmm! Turns out these are flesh-eaters, always part of myth but never seen even in those times. You know, one of those stories that's been handed down from generation to generation, but it's been so long since anyone who witnessed the stories firsthand was alive that the tales are more fiction than fact. Well, now our boys know what they're up against, but it takes them the entire movie to really get things going. For once, Banderas is not the hero, not the swashbuckler of ""The Mask of Zorro"" or the gunslinger of ""Desperado."" The Vikings are the tough guys, and at first they patronize the outsider who doesn't speak their language. But soon he does, and soon he's one of the gang. Here's to male bonding!The plusses of this movie are its cinematography and atmosphere (even my TV set smelled a little murky) and solid action performances by a fine (and international) cast. Downside: there ARE some subtitles, especially at the beginning when the Vikings speak Nordic and Banderas stands, uncomprehending. I guess it's for his benefit as much as for our benefit that those subtitles are there, because he eventually learns the language simply by listening to them.

According to Wikipedia, it's the biggest box office bomb in history. Quite a pedigree, eh? But here's the thing. It's a really good movie.Featuring a classic stranger in a strange land formula and moving without any wasted motion--without sacrificing story or character, 'The 13th Warrior' is a rousing, old fashioned adventure tale. Antonio Banderas leads a cast of mostly unknowns, but everyone really makes the most out of their characters; particularly the 13 warriors themselves.

On this journey, he stops at a Viking village and learns that a nearby kingdom is being terrorised (after the son of the King visits the village and asks their leader Bullwyf - Vladimir Kulich for help). Bullwyf and his associates agree to help the little boy and Fahdian is randomly selected as the 13th warrior and helps both Bullwyf and the boy's family to defend their kingdom...I've actually just re-read my summary for the film and deduced that it doesn't make much sense, but to my recollection that is exactly how the story is established so I can only apologise and reiterate things exactly how I saw them...Part of the problem with this film lies with its vague narrative; Fahdian is conscripted as the 13th warrior because the 13th warrior must not be from a Norse or Northern background. Oh how convenient? Of all the villages, in all the tents in all the world you just happened to walk in to mine... Quite why the 13th warrior cannot be a Norse warrior is anyone's guess - maybe it's explained in Crichton's novel, but hell it's certainly never explained in the film. I also found it strange that Fahdian seemed to be able to understand the Norse people's language and his explanation for understanding them is because he 'listened' - what that's it?? I've listened to people speak in other languages, but I'm still struggling with English so this makes no logical sense. OK, so the script has some ropy elements to it, but I was encouraged when I saw McTiernan's name on the open credits and felt sure that I would bear witness to some top quality direction... Nope the directing that I witnessed was actually very average; there were nowhere near enough action sequences, an unnecessary and unbearably long and dull set-up. The film is also way too serious and the fantasy/sorcery element was overdone and not particularly interesting.To be fair, the 13th Warrior isn't a total waste of time; there are a few decent action sequences (where McTiernan seems to have remembered some of what he was capable of with Predator and Die Hard) and the story is serviceable and moves along at an OK rate - at times it does have an old-fashioned adventure feel which always ensures that it's watchable.However, like I've said considering that this is the brainchild of talented people like Michael Crichton and John McTiernan it's hard not to feel a bit disappointed in this rather wishy-washy action adventure film - particularly knowing how great their films have been individually prior to this rather average collaboration.",The 13th Warrior

I can easily understand how people unfamiliar with these subjects were just lost and confused, feeling not helped by choppy editing where even important side characters just disappear without a trace!I love it! Banderas is great balancing charm and humor in equal measure. Vladimir Kulich is spot on as the Viking leader Buliwyf.

Antonio Banderas plays the hero, an 11th century Arab poet who finds himself in very strange surroundings indeed.He becomes the 13th member of a Norse expedition as they travel to the frozen north, intending to rid their homeland of its fierce enemies. Some very nasty tribesmen have been slaying the villagers and ripping away their heads, leaving people in fear and communities in ruin. The 13 Norse warriors are the only hope that people have of regaining their lives.Jerry Goldsmith's music is rousing throughout, especially during the battle scenes. Banderas gives a good performance as the bewildered hero, fighting for a cause about which he doesn't really understand. The action is filmed well, with brutal battles and narrow escapes shot in convincingly bloodthirsty detail. However, the characterisation is sketchy, with few of the warriors developed in a particularly meaningful way. Also, the occasional attempts to get a romantic storyline going are terribly weak, almost as if much of the footage was left on the cutting room floor. This film never fulfils its potential.

34,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Gorgeous Viking flick,8,20 January 2016,"I feel like John Mctiernan's The 13th Warrior doesn't deserve the bum rap it's acquired over the years. Sure it was a flop, sure it has a few clunky parts near the beginning, but for the most part it's a visceral, rousing Nordic adventure flick that's guaranteed entertainment all the way, unless you're a wretched nitpicker. On the list of films about Viking warriors fighting some kind of barbaric enemy against gorgeously shot landscapes (that are all British Columbia no less!) it comes out a winner. Antonio Banderas plays an Arabian (yeah, yeah he's a Spaniard, deal with it) poet with an utterly unpronounceable name who is banished to explore new lands with a companion (Omar Sharif in an all too brief cameo) and attain knowledge from other people. He takes up with a rowdy Viking band, led by the kingly Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich), who are summoned to their distant homeland to contend with a vicious threat that is attacking their villages. It being their custom to bring along one warrior who is not of their kind, they bring Banderas with them and venture home. The cinematography in their land is breathtaking, as Mctiernan uses a smoke machine in overdrive to give the hills, trees and meadows an ancient, ethereal look. They discover the menace that looms over their land is a primitive tribe of savages, and engage in spectacular battle against them. There's several sequences that shine in particular and will give your TV a workout, including a blood spattered, hazy opening battle and a wicked siege in a subterranean cave. Banderas always makes a stalwart protagonist, whether he's brash and cocky (The Mask Of Zorro) or moody and stoic (Desperado). Here he brings a wonderful naivety that's very unlike him, and uses the eventual horror and ghostly events of his character's journey to burnish his arc nicely to a point where his eventual combat scenes feel earned, having both weight and consequence. The Viking tribesman are all played with blue eyed ferocity by a tireless troupe, with especially fine work from Dennis Storhøi as Joyous, an incredibly brave warrior who Banderas finds a relatable kinship with. The years have somewhat buried the memory of this one, but it still stands as a stirring action epic with photography that is kind to the eye, combat scenes that lay the hammer down considerably in the violence department, and a story that vaguely mirrors the timeless Beowulf while adding its own dash of bloody adventure.",The 13th Warrior
35,drystyx,not a sit down and watch movie,6,6 September 2008,"This movie is an adventure tale involving an Arab who joins 12 Vikings on a sort of ""mythic quest"", to which they believe there will be a logical reason. The characters are not overly believable, but not overly trite, either. The Arab comes across the most believable. They belief in logic, and the modernism of morality doesn't really fit into the middle age world and mentality. You would think they had all read the philosophers and writers of the nineteenth and twentieth century. The movie tries to be a thought provoking piece, a mystery, and an adventure all rolled into one. Where it fails to completely enthrall us is in the super slow pace to which the mystery is even brought up. As a result, it just drones on, without any real interest. It has some nice scenes, and fits in well with modern cinema which is based on having a few ""cinematic"" moments, and a few tough lines. It could be the ""Pulp Fiction"" of the Middle Ages. But it just isn't a film a person can sit down, watch, and enjoy. It neither captivates the spirit of adventure, or the spirit of atmospheric Mystery. But it still has some bright spots.",The 13th Warrior
36,davidmvining,Separation of main character and protagonist,5,25 May 2020,"You can separate your main character and you protagonist, but it's hard to do well. The 13th Warrior attempts it, but I don't think it's really all that successful. There's a technical polish to the film, especially in isolated sequences, and obvious talent behind the camera, but the story is surprisingly disengaging.The problems are obvious from the beginning with an introduction that hops and skips from Baghdad through a long land journey northwards to Viking territory, an attack on the road, a brief introduction to the Vikings, the introduction of the foreign threat they must face, and the absorption of the main character, Ahmad, into the group as the titular thirteen warrior. It's most jarring when the old crone announces to the surrounding tribe that the thirteenth is foreign (Ahmad being the only foreign man of fighting age there) and then there's a hard cut to him packing up his horse to go along with them. He's never given a moment to question the request or even consider it. He's just automatically part of it.The next major emotional hurdle comes when the group of thirteen warriors makes it across the water to find Hrothgar and his hall. There's no attempt to get to know the villagers cowering in fear of the Wendol terrorizing them. Instead we get some vague palace intrigue that culminates in a fight between one minor character and another person who never rises to the state of character that ultimately makes no difference to the story. Ahmad does get some intimate time with a young, attractive woman of the village, but it couldn't possibly leave an impression because she's in and out with little introduction.The movie works best when the action moves towards the quiet inspection of the clues in pursuit of the Wendol, the mass of bear men that descend on the village, killing as they will and taking the bodies of the slain to eat (this was based on Eaters of the Dead, of course). There's a scene where Ahmad and the other twelve find a ransacked farm, and the camera quietly moves through the farm to follow Ahmad as he walks in and out. It's a quietly effective scene.Action in general is dark but assured, but there's a curious distance to most of it because so few of the thirteen warriors make an impression. There's Ahmad, his friend Herger, and the leader Buliwyf who make a real impression, the rest just feel like background noise, and as the action scenes play out more and more of the background warriors get chopped away, feeling like little is being lost.Now, to talk about the difference between the main character and the protagonist. Ahmad is the main character, but Buliwyf is the protagonist. It's Buliwyf who makes the decisions that drive the gang from one place to the next. It's him who makes the large strategic decisions. It's him that the final battle ends up revolving around emotionally, and yet, we don't really follow him. We're with Ahmad all the way, playing as follower to those around him. That moment early when he suddenly joins the other twelve is a prime example. He exhibits no agency on his own. The rest of the twelve affirm their desires to go on the journey, but Ahmad just appears in line. His efforts to fit in range from rather ingenious (John McTiernan has a thing for intelligently demonstrating the transition of languages) to amusing, but the amusing bits aren't what drives the film, they end up feeling like distractions.A final note: There are serious questions about the film's authorship. By everything I've read, John McTiernan, the director, and Michael Crichton, the writer/producer, clashed extensively on set. After a disastrous test screening, McTiernan did not come back to the project (apparently off working on The Thomas Crown Affair that ended up releasing before The 13th Warrior), instead Crichton directed the rather extensive reshoots. So, who's film is this? McTiernan is listed as director, but it's an obviously compromised production with two authorial hands at play.I'm rather mixed on this film. From a purely technical perspective, there's a good bit worthwhile, but there's also a problem in terms of emotional disconnect based on some narrative choices that don't really work. The adaptation of Eaters of the Dead (which is, in turn, a rather clever take on Beowulf) could have been more engaging and entertaining than it is. It's far from a disaster, but also far from a success.",The 13th Warrior
37,Spleen,A qualified success,8,4 February 2001,"I have two nice things to say.  Possibly more.(1)  I loved every minute of the Norse atmospherics.  We really get a sense of ... well, everything we're meant to get a sense of: damp greenness, a village barely clinging on to existence on the very edge of the civilised world, pure cold wilderness on every side, clear air, rustic grandeur, and an immense amount of wood.  Location shooting is rarely this good.  I gather we're looking at Canada rather than Scandinavia, but (a) who cares, it's the result that counts, and (b) it's obvious that a lot of work, and thought, and of course wood, went into the creation of the village: it might as well be the real thing.(2)  Only once or twice have I seen sheer physical courage so convincingly portrayed.  It's clear that each Viking is willing to risk his life - or, even more impressively, extreme pain - without hesitating for a moment, and without fear making a difference one way or the other; and this comes across as genuine bravery, rather than cartoon heroics.  It's not easy to make characters so remarkably brave without giving the impression that the laws of human motivation have been suspended, and that therefore they're not brave at all.  ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" certainly succeeds.(1) and (2) are reason enough to see the movie, and to prevent it, whatever flaws it may have, from being bad.  The story isn't bad, either.  (The most that can be said against it is that it's simple and unremarkable.)  Yet the film as a whole is less than a complete success.  I'm not sure why.  Others criticise the editing, and indeed it is a bit over-chopped, but much less so than, say, ""Gladiator"".  Maybe we don't get enough of a look at any one character.  The Arab would be an obvious one to sketch in greater detail.  I think the soft-focus, soft-light look of the opening scenes was a fairly serious mistake.  Remember, the story is told from the Arab's point of view; and Arabia is, so far as he is concerned, the MOST solid and detailed and real place in the universe.  It simply doesn't make sense to show us his homeland through a dreamlike haze.And I feel another serious mistake has been made in depicting the evil that threatens the Northern village.  When we find out more about it, it becomes far too science-fictiony; the wonderful flavour is lost.  This, rather than poor editing or under-characterisation, is what makes the conclusion less than satisfying.Still, this matters less than you might suppose, in the face of (1) and (2).",The 13th Warrior
38,ctomvelu1,Viking epic with a tinge of horror,8,4 February 2013,"An Arab outcast joins forces wit a group of Vikings to protect a faraway kingdom that is under siege by an army of flesh-eating, horse-riding nomads who appear to have swept out of some forgotten homeland, perhaps central Asia. This is the same basic plot as The Seven Samurai and it is put together very well. Great battle scenes, moody cinematography (the cannibals only attack in fog), and lots of lusty, laughing, larger than life Vikings right out of a 1950s Hollywood epic. No helmet horns, thank God! We are meant to identify with Banderas' Arab, a learned man who is also handy with a sword. Omar Shariff has a small role at the beginning. Why this film tanked, I do not know. Was it the odd title? Lack of promotion and marketing? One can only guess. It also has been compared plot-wise to ancient epics like Beowulf, and borrows from Greek mythology, as the head Viking must confront the cannibals' Medusa-like queen in her underground lair. She is frightening as all hell, and the confrontation scene may remind some of the confrontation scene between Perseus and Medusa in Ray Harryhausen's Clash of the Titans.",The 13th Warrior
39,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An tasteful action film with average writing,6,6 January 2014,"By the late 90s, Mr. Antonio Banderas had gained a name for himself. He was a foreign actor until Desperado (1995) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) had thrown him into the limelight. It almost seemed like he wouldn't ever produce a film where people wouldn't flock to go see. But as the saying goes, nothing lasts forever. Sadly, from what is now known, this movie is one of his biggest belly flops in his career. There's good reason to understand why.The story is about an Arab named Ahmed (Banderas) that is banished from his homeland to end up joining a group of Norsemen to fight a common enemy. That's it. The simplest of all plots. Loosely based on the epic poem Beowulf, many of the characters' names resemble the poems' counterparts. So for anyone who has read the story, some may have a better time figuring out what story arc will follow which character. It's an interesting parallel but it isn't special. Possibly one of the worst aspects of the film is the main antagonist. Reason being, there isn't a main antagonist.The common enemy is a tribe or clan of what come off as cannibalistic bear people. They have no rhyme, reason or motive to why they do what they do. The only dialog heard by them is yelling and chanting, that's it. There is a point where the warriors maneuver to kill the root of the clan but it is so weakly established that the it feels rushed to begin with. Also, the pacing is slow which makes it difficult for audiences to really feel like this is an adventure film. This is all understandable since this movie went through several reshoots and having a screenplay written by William Wisher Jr. I can't understand why his works for the last half of 90sdecade is mediocre. In 1991 he wrote for James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991). What happened?There are some good elements though. Antonio Banderas is a big one, although perhaps this is another reason why this movie didn't gather much attention. Antonio Banderas is cast into a film with a bunch of no name actors - is there a possibility of the movie performing well? Slim to none. Anyway, along with Banderas is Vladimir Kulich and Dennis Storhøi who also give the most memorable of performances in this movie. They both have their own charm - Kulich is like the early Chris Hemsworth before Thor (2011) and Storhøi is like a blond Johnny Depp with the same charisma. Those are the only two main characters besides Banderas that stood out to me.Credit should be given to Pat McCorkle for casting these actors though because a lot of Scandinavian actors were picked for these roles. As for action scenes go, when they finally do hit the screen, they are pretty exciting. The carnage and sword fights are always blood pumping which helps make the tense scenes that much more intense. Finally assisting these action scenes is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. It is the usual Goldsmith sound but it's still fun. Goldsmith even adds a bit of a middle-eastern theme into the music to cover Mr. Banderas' role. It's an OK watch but the story doesn't carry much water.For action film, the pace is slow and the plot is bone dry. However, the actors do give their characters charm, along with some decent battles and appropriate music.",The 13th Warrior
40,Sandcooler,Decent medieval brawl,8,17 August 2010,"Antonio Banderas plays an Arab in this movie, which isn't nearly as weird as I expected it to be. It's kind of a stretch to see him call one of his companions ""a pig-eating son of a whore"", but even that was sorta believable. As for the rest of the film, it's good without really being anything special. A bunch of angry Vikings try to defend their town, and figure the best way to do that is to get some help from Antonio Banderas. The battles look really nice, they're filled with an epic atmosphere and heroic imagery. Since most of the movie is made up from battles, it's pretty entertaining. One does wonder if it was really worth the massive budget (around 100 million, apparently) though, because it's not exactly film history that's written here. In fact, it's not even close to being the best movie in its genre. Still liked it though.",The 13th Warrior
41,philip_vanderveken,"Scandinavian myths and mysteries, brought in a very decent way.",7,6 April 2005,"I guess every region has its own legends and saga's, but I've always found the Scandinavian legends about trolls, monsters and ghosts even more intriguing and interesting as ours. It's no wonder that these people have created these legends once. If you've been there and if you've seen the impressive nature with its immense forests and lakes, the fact that the sun never rises in winter and stays 24 hours a day in summer... makes it easy to understand why this is the land of such creatures.The movie tells the story of an Arab courtier / diplomat who was sent to the barbaric North as a punishment for falling in love with the wrong woman. In AD 922, this could be seen as an execution, because there was no way he would return (it's the same reason why the Catholic Church sent people who had committed awful sins, as pilgrims from our region to Santiago De Compostella in Spain). When they are about to get robbed and killed somewhere in the fields, they manage to escape and accidentally stumble upon a group of Vikings, which saves their lives, because the Barbarians are terrified of these vicious warriors from the North. They soon get befriended and are able to stay with the Vikings, when a young boy, a messenger from the North, comes to the Vikings to ask for help. In their home country many people die because of ""an evil whose name should not be pronounced"". They consult an oracle who tells them that they should send 13 warriors, but that one of them shouldn't be a Viking. The Arab, however not believing that these mythical creatures from the forests really exist, joins them in their battle against the Wendol...Normally I'm not too much of a fan of Antonio Banderas' work, but this time I really liked him as the Arab with the impressive name of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad (I guess you better don't try to say that 10 times in a row). The other actors all did a very good job as well, even though I have to admit that I've never heard of most of them before.The story is nice and well written, the way it was all shot is done properly and overall I must say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. I'm sure that many will not agree, but personally I liked it more than the ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. I like legends and mystery in movies and this movie gave me both.

43,baumer,a bunch of guys kill a bunch of other guys,5,27 August 1999,"May contain spoilers:Where do I start?  Well, I liked the dog.  He had more character developement than any of the human characters.  I don't think I have ever felt so empty after leaving a movie with this much action.  I don't think I have ever wondered so much how a film like this got made.  Especially since the guys behind the scenes are really good movie guys.  John McTiernan is a great director ( Predator, Die Hard ) and when Andrew Vajna was partners with Mario Kassar, he used to put his name on some really good projects ( Rambo, Angel Heart, T2 ) but what anyone saw in this picture is actually beyond me.  And to invest 110 million dollars in it is an absolute joke.  I can't imagine the two page treatment for this film.  Because you could actually do it in less than a paragraph.  ""A guy who can't fight gets thrown out of his land because he loves the kings wife.  Then for no particular reason he has to be the 13th warrior to fight a battle that has nothing to do with him or the other warriors.  He learns how to speak Nordic in about a week, he learns how to fight overnight and then we have about four really intense battles.  People die and some live and then the dog sits down and says a doggy prayer for the dead warrior.""That is it.  Honestly.  There is nothing more to this story.  Supposedly this guy has to join these other warriors because the 13th warrior has to be a man that is not from the north.  But why that is was never explained. There was no reason for his character.  No prophecy, no folklore, no religious purposes for him to be there.  He is just there so Banderas can be the attractive guy in the picture so ladies can swoon over him.  And you know a movie is bad when you start to critisize trivial things like how Banderas is the only one in the film that is well groomed, shaven and clean. The rest of the warriors look like warriors.  Banderas looks like he just stepped out of his trailer in every scene.  Then there was the scene when they were on the boat at the beginning and I said to myself ""If they have their horses after the journey on the boat is over, I'll laugh. ""  And they did.  Watching 13 horses and 13 men get off this tiny boat was like watching clowns get out of a mini car at the circus.  Where did they all sleep? Where did they all stand?  Was there a basement?  Was there an extension to the boat that I wasn't aware of?  Were they in the spirit world?  Does God exist?  All very important questions, but no concrete answers.The action in this film was great.  The battles were bloody and violent but where was the story?  Where was the characterization?  To prove that it is possible to combine both of them wonderfully, check out Predator.  Seven guys, one beast, lots of action and great character developement.  This film has none of that ( except the action ).  You can see where this movie spent a hundred million dollars, but if it was that much why didn't they make a good story.  And don't pin this one on McTiernan, his direction was great. Pin this one strictly on Crighton.  The film is creditting both McTiernan and Crighton as directors.  It is rumoured that the test audiences didn't like it so they hired Crighton to do some extra scenes to spice it up.  Why? The problem is not the direction, it is the story itself.  Having Crighton come in and fix the directing is like having Ed Wood come in and write a few chapters in a book because people think a book needs some spicing up.  First you don't hire a writer with no experience behind the camera to direct a few scenes and secondly, when will people realize that Crighton is not as good a writer as people think.  Jurassic Park was a hit film because of Spielberg, not Crighton.  ER is not a success because of him either.  He no longer writes for the show and it is better than it ever was when he was there. This film is a disaster because of him.  There is no bleeping story.  NONE! You can't have a film with no story.  Everyone knows that.  And what picture exactly is it that Banderas was in that guarantees a picture that costs this much is going to have a huge opening weekend?  Nothing.  Again, Zorro was the story and Spielgerg.  That is the only film that has ever been somewhat of a hit with him in it.  But Anthony Hopkins was also in that film.  So why would you make a picture with Banderas as the star?  And then to top it off you invest 100 million dollars?  What a joke!  So this is my chance to talk to all producers and studio heads.  Please, if you need any advice on what to invest your money in, please contact me.  I can do just as bad a job as some of the clowns in Hollywood now, and at a fraction of the cost.The 13th Warrior is a really bad film.  If you like action then I guess you may enjoy this.  But that is doubtful.  Even Commando had more of a story and a better script than this piece of garbage.  This is the embodiment of p**s poor film making, again not on McTiernan's part, but on everyone from the guys that wrote it ( Crighton ) to the guys that made it a go picture to those that financed it.  You all deserve to lose money on this project. It's movies like this that make me strive for Hollywood myself.  Because I know that all I need is to get my foot in the door.  One hit, and then you have about five years leeway to make it or break it.  Hollywood allows that. It allows you to make garbage based on the fact that you once made a good film or had a good script or whatever.  This film proves that.  What has Crighton done lately to substantiate his stories getting made?  Nothing. What is the movie going to amount to?  Nothing.  And that is a promise.  If this movie succeeds to make even half of it's gross back ( about 55 million )in North America, I'll probably have a heart attack.",The 13th Warrior

Except there are not that many movie with that theme. Based on Crichton's short novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" (Crichton reportedly had a hand in the direction of the movie), this is an old-fashioned adventure movie. Crichton made the book as a blend from the real chronicles of an Arab traveler to the land of the Norsemen and the well known story of Beowulf.

46,marcin_kukuczka,Epic meets horror and history...adventure,6,17 September 2006,"There are not many movies about the Vikings, which appears to be pretty hard to explain keeping in mind that this part of history looks particularly attractive for cinema. Nevertheless, there have been some directors who attempted to make a movie about the giant Norsemen. Except for Richard Fleischer, who made a primarily adventure film with top cast of the time in 1958, John McTiernan is a man who had a wonderful idea in 1999: to make not only an epic, a spectacle with historical facts, but combine most popular aspects of today's cinema in a movie the action of which is set more than 1000 years ago. Yet, did the idea work in practice?The combination of horror, epic, history and adventure at first seems to work in the 13TH WARRIOR. As an epic fan, I watched it with historical imagination, as a thriller fan, I saw it full of curiosity of the action, particularly the sequence with mysterious, cannibalistic Creatures of the Mist and their leader Wendol (the content partly based on BEOWULF). The moody atmosphere reaches its peak before the cruel attacks on villages. The moments, though brutal, exceptionally involved me. The witch who comes and selects the twelve Viking warriors to fight the enemy...the moment she says that the thirteenth warrior cannot be a Norseman is unforgettable. Except for horror fans, there is also much for adventure lovers. The entire content is a pure adventure. Since what may be equally interesting and mysterious than the 10th century Scandinavia? What may be equally involving than the brave bloody combats of the strong warriors of the North? However, though the director seems to manage the combination of horror with epic and adventure with history, there is so much of it that a conclusion sounds like this: ""You simply don't know what the film is going at...""The cast give pretty good performances. In my opinion, however, it is not Antonio Banderas who is at the top. He does no outstanding job in the portrayal of his character, though an interesting one of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, the 13th warrior. Many moments are unnatural, particularly the first half when Banderas is exposed to live and fight among the unclean, brute, strong, giant blond masters of the seas. Yet, there are better performances in THE 13TH WARRIOR. The actors who shine in their roles are Vladimit Kulich, who is absolutely brilliant as an untamed, courageous Viking leader Buliwyf and Omar Sharif as a wise man from the Far East, Melchisedek (unfortunately given rather too little time on screen). It's a pity that the director did not develop the character of Olga (Maria Donnevie). A plot of a love affair would be something that many viewers could find absorbing in such a film). But it is another omission that the film has. But let us now concentrate on some advantages that the movie can boast.The cinematography and scenery are fine. Although THE 13TH WARRIOR was not filmed in Scandinavia as the aforementioned VIKINGS (Fleischer made his film in Geiranger Fjord in Norway), McTiernan's shooting locations of Canada and Canadian natural beauties do leave an unfading trace in many viewers. And they really look authentic. The battle scenes, in spite of being too long, sometimes, are very realistic and imitate Ridley Scott's films (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). I also liked the mysterious grandeur that was exposed in the scene of a royal funeral. These aspects, however, serve primarily the purpose of an epic and the illogic of it all is that THE 13TH WARRIOR is not an epic film - it only seems to be in a way. Therefore, it's pretty hard to evaluate what the film really is. It's a sort of combination, which makes it a really confusing movie for many people.Finally, I would like to concentrate on one positive aspect of the film that many users did not entail in their comments...a different (and accurate) way of seeing Arabs. Their living conditions, their elegance, their riches and exceptional hygiene were far higher than the ones found in the Europe of that time. The main character, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas) is shocked by the lack of hygiene that the Vikings had. In this way, historically speaking, we, Europeans, learned a lot from our brothers, Muslims. This aspect is wonderfully developed in the film, not only in the scene about ""drawing sounds"" (writing) at which Buliwyf is amazed but also at the moment Ahmed prays to Allah at the end. I cannot say that I disliked THE 13TH WARRIOR. This is a sort of film that should not be treated as a serious history and categorized within one genre. The movie rather combines many aspects of movie genres: thrilling atmosphere of adventure, facts of history, grandeur of spectacle, violence of battles, courage of warriors, mystery of horrors, and wisdom of reflections. Yet, this combination occurs to be a partial failure. 6/10!",The 13th Warrior

Fine battles aside, there are a few neat moments: for example, a clever and effective ""character slowly overcomes a language barrier"" montage.The biggest flaw is how, Banderas aside, nearly all fellowship members remain underdeveloped - with the exceptions of leader Buliwyf and Ahmed's pal Herger, everyone else is a bearded, grim cypher.

51,TheNorthernMonkee,Twelve Vikings and an Arab provide a simple action flick,7,29 June 2004,"SPOILERSIn Hollywood there are always certain historical areas where attention is focused. In more recent times we have seen a lot of films about the American West, a huge number about the second world war, a few about medieval Europe and even one about the death of Jesus Christ, so in ""The 13th Warrior"" it feels like rather a nice change for a film to feature that unique race of people, the Vikings.In ""The 13th Warrior"", Antonio Banderas plays exiled Muslim Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad. As a foreign emissary, Ahmed travels to the lands of Europe where he encounters a group of Vikings. This group of men, led by their leader Buliwyf are asked by another Viking King to aid him in a battle against an evil group who's name must not being mentioned. After a wise old woman informs the group that the thirteenth of their mini-army must not be of Norse origin, Ahmed finds himself travelling over land and sea as the gang of thirteen warriors attempt to defend a King and his lands from the forces of evil.Often when Hollywood attempts to create a historical feature, there is constant criticism for the film's historical inaccuracy. With the case of ""The 13th Warrior"", this is harder to do. Whilst obviously everyone can find fault with a film based in the past, whether it be a problem with the language or something equally irrelevant to the enjoyment of the film, in films based around the Viking age, there is a considerable amount which we just don't know. We could argue all day about the Viking way of life, and whilst some parts we could look at historical objects and claim that this is true, the bigger question is whether we should care. In ""The 13th Warrior"", the notion of historical accuracy doesn't feel that relevant in regard to what this film is. This film, simply put, is a tense, action movie with a cast consisting of one or two well known actors and a majority of unknowns. The beauty of this film though is that aside from whether the actor is a big Hollywood movie star or not, they all give us a brilliant sense of who their characters are. With one or two exceptions, we watch as the Vikings fight and die, and we feel for a few who we feel a sense of character for. Tony Curran and Clive Russell in particular are Vikings who stand out that I've seen in different films, Curran being in a few Hollywood films and a couple of British television series whilst Russell is probably most famous for his role in the television series ""Auf Wiedersehn Pet"" (1983).With the main thirteen characters stood firm in place, this film also benefits from the fact that it has a simple plot. This unoriginal idea of outcast bonds with a group as they all fight evil has appeared on many different occasions, and whilst it might not ever win awards, it does keep the audience happy in that we don't need to think particularly hard whilst watching the film. Ultimately that is the beauty of this feature. In a cinema market increasingly split between those films where you leave your brain at the door, and those films where you have to focus hard, for a film to be of decent quality whilst simultaneously that first type of no-brainer is quite a pleasant feeling.Basically, the beauty of ""The 13th Warrior"" is it's simplicity. This film is a simple, straight forward, action film which delivers violence and yet maintains it's dignity by being fun. It might not be awards material, but ultimately who cares. A quality, action movie.",The 13th Warrior
52,russem31,Enjoyable,7,20 December 2005,"The 13th Warrior was a very enjoyable film if not unforgettable. I would consider this film slightly above the standard action fare because of a great performance by Antonio Banderas (with the longest name I've ever heard - Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad!) I must also mention that I read the book first (called Eaters of the Dead) which is MUCH better than the movie, but in some ways that is to be expected since the books can go deeper into the thoughts of the characters than film ever can. Also the book makes me believe what happened in AD 922 was for sure based on fact (as the book states) rather than if I just watched the movie. I also didn't like the fact that the movie didn't mention that these Eaters could have been Neandrathals (which made the book an enjoyable read). All in all, a 7 out of 10.",The 13th Warrior

However, I wasn't too sure whether or not I should like this movie adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel, so I decided to watch the whole thing online feeling a little underwhelmed at first, but as the film progresses, I said to myself, ""You know what? This might turn out pretty decent."" and it did. Apparently, this movie has some problems that ruined it, but I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics said it was.Let me start off with the redeeming aspects. The scenery is magnificent, the costumes and make-ups are brilliant, and cinematography is solid it gives a great atmosphere to the entire film. The direction is above-decent, the pacing never fails to be too fast nor too slow and the music from Jerry Goldsmith is great with some dark moments that suited the gripping action sequences really well, but the strongest aspect goes to it's fine acting. Antonio Banderas is great as the lead role, Vladimir Kulich is also good, and Diane Venora is beyond excellent. Like I said before, there are some flaws and those are it's predictable story, messy script, and mediocre dialog.Overall, The 13th Warrior isn't a kind of masterpiece that I would recommend to fans of the book, but in my opinion, I would say that this is quite underrated and a decent one too.

54,rebeljenn,silly battle scenes,4,26 March 2006,"'The 13th Warrior' is an action/adventure film about a group of Viking warriors. Although there were some good ideas, I felt that they failed to come to life in this film. The characters could have been more interesting than they were, and they feel distant. The story really fails to engage because of the characters and the overall methods in which the story is told. However, the battle scenes were done well, except some of the events taking place turned out to be funny rather than serious. (The sound effects and some of the scenes of heads getting slashed, people doing miraculous killing moves against the odds, horses leaping in the nick of time to safety, over-acting character emotions, and showing a lot of gore for the sake of gore were silly.) This film can be enjoyed and laughed at both if you're not looking for much of a story.",The 13th Warrior
55,RonellSowes,The beginnings of the NFC North rivalry,4,17 November 2020,"The 13th Warrior is a loose adaptation of one of the earliest works of the English language,Beowulf. Just as Beowulf is about non-English speakers but written in English, so are many modern films. And often instead of having actors speak in their character's native language, they speak in English with a corresponding accent. In this film Antonio Banderas(Ibn) and Omar Shariff(Melchisidek),who play Arabs, do just that. Then when the two meet a band of Vikings the film suddenly acknowledges foreign languages. For a good twenty minutes or so the Vikings speak in their native tongue while Ibn speaks in English and Melchisidek translates for him and the audience. After Ibn sets off with the Vikings(and we lose our nifty translator) the film settles the problem in a preposterous manner. By merely watching and hearing them talk he is able to learn their language. And after that all the characters converse in English for the rest of the duration. Which raises the question why was it that they couldn't have been speaking in English from the start ?Though Ibn is the main character of the film the 'hero' in a sense is Buliwyf-not to be confused with Beowulf-and Ibn is just another member of the band while Buliwyf leads the action. One major difference from Beowulf is that in the place of Grendal the antagonist(s) of the film are men disguised as bears. Bears vs Vikings I suppose that's when the NFC North rivalry started.While superior to other Beowulf films The 13th Warrior is a fairly mediocre sword & shields film with all the cliche and flaws that plague most.",The 13th Warrior
56,oneloveall,A boring story against a mediocre backdrop,4,9 May 2007,"Unspectacular adventure film tries vainly to mimic successful traits of past explorer-type movies, though really has no script to back any of the budget up. Those that get excited and long for the glory days of action ala Conan and Indiana Jones may have little else to turn to these decades, but as the uneventful proceedings of the 13th Warrior show, one needs to have a driving sense of mystery in order to perpetuate the adventure.This film has none of that. With a simple premise setting these 13 warriors off to counter an evil force, the uninspired screenplay simply brings viewers through the tired motions. Antonio Banderas, not as bad as I thought he would be here, can still hardly do anything to rescue this methodical homage to cinematic glory days of old. He plays The 13th Warrior, a foreigner who has been chosen to accompany a rogue group of vikings on their quest to seek out and destroy this evil presence.And that, is basically as specific the will plot gets here. Banking on pricey set design and pseudo-spectacular battle sequences, the mediocre project fails because it does nothing to invest the viewer into what producers must have felt was priority here, making the entire journey feel like a few over-bloated set pieces with nary an explanation to hold the action together. Director John McTiernan, of Die Hard fame, is just not in his element here, and with careless editing, lackluster performances, and a shallow story from Michael Crichton, The 13th Warrior will be unnecessary to all but adventure film fanatics.",The 13th Warrior
57,jdkraus,A great Vikings film,8,7 February 2007,"As a John McTiernan fan of his previous films such as Die Hard and Predator, and a studier of Norse mythology, I decided to see this film. I may have come late, but I have to say that once again Mr. McTiernan has delivered another great film of bloody and gritty action, and some surprisingly well incorporated Norse mythology.The Thirteenth Warrior is based off of Michael Crichton's novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" and the true story of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad (try to sat that three times really fast). The story explores an ""ancient evil"" that is not named, known as the Wendol (pronounced with a v) that are cannibals whom are described as having ""teeth like a lion, figure of a man, and a head like a bear with claws"" that slaughter anyone who comes across their path.Ibn (as I call him), an Arabic ambassador, is chosen as the thirteenth warrior to accompany a band of a dozen twelve brave vikings. They are sent to the north to assist the ravaged villages and defeat the Wendol.This is a great film that explores both action and heavy Norse mythology (as stated in the first paragraph). It may sound comical that Antonio Banderas plays an Arab, but he gives a very descent performance as a man of politics who transform into an unexpected hero. Vladimir Kulich also gave a very strong performance as the head of the twelve vikings, Buliwyf. The rest of the cast was simply good as well, giving off both humor and testosterone. The camera work was both thrilling and dangerous, which reminded me very much of the intense camera angles in Predator.The scenery and cinematography is superbly crafted, the heart racing score of Jerry Goldsmith (may he rest in peace) was both haunting and moving. the battle sequences were smaller, (no where in the league of Lord of the Rings) but they were exciting and intense with plenty of bloodshed. And I also have to mention that the make up job was very well done from the wigs to the scars that the warriors gained and held throughout the film.However, the first half hour of the film was somewhat hard to follow, due to the fact that the dialog was in different languages and hard to follow while other cast members such as a surprise appearance of Omar Sharif, was trying to interrupt the happenings to Banderas' character, as well as to the audience. The film I might add was a bit too short, and over way to quickly, making it more of an action flick rather than an epic like Braveheart or Gladiator, and a few intermediate stories were not solved fully.other than those flaws, i was deeply satisfied. 4/5",The 13th Warrior
58,Movie-12,Tense battle sequences--poorly developed script and characters. ** out of ****.,5,16 September 1999,"THE 13TH WARRIOR (1999) **Starring: Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Vladimir Kulich, Omar Sharif, and Anders T. Andersen Director: John McTiernan   Co-written and directed by Michael Crichton 114 minutes   Rated R (for brutal warfare violence and gory carnage)By Blake French:Michael Crichton is a very good writer. Way too good for being responsible for much of the production of ""The 13th Warrior,"" a brutal Viking film in which everything is first rate except the characters and the story. True, the film does contain a few moments of suspense and tension that work well. However, nothing in this movie even remotely compares to any of his past work, such as ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Sphere."" Also, director John McTiernan, who has also contributed his direction to some great movies, such as the original ""Die Hard,"" is completely lost in Crichton's story here, which, in a way, leads to a directional conflict that is almost like the blind leading the blind.Antonio Banderas stars as a humble Arab poet named Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, Ibn for short, who lives a pretty normal 18th century life until he is chosen, along with twelve other brave men, to defend a king's plummeting kingdom from vicious, unknown slaughters who consumer the dead. His life dramatically changes as he defends his leaders and his own life by fighting off these man-eating beasts.  Finding out who the villains are in this movie is truthfully the only reason to even consider going to the multiplex to see it; they are mysterious and devilish. Part of their identity is revealed in a dramatic war sequence that gives away the wrong information at the wrong time. If only the filmmakers offered an answer to this provoking question: we never actually find out who they are or where they come from. Too bad, if the audience was provided with answers, we may have had something a little bit noteworthy here.Another problem I had with ""The 13th Warrior"" has to do with its plot, which was seemed to be absent for much of the film. The characters are good speakers; they explain most of the story to us, with simple and blank dialogue that doesn't include any dramatic impulse in its being--the plot is never directly shown. This dialogue is also used to develop most of the characters. Banderas is detailed though some neat flashbacks, but not even those scenes will make you care about any of the characters.
There is much to like about the production, however. The battle sequences build up enough tension to make them work well, mostly because of the mystery of the villains. There is a nice (meaning the scene works, not that the scene is ""nice"") scene in a cave near the end of the film that has lost of smart material in its writing--but again, we just don't care about any of the characters; it is hard to build up tension if we don't care about who lives or who dies. In addition, there is a tremendously over-looked production design  worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Antonio Banderas delivers a good performance, one that fits the lead role so perfectly that I myself could not have chosen another actor to fit the role better. His character is too shallow to give recognition to, but Banderas does what he can to make his character bearable. I do believe that ""The 13th Warrior"" was destined to succeed. If the writers would have done  what they should have done, considering the potential here, this film would have surely worked. There are  many ways that would have made this material work. For instance, Antonio Banderas stars as a brute, powerful leader of thirteen warriors who are forced into defending their king's fortune. Or perhaps, Antonio Banderas as the leader of a band of scavengers numbering thirteen who are somehow selected to protect their territory from the legendary ""eaters of the dead."" But how in God's green Earth could one take such clever potential and write a story starring Antonio Banderas as some meek, insignificant Arab poet who is chosen by some unknown, distant king to fight for a dyeing nation and protected its citizens from man-eaters whose presence is never explained?

59,FlickJunkie-2,Well directed period piece has an authentic medieval look and feel,8,27 January 2000,"I have read a lot of criticisms of this film here and elsewhere that I don't feel are justified.  I liked this film.  It is an excellent piece of directing from John McTiernan that captures the medieval period realistically.Contrary to most of the criticism that this film is just violence with no plot, this film has a very definite and sound plot.  It is the story of 13 courageous men who are sent to defend the homeland of a respected king from the attack of the Wendol, the creatures of the mist who are thought to be eaters of human flesh.  It is a story of duty, courage, honor and loyalty, and some very brutal battles.What the story lacked was character development and an archetypal hero. Since that is what the masses expect in their films, I'm certain this film was a big disappointment.  That is what made Braveheart a more complete film of this genre.  We had William Wallace as our reason for watching the battles.  If this film starred Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenegger as Buliwyf (played instead by veritably unknown Vladimir Kulich), and spent a little time developing him as a leader, I'm sure everyone would have thought it was a great movie.They only real flaw in the plot was premise that an Arab that they just met, especially one who was not a warrior by profession, would be selected as the 13th warrior.  This was highly contrived.  This film was an epic saga of human conflict.  It wasn't some romantic war over a great philosophy or ideal.  It was raw survival against barbaric intruders.  It was typical of life in medieval times.  This is not something today's society can really relate to being a generation that has grown up on sitcoms and fast food and whose idea of a threat is if someone insults their cultural group.  I believe that this is the reason it did not have popular appeal.  The response would probably be the same if The Iliad were made into a film without some character development of Achilles and Hector. 
McTiernan did an outstanding job of capturing the look and feel of the times.  The locations were fantastic and the sets all very rough hewn.  The cave scenes were also extremely realistic.  The battle scenes were first rate.  He did a fine job of depicting the thinking of medieval men, wrought from a combination of tradition, myth, superstition, and fear of the unknown in a time when almost everything was unknown.The only real error he made was the depiction of Ahmad's (Antonio Banderas) learning of the Northmen's language.  Clearly, he was not trying to make it look like Ahmad learned the language in one night.  Unfortunately, that's the way it came across.  It would have been more effective if he used successive cutaways of him listening in different situations, on the boat, in a field, by the campfire, etc.Of special note, I saw this film on DVD and the sound was fantastic.  This was superb use of all five speakers in the Dolby 5.1 format.  The forest and battle sounds came from everywhere at once.  Characters who rode off the screen, could be tracked audibly as they rode away.  Kudos to the sound designers.Antonio Banderas did as good a job as can be expected given the way his character was written.  Since the hero wasn't the point of this film (the struggle was), and since he wasn't really even the hero (Buliwyf was), Banderas was relegated to being a supporting actor in a starring role.I rated this film an 8/10.  A few minor flaws did not detract from the excellence of the portrayal of the epic.  Not for the faint of heart.",The 13th Warrior
60,LebowskiT1000,A great film!,10,30 July 2002,"I thought ""The 13th Warrior"" was a fabulous film!  The characters were all very interesting, and well done.  There were a number of scenes that I thought were just brilliantly directed.  For instance, when the Antonio Banderas character is learning the Northmen Language.The story is nothing terribly complicated, it can basically be summed up to: A guy is banished from his home and then ends up with a bunch of Northmen. He is then chosen by an oracle-like person to go on a quest with 12 other warriors to help some friends of the Northmen, who have requested help from the Northmen.  So, of course they all go to help them out.The only problem I have with the story is why the Antonio Banderas character actually decides to help them.  There is virtually nothing in it for him, but he goes with them anyway.  It would be nice to have some explanation, but I can deal without it.I thought this was a very entertaining movie and I thought it was an interesting story.  I would recommend watching this film if you haven't seen it already (if this sound like a film you'd be interested in seeing).  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.

61,Antagonisten,Decent entertainment,4,4 November 1999,"This movie, directed by Michael Crichton and based on his novel ""Eaters of the dead"", is considered one of those quite massive mistakes that sometimes happen in the movie industry. The movie was delayed by months (maybe even years) and the test screenings were disastrous. In an effort to save what could possibly be saved the movie was cut down and released in a more or less completely altered version.What appealed to me with this movie was most of all the swinging of swords. I don't what it is with such movies, but ever since i was a kid and up until today swordplay holds a certain appeal to me. Probably that's why i've even seen the Conan-movies a few times too much... Anyway, when it comes to sword-swinging action like this movie there are two things that must be included: (1) Well-filmed fencing scenes, (2) Blood.The problem with many movies today is that the ratings-system must have gone overboard since the early 1980's when Conan got away with displaying gushing fountains of blood when people were sliced with swords and mauled with axes and hammers. There is little blood in this movie and that's of course a letdown, but a bigger letdown is the lack of decent fencing-scenes. The action-scenes are few and far between and much too short.This movie does feel like an edited version of itself. It's probably hard to salvage a movie that's been put through so much editing and re shooting as this one, so i guess the result could have been much worse. It's not nearly as awful as critics at the time made it out to be, but it's definitely flawed. Crappy writing and pale actors doesn't help the issue, and the fact that the final battles hint at a budget swiftly running dry is not to the films benefit either.The verdict? Recommended to fans of the genre i guess. If you like viking/barbarian-style action movies there is not much to choose from today (at least not much that's not child-safe). This is not a good movie, but not as bad as it could have been. I rate it 4/10.",The 13th Warrior

63,acedj,Actually better than the book,9,20 November 2019,"This movie is based on the Chrichton book Eaters of the Dead. He wrote this book on kind of a bet to see if the legend of Beowulf could have arisen from actual events. While the book is good, this movie is the rare instance where it surpasses the source material.
This is the story of a traveling Arab, who comes to be known as Ibn and played by Antonio Banderas. He encounters a group of Vikings and is invited to join them for the evening. The next morning an envoy shows up with a tale of a villages under attack by a group that is invading villages and killing all. The envoy was sent to find help and the medicine woman is consulted. She sees in her bones that the tribe should send twelve warriors, plus one that is an outsider. The 13th warrior status is claimed by Ibn, albeit unwillingly.
After reaching the area that is under attack, the Vikings encounter the fire worm and discover that it is comprised of viscous men that slaughter villages for food, as in they eat their victims. The thirteen decide to seek out this group and kill them in their lair.
This is a very good movie. One could easily see this expanding into the legend that is Beowulf. As I stated previously, it far supersedes the source material and takes you on on heck of a ride.",The 13th Warrior
64,Gafke,Beowulf meets Die Hard,10,17 January 2005,"In the early years of the 10th century, an exiled Arabian nobleman falls in with a band of Vikings. Disgusted by their poor hygiene and their barbaric ways, he nevertheless reluctantly agrees to accompany them to a distant kingdom, where an unspeakable menace terrorizes the land. This is an interesting interpretation of the tale of Beowulf, with the monster Grendel transformed into the fierce Wendol, a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who have somehow survived long past their time. Despite the fact that Banderas is the title character and credited as the star, he is not the hero here at all. The band of 13 is led by the huge and intimidating Buliwyf (read Beowulf), a hero among his people who must battle both the Wendol and their deadly ""mother."" Alexander Gudonov lookalike Vladimir Kulich is the hero of this film, and delivers a strong, amazing performance. Banderas spends much of the film bumbling, stumbling, screwing up and trying to keep up with the Vikings, who look upon him with contempt but finally, perhaps grudgingly, accept him. Okay, so it's not entirely historically accurate and suffers from production problems and an occasional overdose of testosterone, but it's not a bad movie by any means. The casting is great, with standout performances by the aforementioned Kulich as well as Dennis Storhoi as Herger, Banderas's translator and only friend; the handsome Scottish actor Tony Curran (in an unlikely kilt, but who cares?!?!) as the Celt Weath and the woefully underrated Richard Bremmer as the intimidating tattooed redheaded (and damn sexy!) Skeld. The film was worth watching for these three men alone, but then, I am female and perhaps a bit prejudiced in my opinions. These guys are HOT! But, I digress... Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a bone strewn cave lift this movie well above average.

Even my cat was pawing at the door to be let out. If Ed Wood had been listed as producer/director/writer I would have known what to expect. To begin with, the special effects seemed more like a low budget TV movie, and the film looked as if it had been shot with a home video camera or 16 mm film. Where did the money go? Antonio Banderas cannot act, he just stands around while we get shots of his big brown eyes, but at least they did not try to pass him off as a Viking Warrior, for which I will give the film a rating of 1. Even Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis did a better job as Vikings, although they were Jewish. THIS-TV showed a low budget film this week called Royal Deceit, (Prince of Jutland) a telling of the Viking saga on which Shakespeare's Hamlet was based, and which showed how absorbing a budget film could be.

When it does happen the direction is so bad you cannot see half of what is being shown. John McTiernan directed it and writer Michael Crichton was calling a lot of the shots so I don't know who to blame. John often does a pretty good job as director so I guess it's Michaels fault. Crichton has written some nice work but I am not a fan of his work here.The acting was pretty bad, it seems like a reject cast from Braveheart. Most of the cast is English, Irish or Scot and they are playing Vikings, that is just funny. Antonio Banderas as an Arab with his strong ass Spanish accent was too much for me, one of the worst casting mistakes ever. The movie was so laughable it was impossible to take serious.What the hell is up with the language thing? Ahmed only speaks Arabic yet he quickly learns their language which is Norse, and as soon as he learns it they all suddenly speak English. Perhaps it was a way of not making the viewer have to read subtitles the whole movie, but it was absolutely stupid to me. I am glad Omar Shariff didn't go along and have to translate everything for Banderas' character like he did the first 30 minutes of the movie because that was very annoying.As I have said the direction was so sloppy during battles, the camera was right there inches away and making it impossible to see anything - I hate fight scenes like that, pull back you idiot let me see the fight!! I thought it was funny with the enemy here as well, thousands of men in bear skin outfits, I would've been more scared a bear would kill me than those men. If the men all had a bear outfit then that land must've been crawling with bears, but thats just my thought.I also have to point out the old wise woman they go to see who talks like Yoda... brilliant lol, I am being sarcastic. I thought it was embarrassing that filmmakers always use Yoda as the wisest of them all and have mocked him in movies every since Empire Strikes Back came out.BAD BAD movie, thats all I can say. It's is very slow, it has stupid actors playing parts way out of their league and race also. It has the 13 warriors going to protect a town from bad things, so I recommend you watching The Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven to get that. It has mid-evil battles with mysterious creatures, I recommend Lord Of The Rings for that.If you love viking movies and don't care about story or facts or good acting or good directing then you might like this, if you are just one of those people who watch movies and doesn't analyze it then maybe you can tolerate it more than I.",The 13th Warrior

68,galensaysyes,Why did they bother?,2,31 August 2000,"This is probably the worst would-be swashbuckler I've ever seen. It's more like a two-hour trailer than a movie. No character or scene in it is fully realized. The camera takes astonishingly little interest in any of the clothes, weapons, dwellings, ships, or other artifacts of the period, and the fights are shot so closely in as to reveal nothing. One has only to compare these evidences of inattention to the same director's treatment of modern subjects, e.g. in Predator or Die Hard, to recognize that he isn't one whose imagination extends into the past. Perhaps this is why he allows the script to be insufficiently defined as well. After a meandering start, it settles into a series of inconclusive battles and then stops arbitrarily. The story that the main character discloses in narration about how he came to be in the story in the first place is more interesting than all that follows. Would the director - or rather, a different director - had shot that instead.",The 13th Warrior

One  can hardly say, apart from the intermission of the poet Ibn Fahdlan (a stupid Antonio Banderas in one of his worst parts ever), that this movie is not historically correct.  Neanderthalers on horses, it is just possible. Cannibals in the Nordic Fjords adoring bears, it is also possible.  One doubts if the Arab poet Ibn Fahdlan is still politically correct nowadays (the movie was made in 1999).

71,cofemug,The number of warriors should have remained at twelve.,3,1 September 1999,"This movie totally sucked.  I mean it was one of the worst this year.  If I wasn't with four other people, I would have left long before the movie was over.  The only redeeming quality to the movie was the graphic depictions of beheadings, and other such violence.  I almost fell asleep.  This is coming from a person who tries to find something to like in every movie, especially aggressive movies.  (Check my list all the good movies are aggressive toward something from social values to just plain tension, plus they are semi-unique.)Plot:  The reluctant dragon strikes again.  Bandaras falls in love with a shiek's mistress and then is banished.  He finds the Huns(?) and must fight with them because the 13th warrior cannot be one of them.  How stupid is that.  The beginning is very circumstantial.  How convenient that he arrives the night before the messenger for help does.  How convenient that the 13th must not be one of them.  Then they fight eaters of the dead.  They look like bears, but they ride horses, and are really people. 
Violence:  Awesome.  The best part of the whole movie.  It has several graphic beheadings.  I would like to make a montage of the fighting scenes, and skip the rest of the movie.  Blood spurts from necks and heads are carried off.  I sat on the edge of my seat for those parts.  My mind slept for the rest of the movie.  Script:  Awful.  I have seen better dialogue written on bathroom stalls. The best lines are in the previews, and they are not even that good.  I could not believe that audacity of the film-makers to make this bad of a movie.  Plus, who would be able to pick up a whole new language without a dictionary or knowing one single word.  It is quite impossible.Acting:  As bad as the script.  I guess I should not have gone to this movie considering that Antonio has not made a good movie yet!!  Desperado was overdone, Assassins was overlong.  Everybody else was bad too.This movie was not even entertaining.  Beware, do not go see this.  You will suffer.  Anything with this many coincidences cannot be good.  Go see the Sixth Sense.  Rent a classic.

The Vikings had very high cultural values, in fact. They were not a mixture of new-Guinean cannibals and Wall Street brokers.Furthermore, the historic realism could have been done much, much better. Vikings learned early to make soap, from the Celts whom they both traded with and raided.

They meet a clan of Norsemen who are visited by a messenger from a nearby tribe that needs help against a evil. Banderas character is chosen as the 13th warrior.What gives this movie its edge is the contrast in methods of Arab warriors and the completely different philosophy of a good horse.Plenty of swords, blood, hacking and screaming.

77,georgioskarpouzas,a contradictory effort for historical authenticity,7,19 July 2010,"I did see this movie in television and liked it. My point is that while in the beginning it strives to be an accurate portrayal of the life style and customs of the early medieval Norsemen and in a lesser degree Arabs the introduction of the human flesh eating Wendols brings an air of unreality in the whole movie. Either you try to be historically accurate or you play on the supernatural element, you can't do both in my opinion at least.On the other hand as the movie progresses the supernatural identity of the human flesh eating Wendols is dispelled and they are revealed as humans dressed in the garments of bears, living in caves, eating human flesh, very primitive but humans nevertheless without any relationship with animalistic or supernatural elements, as the Arab hero played by Antonio Banderas is the first to discover.The problem is that in this otherwise accurate portrayal of 10nth century A.D. world, inhabited by human beings as diverse as cultivated Arabs and rough Norsemen, where do this human flesh eating, bear garment bearing people, the Wendols, sprung from? Of course one could argue that their practices are not so appalling by the standards of the age since we know that during the barbarian invasions and latter during the Crusades, cases of cannibalism have been recorded.As for the sacrifice of human beings to appease a deity, this was massively practiced even latter in history by the Aztecs in Mexico, while widows were cast in the funeral pire of the husbands even in 19nth century British India.Therefore one could argue that the Wendols are not so exceptional by historical standards after all. Still in the movie their existence is rather unexplained and one can say that the differ from both Arabs and Norsemen in a considerable degree.Otherwise there is an effort to present the age in an accurate manner, the costumes and the practices of the heroes to appear in an authentic manner. The relationship of the outsider Arab with the Norsemen is developed in an able manner as well as his gradual integration to their group and his acceptance of their values.The movie is quite frightening and has scenes of violence, battles and human corpses eaten or skeletons exposed. The Wendols are very frightening in the beginning and even latter when their simply ""human"" identity is gradually revealed.The development of the characters is fine and some of the Norsemen become from uncouth barbarians human beings of endearing qualities that one can empathize with.",The 13th Warrior
78,no-skyline,Good movie but needed a longer running time,6,27 October 2006,Antonio Banderas stars in this action filled re-telling of Norse legend. As an Arabian warrior he is taken with 12 Scandanavian warriors to do battle with a mysterious foe deep in the wilderness in order to save a village from extinction. Filled with action what this film lacks is some more time on character and story development to give it that epic feel. Performances and direction are good but it feels like you never really get to know anymore than one or two of the heroes so consequently you never feel involved when they are in peril and ultimately when some die. The ending is also confusing and doesn't make to much sense when you think about it.Overall this is an enjoyable movie that with a little more could have gone from a 6/10 to an 8 or 9.Not in the same league as Lord of the Rings or even Conan! But fantasy and epic fans will have a lot of fun with this and everyone else will find some enjoyment from the action scenes 6/10,The 13th Warrior
79,bjones,Good Action But Misses The (Book)Mark,7,22 July 2003,"Originally written 19 September 1999; moved accountI went to the film prepared to be disappointed. You see, I read ""Eater's of the Dead"" years ago and it remains one of my favorite Crichton books. It is imaginative and masterful. I always wondered why it had never been made into a film as Crichton's other books had. When I saw the production announcement I eagerly awaited news and was disappointed early on with stories that the book had been greatly compromised and they had coped out early with a name change.Hollywood didn't disappoint me. As expected the film was a pale shadow of the book. The entire premise of Neanderthals surviving into the middle ages was completely lost in this silly characterization of some lesser unnamed bad guys.Also conspicuous by its absence was the uninhibited rampant sexuality of the Northmen. The sanitization of this aspect of the book just added to the disappointment.Some of the fight sequences were well done, with some of the better two-handed swordsmanship I have seen on film. Some of the actors portraying the Vikings were surprisingly good too. In that regard I would have to say that the casting was quite good and the single saving grace of the film's effort. They almost made up for some of the other shortfalls, but not quite. This could have been a remarkable film, but Hollywood again chose mediocrity. I would score it a bit above Hollywood's average though for the sets, costumes, swordplay and the great scenery.",The 13th Warrior

It was difficult to make out who was fighting whom most of the time.Aside from the violent battles, however, the story was slow and the holes in the plot were blatantly obvious. For example - how many hillmen does it take to overwhelm a tiny little village? And where do you fit 13 horses on a Norse boat in the middle of huge seas? The story line was not very involving, I missed why the reason why the hillmen were trying to wipe out that tiny village. Plus the idea of all these warriors getting instructions from old witches who either live in the hills or in the deepest caves on earth wasn't very convincing!

81,SimonD1900,Seven Samurai homage?,7,30 March 2020,"Think this is a good movie and little more even, really really decent movie, but very far from a masterpiece or anything like that. And it's also not a big movie with epic sword battles, but function more on a small scale. Almost with bits of fantasy and even horror elements to it. The story is not spectacular imaginative though, and it's not trying very hard to be historically correct. What sells this movie for me is the 12 heroic Viking warriors that are viewed from the eyes of the Arab (Antonio Banderas). Have to mention I thought also this was fun, for Banderas to do a movie like this, that is a bit on the small scale budget wise and with no famous Hollywood actors or even known actors (if you don't recognize Scandinavian actors) and with Vikings as a theme, you wouldn't expect him doing a role like that. Also, one of my all time favorites are Seven Samurai, and I'm sure the script was inspired by Seven Samurai (but I wouldn't know off course), but that is either way usually not a bad thing, just look at the Magnificent Seven for example (I mean the old classic western more then the new one) . Like the 7 Samurai in Seven Samurai the 12 Vikings are fearless, dignified, humorous and with strong sense of brotherhood, loyalty and experience of combat. They create a great dynamic to the movie. The rest of the movie is entertaining, exciting and not too long. To me that's good entertainment. But if you don't like sword fights or Vikings or this time period, perhaps not a movie for you. I like it though. I would recommend.Edit: just checked some more information about this movie. It was diffidently not on the small scale budget wise, it was actually quite expensive, those sets and costumes off course, have to be. Also didn't know that John McTeirnan is the director of Die Hard. I thought this move almost had an indie feel for some reason. I was really really off.

84,Danimal-7,"Sloppy and illogical, but sometimes entertaining",5,9 November 1999,"How do you mess up a plot as simple as THE 13th WARRIOR's?  This is the story of Ahmed ibn Fahdalan (Antonio Banderas), whom the Abbassid caliph appoints as ambassador to the Northmen (interestingly, I don't recall the word `Viking' ever being used in this movie).  The Vikings dragoon him into service against a mysterious tribe of creatures that are attacking the Vikings' villages and eating the flesh of the slain.Screenwriters William Wisher and Warren Lewis competed with each other to see how many holes they could fit in a plot this small; I won't blame Michael Crichton since I haven't read his book.  The foremost absurdity is that we are supposed to believe that just 13 Vikings turned the tide of battle against this strange tribe of hundreds of creatures, even though the king's village has hardly `a man between fifteen and fifty' besides them.  The concept that this tribe can be defeated merely by killing two of its biggest and strongest members is the invention of someone who has only a video-game understanding of war. Ahmed, appointed as an ambassador, never once attempts any diplomatic function; the minute the fighting is over he turns around and goes home!  He also goes from being a poet unskilled with weapons to Zorro-like derring-do in no time flat, without even being trained.  A subplot involving the local king's son leads to a tedious duel scene and then goes nowhere.  The many smaller holes are too numerous to list.Almost lost in the mangled storyline is some very interesting speculation on the origin of medieval myth and superstition.  When the human-flesh-eating beast-men attack, and are beaten off, the bodies of their dead disappear.  Presumably the beast-men carried them off to eat, but to the Vikings demonism seems as logical an explanation as any.  A gigantic fiery snake winds its way down a mountain toward the Viking village.  This turns out to be a column of hundreds of mounted enemies carrying torches, but how many of the women and children who hid in cellars during the battle passed the tale of the fiery `dragon' down to the next generation?  And it's not hard to see the origin of the Beowulf myth in the confrontation with the beast-man tribe's mother priestess in a cave below the earth.Except for Ahmed and one of the Vikings named Herger, the characters are all cardboard.  I was not the only viewer who couldn't keep the twelve Viking warriors straight or attach names to them.  A love interest character named Olga, played by the beautiful Maria Bonnevie, is so poorly drawn that she should have been left out altogether.
The acting is a mixed bag.  I like Banderas; it takes a hell of a lot of guts for a man who makes his living as a sex symbol to take on an explicitly homosexual role, which Banderas did and did well a few years back in PHILADELPHIA.  But he's just not very good in THE 13TH WARRIOR.  His voice is exactly the same as in THE MASK OF ZORRO and doesn't sound the slightest bit Arabic.  He is given several dramatic one-liners that he flubs badly.  But he is good at simulating pain, and gives a good sense of stumbling over the words of the unfamiliar Norse language.  Dennis Storhoi as Herger does by far the best job.  He's a heck of a lot of ferociousness and scrappiness in a small package, and his face reminds me of a young Liam Neeson.  Vladimir Kulich has been wildly overrated as Buliwyf; the man never once changes his facial expression or tone of voice.  Schwarzenegger's Conan was Olivier by comparison.  Daniel Southern, playing Eadgtho impressed me with his screen presence, though his accent needed work.  Sven Wollter's King Hrothgar is lethargic and boring.The soul of this film, of course, is its action scenes, and they are good, though sometimes confusing.  The pace of the battles never lets up; they're savage and immediate.  Firelight is well used to evoke the primitivism of the battlefield.THE 13TH WARRIOR does a pretty good job of evoking the atmosphere of early medieval Scandinavia.  There's not a paved road in sight; the roughness and uncouthness of the Vikings and their home is well painted, if maybe a bit overdone at first.  Banderas ' prayer before the final battle is as superb a portrayal of the spirit of the medieval warrior as has ever appeared on screen. The Viking swords look like authentic museum reproductions.  But why are there no battle-axes? Swords were rich men's weapons; to make a Viking movie with no axes is almost sacrilegious. Some of the armor looks suspiciously like 16th-century Spanish breastplate-and-morion gear. Also, British Columbia is a bit verdant to pass for northern Scandinavia.The production values are as good as $100 million can buy.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is enjoyable as always, but it's not one of his greater works.  McTiernan sometimes applies the music poorly, allowing it to stop abruptly where it should have faded out.  Unlike many action movies, this one does not have the humor laid on too thick.  Banderas has an awful slapstick scene, but I enjoyed the chagrined swordsmith's line, `He insisted,' upon seeing his sword carved into a scimitar.I was mildly entertained by THE 13TH WARRIOR, but would recommend it only to genre fans, for whom the rich atmosphere and action scenes may outweigh the illogical plot and poor characterization.  If you see it at all, see it on the wide screen.Rating: ** out of ****.",The 13th Warrior
85,Denver53,"You'll ask ""why?"" a lot",2,1 May 2000,"We had high hopes for this movie. They were in vain. This is a classic example of a movie that had almost no thought put into its plot. It is a series of fights, interrupted from time to time with scenes of dialogue that raise more questions than they answer.The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife. He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack. Even more odd is Ahmet's decision to join the Vikings. He already has a mission, and doesn't seem to be under any duress. Even a throw-away line along the lines of, ""I decided to go, so I could learn more about these North People who I will need to understand as ambassador"" would have helped. Along the way Ahmet learns how to speak the Viking language by, apparently, watching the Vikings talk. Never are we shown a Viking saying a word and tying it to an item, so that an observer might be able to attach meaning to the words. Yet somehow our hero learns the language. What are the odds of that?At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking ""Seven Samauri,"" with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.During the ensuring battle scenes, there is an attempt to show a juxtaposition between the culture of Ahmet the Muslum and Rennaisance Man and that of the crude but effective Vikings. For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight). Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time). Anyway, you can *almost* feel the threads of a plot here revolving around Ahmet as an observer of another culture, but it never is clear nor develops (just like the rest of the movie).There are many instances where events make no sense. The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason. It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit. There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits. It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed. And throughout the movie it appears that the odds are something like 20 or 30 to 1 against the Vikings (and the cannibals are on horses!), yet somehow we have a happy ending.The movie *tries* to draw on a theme of honor and courage. The Viking leader is noble and fights until he can no longer fight. But that theme is underminded by the numerous ploy holes. Why should we care about these people and what they fight for? Why are there only 13? Why do the cannibals attack? How did this start? Without answers to basic questions (and no clear indication of a moral cause), the idea of honor falls flat.I cannot believe the average rating for this movie is 6.2. We gave it a 2.",The 13th Warrior

It just seems to be one of those films you either love or hate. I once held the latter opinion, when I first saw the film during its initial release. ""What's going on?"" ""Yeah, right! As if Antonio could learn the Vikings language in one night, just from listening"" were just a couple of reasons I left the cinema disappointed. Imagine my surprise, then, that upon subsequent viewings of the film I started to appreciate it more, and now it sits as a firm favourite of mine. How did this happen? I honestly think it was just lightening up and enjoying the McTiernan - crafted action, he does an excellent job and we all know his credentials as an action director. The characters, although one dimensional, are enjoyable. Hey, they're VIKINGS, not poets or artists, all they have to do is hit things with swords for me to be entertained.

This is one of those movies that bad word of mouth prior to its actual release really affected the box office.

91,Rhino Rover,Sweeping,9,2 September 1999,"This was one Michael Crichton book that I have not read but I probably will after seeing the movie. The ""13th Warrior"" is based on the Crichton book, ""Eaters of the Dead"", which in turn I believe is based on a Viking legend, and if the movie was any indication, the book must be fantastic.
The story revolves around a group of Norsemen (Viking) warriors that have volunteered to a request for help from one of their neighbouring villages. Antonio Banderas' character is an ambassador from Bagdad that has come to this group of warriors to observe their culture and customs (I will let the movie describe the circumstances to his arrival). His timing couldn't have been worse as not long after he joins up with this group of warriors they recieve a request for help. As a result, 13 warriors must volunteer for this mission and by the luck of local customs, the 13th warrior cannot be of Norse decent, which means, Banderas is automatically selected to join them. The rest of the story I will let you see for yourself.The cinematography is absolutely wonderful. The sweeping shots of the land show the ruggedness and mystery of the country and in some cases it feels somewhat like a documentary, which adds to the realism of the story. The beginning of the movie starts out with much of the dialogue spoken in the Norsemen's native language with no subtitles. What is spoken is not of great importance as what you're supposed to observe is the cultural interactions between the warriors. But as Banderas' character is slowly integrated into the plot, the director chooses an absolutely wonderful way of making the transition from the native tongue to english. To me, this was definately one of the creative highlights of the movie. This is one film where I have to stress that the dialogue is very good. I found that every line spoken was of significance to the story and often revealed insight into what the main characters were thinking and feeling. Although Antonio Banderas was billed as the lead actor, he did not dominate the movie. In fact, his charactor had more of a supporting role that was there to document the mission. The movie did a very good job of focusing around the warriors as a group and gave enough attention to each of the main characters to allow the audience to gain an insight into their personalities. The acting was very good. Every character was played very well and definately created an authenticity to them. There is quite a bit of graphic violence so if you are the ""faint of heart"" type, you might want to consider a different movie. Despite many of the positives that I've mentioned there are some points that should be noted. This movie does have a religious tone to it so if you are a religious person, keep in mind that you are watching a movie about another culture's take on religion. Also keep in mind that this story is based on a folklore/legend, which means that not everything is going to make sense. Most of the story does but there are things that don't lend itself to logic but if you pick every little thing out, you will end up ruining the movie. Also, there are some parts of the battle scenes that take place in very dim lighting which make it hard to see but I have a feeling this was done on purpose to add realism. Overall, I found this to be a very gripping and entertaining movie. I also think that ""Eaters of the Dead"" would have been a more intriguing title....9/10.",The 13th Warrior

Spaniard Antonio Banderas is absolutely horrible at portraying an Arab.  The directing was very inconsistent.

The explanation of Grendel and his mother ... who looked like a teenage actress, actually ... is more plausible than ... but not as good as ... the legend. The depiction of the Vikings' lifestyle remains true to idb Fadlan's writings.

He doesn't say much, but every word has impact.The sympathetic treatment of Islam is intriguing.

95,carflo,Great Adventure!,7,4 December 2003,"The 13th Warrior is great adventure of myth, magic and bravery.  As has already been said, Antonio Banderas is a civilized Arab in the land of the Vikings in this well done adaptation by Michael Crichton's of his novel Eaters of the Dead.  The Crichton book is in itself an adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.  Crichton has crafted a clever tale that contrasts the educated, sophisticated and civilized Arab poet against the decidedly less than civilized Vikings.  The journey from southern Russia (where the story begins) back to the Viking homeland becomes a period of adjustment and learning for both sides and also creates most of the humor.  The funniest scene in the movie is caused by the Vikings' contempt for their Arab guest's ""little"" horse.  To prove the quality of his Arabian, Banderas jumps it over the head of his loudest critic who is mounted on a large Viking horse.  It is a gesture the Vikings, who live by their physical prowess, understand and find as funny as the audience. It is the beginning of respect for their strange guest and the real beginning of their comradeship.  They travel north to save a Viking king from a savage tribe that raids his lands killing, not only his undefended farmers in their isolated homestead, but also his warriors as they sleep in his fortified hall.  This savage ""bear totem"" tribe eat their fallen victims and are the ""Eaters of the Dead"" in the title of the novel.  They use mist and magic to frighten and paralyze the superstitious Vikings.  It is the sophisticated Arab with his educated belief in Aristotelian rationalism and his devout belief in one good God, Allah, that sees through the tricks of the enemy to the mortal men behind the magic.Taken together, these elements blend into a tale of myth and magic and bravery and comradeship that transcends culture.  It also creates a great adventure with some spectacular scenery, swordsmanship and spooky danger. If you like swords and magic and bravery, you will like The 13th Warrior.",The 13th Warrior
96,Dkish,At Last Hollywood does justice to the Norse,8,27 August 1999,"Hollywood takes another chop at making a Viking epic. Will the 13th Warrior be the `Braveheart' of Viking epics? The 13th Warrior chronicles the journey of an outcast Moor (Antonio Banderas) who becomes involved in a mission to save a Viking village from the onslaughts of some bloody thirsty cannibals. Originally entitled `Eaters of the Dead' and adapted from the Michael Crichton novel, this film has taken one and a half years to get to our local multiplex. Rumors of a $150 million plus budget and numerous scenes being reshot, I was beginning to wonder if this film would ever surface. Director John McTiernan was extremely upset with the film and the studio pulling the plug pre-emptly. There are reports that the studio pulled the plug then asked the angered director to reshoot the ending and various fight scenes. Let's just say this film was a behind the scenes mess. What's so incredibly amazing is this film overcomes the plagued behind the scenes mess. The sweeping Viking mists, the longboat overcoming thirty foot waves, blood thirsty battle, and scenic highlands are just some of the mystique that have enchanted our minds on the views of Viking lore. What's really rich and never been done in Hollywood is the thought of an outsider entering this mystical world and letting us see it through his eyes. Banderas' Muslim outsider is kind, sensitive and passionate until he becomes embroiled in the honor of being a man of the North. He is among very few Hollywood heroes who are disturbed by the blood and gore associated with Viking civilization. But when he finds that the `unnamed' evil is only a man, his anger engulfs him and he begins to see a new vision of what man is. This is an epic in the greatest sense of the word. The only ever evident flaw in this film is the ending itself. Why is it so short? Why is the climax not on a major scale? I know the symbolism associated with Vikings dying in battle and why didn't they take that to next level? The ending is only about 3 minutes when we should have been in the 10-20 minute range. On a positive note, this is the first Hollywood venture I have ever seen that takes Vikings seriously and I have wanted to see something in that nature all my life. I just hope because of all its problems they don't stop making Viking films. Previous Viking films have been on less than 10 million dollar budgets and looked like men dueling in woolen overalls. Anybody out there remember `Lee Majors' in `The Vikings' or `Tim Robbins' in the funny `Erik the Viking'? Well these were about the only Viking staples until `The 13th Warrior'. So go out and see this epic but when its done think what it would have been like if the final war scenes were 10 minutes longer. I hope Hollywood can hear me.

97,randreww,Hit & Miss!,4,14 November 2016,"The 13th Warrior is a conflicted film of jaw dropping set pieces, profound detail, & stunning cinematography, which has a ""lets fight the savages"" story & a ""Don't talk; fight"" narrative. The men are too tough for tears, the women too scarce for encouragement & strength, the children are just props & the meaning is lost upon the project as though any soul would dirty the film. I can't believe so much money would be ploughed into a film without a solid script first! So much effort was clearly & painstakingly put into every frame of these frenetic battle sequences. And yet the shots are kept deliberately low which creates an even more uninspired experience than that purloined from the script itself! There is an appreciation to realism not found in Hollywood or any surviving studios who may have the kind of money to make films of this disappearing & under-appreciated genre, which makes it all the more disappointing. If only this demonstrated the level of love both men & women had for each other, it may translate to the passions adverse to love on the battlefield.Little effort is made to define the geography of this battleground either. I presume they are Greeks? As they were speaking the Greek tongue at the start of the film, but then what origins are the natives from? To make things worse, the Arab isn't even played  BY AN ARAB!! I hate how there is always an absence of darker skinned cast members in film. Bruce Lee had a vision where peoples of ALL cultural background worked together, but this seems to be lost upon both studios & audiences now. It's so embarrassing to have to watch hour after hour.. film after film of passive racist predilection.Anyway, it has moments of strategy but don't expect much more. This came & went like the weather seemed to do so in this flick! A wasted opportunity!",The 13th Warrior
98,Lumpenprole,At least the gore is satisfying (spoilers),4,17 June 2002,"An unlucky film that was hoping to exploit the market for costume epics spawned by Braveheart in the late 1990s.  The writing is feeble and the editing is a last ditch attempt to salvage a mess created when McTiernan left the movie during production.  (Disney clearly had no hope for it and quietly farted it out in the Fall without any fanfare.)  The plot centers on an Arab diplomat in the 10th century that traveled among the Vikings and is recruited to fight the Eaters of the Dead with them.  The plot of Beowulf is used for about 20 minutes of the film.  After a bunch of hints about monsters and magic and so on, the villains turn out to be the same marauding army of morons that show up in many action movies.  They rape, pillage and say `har har' a lot.  They're the same bunch from the bad Mad Max films, bad Stallone films and basically bad action films.  In this movie, they mass for a great assault of guys in makeup and dishrags vs. the Vikings.  Sorta like Thunderdome, but no fun.  Like all evil hordes, they just lose the will to fight the outnumbered heroes when their ridiculous leader dies.  The Eaters of the Dead start the film as wraiths that move with superhuman speed and agility.  By the end they're about as menacing as stormtroopers running into Ewok traps.The 13th Warrior is not great for MST3k purposes unless you really enjoying digging into Antonio Banderas' acting style.  I like watching $100 million flops in the same way that I enjoy Ed Wood movies.  The number of people posting here that actually admire this 90-minute accident kinda amazes me. Looking over them I noticed that 13th does indeed have a couple plot elements in common with Seven Samurai.  I never thought of it because when I think of the Seven Samurai the first thing that comes to mind are those seven concrete personalities working together.  I can't remember a single Viking from 13th, except that one was the big leader and another was the talkative joker who grinned a lot.Without a doubt, this film has one of the most perfunctory `insert love interest here' subplots ever filmed.It's also interesting for the most obviously lopsided climatic fight scene since the giant Wesley Snipes went head-to-head with the dapper Stephen Dorff in Blade.If you're familiar with the history or Beowulf, it's kinda a weird experience to spend a whole film with one eyebrow arched in mild disbelief and confusion.",The 13th Warrior

Where was it spent? Antonio Banderas was really hot when this came out, and Omar Sharif doesn't come cheap I'm sure, but really guys? Bad investing decisions aside, the movie's not great. The epic scale of production turns out to be a waste of money as they forgot, in all their spendthrift extravagances, to craft a meaningful story. The characters do not make us believe in their quest, but it's not because of the acting: these European character actors are perfectly cast. There is no meat here, no character arches, no soul drama or connection between the players and the play. My guess is Michael Crichton (who wrote the book this was based off of) had an idea that was a cross between Lord of the Rings, Seven Samurai, and Lou Ferrigno's Hercules, and paid someone a ton of money to film it. As a vapid action epic it's got enough going on to maintain your interest, but just barely and the film is really saved by the last 30 minutes. Rating: 18/40",The 13th Warrior

105,illegal_alien51,Turned out quite impressive in the end,8,4 May 2004,"*Very few spoilers* Yep, that's true. The first thing that impressed me a lot was the beginning, because between the Tartar attack to when the oracle speaks to the prince or new king, the movie does actually follow an eye witness account from 922AD. In that year Ibn Fadlan had come from Baghdad with a 5000 men strong delegation to visit a place nearby. That they met the Vikings at the Volga river was luck, but there he actually witnessed the burial of a Viking king. When he came home he wrote down his experience. So the movie comes with quite some impressive fact at the beginning. The burial was of course not shown in quite so much detail as Ibn Fadlans eye witness account, but it was good enough. It was rather funny to see the washing bowl thing (the bowl they spat in and washed their faces in later) depicted in the movie too! As far as I understand the rest is rather fabricated with a bit of myth woven into the story.The acting was good and I liked the Vikings language, it sounded rather genuinely old. They could have prolonged the period in which Ahmed learned the language; it would have been a tad more realistic. Also did I see surprisingly few axes in the movie... if any? As far as I know did the Vikings like axes quite a lot! There were a few more things, like where did the enemy get all those horses from and also, why did THE WOMAN have a tropical snake around her neck (at least it looked like that) but I guess like with most more fictitious movies you shouldn't take everything too seriously. I found the first fighting scene in the village to be an ounce lame, but the later fight (the last stand) was just the more powerful and gripping. I'm normally not so very easily moved but it was actually quite touching and truly heroic.So, for whatever slightly bad things, there is enough good to go around so that the movie reaches a very nice ending!I think I actually gave it a quite so deserved 8/10",The 13th Warrior
106,Norway1,Well-worth-the-ride cleaver and unique action-thriller.,7,21 February 2000,"I Finally got to watch this movie as it was just released to video here in Norway. Either I missed it somehow when it was in the theaters it never was released to theaters here. What can I say more than that I LOVED IT!! I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every detail. Without spoiling it for those that haven't seen it yet here's a summary followed by my review and take on it:This is the story of an Arabian diplomat played by Antonio Banderas and his adventure in the land assigned for him to diplomat: ""The North"". Today this would be called Northern Europe, Scandinavia or even more specifically: Norway. ;o)He takes with him his trusted advisor and interpreter, Melkisedek (sp?) to try to communicate with the Norse leaders and assess the situation of their country. In doing so he meets up with a group of Norsemen (Vikings) during a celebration for the coronation of their new king and funeral of their late king.During his stay with these Vikings a young boy from one of the villages of northern Norway comes to seek their help. Several of the neighboring villages had been destroyed by mysterious creatures and king of this boy's village sent him to find some warriors to assist them in defending themselves against these creatures.A fortune teller is summoned to advise them to how they may defeat  the creatures. She says 13 men must travel to the village, the 13th not being a Norseman. Antonio is obviously chosen to be the 13th warrior and they set off together for the quest.It isn't as gory and full of violence as one might expect. I for one was pleasantly surprised by it's tactful balance. They showed enough for you to get the idea that the creatures were cannibals and to sort of frighten you, but they didn't over do it and make it into a ""hack and slash"" horror flick.It was an intelligent thriller that required some thinking. I wondered, ""How in the world are they going to defeat these guys?"" and was mostly satisfied by the answer (which I won't give away now anyway).As one who can objectionably critique this film's accuracy to true Norse lifestyle and legend I must say they did a pretty darn good job!The language spoken by the Vikings was mostly Norwegian. While one of the 12 spoke it with a Danish accent and at least 5 or 6 others had quite strong American accents it was still mostly accurate. The only problem with this is that the true language of the Norsemen/Vikings wasn't really Norwegian as we know and speak it today. It was a very Old Norwegian much more similar (I assume) to Danish while yet very different from both languages. However, giving credit they probably could not have made an accurate imitation of it and if they did it would have been so unintelligible that we couldn't have understood it nor could they have found actors to accurately portray it.The costume detail was terrific! I loved the armor and weaponry used by the Vikings. Their ships were also quite realistic and true to history. One thing I really appreciated was the strange rituals and superstitions of the Vikings. The way they ""buried"" the Viking's leader in the beginning by sending him out in his ship along with his armor and sword and burned it (the ship) is 100% true to legends. In addition they sent a young maiden (likely a virgin) along with him for this ""journey to paradise"" which is also Norse folklore. Also many of their sayings and habits were typical of this culture - especially for back then. Basically I was very impressed with the consistency. What some people may call a lack of plot I call a cleaver and unique story with a historical background without the need for an excessive abundance of plot twists and Hollywood fluff. To my benefit I haven't the incredible book to taint my judgement. There are most certainly many differences and some may be disappointed (they always are) with the result, but frankly I can't see why they complain. This is the MOVIE VERSION!! Get over it!I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys a good action-thriller with a twist of historical nature. It's almost a combination of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and BRAVEHEART.Long live the VIKINGS!!",The 13th Warrior
107,shamsee,John McTiernan's worst effort ever!,4,20 January 2000,"Director John McTiernan is one of my all time favorite directors. After watching Thomas Crown Affair, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, my hopes and expectations were raised even higher. This is the guy  who gave us 'Die Hard', 'Predator', and 'Hunt for Red October'. If that was not enough, Antonio Banderas, who gave a tremendously entertaining performance in 'Mask of Zorro' further convinced me that it can't be bad.I was wrong in my calculations. John  McTiernan was inspired by some of his own previous work and sort of tried to combine 'Die Hard' (in the sense these 13 guys are sort of locked up in  a village) and 'Predator'(in the sense that their are man hunters, and people who collect skulls as a tribute to some diety). However, there are so many illogical inconsistencies that whatever one or two semi-decent action  sequences this movie has, can not make up for rest of the shortcomings.When the man-hunters attack for the second time at night, could someone explain to me why they just turned back and left? Were they on some kind of synchronized clock? The point at which they decided to quit was the time when they were about to complete victory.Second, It didn't really was made clear that they were actually man-eaters, or just using skulls for some pagan ritual. In addition, the hero of the movie, the 13th warrior really does not contribute anything additional to the mission. Also what's the deal with just 13. When the other side apparently has thousands, then shouldn't everybody be putting an effort to not get eaten or avoid having their skull used for decoration purposes?In beginning of the movie Director makes the point, the man-hunters are smart, as they not only camouflage well, but hide their tracks well. Then the director shows them as complete idiots, when it comes to launching an attack (which should not be the case for those who make their living hunting and killing). There are thousands of them, and why do they decide to cross into the village at the only spot where the remaining 5 or 6 guys were defending? Even animals, predators like wolves and rest of them have enough intelligence to surround, and plan their hunt etc. On one hand they are shown so smart that they never suffered a casualty for hundreds of years that could have revealed whether they were animals or men, and on the other hand they just run themselves into blades for no apparent reason.
In the end of the movie, the victory  comes in the form of killing of the evil female leader, and the strong male warrior leader. Once again its illogical to show that only those two guys were the source of inspiration for killing. After-all the plot indicates that they have been hunting for hundreds of years. That means there has been some continuity and power is inherited among them. Even in animal kingdom that happens everyday. However, according John McTiernan, those logical events do not apply here.
The biggest robbery in the movie is that in the commercial it was shown he fights for love and the beautiful Arab woman in  veil is shown. In reality, there is no romance or love, which makes the whole thing even more dry. You don't get the true feeling of adventure either as the final mission turns out to be easy. They track, go in, kill the leader, and get out.
A bad movie. I hope John McTiernan just turns the page over, and helps us forget about this effort.",The 13th Warrior
108,m_a_singer,I wish it were better,7,4 July 2007,"I'm honestly glad that some of what was in Crichton's book - like the Neanderthals - never made it to the screen. It's unfortunate that what did make it is pretty much nonsense. All of the Beowulf parallels are gone (they weren't very clear in the book, either), along with the personalities of most of the characters. The movie looks cheap and ugly, and things like the ""stand in a circle while they conveniently come at us from all sides in the round building"" bit are just laughable. The action is pure slop; it seriously looks like no one bothered to stage it.The one bright spot is Dennis Storhøi, whose sharp intelligence and joking comradeship with Antonio Banderas' petulant Ahmed Ibn Fadlan actually breathes some life into this mess. It's too bad that the Norwegian Storhøi, who followed this up with a performance as George in _Who's Afraid of Virigina Woolf?_ that won the Norwegian Theatre Critics Award (Teaterkritikerprisen), will likely never get another chance at an English-language film. He's good (and Banderas is better when around him) - the film is not.(After writing this review, I read complaints from several of the other Scandinavian actors that scenes explaining who their characters were and exploring their world and relationship with each other as a ""band"" were removed in favor of more ""action"" material from the Chichton-directed re-shoot after original director John McTiernan was fired. That just makes this even more of a failure.)Update 7/16/2017: I've since watched this several times again, and each time I gain more respect for what the film could have been.

Jerry Goldsmith's score is one of it's key strengths, providing the epic feel the film needs.Where it falls apart somewhat is the introduction of characters and subplots that prove to be totally irrelevant, and pointless, and seems merely a way to pad things out a bit.Still, it's a definite must-see for blokes.",The 13th Warrior

Fans of pre-firearm history are no doubt aware of the problematic quality of many Hollywood interpretations of a given period, and this film is by no means strictly accurate, but the ""feel"" of the film is better than average. While there is a bit of a ""low budget"" feel about the production, ultimately the problem with this film is not budgetary, but rather with the script, which is quite unjustifiably disjointed and stilted given the simple and exciting story.This film, is very good for it's ""action-sword"" genre, but will be preferred by fans of this sort of film, or by more casual viewers, rather than the tightly wound art film buff.",The 13th Warrior

""Hurry to meet death before your place is taken!"" And Buliwy to me is the greatest warrior ever pictured in cinema. For those who disagree, well, it's your right to do so, but I do enjoy the 13th warrior every time, and to Ebert: Please make sure you're watching the right movie!

116,Walle-2,Extremely entertaining,8,29 February 2000,"13th warrior has a good old story, it´s influenced on ""seven samurai"" and others. Good fights, nice surroundings. It´s starts off pretty scary when you first see the ""eaters of the dead"" after that hell just brake loose. A strange thing is the languages. It´s supposed to be norwegian or something like that, but they talk english so that ""we"" can understand it. But at first they talked the real language and that was kinda cool. The 13th warrior is for you that like the medival. It has many good fights and..well that´s about it. Extremely entertaining 9/10",The 13th Warrior

118,prudhoeboy,Lame Warrior,1,23 May 2010,"I'm a big Antonio Banderas fan, but this movie just didn't work for me. The acting wasn't bad, but the whole premise of the movie was preposterous. I've never heard of vikings in Vancouver, and there was nothing close to resembling ice or snow, just rain. The mystique of some fabled viking monster had initial appeal, but failed to materialize. What we ended up with was basically little more than a cowboys and Indians flick in the northwest. Memo to the writer: There were no cowboys and Indians battles in Vancouver. Never. Get it? And the warriors were so outnumbered, it there was no way they didn't end up in a gift shop. As good an actor as Banderas is, he just didn't seem to be into this movie. His theme seems to be hot-blooded latino, not Arab and not viking. I think he would rather have been in a bull fight movie or something. Or maybe the bogus factor of the movie was too much for him. His trying to convert the Vikings to Islam also seemed delusional. Da, I think the 13th warrior was supposed to become more like a Viking, no? Why in the heck would a Norseman care about Allah? And doesn't he know it's rude for a stranger to try to convert the host? He didn't even give them a chance to teach him some words, like a savante or something, he picked it up just sitting at the campfire and listening. Right. If the viking was visiting the Arab, he would have to sit polite and be taught their ways etc. So the movie tried to be politically correct or something. Yuck. And this movie rhymes with that. 1 out of 10, and no good excuses for this movie.",The 13th Warrior

120,kuner-59029,There's an amazing movie hidden here,8,23 August 2021,"This movie was butchered by the studio, had an unnecessary 2nd climax tacked on, filmed by another director after John McTiernan dropped out, had 30 minutes of its runtime cut, as entirely rescored, but still remains surprisingly watchable. This alone is testament to the talent of everyone involved.John McTiernan's assured direction, beautiful photography, narrative thrust and the spirited acting of almost all actors make this a joy to watch, despite its flaws.The unknown actors portraying the Vikings all shine in their roles, each using their limited screentime to the fullest, so we get a sense of their character. The 13 warrior gives us more characterization of its twelve Vikings in 90 minutes than Peter Jackson's Dwarves received in 9 hours of Hobbit trilogy.The movie starts off as a classic adventure film, with an Arab diplomat (Antonio Banderas) joining a group of Vikings on a quest to save a northern kingdom from a mysterious threat. The scenes of Banderas bonding with the Vikings and slowly earning their respect are flawless storytelling and endear all characters to the viewer.Sadly, as the movie progresses, the studio meddling becomes more and more apparent with subplots left unresolved for no apparent reason (the intrigue, the romance) and a ridiculous 2nd climax fight added, that renders the previous climax all but pointless.Here's hoping we will one day see the original ""Eaters of the Dead"" director's cut, which I suspect is far superior to the theatrical version. In this day and age of director's cuts, this is a movie that truly deserves to be revisited. One of the criminally underrated classics of the 90s.",The 13th Warrior

This is a spoiler, so please don't listen to me if you want to see this movie. A priest is basically forced to travel on a boat to fight a vicious enemy. The enemy is a lanky green woman who looks like she's on heroin. Her warriors are people running around with buffalo heads placed on their heads.

So I really loved this movie, It was the Great Adventure movie the kind that hasn't been made in a long time! Based on the Micheal Criton novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" Which was loosely based on the Norse (Viking)legend of Beowulf.
The acting, the directing, the plot were all good Inspite of what some IDIOTS have said. This movie is like a wild ride, it just gets better and better right up to the end.Maybe the people that hated it just weren't smart enough to understand Viking mythology, but maybe I'm being to harsh.

Even the wooden stockade and tall peaked houses were the same.  The fighters were not so sophisticated, but miraculously there were more of them left at the end, since there were thirteen instead of seven to start with.For a Nordic/Celtic fantasy battle film, it was more convincing than many - not that it made any sense.   It had great looking warriors, costumes, and sets, and some nice touches - learning Norse, the boy messenger.  I could watch more films shot in British Columbia!   I kept getting irritated by the cramped framing, but the general momentum of the picture was fine, with a nice shot of the boat in the fjord at the end.      Antonio Banderas doesn't much resemble an Arab, but he is cute as a button, so I'm not complaining, just so no-one tries to persuade me this was a *good* movie.",The 13th Warrior
127,Robert-132,A solid epic...,9,30 August 1999,"This is not a film that will appeal to everybody.  That has to be said first.  It is not because of acting; in fact, if you look, you'll see that there is some fairly good acting by the principles (who have all the screen time, so the bit parts don't really come out).  It is not because of the effects; the effects are actually quite good.  It is because this sort of story has never, to my knowledge, been told on the screen (and yes, I have seen Conan).The 13th Warrior is a proper Norse/Germanic epic.  It is filled with larger-than-life heroes, horrifying monsters, and lots of battle and glory. There is very little in the way of romantic interest, which is not surprising in the least.  The film is based on Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead, which is in turn based on Beowulf.And as a rendition of Beowulf, it is very well done.  Some vast liberties have been taken with the plot, but the spirit of the poem remains.  The story is told through the eyes of an Arab traveller (Antonio Banderas) who voyages to Hrothgar's hall of Heorot with twelve Vikings led by Buliwif, the son of Hygelac.  There they encounter the Wendel, bear-like monsters who are said to eat the bodies of the dead, and they battle both inside and outside of the hall.If I have any criticism of the film, it is that at times the battle scenes are so crowded that it is very difficult to keep track of what is going on. However, if you are a fan of Beowulf and Norse/Germanic epic, then this is a must see.  If not, then this will be a new and hopefully enjoyable experience.  One warning, however: it is quite gory.  4.5/5",The 13th Warrior

He survived to write about his adventure .. and so we know first hand, a little about Viking life.An attempt to tell the real story would have had some dramatic merit.

131,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of The 13th Warrior,8,8 February 2013,"13th Warrior is a 1999 action/horror film directed by John McTiernan. So the 13th warrior is based off a book called the ""Eaters of the Dead"" and I my self have never read the book. The film is about a banished poet who teams up with 12 viking warriors to travel to a distant land and banish an ancient evil. We are soon treated to some very cool action scenes involving the cannibals and the vikings. The film is silly yes but I think in this case all the actors turn in very some very impressive performances and it blends perfectly with the silly action. If I had one problem with this film it is that there is no real evidence of character development for Antonio Banderas's character,it just sort of happens. See this flick if you enjoy action movies like Aliens and Predator.Skip if you dislike silly action movies that are fun and bloody. 8.5/10",The 13th Warrior
132,El_Rey_De_Movies,Vikings set sail again!,7,3 November 2005,"Based on a novel by Michael Crichton, this is the story of a young Arab nobleman who spends too much time chasing someone else's wife and gets himself exiled as an ""ambassador"" to the savage northern barbarians known as Vikings. It then turns into a saga of nobility and heroic self-sacrifice as thirteen warriors are sent to battle something that is so vile, so horrible, so evil that people are afraid to even speak its' name. It's got some definite parallels to the classic story of Beowulf, one of the earliest sagas to come from Northern Europe. It's a rugged and manly story, showing both the waste and futility of war while also showing that armed conflict can bring out the bravest and noblest sentiments in a man. It's got a great performance by Banderas, a solid cameo from Omar Sharif, and the baddest Viking warriors the screen has ever seen. A solid adventure movie, very entertaining with a surprisingly moving ending.",The 13th Warrior
133,LordBlacklist,"Good enough for what it is, fascinating for what it could have been.",8,8 February 2006,"This is an extremely well crafted film, but a poorly edited one. Much like The Ghost and the Darkness it has such a winning historical concept that it is easy to forgive a little narrative incoherency from time to time. This film is a bit muddled when it comes to plot and characterization but hits all the right notes in terms of creating an adventurous spirit and thrilling action sequences. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a real high point, as is the cinematography. This is an absolutely wonderful film to get all caught up in on a lonely night because it makes you feel as if you are on the journey with Banderas' character. It is an action thriller that is actually...thrilling. In particular the scene with the ""fire dragon"" is one of the more memorable battle sequences I have seen in any movie, and I really mean that. The only negative aspects of the film are the feeling that a lot of scenes were left on the editing room floor, which is true, and if there was ever a film that really deserved a director's cut this is certainly one of them so long as Jerry Goldsmith's music (the soul of the picture) remains in. (Greame Revell composed a score for the unreleased longer version, which I have heard and in no way compares to Goldsmith's thunderous adventure music). The lavish costumes, set designs, memorable characters, and brilliant camera work somehow allow this film to overcome its editorial handicaps. All being said, this is a film well worth watching.",The 13th Warrior

It found its way onto more than a few Worst of the Year lists and was generally ignored by the public.I enjoyed Crichton's book and the movie was quite faithful to it. Some parts regarding the eaters of the dead were a little silly, but hey, no more so than most of the stuff we're expected to buy from any other movie.
On the whole, it was genuinely funny and the sword-fighting action quality was a treat after countless Hercules cheese-fests. I was also totally satisfied with the way the movie handled the language problem. Although I wondered how Antonio learned the viking word for ""grape,"" once again, a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way. This isn't a historical drama here, folks, but it is a satisfying two hours.",The 13th Warrior

It is not a deep character film. Rather it is a true adventure film full of action and tongue in cheek dialog that tells it's viewers that although the characters are all warriors they have more going on in their heads and hearts. It's enough to sympathize with the characters.

Fact is ""The 13th Warrior"" works. And if there ever was an adult boy´s own film, this is it. The direction (whether by McTiernan or Crichton) knows how to handle adventure and the grim photography reminds one at the same moment that these were hard times for anyone around.

It's fabulous in my opinion. Fast paced, but not too fast,with great scenic shots. I don't like the modern MTV-Style of editing with its fast cuts and sweeps. I like it a bit more subtle. And this is done here. The scene at the watchtower for example, esp. the moment when the camera lingers a moment on Banderas, when he is looking for the mist. Great! Second, the scenery and production design. These guys should be very proud. Apart from one type of armor (Helfdane the fat), which is a bit too modern (It looks like a Spanish Conquistador-Armor), all look very neat and stylish (As a Live-role-player I have to say, I envy Bullwyf for his cloak). The weapons look real and authentic too. The buildings in the village and the great hall look like original replicas they have in Scandinavian museums. Third, the cast. Perfectly cast through all roles. My personal favourites are Diane Venora as the Queen, Sven Wollter as King Hrothgar and Kulich as Bulwyf. But all the others deliver peak performances. Last but not least is the script. I read the book ""Eater of the dead"" before I saw the movie. I liked the story and used it in several P&P RPG-sessions but after the film...whoooah. They took all, that is possible to put in the movie and made that movie. Personally, I rate the movie better than the book...no, not better, more entertaining, since the book is more of a documentary.",The 13th Warrior
139,Movie-Man,Why?,3,9 September 2002,"Includes SPOILER!I think I saw this movie with a fairly open mind. That means that I'm usually interested in the things on could hope for in the story. The Problem is that it never gets anywhere, all of the great potential the storyline has becomes totaly vanished. For example: there was great potential to be gain from the fact that there were different cultures involved, but except for a few minor (and very easily solved matters) the movie maker doesn't take advantage of this.There is also the problem with the eaters of the dead, ok, they're dressed up as bears... but WHY? Nothing ever covered this. What was the mystery with their mother? Why did they scatter when the leader was killed? This things in the plot would make the whole movie a lot more dense and three-dimentional. As it is now it's hardly two-dementional.I think the story-line is too thin for this to ever work.

141,StevinTasker,Cracking yarn,8,29 November 2005,"I found this troubled production to be hugely entertaining and it is one I enjoy watching time and again. The basic idea is that Ibin (Antonio Banderas) is a wealthy Arab. A well educated man whose elitist (he walks palatial halls) and scholarly (he describes himself as a poet) lifestyle comes to a steady halt due to him being exiled by the Caliph for being a little too ""friendly"" with a married woman.Exiled far to the North with a small entourage including (Omar Sharif) he happens upon a camp of Vikings or ""Northmen"" where he witnesses the ritual burial of a king and the rather swift and violent election of a new leader! A messenger arrives at the camp and 13 warriors are called for to travel back to their homeland to a kingdom besieged by beasts. As one of the warriors must not be a Northman Ibin is coerced to join this ""task force"".I enjoyed the visual poetry as well as the musical score, I found each to be very rich and whilst there wasn't much time spent on character development I found I could engage with and care for what was on offer.During the arduous journey (a lengthy passage of time condensed for movieland) Ibin passes the time by watching and listening to his compatriots; we see that these north men are a fairly robust but amiable bunch as they poke fun at each other and talk about their wifes and lives. As an educated fellow skilled in language and writing Ibin manages to communicate with his compatriots and at the end of the long, did I mention, long, journey he learns to speaka de lingo (so to speak).Upon arrival at the homeland the 13 warriors find that they are up against a bear worshipping tribe which they can only stop by killing the Witch / Mother and the tribal Leader. Whilst achieving their goal we are treated to a mixture of myth, legend, action, and adventure, all wrapped up in great cinematography and music.That said, the film undoubtedly has flaws, the unfinished plot line concerning the Kings son is unforgivable for a major studio and I echo those comments calling for a directors cut.Even with its flaws, it beats many other films hands down and is a welcome addition to the genre.",The 13th Warrior
142,severin72,Keeps getting better with each viewing,9,29 December 2006,"This film makes one wonder what would have happened if, after the superb understated little gem that was ""Nomads"" Mctiernan had made something other than ""Die Hard"". Apparently assorted screenplays for an adaptation of Michael Crichton's pseudo-historical novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" had been knocking around Hollywood for years before Crichton's name become forever associated with ""Jurassic Park"". At that point the smell of money began to emanate from the project and so, away we went. This could very easily have been awful. That it is actually an emotionally and structurally complete and satisfying film is, in no small part, due to its respectful and level-headed treatment of two disparate and under-explored cultures, both foreign to western audiences namely Umayad Arab and Viking. Anonio Banderas is as good as he has ever been as Ibn Fahdlan, an unwilling ambassador to the Norsemen who finds himself part of a band of unusually believable heroes defending a crumbling Scandanavian kingdom against a possibly supernatural menace. The casting of (to Americans at least) unknown European actors as the viking warriors is key to making them seem to be so real and thus to committing the audience to their fate. Czech actor Vladimir Kulich as leader Buliwyf is a dominating presence and equal credit goes to the Norwegian Dennis Storhoi as the charmingly phlegmatic Herger the Joyous. Accepting that, at some level, this is ""The Seven Samuraii"" with longboats this is an original and entertaining experience. McTiernan, making intelligent use of night and a rain machine, films some of the better battle sequences in recent memory. He also presides over the most thoughtful (if not totally plausible) handling of different languages that I can recall seeing. It's sort of the next logical step from his transitioning from Russian to English on board the Red October. An interesting tale in a gorgeous and well thought-out historical context.

I am not telling you what it is. It has so many great actors in it, Antonio Banderas, and Omar Shariff and others that I had seen in other movies. It is a bit like Braveheart in that it shows the hard life these people lived, but also how they were such robust and courageous men who were Not Afraid of Anyone or thing. It was really an awesome movie. I did like how tough the men were and strong, and never backing down. It portrays Vikings as men that one did not trifle with.

But the thinking of many of those who think about this stuff is that he must have been irked at his hosts, because he's got the Vikes doing all sorts of unsanitary things, whereas in actuality they were among the cleanest people in the world. That spitting in the washbowl stuff? Nuh- uh. Behavior like that would have been grounds for combat and fines among Celts and Vikings alike. You could actually be fined if you didn't offer an arriving guest an immediate bath... So, lies. Or maybe the Vikings were putting the Arab on...And the ship-burial with attendant sacrificial maiden...maybe, maybe not. I think that Ahmed's diary is the first place where that prayer was written down, though, since the Vikings, like the Celts, were a non-writing, purely oral culture. Also, the tradition with both cultures was that the battle ended when the leader was killed, so the fact that the Wendol were shown fleeing after Hornboy bit the dust is accurate as well.As to the film itself, lovedlovedloved Dennis Storhoi and Vladimir Kulich. Banderas is wooden as ever, though it served him well here, and I was annoyed at the subplots (to do with the women, mostly) that didn't go anywhere. It didn't dawn on me for a while that Weilew was actually the queen, because women in Norse society had a lot of power and she looked pretty powerless. And the blonde who hooked up with Banderas's character kinda came and went out of nowhereland, too.Plus Neanderthals (if that's what they were supposed to be) didn't coexist with modern man--they were gone thirty thousand or more years ago---so not so much there either, and I doubt they'd have had organized cavalry even if they did.

Memorable characters, fantastic sets, cinematography and one of the most hard hitting soundtracks ever in a movie, but it should have been much more, as it is all over the place when it comes to editing. That though doesn't take away from the overall awesome experience you get from watching this cult classic.The inspiration for the movie - the novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" by Michael Chricton, is just as thrilling as the movie, yet the latter feels more tame and didn't expand on many things it tried to set up. We don't learn much about the warriors, which is a shame, because they all have very different personalities, and would have helped drive the narrative better. Almost none of the movie has any historically accurate stuff in it. The weapons, armor and animals are all over the place, taken from different cultures and time periods, they are all mixed up creating a pretty colorful group of fighters.Banderas really elevates his role, as he perfectly fills the shoes of the travelling arab, and the changes he goes through are belieavable, despite how rushed the plot is. The contrast between him and the northmen is huge, yet it only helps make The 13th Warrior even more interesting.",The 13th Warrior

The film is about a group of Vikings who recruit an Arab Ambassador (Banderas) to fight strange man eating creatures.  The movie has its moments of gory deaths, atmosphere and edge of the seat scenes (particularly when our heroes decide to go into the monsters den).Despite a rather rushed conclusion, overall, this is still a rather enjoyable flick and you wont feel you wasted time watching it.  If you're a Muslim, then I would certainly recommend you add it to your movie collection, as Hollywood rarely makes films for you.",The 13th Warrior
150,Erik G.,"Positive, spoilers",10,1 February 2000,"Awesome.  Those who grumbled about the 13th warrior, such as many movie critics, kept me from seeing it on the big screen, and now I regret it. Having seen the gorgeous DVD edition, I was very impressed with this movie. What I don't understand is why so many people didn't like it.But for now, anyway, I can snag the DVD and enjoy '13th warrior'.  Only the beginning is a little rocky.  As usual, a lot of plot has been condensed heavily--only McTeirnon decided to do it all at the beginning.  I haven't read Crichton's 'Eaters of the Dead' (thank goodness they changed the title), but you can tell a lot of ""book-to-movie"" plot trimming went on. Once the Arab Ahmed and his barbaric buddies get to the task of dealing with the Wendol, however, the plot pace becomes more even, and you get a great adventure.In case you are one of the few who didn't know, this story is a retelling of the old english poem Beowulf.Critics moaned about the over-simple plot a lot.  But considering the source material (which was VERY simplistic, but nonetheless exciting), I think Crichton did a fine job.  He reinvented Grendel and his mother, and added a band of viking warriors, and an arab scholar to make the story more realistic.  Not that that was necessary, but it gives everything a grittier feel.Once you realize that Ahmed is not actually the 'hero' of the film, and you recognize the obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's Seven Samurai film, I think you will probably enjoy the movie tremendously, but I warn you there are a lot of things this movie doesn't have:  It doesn't have any silly barbarian queens running around in cleavage revealing armor.  It doesn't have a muscle bound hero that spouts cute one-liners.  It doesn't have any modern sounding dialogue or obvious anachronisms, and it doesn't have any campy humor.  It doesn't have a lot of 'hip' actors playing themselves in costume, in fact most of the actors are unknowns, adding to their authenticity.What it does have is some utterly beautiful set pieces, and some heart stopping battles.  The fights are bloody, but like Braveheart, the camera does not linger on the carnage very long.  It has some cool undercurrents dealing with themes of fear, the nature of heroism, and some thoughts toward the harsh, brutal life of the Norsemen.",The 13th Warrior
151,Lumiere-5,"Take historical manuscript, mix with famous myth, stir",10,29 August 1999,"Awesome!  Totally awesome!  One of the most exhilarating movies I've ever seen!  Far better than any of the so-called blockbusters that crashed down upon us earlier this summer.  This was one cool film, and from one of my favorite books (usually when a book I love gets filmed, I want to puke).
Crichton takes the manuscript of Ibn Fadhlan (one of the most important documents in history, an eyewitness account of Vikings by an Arab diplomat who was kidnapped by them while on a mission to the Bulgars--from which anthropologists got the eyewitness account of a Viking funeral) and combines it with the story of Beowulf, changed a bit to make the monsters into men. Parts of the book has been changed to make them more visual for the film, but the result is an amazing array of images masterfully woven into a rich tapestry of 10th Century heroism.  Okay, the armor sucks--there's no reason to put Buliwyf/Beowulf into gothic plate other then to give the film a Boris Valejo flare.  Other then that, however, it is truly stunning.  There is a sense here both of the barbarism of the Vikings as Ibn Fadhlan first encounters them, and the heroism and spirit he finds as he gets to know them and, eventually, becomes one of them.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant!",The 13th Warrior

(Even though the bad guys are goddess-worshipping, vicious decapitators. This seems like an unnecessarily mean-spirited dig at those who would romantically imagine that all goddess-worshippers are peaceful and admirable vegetarian types. On the other hand, every stereotype needs a good, sharp poke to deflate it now and then.) The film came to my attention when a university professor (can't remember the name) was on the radio talking about his two decades-long quest to find a film, any film, that had a positive Moslem character in it. He viewed hundreds of English-language films with Moslem characters, and found a grand total of two. The Thirteenth Warrior was one of them.I was also very impressed that they got the horses right. Such films NEVER get the horses right - but in this film, they ride exactly the type of horse that would have been found there at the time, even though they might look a bit funny, with big guys on little horses.",The 13th Warrior

The worst part about this movie was the fact that there were so many holes left in the plot after the movie.  Right after Banderas found out he was ""The Thirteenth Warrior,"" in the next scene you see him going out with the other twelve warriors, not even questioning a thing!  This is definitely one movie that falls dead.  If you are looking for a nice gory movie with an actual plot inside it as well, go rent Braveheart.

Everyone here mentions Banderas, Sharif, and Kulich but I'd also like to given a shout-out to Dennis Storhøi, who completely captivated me.The thing I love is the twofold culture clash story. Cultured, intellectual Arab encounters Vikings; they learn how to be friends and work together in the face of a deeper culture clash with a last, remnant population of Neandertals. (""Has anyone seen one in A HUNDRED YEARS?"" Such a great moment.)Laid over that are varied, wonderful characters as amazing (and more vivid, because possible) as any fictitious fellowship. Don't get me wrong, I love Tolkien. I just think these heroes are likewise delightful.Well crafted, paced, and acted story with an outstanding soundtrack from the great Jerry Goldsmith. I suspect it was disdained in the '90s because of some overt violence (nothing compared to American Horror Story or the like nowadays) and a lack of trust in how smart and capable people can be. Also because most reviewers probably did not suss out the Beowulf-vs-Grendel, Beowulf-vs-Grendel's-mom story, nor the Neandertal aspect.The only carp I can see is that visually we didn't see Neandertals-but that might have been from evolving to live off less.

I've watched it at least a few dozen times over the years.There is only one thing that bothers me about this movie. The ""Eaters of the Dead"" have many horses, and their home is not very far from the Viking settlement. The horses would need to graze, and that many would be almost impossible to keep hidden from anyone within a wide radius of their cave. It would certainly be impossible to keep them hidden for a long time. If they were to keep them in the cave 24/7 and bring them food, they'd be weak, tired beasts and not suitable for riding into battle. This is easy to overlook because the movie is fantastic.I love the atmosphere, the meeting of ancient cultures, the way that they learn from each other, their interactions and character development.

It could be compared to the philosophy at the heart of the movie, ""Camelot"": for one brief shining moment an apex is attained. Dennis Stohoi's Herger the Joyous in ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" accomplished that.It is also a travesty that such a performance is not given its full recognition and stature in the world of film-making.

The story really sucks. When they said there was ""an evil that can not be named"" I thought they'd have to face a dangerous, supernatural evil force.

I mean, how could they be hiding if there were thousands of them, along with a horse for each one? Who said Antonio Banderas was the leading character? and who thought he looks like an Arab?But the worst thing is the photography work. I've been in the production of school short films myself, and I bet our work was way better than this trash.In the same scene you can see at least three variations in color. Some of the night scenes were so bad you can't see anything but a huge blur. And some day scenes are all burned out! The editing in the battle sequences is terrible.

They just hit him off his horse as if they were playing baseball. And the story itself was too corney. The part where Antonio Banderas learns the Vikings language in one night really didn't make any sence. It was stupid. When you think about it, the story was good, so was the plot, but it just wasn't done right.

Here is the true story of this great scientist (Ahmed Ibn Fadlan).,5,13 October 2019,"Ahmed bin Fadlan is a well-known Islamic scholar in Islamic history. He was a writer, geographer, and explorer dating back to the tenth century. He wrote his description of his journey as a member of the Abbasid caliphate embassy
About the Muslim traveler Ahmed bin Fadlan:-
His full name is Ahmad Ibn Al-Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hammad Al-Baghdadi. He was known as Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, born in 877 in Baghdad, and died in 960.
Ahmad Ibn Fadlan gave the oldest description of Russia in 922, and the scholar Ahmad bin Fadlan visited Russia with a message from the Abbasid caliphate. When Ibn Fadlan arrived in Bulgaria in 922, contemporary Tatarstan took this day to celebrate, and made it an official holiday. Ahmed bin Fadlan was not only a talented man or a political statesman, but he was in front of his eyes behind the unique scenes, and was always preoccupied with his mind analysis without monitoring. He worked for a long time about ten years right assistant to the military commander Mohammed bin Suleiman, and learned in this period of him a lot through contact with different peoples, until he reached the Abbasid caliph (Muqtadir Billah) as a jurist in the state and Islamic researcher. The scholar Bin Fadlan continued to be promoted in the court of the Caliph Muqtadir Billah, and at the time of the arrival of a letter from the Bulgarians at the request of an embassy sent by the Caliph to Bulgaria to explain the principles of the Islamic religion there; The lawsuit's journey to Islam, which was supported by Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, moved from Russia, Iraq, Iran, to Central Asia, to Bulgarian countries, to Russian territory, to the Caspian kingdom, and to the Scandinavian peninsula at the North Pole.
The West admitted that this journey made rare cultural discoveries, and the name of Ibn Fadlan existed in bold letters in the history of the arrival between Islam and the modern world. Ibn Fadlan described Russia When he was present in Russia, he gave an accurate description of the land of Russians, and described everything that exists in this country; he described their men, the status of women, the population, the way of life, the burial of the dead, beliefs in God, and other Things that are in Russia. He also talked a lot about building wooden houses in Russia and worshiping idols, Russian merchants' fondness for dinars, silver dirhams, funeral ceremonies, and cremation in boats. Some sayings of Ibn Fadlan about Russia, The most famous of his words (and the jewelers have green beads of porcelain, which is on the vessels exaggerate, and buy bead beaded dirhams, and make jewelry for women). (If they hit a thief, they brought him to a large tree, tightened a tight rope in his neck, hung him in it, and remained suspended until he was cut off by the wind and rain.) He says about their king (the king does not come down from his bed, if he wanted to spend a need, he was doing in a bowl, and has a commander who heads armies and faces enemies, and takes care of the affairs of the people).
The impact of Ahmed bin Fadlan on the general culture:-
The journey of the Islamic scholar Ben Fadlan was the basis of the novel written by Michael Crighton, called the ""Eaters of the Dead"".
A book was published about the biography of Ahmed Ibn Fadlan called (The Adventures of the Ambassador of the Arabs) by the writer Ahmed bin Salam Al-Bakali, and a Syrian TV series called (Roof of the World) talks about the adventures of Muslim traveler Ahmed Ibn Fadlan without falsification, distortion or fraud.

The film's best attribute however, is that if you search beneath the surface it actually has some interesting things to say about the power of language and especially the written word as it relates to the remembrance of greatness.

177,myspiderungoliant,The best adaptation of Beowulf to date,10,20 November 2007,"Many years ago, when Michael Chrichton was in an English literature class, his professor briefly covered Beowulf and commented on how almost no one read the epic poem any more. Well that got Michael and his friends talking and one of them dared him to write his own telling of Beowulf. Michael Chrichton did so and produced a book called ""The Eaters of the Dead"" and as a result we have The Thirteenth Warrior, possibly the most accurate Beowulf depiction despite the fact that the names of characters and places only sound like the ones from the poem.I like this movie for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Vikings are depicted rather accurately and the depiction of their religious beliefs is actually pretty spot on. I like this movie because it is almost 90% accurate to the original book. It has a much more ""real"" feel to it than many other movies set in medieval times.I would also be so bold as to suggest that this is Antonio Banderas' best performance. As Ibn-Fadlan he gives a rather good portrayal as an Arabian poet who finds himself dropped into the middle of a culture that he cannot understand but eventually comes to respect.""Lo there do I see my father! Lo there do I see my mother and my brothers and my sisters! Lo there do I see the line of my ancestors, back to the beginning.

To me both movies are now of a rare kind - mesmerizing, strangely unique, hypnotic. For no matter how many times they put it on some TV program I always stay there being swallowed by its charm. I mean - isn't it strange that Antonio Banderas, who in my opinion ruined a promising career after a splendid international start (Mambo Kings) raises high with his Arab part. Don't you agree it took guts and charisma to stand above all those never-before-in-film perfect and powerful Vikings? Just like Richard Gere ""dancing"" on an equal footing with an acting greatness of Laura Linney in the Mothman.

179,dark-10,A VERY weak version of Braveheart,1,30 August 1999,"Are you people kidding me!?!?!?!? i didn't pay to see this movie and i STILL thought it was bad!! i was amazed to see its average at 6.7!!! i thought giving it a 6 would be generous!! this movie is all in all WEAK. the love story went nowhere (i've been more affectionate with just friends), the intro of y antonio is exiled should be elaborated....crikey! let me catch my breath. ok, the kings son has no place in this story. they make it seem like he's gonna be this problem (they went as far makin a fight scene where one of the warriors kills one of his men) but he has no place in the story after the intial arguments!! geez, if they needed to take up screen time they could've told more about the love interest, or maybe antonio's motivation for the mission. i mean really, some witch says ""the last warrior has to be a foreigner"" so antonio goes along with an ""oh well, i guess thats me"" attitude. what does he care to save a village he has absolutely no affiliation with (or even heard of)!?!?!? he was picked out of the hat and we're supposed to beleive he's fighting with as much passion as william wallace does for his country??? and thats another thing, in the begining we're told he's this preppy, manicurist pretty boy who doesn't know how to fight. there's a scene where he's trying to sharpen wood with his sword and he can't even take a swing without falling over. but then a few min later when he polishes his sword into an arabian crescent blade, he becomes jet li's master with a weapon!! *takes a drink of water* Not to mention the weak showdowns of this flick. One warrior kills the mother witch (who fights with a 3 inch bone in her hand) in like 20 sec., and amid a battle scene, the same warrior simply knocks the leader off his horse and stabs him, and thats it!!! how unclimactic!!!!!! man, i for one have very low standards, so u know when i say a movie is bad, it very bad. anyone who says this one is good, already had posters of antonio all over their ceiling.",The 13th Warrior
180,imdb-211,"Lots of promise, but too short",3,10 February 2002,"I really want to like this movie. It shows lots of promise, the scenery is beautiful and the actors are first rate. Unfortunately, it falls short on a few fronts:First, the movie is just too short. A lot of the story just doesn't make sense. I guess the book is more elaborate, but the movie should at least be twice as long to help give the story some kind of flow instead of making it look like more or less unrelated scenes stitched together.And then there are the fight scenes. They're just no good. Nowadays that we have movies like The Matrix, fight scenes that change so quickly that you have no idea what's going on just doesn't cut it anymore. I had no idea what was going on during the fights, who was fighting against whom or why anything was happening at all (actually, I had that feeling during most of the movie).If you have an hour and a half to waste and this movie is on TV, by all means watch it, but don't bother buying or renting the DVD.",The 13th Warrior
181,bdiebold,An absolutely terrific movie,10,4 July 2002,"This is a quietly great movie. Terrific cast. Banderas isn't at all bad, but his co-stars steal the show, especially Vladimir Kulich. This movie bears watching over and over again; the details are terrific and the performances totally on key.",The 13th Warrior
182,bdiebold,A few comments (long),10,26 September 2002,"I feel the need to comment to a few of the reviews I read from the first page, which I must say were totally off-base.A few notes, at random, and in no particular order.Several reviewers are evidently confused about the relationship of the movie to a textual source. Specifically, they don't get the point, because they misunderstand what it's trying to do. The movie is based on the novel ""Eaters of the Dead"", by Michael Crichton. This novel is a fictionalized history, written in the form of an epic translation (which it isn't), and recounts what happens when a group of Norsemen, accompanied by an Arab observer end up at war with a remnant population of Neandertals. Yes, Neandertals. It's not completely ridiculous, though the most recent evidence for neandertals that I know of (I'm an archaeologist) in northern Europe is about 25k before present. It didn't happen -- it's just Crichton's device, and it's a fun one. Neandertals are very close to modern people, but not the same. They are in some sense Other, and to xenophobes like medieval Norse they must have seemed, well, something like Grendel is discribed in Beowulf. When Crichton wrote this, originally in the 1970s, even less was known of Neandertals than now, thus the brutish characterization, exaggerated a bit by the movie.Once this background is adequately understood, several criticisms should disappear:A. One reviewer complains that the movie isn't faithful enough to the original text, apparently believing in this case the text written by Ahmed ibn-Fahlan, and published a few years ago. This reviewer appears unaware that this is a literary conceit on the part of the actual author, Michael Crichton.B. Meanwhile, a second reviewer complains that the movie is insufficiently close to the Beowulf myth. As implied by the above, this criticism goes nowhere, because it is not a simple retelling of Beowulf. ""Eaters of the Dead"" is Crichton's effort to fictionally historicize Beowulf by placing it in the context of a struggle of Norse against a remnant population of neandertals. ""The 13th Warrior"" is a pretty accurate retelling of the encounter as envisioned by Crichton, and its relationship to Beowulf is as tangential as Crichton's.C. A review complains about the ragged mobs of bad guys, clad in bear skins for no good reason. The reason is that there is good evidence to suppose Neandertals had a ritual life oriented in some way around cave bears. They might be ragged mobs because the book, and movie, are emphasizing their primitiveness, relative to the modern humans they are fighting. I had more difficulty with Neandertal cavalry, but there isn't any particular reason to believe a remnant population of Neandertals couldn't observe the use of domesticated horses, steal some, and figure it out from there.D. I didn't think that was the lamest love interest subplot ever by far. First, the woman was gorgeous, so it can't be a waste. (heh, okay) Second, it underscores the relatively casual attitude of the norse toward sex, especially as initiated by women. This is obviously not a universal trait in medieval western cultures, and is a nice historical touch. It would have been sappier if he'd stayed or she'd followed, but neither happens. It's a moment of comfort and connection in a hopeless situation, and works well in that context.E. We have no idea how a complex Neandertal society might work -- there's no evidence to suggest they might ever have had one. For them to coalesce briefly around a few charismatic leaders, and disperse when those leaders die, is no stretch at all. In fact, it's the most likely scenario. I'm not that'd happen in the middle of a battle, but maybe it would. Who knows? After all, if they had a structured society that *didn't* depend on the presence of charismatic leaders, they'd be more visible in the archaeological record, and might have been more of a threat. It'd be a different situation, certainly. Anyway, it's Crichton's story and it works.I have no particular rebuttal to those who didn't like the characters or the acting or whatever, except to say I think they're dead wrong. And the reviewer suggesting this as MST2K material ... well...evidently doesn't know much about 13th Warrior OR MST2K. (Trying to be nice here). Hint: MST2K makes fun of *bad* movies, not good ones. I love the characters and thought the chemistry was terrific. Visually, it's stunning.The movie just works great on a lot of levels. It's just a quietly great movie. Certainly on my top 10 list, and probably top 5. A lot of my friends avoided it in the theater, but when I show them the video, I haven't seen anyone not like it. I think it will have a solid second life. It should.(Apologies for length)",The 13th Warrior

My only complaint is that the film was too short and the action sequences ended too quickly.Ahmed is nicely portrayed by Antonio Banderas with a believable Arabian accent. Tony Curran gives a strong and humorous performance. The actors' abilities were just as beautiful as the landscape. I don't know where this film was made, but the haunting scenery was scary.Each character is deeply developed. With a flick of an eyelid, or a tightening of the lips, the emotions come across clearly and expressively. Most films these days like to portray ""bad-guy-is-Muslim"" kind of attitudes which are frankly easy and redundant. This story had a completely different premise. The dialogues were thoughtfully scripted, with open-minded approaches to both cultures. I appreciated this film, and I think many people who enjoyed ""Gladiator"" will also like this film. I hope there will be another adventure with Ahmed Ibn Falad and that red-flaming haired Tony Curran! 9/10.",The 13th Warrior

In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Die Hard 3 in that it was really good until the last act. Not that the last act was bad, but the most important rule for great action flicks is, don't peak until the end... This movie however had a great action sequence at the end of the second act, but the third act is basically two action sequences, that although not bad, they don't match let alone equal what we've already seen...If you're not convinced about the need for action flicks to peak at the end, go watch any James Cameron Flick to see how its done...

192,diva-19,WHEN MEN WERE MEN,4,11 September 1999,"Another film in the style of ""Bravehart"" and all.The story is some confused tale of an Arab hooked up with Norsemen to protect some tribe that is being seriously put upon by guys with Grizzly Bear headresses.Valhalla is mentioned a couple of times in the script giving the film mythological barings (no pun intended);however,Richard Wagner did it better; as did George Lucas with the original ""Star Wars"".The script is hopeless and the performances are adequate for the drama on hand.The first hour is tedious; the second hour moves well. Banderas, in the lead,does a fine job of looking concerned.He should be considering his recent track record of films.Is this actor deliberately trying to kill a career or what? He has made some good pics, but not for some time.This go around, his character is a void in the middle of the film with no motivating force whatsoever. ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" is not a complete waste of time, though. Cinematography, sets,fur costumes (not an animal rights film - plus horses take quite a beating in the battle scenes) and special effects are all very good.The battle scenes are fun with beheadings and blood spurting all over everyone and not really disturbing, because this movie never becomes at all personal and never gets one emotionally involved. It's distant and theatrical; kind of like a video game.The scenery is great with lots of mist. Check out the great line of fire (torches) as the bear warriors on horseback ride out of the valley to do battle.

196,Contra-2,Long + Boring + Silly Writing < Good Action Film,4,19 April 2001,"It never ceases to amaze me that a studio can spend $100 mil on a movie, and seemingly forget to pay somebody to write a decent screenplay. In this case, the writers seem to have spent their time trying to figure out how to write around some awkward constructs that didn't make much sense in the first place. For example, when the director tires of hearing all this foreign language stuff, he needs the main character to start speaking their language. Solution: the main character learns this foreign language, apparently perfectly, in one night, by `listening'. Say what you will about the `universal translator' in Star Trek, at least it avoids this kind of stupidity.Unfortunately, holes abound throughout the story. At several points, effort is made to show the viewer that the mythical aspects of the enemy are just that, mythical, and we get to see the trick, i.e. the scary bear teeth is just a mask, the glow worm is actually cavalry with torches, and so on. But all of this is undone at a stroke when all of the dead bad guys disappear like a wisp of smoke.

The story line is explained in far more detail (of course) and the fact that Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan is in fact a real historical figure is one of the most fascinating aspects of the book.  Despite the fact that Antonio Banderas cannot escape his Spanish accent (making him a very unique Arab) I found the film fascinating.  The only drawback for me was the fact that I know intimately the area where they filmed it, loosing a little of the romance of it for me. 
The whole thing was a very satisfying adaptation of a fascinating story.  If you enjoy the film, read the book, if you liked the book, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the film. All in all a good film.",The 13th Warrior
198,Don_Mac,The Best Action Movie of 1999 and the Best Viking Movie Ever,8,1 February 2000,"This film got very mixed reviews when it was released - I saw some critics give it the highest marks while others trashed it as, in their opinions, one of the worst films of the year.  I personally agree with the critics who liked this film and think its the best movie ever made about the Vikings (although there, unfortunately, aren't many other Viking films for comparison) and I think it will grow in popularity over time like other unique films that initially failed with critics and at the box office (like ""Blade Runner"").  This is a pure testosterone movie that tells, through the eyes of an Arabian poet, the story of Vikings fighting against a mysterious and cannibalistic tribe.  Based on an older Michael Crichton novel called ""The Eaters of the Dead,"" this movie takes itself seriously - no wisecracking sidekicks or other dumb movie cliches are to be found here (which, inexplicably, was something the critics who hated the movie complained about - I guess they prefer every action/adventure movie to be campy and tongue-in-cheek like ""Congo"" or ""The Mummy"").  And, by taking itself seriously, the nobility of the Vikings and their code of honor comes through strongly by the end of the film.  If I had to criticize anything in the film, its that the battle scenes are too dark and hard-to-see.  While I greatly admire naturally-lit films, and these scenes do capture what a fight in the dark of night without artificial lighting would be like, I think they should have bend a bit towards standard movie convention and used more lighting in these scenes.  Still, despite that complaint, this is the best action film of 1999 and it is definitely worth a look (8/10 stars).",The 13th Warrior
199,Everwas,Failed to live up to potential - Read the book instead,3,9 June 2000,"I have to admit that I enjoyed several of the clever aspects of this film. However, you're much better off getting these entertaining events from the book by Michael Chrichton than by seeing the movie.  This is because the movie is incredibly boring at times (especially the first several minutes), the end of the film is immediate and unsatisfying, and because Antonio Banderas just doesn't fit the lead role (is he Spaniard-Arabic or Arabic-Spaniard?).  I almost think this a movie that shouldn't be a movie. It just doesn't entertain like a movie, and if it doesn't entertain and doesn't accomplish some social commentary or other worthy goal, why make it--or, more importantly, why see it?

Whilst this recent offering is not nearly as bad as his almost unforgivable Last Action Hero, The 13th Warrior is one that should be watched and discarded without much ado. Suspension of disbelief was difficult to maintain, not least due to the almost laughable range of accents adopted by the principal characters. We'd expect that with Banderas who has, to his credit never attempted to disguise his latin tones, but the ""Northmen"" discuss their business in a dreadful mish-mash of Eastern European, Scottish, Irish and Cockney which, towards the end of the movie, I found increasingly irritating.Michael Crichton's book ""The Eaters of the Dead"" , on which the movie was based, made much more of Ahmed's problems in adjusting to the cultural, religious and philisophical differences between his own race and the Northmen and even allowing for the fact that time and script constraints mean that such subjects cannot be fully explored in the movie, one comes away with a feeling that the entire opening hour of the movie serves no purpose other than to set the scene for the battle. Lastly, I should say that while I'm no fan of Antonio Banderas he does bring a pleasing presence and subtle humour to a movie that, in almost every other way, lacks substance.",The 13th Warrior

It's not that this is a bad movie--it's watchable.  Rather the problem is that things get smooshed together and made into a plot with little to no explanation.  How did this Arab ex-poet fall in with Vikings? How was he able to learn their language by listening?  Why didn't he ditch his customary gear for something that would help him fit in?

The Northmen are an amusing and intimidating bunch, although they look a little old, with exception to Banderas and Dennis Storhoi, who is excellent in his Hollywood debut the Northmen are well over 6 fee tall. The Wendols are appropriately murky and misty, the action is quite good. The performances are fairly good with exception to Diane Venora, and Omar Shariff, who exits quickly after picking up a nice paycheck. Vladimir Kulich, makes a great action hero without saying much. His imposing prescence and heroic performance are the best thing about the movie. Maybe only Arnold could have played a better Buliwyf. The film was delayed for about 2 years and Michael Critchton stepped in to do reshoots. The re-edited Critchton version is shorter than the McTiernan cut, which was released.

For example the heir apparent who supposedly fears the 13 warriors wants to take over his father land. What happened to him!!!It also seems to be an over glorification of Islam and not particularly historically correct. The Arabs were far more advanced than the Vikings, however this potrayal was poor.Basically I can't believe such a rubbishy film is financed by Hollywood. It makes you wonder about whether the production crew even went to film school.  It probably should have gone straight to video. The only thing i thought that was Ok was the casting of the fearless King and the respect his men had for him towards the end of the film.

210,Alfonse,Braveheart meets the Magnificent Seven,6,13 September 1999,"After reading the novel by Michael Crichton I was surprised to hear that a film of the book was to be made (another Crichton book cash-in!!) given the nature of the story. The result is, however, a very enjoyable film full of epic battle scenes, old-style heroism and plenty of severed arms and flying heads. It's all very spectacular with hordes of heavily armed horsemen crashing through barricades and a suitably thrilling score to back it up - but my biggest problem is that although remaining faithful to the book, it doesn't really add anything, making the story appear a bit aimless and stilted. This is fine for the book, which is more of a diary of events but makes the film appear as more of a series of battle scenes rather than an involving tale. Despite this sentiment, I found the film to be thoroughly enjoyable and would urge anyone wanting a good adventure yarn to check this out. If you want a better viking flick, however, watch the Tony Curtis/Kirk Douglas effort, ""The Vikings"" made in 1958-  its got a better story and is ultimately more rewarding!",The 13th Warrior

I thought it was an interesting, original adventure of the kind that is rarely made anymore.
If I have any problem with the movie, it is that the characters are a tad underdeveloped. We learn more about them through their battle scenes than anywhere else. But I came out not even knowing most of the characters' names (save Antonio's), much less anything else about them. However, a few personalities do manage to shine through the mud and blood.If you're up for a rip-roaring adventure with an interesting story, I highly recommend this movie.",The 13th Warrior
212,Lucifer-23,"Good, but...",9,29 August 1999,"Although I truly enjoyed the 13th Warrior, I felt that they left a lot of conflicts unresolved. There are a few subplots that the writers touched on that seemed to go nowhere (like with the eldest son of the king, who just seems to disappear in the film) and left no motivation as to why the Wendol were even attacking the Vikings to begin with (outside of being a potential source of food, but they could have probably fared better by attacking less fortified villages). And why, if the Wendol had not been seen in almost one hundred years, would they suddenly reappear. I have a deep feeling that the reason rumors abound that the director wanted to take his name off of the picture is that he may have shot scenes to explain some of these plot holes, but they were cut out for time constraint reasons or they slowed the action down. Outside of plot complaints, there was little else to be upset about in this film. The cinematography was beautiful, the actors were good, and the action scenes were well-staged. Antonio Banderas did not hog the scenery, and some of the secondary characters were given ample screen time to make an impression, which is rare in film nowadays. There is little in-depth character development, but there is enough that you get to feel for some of the characters and hope they live until the end. The last major battle sequence was brutal and graphic, but well-made. All in all, not a perfect film, but much better than what I was expecting given the history of the film and the rumors surrounding it. Worth seeing at least once if you liked movies like Braveheart and the old Kirk Douglas film The Vikings.",The 13th Warrior
213,jazkat,Great potential never realized due to poor editing,7,1 November 2000,"Its definitely not Braveheart - not even close, but it could have been. The story has great potential, the cast turned in fantastic performances, the dialogue could have been beefed up but it kept the story entertaining, the narration was an essential element used well, the cinematography was captivating, battle scenes were well choreographed and filmed, poor set lighting often obscured characters and action but not a serious flaw, the story was choppy and had holes at times - most likely due to editing.From a critical view, this film was somewhat disappointing. It  could have been an epic adventure but clumsy editing took care of that. I did, however, enjoy it for its sheer action, heroics, and battle field entertainment value. I liked it and would recommend it to action/adventure fans. I would like to see a re-edited - director's cut version.",The 13th Warrior
214,filmboy303,Only movie that stays true to Crichton book,7,23 December 2000,"As a HUGE Michael Crichton fan, avid reader of all his works, I have been disappointed time after time when his novels are made into movies. Ex: Jurassic Park, Sphere, Congo, Rising Sun, are all terrible movies, despite big-budgets and A-list actors, that deviate horribly from Crichton's original vision.However, such as different with 13th Warrior, from veteran director John McTernin (Die-Hard,Thomas Crown Affair, Predator). This big-screen version of the short novel by Crichton originally titled ""Eaters of the Dead"", is the truest book to screen film I've encountered.With grand battle scenes and great looking cast, 13th Warrior is a true hero-adventure film, with all the perks that go along with it. Banderas is great, as usual, and the unknown cast that makes up the Viking warriors is equally good.Why audiences might be put out about is the jumpyness and uneven flow of the film. We get almost no perspective of the mysterious ""riders in the night"". This, along with all the jumpyness and weird-lack of movie closure-ending, is due to the way the book is written. Crichton simply elaborated on the already existing journal entries of the real Iban Flalad, who documented his journies and adventures in the 14th century.YES, this is a movie loosely based on the (historian-skeptical) true story of Iban Falad. Crichton simply gives it a few sprinkles here and there to make it more interesting. However, in writing it, he keeps true to the holes and loops that an unreligiously kept journal may yield... this also translates onto the big-screen.Bottom Line: You'll like this movie, not great, but good. But definitly read the book to appreciate the film.",The 13th Warrior
215,rockdude-68045,Consistently Refreshing!,9,10 December 2020,Let me start by saying this movie offers a lot of unique elements to the storyline. It has always been a staple movie in my catalogue to revisit when I need a solid movie. I enjoyed the movie because it has both progression of a storyline but also details to it. It's a fantasy action movie and should be treated as such. One major part of the character development that I always highly regarded was that he isn't some war hero or suddenly became this heroic warrior. Instead he slowly develops his skills from being novice to slightly above average thanks to help from his hero like friends. It's a piece of realism often forgotten in movies but in the context of this fantasy action movie it helps provide a sense of validity in the potential of this character and his story.This movie is easily one of my favorite movies to watch and is severely underrated! It does not deserve the low grading it has received by some. I think they either didn't understand the conceptual aspect of the movie or simply didn't care for a good reliable action flick!,The 13th Warrior

217,rickmeister,Classic Norse Saga of the Magnificent Seven,8,26 November 2006,"Of course there are probably hundreds of anachronisms and faulty historical facts but I have to say that this film is one of my favourite fantasy screen sagas. It's a bit bloody and violent and the inclusion of an Arab diplomat in the Northlands is a bit spurious but to be honest it just works. The plot is a bit basic, even B-movie, but what really brings the movie to life is the characterisation of the Norsemen Warriors - a good half-dozen who get a reasonable chance to develop their characters on-screen. Banderas is a likable, slightly effete, exiled Arab diplomat and neatly pulls off the educated philosopher finding his warrior roots. There's also a lot of humour - largely on the part of the extremely watchable Dennis Strohøi and the 'buddy movie' plot between his character and Banderas' is one of the film's best points. The hero Buliwyf is also not one-dimensional and he shows depth other than his ability to lead men and hack his enemies to death. Having said that there's a fair amount of hacking and slaying to watch but the battle scenes are actually pretty good, gritty, dirty set-pieces and the Norsemen by no means invincible. In a way I guess it resembles more the Magnificent Seven rather than the saga of Beowulf upon which it was loosely based. And that's probably the best comparison - village besieged by evil doers that the heroes finally vanquish but at no insignificant cost to themselves.Throw in some nice touches to the Dark Ages world they live in (even if historically inaccurate in places) and some nice one-liners and you have a very watchable film in the tradition of the old Norse Sagas & a McTiernan buddy film.Incidentally there is also probably the best on-screen language transition from having to use subtitles all through the film to suddenly everyone being able to understand one another that I've ever seen. Yes it's pretty unbelievable but it makes the whole film a lot easier to watch and is quite amusing at the same time ... So don't be put off by the bewildering Greek, Arabic, Old Norse and Arabic that the film starts out with.As the man says: 'Ja være den ottende menne'",The 13th Warrior

Funny thing: friends of mine who would probably enjoy ""The 13th Warrior"" never bothered to see it because they were tired of Antonio Banderas, but frankly, I thought this was one of his best performances. He's not really the focus of the story, except from the ""stranger in a strange land"" angle, but he delivers a fine, understated performance. The stand-outs are the excellent, largely unknown actors portraying the intrepid band of North-men dispatched on a quest to vanquish the evil Wendol (who are tormenting a neighboring kingdom). The characterizations cover the whole personality spectrum, from the charismatic men-of-few-words such as the superb Vladimir Kulich as the leader, Buliwyf, and Daniel Southern as Egtho ""the Silent,"" to the cheerful and enthusiastic, embodied by the fine Tony Curran as Weath and Dennis Storhoi in a marvelous, central performance as the aptly-named Herger ""the Joyous.""The battle scenes are exciting, and the climactic confrontation with the Wendol is reminiscent of Branagh's ""Henry V,"" right down to the rain and mud. The locations, shot in British Columbia, are gorgeous and evocative of a misty, ominous Scandinavian wilderness. The late Jerry Goldsmith accompanied the action with a stirring score, with an appropriately Wagnerian flavor in the last few scenes of the film.No sex, no foul language, some gore (so be careful if there are kids in the room) -- and the rousing exploits of a group of warriors who, if ever there was a Valhalla, must be drinking mead and singing battle songs in it these days....

The character Ahmad is very loosely inspired by the historical character Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who travelled to the north, and reported from the life of the Volga vikings, Swedish pirates, traders and mercenaries situated in modern day Russia.The rest of the movie is a mess of native american, stone-age, iron-age, british knights tales and speculative mythology. It is quite entertaining for what it is, an old fashioned, silly adventure movie. But as a movie with any historical merits, it is abysmal.

This movie doesn't have much of a plot or story, but c'mon....when it gets down to it, any movie with lots of blood and action doesn't really (Starship Troopers).

Even though it shows that a lot of matrial is missing (Dare we hope for a directors cut on DVD???) People accuse it for lack of plot, but that is not true, it is there, a lot of it has just been cut out, which of course hurts the film, but these kind of films are few and far between, so whenever one comes your way, you should see it.

I liked the ""Arab"" between the ""Normen"". So far for the positive parts, now for the negative.The story was unconvincing and impossible. The movie starts out weak, gets better, but the last half hour was an anticlimax. The movie's climax was somewhere when the cannibals storm the village for the first time, what was if I recall it well, around the 40th minute of the movie. BAD!!!!!! Very bad indeed!!I will now sum up the things that are impossible or leave a questionmark in my head.How can an Arab possibly meet Normen in the desert? The larger part of the movie is set in Scandinavia. How come there are africans among the cannibals? How come that not all cannibals are african, but some also have the Scandinavian look? Why is the leading part for Antonio Banderas and is the heroic part in the final scene for a minor character? Why is the romance between Antonio and this girl worked out so poor? Why are there so many small scenes in the movie, where they never get back to?I am sure I still forgot some questions, but at this very moment I can't recall them.To conclude I want to state that after when I saw the movie, my first impression was: ""Cool!""Than I went to the bathroom and started thinking...When I came back and thought over about how to comment for IMDB, my conclusion was that this movie was actually very poor, and only to be recommended to real lovers of the medieval genre.Regards, Johan Romeijn",The 13th Warrior
228,eyoak,A greatly balanced action movie,8,7 August 2012,"This movie is a gem of an action flick in my opinion. It has so much more to offer, the plots are not deep, the chars hardly evolve, and still value is added. The narrative beginning does fit perfectly, and let us see how the story began. From the start already we get faced with prejudice: the vicious tartar caravan attackers, the godless fearsome northmen. Even the northmen themselves have judged the Arab and his horse without knowing who he is. It is not hidden well, but some of the Northmen accept him as an equal straight from the beginning. The Story is simple, and still it caught and kept my attention the entire time. The comedy worked as well for me, if not laughing, it still got a smile.Underestimated movie in my opninion, if this was a 100% American cast this would have hit gold in the USA.8/10 for me",The 13th Warrior

I understand some people having a problem with Antonio Banderas playing an Arab. He's a Spaniard - so he looks and sounds like a Spaniard. But I really think he gives a great performance here. He really makes his transformation from pampered Lothario to warrior compelling and believable. He has this great intensity that takes the action to a whole other level. The largely unknown supporting cast is also great. They feel totally authentic. Without a doubt this is one of John McTiernan's best films. He was really on a role in the late 90's - which makes you wonder just what went wrong with Rollerball and Basic.

Before you even think of going out and renting this flick, let me spare you the experience and give you the entire hehe 'plot' in a nut-shell.Arab guy is banished to Norway because the Kings wife loves him. Some little boy asks a group of Vikings for help because his village is being over-run. All of a sudden hundreds people in bear costumes show up, and 12 Vikings beat them off, then they come back, then the vikings beat them off, then they come back, then the vikings beat them off.Then they get a bright idea! If we go to their lair and kill their mom, they will go away. So we have to suffer through an agonizing underground sequence which climaxes where the hero can barely defeat an old women holding a 2 inch bone. PSYCHE! It didn't work, and guess what, the Bears attack and the Vikings beat them off(this time with only 5 people). The End.

Vladimir Kulich is perfect as the Viking King without a Kingdom who leads the band of 13. But Dennis Storhoi steals every scene he is in. He is excellent, with a deft balance of drama and humor in his performance. 
I love the way the Vikings are depicted in this movie, not as mindless brutes, but as extremely intelligent, calculating, warriors. The directing is superb, I particularly liked the way the director showed how Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan learned the Viking tongue by listening through a series of transition scenes around the evening camp fire as the Vikings traveled to their destination. The battle scenes could not be better, extremely violent, but not excessively gory (well maybe a little excessive). Even the musical score is very well done, capturing the strength and high adventure of the Vikings.

Unfortunately, the latter is my impression of this long, bloody, brutal, boring movie.To be fair, the three friends with whom I saw this movie loved it. A couple of them have purchased the video or DVD. I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Perhaps if your goal is to see a head ripped completely off of a torso you can overlook the absence of things such as plot and compelling characters. Maybe it won't bother you that there are so many things that cross the line of believability (and not even in fun or imaginative ways). Maybe you won't care that this movie has the **world's most unnecessary** ""romance"" (and I use the term loosely) ever or that what you think is supposed to be a major obstacle to our ""heroes"" vanishes without a trace. If these things don't bother you and you don't mind seeing people act like animals (my apologies to real animals everywhere), then this may be just the thing for you! I just simply don't get it.

It's still a good movie, though.One note to all those who think it was super human like and unrealistic that the Arab learned the Norse language in one night! Watch it again and see that he learns it in the many weeks that the party is underway to The North. The few minutes of actual camp footage are a depiction of the many nights the camped for the night.

Despite all this, this movie is nice to watch if you like period movies. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Antonio Banderas' character isn't as present as I expected it to be.

It has a great story with depth and historical accuracy underneath the gritty fantasy elements. The score is absolutely fantastic, one of the most epic I've ever experienced in a movie.Good pacing leaves this movie with little to no boring moments and even the talks-y scenes seem to have a constant suspense and makes you want to hear every word. The fights are fantastic, bloody and will make you clinch your hands. The adversaries are well written and you're often unsure about your thoughts about the nature of these beasts.I do wish they expanded and developed the love aspect a little bit more to flesh out the character of the main character. As it is it feels shoehorned in there like it was edited in at the last minute. I would have also preferred a non-existent love affair over the one in the movie.I have not read the book this is based off (Eaters of the dead) but the movie is most likely inspired by the Japanese classic ""Seven Samurai"", not enough to make it seem like a copy, but enough that if you've seen both you'll see the connection for sure.In all: Very good movie, entertaining and dark and gritty, you'll find your hands sweaty and your eyes not blinking during some parts of the movie and if you enjoyed shows like Vikings, King Arthur, 300, and even films such as Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, and The Last Samurai, you might very well like this one. Give it a shot despite the scores and keep in mind it might not have aged exceptionally but it's got that 90s charm.Expanding a little bit:A lot of Norse mythology went into this movie of course, it being inspired by the story of Beowulf, but I would have loved to see some other references in there. Though if you are Nordic you might recognize a word hear and there when the Norsemen speak their language, as it is based on old Norse which is a sort of mixture of Norwegian, Swedish and other Nordic/Germanic languages. The scene with the oracle is particularly interesting, if you can find a translation to what they're saying I'd love to read it.

You don't have to imagine much as the film does that for you with great depth of characters and scenery. The fight sequences are gory, but required. I loved the performances of the Norsemen mostly. The story is simple and effective and the film is not overlong. I really hope they make a sequel as I don't believe that there are enough 'GOOD' films made for that time period.

Along the way, Iban is revealed to Viking Customs and must change to the Vikings Climate too.What i liked: As said, it had great cinematography and great atmosphere. The action sequences were amazing. Each battle is choriapgrahed well. Great musical score and sounds. Good Story and decsent acting. Good depth in the characters.What i didn't liked: The place the movie was shot was not in Scandanavia but was shot in Canada. Didn't like the ending. Wish it had been longer to explain the story in better detail.Conclusion: The Pros far outweigh the Cons witch make for a great action/adventure flick. Give this one a rent.-=FINAL VERDICT=-  7/10",The 13th Warrior
244,LordDave,Cool action film with a great score.,6,30 August 1999,"This was not a film masterpiece, but I enjoyed it.  It was well acted.  The North-men were very impressive.  The fighting was interesting.  The Evil Ewok-men weren't as interesting as I had hoped (I was expecting a more mystical, fantastic kind of an enemy).  What convinced me to give this movie an 8 was Goldsmith's great score.  It wasn't overbearing and didn't try to cue the audience, but it carried along the action and impressed me.  Overall worth watching.",The 13th Warrior
245,JHaven,"Vikings, Witchcraft, Canabalism...OH MY!!",8,24 February 2000,"First let me say that I did NOT think this was going to be any good.  But I was sorely mistaken!  The story chornicles a young Arab poet/scribe exiled as a ambassador to the ""North Lands,"" the land of the Vikings.Without spoiling anything, Bandaris is thrown in with a young viking lord and his ""brave men"" to help a fellow Viking King from an evil that threatens his very kingdom.Mixing just the right amount of humor, action, and plot setup the 13th Warrior is a good movie to watch, or rent.  As an added bonus, if there is any Nordic blood in you, the film actually quotes a ancient Viking prayer. The words will effect anyone, whatever there blood.  Just as this movie will have you renting it again and again.  Might as well just buy it, I did.",The 13th Warrior
246,Stitch65,"Pretty good, could have been great",8,30 August 1999,"I had been expecting The 13th Warrior for a few months, since I'd first seen the trailer.  Then my eagerness lowered after I read some reviews (some were good, some were bad).  So my expectations were rattled.  I came out of the theater feeling pretty good.  At least I wasn't disappointed.  This wasn't another Godzilla.  But it wasn't Braveheart either.What I liked:  Good action sequences.  It seems that lately action films go soft when blood is needed.  Now, I've never been a big fan of gore but when you're in the middle of a battle between Vikings and cannibalistic savages I think you can't go wrong with blood and realistic depiction of violence (the head-ripping shot was cool).  The sets and photography are really impressive, made the whole movie seem cold and frightening (well, maybe I felt cold because of the freezing air-conditioning; why do they turn it up so high?).What I disliked:  I felt there could've been more.  There are many side stories that seem to want to develop but are nipped in the bud.  The first minute about why Ibn has to leave his country could've been stretched into at least 20 minutes.  This way, we could have learned more about the main character and his demons.  There could have been political intrigue, a forbidden love story, etc.  The Viking prince and Ibn's love interest seem to take us somewhere beyond the carnage and then they don't.  It's a shame.The verdict:  As far as the action movie genre goes, The 13th Warrior was good enough to fit in the category with its head up high.  But with it's lack of psychological development and burgeoning side stories it doesn't go much further.  This film could have definitely reached epic proportions (like Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart) but for reasons previously mentioned it remains simply an action movie.",The 13th Warrior

248,DJ-75,Where's this going?,5,11 September 1999,"What's unfortunate about this movie was that it had potential.  The concept was new and original, but the story led me to believe that the first draft was shot.  Usually, dialogue is used to progress a story.  But in this case, dialogue is a distraction.  I found the cinematography pleasing, but not to the extent that it was true visual storytelling. Aside from his small role in Philadelphia, Banderas hasn't accepted a decent role in his career.  I would recommend that only serious fans of Banderas and those who enjoyed the Beowolf theme gamble with their money on this film",The 13th Warrior
249,fbennett,see this movie again,10,19 August 2001,"I saw this in the movie theater when it first came out and I grudgingly liked it (because of Antonio). Lately, its been showing a lot on the movie channels and the more I see it, the more I appreciate what they've done in this movie. Rarely a movie gets better with multiple viewings, but this one does. The cinematography is great in capturing the beauty of the virgin forests and the claustrophobic darkness of having to live by firelight. They really give you a sense of what life must have been like at that time. Storywise, I love how none of the warriors are spared. Which when you think about it, makes perfect sense. Antonio is wonderful bringing a lot of comic relief to the movie. For a leading man, he thankfully doesn't hog the spotlight. And the bad guys remain superhuman and creepy. So to anyone who didn't like it the first time, I recommend seeing this movie again. It's on enough and even with fifty million channels, sometimes it's the best thing on tv.",The 13th Warrior
250,enjoys insanity,Better the 2nd time around. Indiana Jones genre,10,30 July 2001,"The first time I watched it I thought it was about a 7.  But after watching it again I'd give it a 9 or a 10.  If you're going to watch this movie, you should pay attention to it, you'll get a lot more out of it.  Sure, you could just veg out and watch some pretty cool fight scenes (and Antonio Banderas, if that's your thing), but then you would feel like it was just a decent movie with holes in the plot. I wouldn't call it an intellectual movie, but if you pay attention or just think for two minutes about one of the scenes in question, the story line/plot will make sense.  One example ****minor spoiler******: they do switch from their language to English, but during the transition they use both, to show that he is starting to understand some of what they are saying.  They only use English when he understands them.  (The rate at which he learns the language is less than believable, but I don't expect movies to be perfect.)2nd point - if you like Indiana Jones movies, you'll probably like this.  It doesn't have the treasure hunting aspect, but it has action and it does have an historical aspect.  I'm not an expert on 10th century European History, but from what I do know on the subject, they were historically accurate. This isn't one of those cheesy medieval films where the warriors are running around in swimsuits.  They actually try in this film.  It made me wish I knew more about Viking, Tartar and Arabian history to see how accurate the movie was.",The 13th Warrior

What I got was a very interesting action packed film. The story smacks of Beowulf and his killing of Grendel. These warriors have basically been sent for to protect a village from slaughter by some unknown foe that only appears in the mist and in turn kill it (them).Even though I'm not a very big fan of Banderas (and maybe because he wasn't the center of the story), he brought a touch of comic relief that worked well with Herger the Joyous. These 2 characters are the most memorable and the ones who we get to know the most. A few things were off on the DVD: In the subtitles Omar Sharif and Herger the Joyous do not speak Greek, they speak Latin.All in all rent this movie, it wouldn't win an Oscar, but you just might find yourself watching it more than once.",The 13th Warrior

I have rented many a B movie for 50 cents from a dusty shelf just to see my man. But I can honestly say that I left this movie feeling that I had wasted my $7.50. I saw the 13th Warrior on opening weekend. It seemed to have everything I love in a movie- history, legend, violence and Antonio Banderas. I drug my boyfriend with me promising that it wasn't just about me salivating over my favorite movie star (at least on the sexy scale). I was so utterly embarrassed in the end. Let me summarize my above banter. This movie was horrible. I think the last movie I saw in the theater that I thought was horrible was Mom and Dad saved the World or something. That was 10 years ago. That's the only other movie in the history of my world that I hated. So yeah, in conclusion... I rated the movie a 2 only because of Tony.",The 13th Warrior
254,agonizer,No more Mr. Ego,10,19 October 2003,"This movie has been a real turn around for me. I have always seen Antonio Banderas as Mr. Ego (like Bruce Willis and Stephen Segal) and couldnt stand watching his little snear or smart comments but here was a nice test of acting skills. From learning a new language and accepting anothers religion he took it to the max. Plus all the other warriors were twice his size, tends to put him into perspective I guess.But do not forget the other 12 Warriors, the Filthy (literally) Cannibals, the sexy mistress nor the background imagery. Buliwyf did an outstanding job in leadership to the group until the bitter but victorious end. Each of the group knew there place which was a specialty in sword fighting, tracking, and so on. This type of team makes you wanna run to the nearest Renaissance Faire, pick up a few big boys and have your own adventure.This movie brings back the way movies used to be where it grabs your vision likes blinders and wont let you get up to pee until the ride is over.",The 13th Warrior

Seemingly a budgetary issue, none of the sets or visuals were really breathtaking... and in a movie like this in an age before CGI really took off that could have gone a long way. I mean, it literally looks like some guys just went out in some random forest in Canada or something and started shooting, and the buildings and structures... well... we don't even get to see them really.It also suffers from a weak first act... it seems hard to follow, dialogue very disjointed from scene to scene.Lastly, I love his work, but Antonio Banderas is distractingly miscast as an Arab.

259,Eldorodo,A great film for those who love a good adventure film!,9,20 December 2000,"The 13th Warrior lies somewhere in that grey region that exists between the real world and that of high fantasy. While little more than a re-telling of Beowulf, It gives us a surreal but entirely believable setting with none of the bizarre magic or monster fare common in this sort of high-adventure film. What the film lacks in exposition it more than makes up for in lush cinematography and intelligent presentation. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and yet the comedy we do see is more everyday reality-based comedy as opposed to the one-liner, slip on a banana peel type of comedy we see in films like the Lethal Weapon series. It's the kind of movie that not all will really appreciate and many will overlook, however if you're looking for medieval fare, swords without the sorcery and dungeons without the dragons, and aren't in the mood for the political and dramatic presentation of something like Braveheart or The Messenger, than you can't go wrong with the 13th warrior.",The 13th Warrior

261,leitmotif3,Solid Adventure with the Crichton Touch,7,17 July 2021,"The end of the last century was a great time because Michael Crichton was still with us. His touch is clearly in evidence in this film.I just finished watching it again for about the twelfth time, and I still find nuances in dialogue, acting performances and story structure that are a delight. For example, the way we see our protagonist learns his fellow warriors language is wonderfully shown.I see only three challenges that Crichton was unable to fix:1. As noted, the origin of the enemy is never really explained. Why are they hostile, and how are they different from the men they fight? I know the book provides an explanation, but I think it could've been included somewhere in the storyline.2. An ensemble cast of this many characters (13 warriors, after all) requires careful staging to ensure we can follow the fates of all of them, so we understand who falls when, and who is left to carry on. Some of the characters never develop well enough, or look so much alike that it becomes hard to know who is who in fight scenes and discussions afterwards. It can be done, and ""The Dirty Dozen"" is an excellent example of how to do it.3. Finally, the main night attack on the town has some thrilling moments, but the lighting is such that it can be hard to follow which of the characters is facing off against the foe, and the final set of scenes is a confusing mishmash of horses, torches and repeated shouting of the same warning.Nevertheless, these are minor shortcomings.I will watch it again--for the 13th time--Odin willing.",The 13th Warrior

The movie's scenes of action were great and I was very impressed.  I felt like I wanted to go fight evil forces after I saw this movie and that I should learn to use a sword.  Alas this quickly faded from my memory until I saw it again!  This is a very fun movie and will make you want to get up and do something heroic.  It is worth the money to rent.,The 13th Warrior
263,rklok,"Totally unexpected, this was a great movie!",9,5 May 2008,"Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",The 13th Warrior

Fist of all, there's no plot. At all. As a result, we never what exactly is going on or why. It had something to do with a poet named Ahmed ibn Fadlan, who is banished from his home for looking at the king's wife the wrong way. He then gets recruited by a bunch of viking dudes, who are assigned to find out what(or who) is plundering a certain kingdom. Then the warriors fight the monsters, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters one last time, the end. The warriors, aside from having no personalities, have no names. We never learn anything about them. The same goes for Ahmed, other than he is afraid of heights. We are not properly introduced to him or the other characters, as a result it's impossible to care about them. I can't comment on the acting because I couldn't find any. As I said, no one has any personality whatsoever. We don't even learn their names for crying out loud! This might have been forgivable if the much hyped action scenes were any good. Sadly, the action is filmed through a filthy lens and shaky camera work, so you can't tell what is going on at least half the time. More confusing than exciting if you ask me. Bad action, bad dialogue, bad acting, non-existent plot, sloppy writing, lots of pointless scenes, this movie flat-out sucks. Not one of the worst I've seen, but still quite awful. Rating: 2/10 Grade: D",The 13th Warrior

It has Antonio Banderas in the lead role, and I remember that he travels through medieval Europe settling arguments or some such. Anyhow, I remember that it has some connection to Beowulf which I find pretty boring as well. I saw this movie the night before I went away to college for the first time. So I guess it's a tad nostalgic. But I don't think the movie was very good really. Antonio Banderas has been better in some other movies, but he's relatively weak in his performance here. One bit of trivia on this is it was in theatres the same year that a movie called The Thirteenth Floor was in theatres. The two movies have plots that are totally unrelated to each other, but their titles are obviously similar. Overall, I don't think it was that good of a film.",The 13th Warrior

The Vikings were not analysed in this film with a magnifying glass, but rather, more a curious approach of intelligence and humanity was injected into their demeanor. Warriors, yes, brutal, yes - and also curious, with a person from Baghdad who prayed to Muhammad. There wasn't any stereotype of 'terrorists profiling' of Antonio's character who was referred as 'little brother' by his new Viking friends. This film was made before 911, and he was welcomed by the vikings as the 13th warrior to become a brother with them on their protective journey to defeat the unknown. I enjoyed the language scenes and the character's learning curve of it,the training scenes and preparations, and the cunning nature of the Vikings, also the playful teasing of each other. It makes me wonder if there ever was a scroll written of this story hidden away somewhere in a historical library in Baghdad. Great movie!!!

You can watch and enjoy the rest of it by yourselves.My favorite parts are Ahmad ibn Fadlan learning Viking language and Buliwyf learns writing the sentence ""There is only one God..."" at one glance - this is key sentence of Islamic teachings. And it's a fact that people in the past are actually learning other languages by observing and listening. Ottoman Emperor Mehmed the Conqueror speak, read and write in 4 languages fluently and are learned all of them by himself with just observing and listening other people.Michael Crichton did a great job digging these facts through the history. Islam used to source of a great culture, Baghdad was a rich paradise in every sense of the word (from material to spiritual) There were poets, scientists, philosophers - peace and abundance. Now there is only oil & gun money and idiots who forgot about being human and killing people with screaming ""Allah Akbar!"" - meanwhile Allah never allows killing innocent people and this emphasized in Quran almost a thousand times. That movie puts a dim light to the glorious past where men live by honor and die by sword - and these men were actually highly intelligent, well educated people with strong leadership qualities.

The movie is a mix between the historical account of Ahmad ibn Fadlan and his meeting with the vikings and a much bigger portion of the story is a kind of retelling of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. I liked it a lot because of the acting, the cinematography and the action.

269,hlgirl,"Too compressed, but wonderfully Norse.",7,26 September 2004,"The movie's main fault is, perhaps, that it's not as good as it could be. However, it's not actually a bad movie. Based on Michael Crichton's novel adaption of the Beowulf legend, it certainly suffers from a relatively short running time of 100 minutes - it tries to work in the political subplots, plus some lengthy journeying/cultural acclimation sections at the beginning that just feel rushed. Where it most succeeds is the atmosphere. From the time the 13 warriors reach the North, the film becomes steeped in the Norse worldview. Fatalism and superstition abound - things that could be explained rationally in the light of day become sinister, mystical portents in the dense, rapidly-falling fog. This feel is aided by a strong (mostly) Scandinavian cast, excellent sets and good costuming.Unfortunately, Crichton's clever premise -- that this might be the way Beowulf's story really happened, before time and the endless re-tellings spun it into legend -- is mostly lost, and I think a lot of people thought the script-writers just roughly copied ""Beowulf"" because they couldn't come up with their own story. There is a good movie hiding in here, but as it stands it's only a decent sword flick, though it provides a good Nordic fix, if you find yourself needing one.

271,Mephisto-7,A great epic retelling of a classic story,9,28 August 1999,"Having waited some time to see this long-delayed screen version of Michael crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" I went into the theater with a few reservations about how this film would turn out.  Two hours later, I left the theater exhilerated by one of the best and most surprisingly intelligent action films since THE MATRIX. The 13th WARRIOR is an excellent addition to a sadly underused genre, the period epic actioner.  Not since BRAVEHEART has a film included such large scale exhilerating combat sequences, skillfully directed by action auteur John McTiernan.  While many may not believe that this as good a film as DIE HARD or HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I strongly believe that in terms of direction alone, this is McTiernan's crowning achievement.Amazing action sequences aside, the intelligence in this film lies within its roots.  The film is essentially a retelling of the classic epic ""Beowulf.""  Instead of the valiant knight Beowulf, you have thirteen valiant warriors.  Instead of Grendel, you have a huge clan of mysterious cannabalistic creatures.  The same questions surrounding Grendel apply to them.  Are they animal or man?  Or perhaps something even worse?  Having knowledge of the Beowulf epic does enhance the film, as the story has some holes you may not understand if you are not familiar with the epic.  The same may hold true for the book, which I have not yet read, but very well may after seeing this film.   The film also includes another great action performance by Antonio Banderas to add to his exciting turn in MASK OF ZORRO.  It also includes a supporting cast who should be commended for endowing their roles with such character even with only a few lines of dialogue. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies like Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART or John Boorman's EXCALIBUR, which I also recommend to anyone who has not seen it and enjoys this genre.  I highly recommend to those who enjoy this film that they track down a translation of BEOWULF and enjoy the epic poem from which this high-powered film is derived.",The 13th Warrior
272,ThorbyB,Pretty Fine Movie,10,28 August 1999,"Considering we're a society that supposedly loves violence and gore, there are very few really good, solid action-adventure flicks. The 13th Warrior is one such rare beast.The movie's exciting, unpretentious, and effective, though the introductory sequences are a bit rushed. After that, the movie settles down; the fight scenes are dramatic, well-staged, and in no way gratuitous (though anyone under 13 is guaranteed nightmares). There are some really cool sequences involving language and weaponry, though and the interaction between the Arab (Antonio Banderas) and Norse (Everybody else) cultures are pretty neat.Banderas is the only advertised star and eponymous 13th Warrior, but he doesn't dominate the plot and screen to the detriment of the film; rather, virtually all of the 13 warriors are permitted to develop as characters, to some degree. They all act pretty well, a rarity in movies in general and especially with this genre. It's especially fun to watch Banderas's character develop as the film progresses.In addition to the strong support for Banderas, the setting really enhances the movie. Beautiful forested settings, a dose of Norse culture, and some great scenery shots are very effective.The 13th Warrior is pure action, though; there's no heavyhanded message, attempt to be politically correct, or apparent ulterior motive. The action is fast, the men are masculine, and the bad guys are pure evil.The movie has a few flaws, but they're not much of an issue. One or two plot lines are undeveloped, and some of the events and last-minute escapes are a bit improbable. However, anyone watching the movie will soon forget such issues; the movie really draws one in.",The 13th Warrior
273,inkhorn5,Couldn't get into it,4,20 September 1999,The 13th Warrior was one of the most disapointing movies I've seen recently. I was disappointed because it could have been a much better movie if the story had been told properly.  Too many details were left out of the story in order I suppose to keep it from dragging and to put less space between the action sequences.  You were never able to truly care about any of the characters individually so you didn't care what happened to them as a group. It would have thought it just fine to see and hour more of this movie so that it was explained better and I would have cared about what might happen to the characters.,The 13th Warrior

King Rothgar has sent his son to ask for help in fighting a legendary, gruesome, and greatly feared enemy.  this enemy is so feared by northmen, that they refuse to speak its name.they consult a sear to find out how to defeat this enemy and are told that 13 warriors must go to this battle.  before a final warrior can volunteer, the sear states that the final 13th warrior can not be a man of the north and points to Ahmad.  he must be the 13th warrior.  so the adventure begins.the next few scenes of the 13 traveling to the north by land and sea are wonderfully cinematic.  the scenes where ahmad discovers and learns the northman's language were beautifully done.  i realize that this may seem impossible, but remember this is a legend and legends are bigger than life.what follows without giving too much away, is an account thru the eyes of ahmad, of how the northmen fight the chilling and gruesome enemy.  of how, ahmad, originally horrified by the pagen rituals and uncivilized behavior of the northmen, comes to respect them for the great band of warriors they were. after watching this movie i will definitely go back and read michael creightons book.   from many of the comments, it seems that some of the scenes that may have given more insights to some of the characters, were cut from the movie.  i wish they had released a directors cut with this video.without giving too much in the way of spoilers, one of the most chilling and appreciated scenes in the movie, was the final battle scene.  knowing that they may die defending the village, the men gather and fortify themselves. Buliwyf, their leader, injured in a previous battle, is thought to be near death.  as the villagers and men arm themselves, they realize they will be going into battle without him and they are afraid, worried that many will run in fear of so large and gruesome an enemy.At the last minute, as the enemy are advancing, Buliwyf, struggling valiently, gathers his strength, and takes his place as leader of the group. as he stands, in front of his men, tall and proud, he watches the enemy approach and sees the dreaded leader of the ememy.  Buliwyf begins to recite a viking battle prayer, and with each line, his fellow warriors join in, until all are reciting it with him, all drawing strength and resolve to face what lays before them. as the final words are spoken, Ahmad, joins in with them.  the prayer is a wonderfully spoken plea for strength and courage:""lo there do i see my father.. lo there do i see my mother, and my sisters and brothers... lo there do i see the line of my people.. back to the beginning.. lo, they do call to me.. they bid me take my place among them.. in the halls of valhalya.. where the brave..may live..FOREVER!""i replayed this scene over and over again.  it was chillingly beautiful and showed why the norsemen, even a small band, were revered and greatly feared and respected warriors. how they drew their strength and courage from their generations old pagan beliefs and superstitions.  and that death, faced with bravery and courage, led to a joyful and happy afterlife.while this movie is not an great epic of the proportions of ""braveheart"", it was wonderfully and chilling entertaining. my only wish is that the director had spent more time developing the individual characters, or spent more time giving us information about who the 12 warriors actually were and where they came from.  more about them as a people or clan.those that are offended by graphic violence, beware, this movie has plenty. the revelation of who and what the enemy actually are, is as gory and graphic as it gets.  but the resolution is a wonderful triumph of the human spirit.see this film if you wish to be entertained, you will not regret it.",The 13th Warrior
275,doctorludovico,I'll pray the Viking Gods...,10,5 November 2000,"Even amputated, the 13th Warrior is one of the greatest films of John McTiernan, and in my opinion the best adventure movie of the last decade. I wasn't usually a fan of Antonio Banderas, but he's perfect as Ibn Fahdlan, the poet who becomes a warrior. Vladimir Kulich's performance is fantastic, he made me think of a modern , noble figure of Conan the Barbarian. I loved too this fabulous score. Jerry Goldsmith is a musical genius. What can I say more ? The epic battles, the Vikings, the photography... It's perfect ! I think I'll pray Thor and Odin for a Director's Cut Edition of this great Nordic adventure.",The 13th Warrior
276,dmdalton,Underrated and Great,8,6 October 2001,"This is a great movie.  Not one of the best of all-time, not even the best of the year (or top 10), but a fine piece of movie-making.  The unknown cast of European Actors were great.  And look real-close and you will see most of the cast of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"".  Anyway, the action was well-directed and the dialogue, what there was of it, was sharp.  Although the plot wasn't the strongest, ""Eaters of the Dead"" couldn't have been the easiest book to adapt.  By the end of the movie, you will be chanting the Viking Death Chant with the rest of the cast.  Very nice.",The 13th Warrior

278,iliana_gergana,Don't miss the point,10,4 May 2001,"Most of the comments I saw on 13-th warrior were negative - either the plot is hollow, or Gladiator is better, etc. OK, Gladiator is a better gladiator show, and there are better plots, and battle scenes and guys speaking Hjfghdueiueonian language from the start till the end, really consistently. (Can anybody tell me though why Hamlet or Maximus, if you insist, so consistently speak English?) But to me this is a real fairy tale - about dignity, friendship and much much more. There could be a poor plot and a great film, not so fancy costumes and a great film. So I usually give 10/10 for anything I like very much, despite the shortcomings, and 1/10 for anything that is ridiculous and boring and irritating. The Thirteenth Warrior - maybe 1/10 for speaking something instead of something, 3/10 as a gladiator film, and 10/10 for The Thirteenth Warrior.",The 13th Warrior
279,tdzz1,great movie!,10,5 June 2007,"Much more going on in this movie then you would think at first. If you read the book Eaters of The Dead then you will understand. This movie is as much about the change in culture brought on by the Romans as it is an action movie. Notice the armor they wear. If a captured slave fought hard enough, and survived, the Romans released them and many returned home. Roman culture was lead by men, elsewhere (The Americas, Northern Eruope etc.) woman were more often the teachers, doctors, leaders etc. You will notice these big burly Viking men do not make a move without a woman's advice. The other half of the unknown story is the bad guys. The boogie men are really Neandertals. Living on the fringes of ( and interbreeding with as modern day DNA research has shown) present day man.",The 13th Warrior

It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I am involved in the SCA, which is an international group of medeival recreationalists, so I am concerned about the historical accuracy with movies like this. I thought this was, for the most part, a good view of how a group of vikings might have lived 250 or 300 years ago. So, if you have to see a new movie this year, make it THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR.",The 13th Warrior
281,MDBum,"Fun...but like all other movies, have flaws",9,23 April 2002,"This is a movie you can watch over and over again. I just love that theme of action and history rolled into one. The action is good but blurry at times(especially in the viking lodgings).  The charachter development isnt all that well but their honour and bravery and very well displayed.  they can also be humurous without looking like a clown.  i also liked the fact that Iban wasnt portrayed as a lousy obnoxious sidekick as was done in The Mummy and such.  The ""Bad prince"" theme was totally out of the blue and shouldve been better explained but a decent attempt to add depth to the story.  the people of the town were also not well shown in a way that their plight and ideas were not well represented.  the armour and fighting was good but one of the men looked more like a spanish conquistador than a viking.  Nonetheless this movie flies by real fast and is not dull for one moment and the cinemetography as well as the soundtrack was well done.  I just wish more movies like this will come out in the future (Gates of Fire)...intellectually 6/10...but a movie you can watch over and over again.",The 13th Warrior
282,inkstainedwretch2000,What do you mean you didn't bring the lights either?,2,27 September 2002,"What the hell happened here? For starters where are the lights? Not one scene takes place and is filmed while properly lit. Including ones that take place during the day. Yeah, I know, y'all are going to say ""Hey they take place at night, dude! All they had was candles!"" What do I have to say in response to that? Watch Amadeus! Watch Braveheart! Watch damn near anything else! 	So okay, you can't see anything that happens in this film, all right. I can let that go. It takes the entire point out of an action film, but okay. How does Antonio Banderas learn the freaking language so fast? That just ain't possible, kids. Granted I am watching a film about cannibal warriors, but still. Where is the motivation for any of these characters? Why does this story exist? Word is that McTiernan stormed off of the set because he too realized that it was terrible. Who directed the rest of the film and even re-shot footage? Crichton. Good God, who thought up that brilliant plan? Was is someone who happened to be a big ""Coma"" fan? This movie is awful. Awful awful awful! It made my brain hurt it was so bad. The costumes were pretty good, I guess. So that's something.",The 13th Warrior
283,Optimus_,Severelly underrated masterpiece,9,4 June 2012,"OK, let's get things straight: The 13th Warrior isn't a masterpiece in the sense we use for ""Citizen Kane"", for example. As some have already pointed out, the plot is quite thin (even if you have to be totally illiterate in order not to figure out this wants to be a re-interpretation of Beowulf) and has some bad inconsistencies. Of course there's no way an Arab (speaking a semitic language) would learn old Norse (indo-european language) in a few weeks by just listening etc etc etc.HOWEVER, this isn't what this movie is about. The 13th Warrior is just a vehicle made to get the modern-day man in touch with the ""kill or be killed"", ""stand your ground or everyone in your village dies"" spirit. I mean, if the scene where Buliwyf barely drags his feet (and his sword) to stand in the way of the incoming onslaught of the primitive's cavalry charge doesn't fill you with adrenaline (and with the sudden urge to grab a damn spear or something) it means that you're either a old woman or... (well, let's not go there, you know what I mean :D )On top of that, I'm willing to bet that many of the bad reviews are actually caused by the very positive depiction that this film gives to Arabs. Add positive view on Arabs to Norse mythology and you easily can figure out why some critics will rate this movie as complete crap. Well, it isn't.Someone wrote here (with acted disgust) that this is a movie for men who like to bang their chest with their fists (gorilla style). Well, I ask you: should we completely forget what we're actually made of? :D",The 13th Warrior

Great story.
True story taken from the chronicles of early Muslim adventures in to Germany at that time a controlled Viking territory.

285,elkhadem,Great fiction movie,10,14 October 2004,"Although not promoted enough, this movie is excellent. If you like old-style thrillers such as Sleepy Hollow, you will love this one. The films also has a comedic side to it, which makes it more amusing. Antonio Banderas is very convincing in this role and so is the rest of the cast. Omar Al-Sharif also guest stars at the beginning of the movie for a few scenes, but as always, he adds more weight to the movie.The most brilliant part in the film is how the director showed Ahmad Ibn Fadlan picking up the nordic language of the vikings, gradually. This is definitely original and very smart. In a nutshell, you either like this movie or you don't, I do and so do most of the people who told me they've seen it.",The 13th Warrior

But, no! 13th Warrior could not hit the spot for me. The story was not interesting, and the ending was awful. They were like ""O.K. it is over"" and that was it. Maybe my expectations were high, I do not know, but I am really sad that I paid 7 bucks to see this movie.",The 13th Warrior
288,Ripple-6,A movie for the rest of us!,8,1 September 1999,"Okay, Look. I've read a lot of comments about this movie and I've also seen the movie. I loved it. Partly because of the fact that the characters were believable, especially the Vikings. I also loved how the story tied into Beowulf. But I really liked this movie for the action. Now, if you're the artistic movie-goer and don't like a movie unless it finds a new and inventive way to show breasts, violence, or even the common act of taking a dump in a new ""artistic"" manner...don't see this movie!

289,bruno-36,Very good Movie,10,30 August 1999,"To really appreciate this movie, I think you need to read the book (Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton). The book is written telling the story of the deeds of Ibn and his Viking buddies. Fortunately the movie followed the book almost word for word and scene for scene. The depictions in the book were realized in the movie, which is not always the case. Some might say there was very little dialog thus little story but they missed the whole point. This story is gives us a unique look into what life must have been like without a large government supporting us. Where the difference between life and death is in  our own hands. This was a very basic movie about comrades in arms and the acceptance of an outsider into the brotherhood of the organization. It was about base things of life that don't need a fancy dialog to receive you receive it directly to the gut. If you don't get this movie you have never struggled with life or seeing your efforts pay off through teamwork...",The 13th Warrior

Apparently Michael Crichton feels that way, and needed to bring up some vitriolic bile to spew.Unintentional Comedic Relief elements:I did laugh very hard at the 13th warrior's miraculous ability to pick up Norse faster than Thor's hammer can swing. He ought to replace the Universal Translator in Star Trek, because he'd be better at the job. For that matter, he's also damn good at grinding down claymores into damascene scimitars.On my personal scale, this one rates a -10 for cultural odiousness",The 13th Warrior
293,DrScholl,brilliant,10,9 September 1999,"This movie was brilliant.  I made a note not to see any previews or trailers for this movie.  I know who the director was, and that was enough.  THus, I felt that I truly had an opertunity to enjoy the movie for what it was worth.  I cannot remember the last time that I was able to watch a movie and not know how it was going to end 5 minutes in.  I thought Banderas was the hero when I saw how much effort was put into making him come.  Then there was the mystery.  Very well done, I was waiting to see the ""Dragon"" and I was almost disapointed (but I was to impressed at how it was done) to see what it really was.  For those of you who thought the plot was thin, watch it again and stop hoping that it will all be nicely laid out for you a la hollywood norm.  THis was a great flic and it was very refreshing to see a good movie that I did not already know how it ended.

294,kbhyland,An Introduction to Literature,9,7 December 1999,"After reading many of the other comments, I would like to share an opinion from another viewpoint.  I have watched this film on the big screen about five times now.  Each time picking out more of the in-depth work that was done on the historic viewpoint.  It was my introduction to the Beowulf Saga.After the movie, I read the book (I prefer to do it that way and learn the background of the story instead of watching for some favorite scene that didn't make it all the way through) and learned so much about Michael Crichton's effort in explaining an epic poem in realistic terms.  Then I read several other books on the epic, including one prose version of the tale mixing realism and Nordic myth.  All added to my further enjoyment of the film's storytelling.Further research lead to explanations as to why things could have happened as the film depicted.  The ""Venus"" effigies used by the ""Wendel"" were common to the CroMagnon people.  It was highly likely that a pocket civilization might exist in the mid-900s.  The sole survivor of one attack listed it as a ""very old hate"".The armour of the Vikings was unique.  It is very possible that they would each have their own favorite pieces which they had procured one way or another in their travels.  Each one was a specialist in his own way.I enjoyed the film thoroughly, obviously.  I look forward to the release of the VHS and DVD editions.  From further reading, I understand that there was much unused footage.  A director's cut would be a welcome addition to my collection.",The 13th Warrior
295,Moondoggie,Surprisingly good for a Crichton movie.,9,26 December 1999,"I was lucky going into this movie that I hadn't been told anything about it. Most critics predicted a bomb, I believe.  Certainly I wouldn't have bothered if I had known it was directed and written by Michael Crichton, creator of such ""gems"" as Congo. The more I watched, the more I loved this movie.  It has all the elements of a wonderful action flick, great historical themes (such as the Viking horses vs. the Arabian), and surprising originality.  It actually contributed new material to the genre of historical fiction, not to mention having darned fine fight scenes.",The 13th Warrior
296,Keydjes,Wow!!!,10,26 June 2000,"What can I say. This film has it all. Action, blood, romance and a lot of humour. Antonio Banderas is doing what he always does.

297,rainman-33,Underrated but not perfect film,8,24 February 2003,"As much has already been written about the merits and problems of the film I only want to focus on two significant points. First the casting is *outstanding*. I really believed that these guys could be  Nordic warriors of the time. Rugged, strong and with stony expressions that could inspire fear in any opponent. These actors really look battle worn. Kudos for the cast and casting. Second the sub-plot with the Prince and his scheming is totally left unresolved. It may have been better not to have included it at all. The issue is raised and then suddenly the situation and its characters simply disappear. Not a very satisfying thing in an otherwise above average movie. Did I mention the cast was excellent?",The 13th Warrior

One should also wonder why not many or any films at all are made but countless films are made to glorify the deeds of the American army when what ever they do is justified for good only.

I found much of the criticism unwarranted.The film is one of the better book adaptations I've seen, and it should be - The Eater of the Dead's author, Michael Crichton, also penned the movie script.  Though the first few sequences seemed rushed, the overall pacing and tone of the film are very effective.  The scenery is lush (it's so nice to see a movie that's filmed primarily on location for a change), the sets remarkable, and the costumes excellent.  Though Antonio Banderas is miscast as Ibin Fahdlan, he does a decent job with the part.  The real stars of the movie, however, are the mighty Norsemen.  Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhøi, and the raucous but noble host of others embody every boyhood dream of what Vikings should be.  The only distraction from this party of merry warriors is their various nationalities lead to various accents.  Oh well.  They sure look the part and look as though they're having the times of their lives.The ""monsters"" are effective, but somewhat underwhelming.  The battle scenes, choreographed well by director John McTiernan (Die Hard), are engrossing, and they are the reason I rented the movie in the first place. Enjoy!",The 13th Warrior

301,Alkyran,Underrated... Why?????????!!!!,9,11 October 2002,"I had read Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" based on the chronicles of an Arab called Ibn Fadhlan around 1100 AD. Despite the overwhelming critics, the film IS a very good adaptation of the novel. Also, the novel itself, happens to be an adaptation of the Beowulf Saga, with some nice insights in the lifestyle and beliefs of the ancient Norsemen. There is a very nice musical soundtrack, and beautiful, fitting scenery throughout the movie. Maybe the accents, and dressing of the Vikings strike as unrealistic, but this is not the first time such a thing happens, not is it a reason to blame the film (remind you of ""Gladiator""). The brave, laughing spirit of the valiant Norsemen, kept me awed throughout the film, with a very remarkable show of bravery by their leader Buliwyf in the end. The film hasn't changed many things from Michael Crichton's novel, and I would suggest reading the novel first before bursting into negative comments about it. Neither did I find the film ""empty"" in dialogue, nor did I get the feeling that I didn't grasp some part of the scenario. There is action throughout the film, nice battle scenes, and an adventurous spirit with a touch of the Norse valor in more than a few occasions. An overall good film, that may have been better, only if it had been longer, and maybe given us more depth into the characters of the 12 brave Norsemen who were chosen to face such monstrous opponents that remind us of Grendel from the Beowulf Saga.",The 13th Warrior

The setting was very realistic and matched the movie very well. The clothes they wore were very old fashion and great for this movie. They fit in very well. The dialogue was very good, and you couldn't tell they weren't from that time period. The movie wasn't my taste, but it was still a good movie for people that like those kinds of movies. I would recommend it to friends or somebody that is working of stuff Beowulf. 13th warrior is similar to Beowulf, because there are big monsters destroying both of their villages, and wrecking their lives. This movie represents Grendel and the dragon from Beowulf. The cannibal bear people would kill everybody and then eat them alive just like Grendel. The dragon is represented by warriors descending from the mountain with torches. These interpretations are very unique.",The 13th Warrior

Some people here wonder why there are so few viking movies made. I think on the contrary one is one too many. Please spare us from anything from the Norse. They were brutal,useless and were incapable of communicating especially with a great man from an Islamic country. The fact is that the Scandinavians are still the same as the used to be.

Great story, great characters (I will come back to this one though) and believable looking Vikings, all in all, with a brilliant sound track - you have a chance at a great film.Big Spoiler alert.Unfortunately the biggest killer, and no matter how many times I watch it, this is a fact, is you only ever see 12 warriors? where is the 13th? there wasn't one!! am I missing something? two vikings die in the first attack, four in the second, one in the cave and one at the end - how many were left? there were 4!!! how? please correct me somebody, but I think they edited this film so much some poorer actor got chopped off.What a shame, I still think it is good, although the film loses some of the more interesting proper big, muscle bound Vikings too early and we are left with irritating accents instead.If they produce a directors cut with at least 15 more minutes on there I would buy it.",The 13th Warrior
305,McThew,Could have been so much better,7,13 September 2005,"The 13th Warrior is equal parts involving, exciting, but then also weak. The story is formulaic, following a similar pattern to Seven Samurai with an exact number of warriors doing battle against all odds. Throw in some hokum, and pseudo magic/horror and you get the general idea. Where it works, it provides a largely unknown cast to shine, and Banderas does a good job in the lead role. But if the story is formulaic, the script is patchy as though the writer intended to almost ignore characterisation and deal just with the action (which is filmed conventionally and without much drama - and at times it is so dark you have no idea what is happening anyway). It could have been so much better... but then how many times can you say the same thing about recent Hollywood fare?",The 13th Warrior

It was one of those old fashioned swashbuckling tales that didn't take itself too seriously. Often people get so caught up in the details that they forget to just sit back and enjoy the movie.The scene where he learns the language of the Northmen by listening, I will admit it was a stretch, but having the whole story told through dialogue in Greek would have really bogged down the story. In the book both Herger and Fadlan speak Latin, and Fadlan slowly picked up the Norse language.The only real error visible that appeared in both the book and movie was Fadlan drinking alcohol. He tells the Vikings that he cannot drink fermentations of grape and wheat. The movie makes it seem that fermentations of honey are permitted. In fact Islamic religious doctrine bans drinking ANY intoxicant which includes drinks made from honey.

I have watched The 13th Warrior over 20 times.The music is very good, the story is believable: hominid anthropology overlap credible, holds together well, and I have always thought the film's portrayal of Ibn Fahdlan's learning transition, learning Old Norse by listening quietly to the other characters, makes his (our) transition to understanding all of the characters speech quite believable. Good job, there.The battle scenes are great, well constructed, lots of long-shot perspective, avoids cheap close-ups, the cannibalistic bear warriors fierce, the horse riding first rate, and the cave fight scary. As I do not like enclosed spaces, this portion is very believable.While the only notable actor, besides a short cameo by Omar Sharif (Melchisidek), is Antonio Banderas (Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan); I thought the ensemble acting of the others including Dennis Storhøi (Herger) Vladimir Kulich (Buliwyf) were very good. I have yet to see these actors, except Tony Curran, anywhere else.The only complaint I have is the geography. As a geographer, I know full well that Scandinavia can be, for the most part, short on coniferous forests. I deduced that the filming was done, not on location, but in Canada, which I found later to be true. Admittedly, it was probably cheaper to shoot in Canada, and made the story more enjoyable with a few more trees.I am amazed that there are those who've submitted reviews on this site, who rated the abysmal Conan The Barbarian higher the the The 13th Warrior! Honestly, after reviewing the movies on the Best Medieval Movies Of All Time, I cannot think of a better movie than The 13th Warrior.",The 13th Warrior
308,Unknown_Glyph,Excellent adventure in a much overlooked movie.,9,6 October 2005,"13th Warrior is not your average run of the mill adventure movie. Seeing it for the first time may have the viewer get lost in the odd language used and the spotty action. But if you're a fan of fantasy novels, games etc then this movie is perfect. Everything is laid out with a good story and great heroes.13 warriors are sent to rescue a northern territory from it cannibal neighbours. Working with terror the cannibals dress as animals and attack like them. Hiding in the mist and striking out at night. The 13 warriors arrive to the village and immediately set upon an adventure to save the king and his people.I loved this movie for the diverse heroes and the humanity and reality of the story. Nothing makes these warriors special other than the fact that they are veterans of battle. Being men of the north they are brawny and big so it gives a nice image of a heroic warrior.If you are the type of movie person who loves movies like American Beauty, Mystic River, The Piano this movie is not for you. But if you're into the historic/fantasy/adventure films like Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Scorpian King then this movie is a must see.",The 13th Warrior
309,kevinagillihan,Lo there do I see my father. Lo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers,10,25 March 2018,"To say that this is one of my favorite movies is an understatement. I have watched this movie more times than I can remember. Each time is a wonderful experience. The movie is backwards and forwards everything I want in a movie. A sweeping epic tale of warriors, danger, the unknown, battles, fear, pain, sadness, victory, death, happiness, different cultures, love, hopelessness, beauty and everything that makes a person human. A simple man from a completely different way of life is thrust into what would become his worst nightmare. Antonio Banderas might not pass for an Eastern-born character but he plays his part masterfully. He is taken from his life of care-free luxury and transplanted into a world of war and death. The legendary Viking warriors have little time for someone who is not a fighter. They scoff at Ahmed and see him as no more than a child in their world. His transformation from an outcast to a warrior at the end is no less than breathtaking. Through hardship and trial Ahmed proves himself as capable as any of Buliwyf's fellow Vikings. The cinematography is equally stunning as are all the performances in this film. It shows a brutal landscape with equally brutal people living in them. The score for the film is fantastic as well. Jerry Goldsmith masterfully weaves epic battles into moments of unease and then to triumph. It is a sad thing that the production of this movie failed it so completely. The director and the writer both could not come together as to what story they wanted to make and combined with the advertisement and setbacks it undid whatever success this movie could have achieved. I for one love this movie and am grateful to be able to experience it each and every time.",The 13th Warrior
310,ihash,Solid film,7,31 March 2006,"I caught this one on television and I liked it quite a bit. Is it a great film? No. But it was a good film and was solidly entertaining. There is a distinction I make between a good television movie and a good theater movie. A good television movie is not a movie with substandard production values; the production values for this film are actually quite good. Instead it is a film that for whatever reason just seems more satisfying on TV at home than after all the hassle of going to a theater, paying 20 bucks, being generally irritated, etc. It does nothing groundbreaking. All it does is entertain. The film has Vikings, swords, battles, barbarian hordes-all the ingredients of a healthy, long-running, well deserved cable television life, the type of film that plays on television twenty years after its release.",The 13th Warrior

That they actually do speak scandinavian in the movie, is something I can appreciate in the movie. And because it is only an action movie, I can forgive that the scandinavian culture in the Viking age, is shown as something that is very far from the truth - I just do not hope, that people think that is true.",The 13th Warrior
313,JB-37,"Fine, but that's all.",2,22 August 1999,"I watched the 13th two days ago with my girl friend, who graduated as a BA of English Literature. Having studied _Beowulf_ when she was in college, she loved the film. But I was more conservative about it.The most visible difference between the movie and the novel was the viewpoint. The book was composed as two parts: ibn Fadlan's 1st person narrative, and the scholar's voice in footnotes that acts as a 3rd person omniscient (or smartass) viewer. The movie only follows ibn Fadlan's line. Its viewpoint was closer to _Beowulf_, many of Crichton's inventions were removed, something as the Neanderthalian hypothesis.The movie was designed to be a testosterone-rich saga. Ibn Fadlan turned to be a he-man in nearly no time. You can see him display his masculinity in front of the Vikings shortly after he was kidnapped. You just don't have the idea why and when he became stronger, and was willing to fight for these barbarians. (Hint: watch for the quickest language lesson in the history of movie making.)To sell the movie as a superhero film, they omitted some flavorable parts in Crichton's original. Say the whale part. Why should these Vikings fear a whale? Wasn't a whale supposed to be a kid's best friend? Didn't you see _Free Willy_ before? But the whale part was one of the most interesting part in the _Eaters of the Dead_, and came straight from the first paragraph of _Beowulf_ (whale-road as the ocean). It made the film less tasty to skip the whale part.As the movie's title implied, the show was focused on the 13th warrior solely. Throughout the film, the rest 12 of them were neglected, including Buliwyf, the one created by Crichton as his own Beowulf. You didn't know much about him, not to mention the others. Some warriors remained faceless and nameless until they died. Then you learned about their names postmortem. And after the show, you still didn't have a clue about how many of them survived. All you could see was Antonio, Antonio, and Antonio. That's why the movie bugged me most.Otherwise it was viewable. And I'll very probably see it again. It was entertaining. But that was all. It could be better if the film was more complete. I mean the edition showed in Taiwan was only about 95 minutes long which was 20 minutes shorter than the US edition. It was rated R in the US while PG in Taiwan. So it was clear that I did not see the whole picture.",The 13th Warrior
314,forty6n2-3,Wasn't long enough,7,30 August 1999,"This movie was good, but i think the short length hurt the film.

Still a good film though.",The 13th Warrior

And the vikings are supercool. Ok, there are some things that aren't very well done.

Although I was afraid the movie being another disappointment like the Man with the Iron Mask, it was a really great experience watching a foreigner not understanding the language for a few minutes without a translation for him or the viewer. Also, I liked the fact the hero (and, as a matter of fact, the only really popular actor) of the flick not fighting/killing the two major foes, but himself playing a rather unimportant role. The action was well-made and the accessories (chain mail, swords) were real, consisting of metal and not of plastics or wool as in First Knight. The actors were quite good, too.",The 13th Warrior
317,Storm-33,"not too bad, but...",5,10 September 1999,"I really expected a great movie, because of his good preview, which showed a lot of cool action. After leaving the cinema, however, I was really disappointed.There are too many points which are not logical or worse. First, he learned the viking language in a few weeks with ""listening"". (cool, I'd like to have this ability too) The first assault of the ""eater of death""...there were soooo incredible many of them, but only to destroy a half-part of the village? And only 13 warriors can stop such an army?The revenge, however, was cool and smart and had a lot of good action. The worst thing was the last assault of the ""eaters"", when the leader of them was killed after 30 seconds! No final-fight with Banderas who learnt also to be a warrior? Apropos Banderas. Why this few scenes with the woman? She was absolutely not important and failed.In addition, if you like to see some bloody action and you are not interested in a good story, I recommend to watch the movie.

I had found the book interesting, but had forgotten about it years ago until I was about fifteen minutes into the 13th Warrior.  I found the movie to be more in depth, and more exciting.  I did have some problems trying to believe an Arab using a Spanish accent, and I also could not fathom how so many of the bear-cult followers could remain secret for long (their procession of torches stretched for miles - The Gold Dragon), nor how they could not just overwhelm the Northmen.  Otherwise, I had a lot of fun watching it.",The 13th Warrior
320,dttransam,1999's biggest could-have-been,6,25 October 2000,"When I first saw this movie, I was both excited and disappointed. I had loved Crichton's novel and was hoping for a lot, but sadly, all was not achieved.  The 13th Warrior was supposed to have been an epic somewhere along the lines of Braveheart, but the editors chopped the movie up so badly, it turned out to be nothing more than a medieval hack-a-thon. Really a shame considering its potential.  The movie was extremely well cast (all the Vikings were really cool), cinematography was great, and music was good, though often underused.  However, the script was terrible, and the overall storyline was far too basic.  This killed any feeling of depth, both in the characters and the plot.  Bad direction?  Not likely, considering John McTiernan's experience and all that the book gave him to work with.  There was a big delay in the production and release of the film and I would guess there was big controversy over what kind of movie McTiernan was trying to make.  Too bad some better thinking wasn't put into it, because it could have vied for film of year if it had been done right.  Still, The 13th Warrior was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend it if you like ""historical films"".",The 13th Warrior

I'm a fan of the genre and the possibilities -- Viking warriors and mythology, monsters and fierce battles -- sounded good.My biggest complaint is that I never felt a real connection to the characters, while the story moved along with somewhat of a disjointed feel to it.Antonio Banderas is an Arab courtier and the 13th warrior, the one who an oracle says will help the Vikings save one of their villages from the man-eating creatures.  It has somewhat of a ""Magnificent Seven"" feel to it, with the band of Viking warriors trying to come to the rescue of the village.The battle sequences were impressive, as was much of the scenery.The Viking warriors had potential, but their characters never seemed to develop, save for one or two.  At the end of the movie, I vaguely remembered the name of only Banderas's character, and he wasn't especially compelling in the role.Overall, the ""13th Warrior"" was a slight disappointment.  It could have been much better, but seemed to gloss over parts of the stories that needed to be expanded on.",The 13th Warrior

And whats really cool is that there is actually a pretty decent story behind this extremely cool viking warrior movie.  It's sort of a retelling of the classic poem Beowulf, but instead of Grendel (the big evil monster in Beowuf) there's this army of brutal savages who are believed to be demons.  Antonio Banderas (desperado) enters the movie as an arabian poet kicked out of his village because he liked this lady. So he winds up in the Norse land (huh?) and winds up helping the villagers to fight the evil creatures. I know that doesn't really sound very interesting but trust me, it's cool(hey, if i told you the whole story it would ruin it).  So, if you like Banderas, swords, carnage, and vikings, i HIGHLY reccomend this movie!",The 13th Warrior

The main characters' use of a hodge-podge of looted armor from various cultures is a degree of realism you just don't see very often. The story is completely engaging and you are easily drawn into the main character's rite of passage experience. There's a lot of practical wisdom that is conveyed through the dialog that is valuable in itself. I wish more of the battles had been done in broad daylight, but the darkness was part of what the Wendol relied upon to confer a psychological advantage. The thirteen warriors each had their own speciality...it was a well-balanced team. It helped the viewer understand that these were competent and well-seasoned warriors. You can't help but love how the Northmen laughed off tense or dangerous situations...it helped build mutual confidence. There's a lot about respect, honor, and courage in the film that makes it something I don't mind my boys watching (but it is fairly violent, so if you're protective don't let your kids watch it).

325,scottpberry,Not the perfect sword and board but it is as close as you get,8,18 December 2020,"The 13th Warrior is one of those films that flies under the radar. It pays loose homage to classic literature, while holding true to some historical accuracies. At the end of the day though it is still a fantasy and should be viewed in that light.Antonio Banderas' acting is on point and brings a lot to his character. All of the men and women who play Vikings are all amazing in their roles. I particularly enjoy Dennis Storhøi, Vladimir Kulich, and Tony Curran's characters. Herger, played by Dennis Storhøi, by far, is my favorite, he brings some needed comic relief to the serious plot, but it is a comedy of wit and wisdom, not silliness. The ever stoic Buliwyf, played by Vladimir Kulich is a leader that we can all admire. Tony Curran, who plays Weath, always performs well, with solid acting, good comedic timing. His character is strong, but humorous.This is a great film to just sit back and enjoy.",The 13th Warrior

I really liked the main character in the story; he reminded me a lot of the character Beowilf. ""Amed"" was very brave and loyal to be fighting as a warrior. I was really supervised of how similar the two stories are. When I was watching the movie I felt like I was watching what actually happened back in the Angelo-Saxon times. This movie had a lot of action and kept me on the edge of my seat. In the movie I especially liked the part when he realizes he is a warrior and defeats the evil people murdering in Hrothgar's kingdom. I think the setting of the story was really interesting, how the people back then acted; they had very poor hygiene, and I thought it was really surprising that they would settle disputes by fighting with weapons. The actor's clothing and dialog I thought to be very authentic, because when I think back to that time how the actors looked and dressed is very similar to what I picture in my mind. That made it easy for me to be able to get in to the movie.

For the uninformed the movie/book loosely follow the story of Beowulf from the eyes of an outsider. Each and every actor fills their role so perfectly for me that I become lost in the story each and every time I re watch it.

What a wonderful way to peek in to other cultures and world history. We've used this movie as a jumping-off point for a wide range of discussions and further study. The fact that this is the story of Beowulf adds to the value, as it will entice almost anyone into wanting to pick that worthy tome up again!

334,scottgerry,"Fair To Good, Spoilers Subject To Interpretation",7,24 May 2016,"This movie is difficult to fully dive into without rewriting the story Michael Crichton original wrote to begin with. I'll say this to start, Michael Crichton's Eaters Of The Dead was better. That doesn't denigrate this film, but I do feel it sets the bar beyond what this film achieved. Antonio Banderas was... both good and bad in this. He seemed to hop back and forth from motivated to bored. The supporting cast however was on from start to finish. The Northmen in this film were great. Their portrayals were fiercely accurate and their emotions were well balanced based on the source characters. Of all those featured in this film Dennis Storhøi gave the best performance by far. Clearly he embraced the role and his dedication makes up for much of the lackluster sequences of the movie. Omar Sharif made a brief appearance but did an excellent job setting the stories path. Praise aside there were clear problems. The pace is incredibly uneven with certain scenes dragging on and others being over too quickly. I excuse the battle sequences being too quick at times as in reality most historic battles are fought in five minutes followed by a lot of battle statistics, tactical planning, and contingency planning. If I go into the film anymore I'll ruin it for those who haven't seen it or only saw it in passing so here's the breakdown.Audio Experience: 6.7 Reason: The score was alright, it was kind of forced whimsy (meaning over-the-top for the sole purposes of appearing mystical). It didn't ruin the film or counter the scene setting but it came across a bit lame at times.Visual Experience: 7.0 Reason: It was somewhat gritty and realistic but not to the point it advertised which makes some less entertained. I'm not saying it needed more violence, but it certainly advertised itself as having more.Emotional Experience: 7.0 Reason: It really isn't about that. It's a journey tale but the main protagonist's self-discover isn't rewarding in this format. The book better utilized character building than the film but the film, due to format, didn't really need to.Overall: Fair. It wasn't as good as it could (or probably should) have been but it was at the least watchable.Recommendation: If you enjoy action films, war films, period pieces, or even realistic fantasy I feel you would enjoy this film or at least find it worth seeing once. If you're looking for something profound or life changing, I'd continue searching.",The 13th Warrior

When it comes to the Vikings, I as a Norwegian couldn't get a complete hand on what they spoke, but took a guess it might have been some kind of Danish. However when the Kings son spoke, I could confirm that Norwegian was spoken in this movie. For me, I don't really know many ""Big movies"" containing Norwegian, so this was a nice surprise. To bad it didn't last the whole movie, but it still beats X-Files episode where they travel to Norway, but where they speak Danish.The language was basically the biggest thrill for me, but still this movie manage to have a fair deal of action.

There are some amazingly good lines in the movie (especially the line when he makes his scimitar) and the dialogue is very good throughout.I would especially recommend this movie to anyone who plays AD&D. It will bring to life all your good campaigns.Overall, I gave it 8 out of 10.",The 13th Warrior
339,stark-3,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,7,28 August 1999,"Now im a big fan of science fiction fantasy type films,i like bravehart and all those types of movies,and this my friends is the biggest pile of garbage i have ever seen. First of all the film is way too dark,you can't even see what the hell is going on half the time,and you remember films that have plots and themes and such,well this film has none of that. To sum it up,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT CONSIDERING TO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!",The 13th Warrior
340,lhutch99,Fabulous cinematography and stirring soundtrack,8,31 August 1999,"The previews spoke of mystery, magic, and other-worldly settings; my interest was peaked. I picked up the book and flew through it. I couldn't wait for the movie. But I couldn't really see how some of the plot elements would be handled and Antonio Banderas playing an Arab diplomat turned warrior. I was rather astounded by the outcome. The 13th Warrior, while not destined for Best Picture, was stunning in it's imagery and sound. Both things drove me to feel the bravery and courage of the warriors set out to battle ""the thing which cannot be named."" The plot is a little confusing (having read the book first, I followed better than the others in the theater) but it mirrors the confusion felt by Ibn who is thrown into a world where he doesn't speak the language and doesn't know what he has been chosen to do. It's a great action movie with a hint of mystery and magic that's definitely meant to be seen in a theater to get the full effect of your surroundings. Try to catch an off hour showing as some of the dialogue is hard to catch with lots of other ""people"" noise surrounding you.",The 13th Warrior
341,ntaylor,Avoid this warrior like the plague!,2,4 March 2000,"Well, I've got to hand it to director John McTiernan: either he has incredibly high hopes for this film or he underwent a brain transplant from aliens from the planet Moronis.  Apparently he thought a film with the name ""Eaters of the Dead"" wasn't vague enough, and by changing it to a name that has next to nothing with the actual story (more on that later)....well, you get the picture.The ""script"", based upon the novel by Michael Crichton, is thoroughly awful, which is even worse, given what potential it had.  Perhaps it wasn't the script that needed work, but we'll never know when we've got an actor such as Antonio Banderas reading them in a drab, monotonic voice that only he can do.  For instance, one of the subplots that was only mentioned but never explained was Ahmed's ""prophecy"" to kill the bear-people.  Yeah!  Speaking of ""profits"", I wonder if this movie made any?The only two redeming features that this film has is that it pumped some desperately-needed funds into the Canadian film industry (The bulk of the work was shot in Vancouver Island), and occasionally, the cinematography stands out (esp. the scene where Ahmid ""learns"" the viking's language, and replies to their insults with the retort that is sure to stand out in film history:  ""My mother... was pure woman from a noble family!  But at least I know who my father was, you pig-eating son of a w***e!"")That line bumps my vote from a 1 to a 2.",The 13th Warrior
342,Snoopy-36,Heroic stuff,9,1 October 1999,"Perhaps one special feature about the movie which I seldom come across in other Hollywood-produced movies is the fact that it gives a good light about Islam, and in a rather casual and a-matter-of-fact way too. Being a Muslim myself, when I realised that Banderas was a Muslim in the story, and being the main character too, I was bracing myself for some inaccurate and bias portrayal of the religion. Well, apart from some forgiveable inaccuracies, it did not materialise at all.The highest point in the movie for me is the final battle between the warriors and the baddies towards the end of the movie. It is moving to see Banderas's character praying to God for victory before the final battle. Makes me realise how much human these days forget to do the same whilst in the same seemingly hopeless position. And Buliwyf too. As he went into the battleground, probably half dead from poisoning, I felt like running into the screen and join the battle with him. Pure heroic stuff.",The 13th Warrior

The reviewers have really given this movie a raw deal.You can't beat Beowulf as a basic story - - a few brave, intrepid warriors fighting a nameless horror that is preying on the innocent.  Add to that a good cast and lots of attention to historical detail, and you have a wonderful movie!  ENJOY!",The 13th Warrior

345,BrandyB,Without Expectations,2,6 September 1999,It must be my passion for fantasy that lured me to this movie. Yet I went without real expectations. A good thing. This movie delivered absolutely nothing.It earns 2/10 because I've seen even worse.,The 13th Warrior
346,Paladin-39,Stunning!,8,28 August 1999,"At first, one wonders will this story ever get off the ground. But once it does it moves with effortless grace.

Well Done, Mr. Crichton!",The 13th Warrior
347,Eric-186,A faithful adaptation to the novel.,10,3 August 2000,"I've read the novel, Eaters of the Dead, by Crichton and this movie, 13th Warrior, is an extremely faithful translation of the novel. This movie had a bold, sweeping musical score and beautiful cinematography.This movie has been bashed by critics, but these same critics seem to have not read to novel because the criticisms they made should be directed at the book instead. This movie and the novel were both based on an ancient Nordic poem called, Beowulf. The novel itself was written in a journal or chronicle format, which is why some plot holes and lack of character build up is present. Overall, this film gives a refreshing perspective on both, the legendary poem and the novel.The film is extremely enjoyable and it contains a solid ending, which, in my opinion, is the heart of both, this movie and the novel. Anyone who enjoys action and archaic, Period films of warriors and heros will love this film. If you've read the novel and enjoyed it, you will definitely love this movie.",The 13th Warrior
348,Jolly-8,Epical Heroes Legend,8,7 December 1999,"This is a movie like the old northern legends. Few men stands up against a lot of enemies. They fight brave and die only for honor. The special element in this epical is the ""Arab"". He is more a man of spirit then a man of fight. But he proves his strength and fighting ability. So my opinion is, that everybody who likes classical sword-fights and northern legends (like The Edda) should see this movie.",The 13th Warrior

I think Antonio Banderas rocks, and John McTiernan's Die Hard stands as one of the great movies of all time.But The 13th Warrior sucks.  It's so boring, my wife fell asleep.  You can't SEE anything, but when there is enough light to see, there's nothing to see anyway.  There's not a single shot that impresses the eye.  No sweeping vistas or elegant lighting -- hell, not even cool swordplay.This looks like a bunch of high school students with a camera.  There's absolutely nothing to remember -- there's not even BAD highlights, you know, stuff that's just so terrible it stands out.  Not even that.  I have no idea why this movie was made.",The 13th Warrior
350,DadGuy,Bringing civilization to Western Europe.,8,1 September 1999,"Loved the movie, saw it twice.  Great action with enough plot to keep it interesting.  Found it very interesting that a major studio would acknowledge that Mohammed's Arabia was the center of literature, culture and civilization in the middle ages while Western Europeans were living in mud huts or caves. Also loved the sequence showing him learning their language. Lots of levels on which to enjoy this film.  8/10",The 13th Warrior
351,Albert J. Katraz,"A terribly bad movie, but kinda fun. (spoilers, I guess.)",3,8 February 2000,"I was surprised to see that most of the IMDb comments for The 13th Warrior were positive ones... and was shocked to find an average vote of 6.3 for this awful, awful movie. I mean, I went into it with fairly low expectations, but had no idea that it would turn out to be one of the worst movies of 1999. It's hard to know where to start criticizing...but I'll do my best.Firstly, the title. Why The 13th Warrior? Antonio Banderes' character was the most useless one in the whole movie! He did absolutely nothing to contribute to the group. Speaking of characters, the only warriors who had any kind of personality or characteristics to distinguish themselves from the others were the leader guy, Omar Sharif, and the Irish guy from Braveheart. The other nine were faceless drones. How uninteresting.The plot...where was it? What was it? I still don't understand. These 13 warriors are sent to protect the town from...who? What are those things? Bear-people? Just some savage tribe? Okay, a tribe. Sure. With you so far. They attack the warriors, killing one of them, and then leave for no apparent reason. They could have won then and there! But off they go, back to the caves. Those crazy Bear-people. Then the warriors go talk to some witch lady in the village...who is she? Who knows; but she gives them a few words of wisdom and they end up in the bear caves. (Thanks to Antonio's sage advice: ""They think they're bears...where do bears live? Caves!"")Then, the Bear-people organize a wide-scale final attack against the village, which is over in one minute when the good leader (who returned from his deathbed) kills the bad leader with one swipe. The rest of the tribe (hundreds of fighters) proceed to turn around and walk back to their caves. Thanks for stopping by! Nutty Bear-people. Meanwhile, Antonio watches avidly.I thought some scenes were fun and amusing, but I'm sure this wasn't intended. Antonio learning the Viking language in a few nights is cool, but unrealistic. I know he's a diplomat, but how does he learn ""Your mother is a wh*re""? (or whatever it was). A scene I actually thought was well done was where Omar Sharif challenges the big guy, gets all beat up by him, then dodges the final blow and lops off his head in one motion. Beautiful.Overall, a very bad movie, but fun if not taken too seriously. I liked it a lot more than the people I saw it with did, that's for sure.Al's Rating: 3/10Recommended for: Mindless action fans, Bear-people",The 13th Warrior
352,lvictory,Ignore the Nay-sayers,8,22 February 2000,"I support this film for two reasons. One, McTiernan should receive kudos for excelling at his craft during the making of this film. Two, the cast of actors surrounding Banderos deserve to be noticed. Anyone unsatisfied with this film either expected too much or is overly critical due to some chemical imbalance which manifests itself in the ""I know film and this was not the 'Bicycle Thief' or 'Raging Bull' so in my miseducation of the business I will score it low and complain"" disease.This story has an even-keeled, nicely planned through line, and gives enough back story to fully color in an interesting plot. Historic, exciting, funny, and well executed this film is a great example of what good direction creates. McTiernan has used all the elements available to him (casting, art direction, editing) in high fashion. In the hands of anyone else this film would have suffered, yet McTiernan delivers a film that will survive as one of the better actioners ever.One of the most thoroughly enjoyable aspects of this film was the cast. The band of Viking warriors especially. All were interesting looking and great actors. They all looked so comfortable in their roles that I was unconsciously drawn into the movie and was sad to see them go.An unpretentious and funny film, full of good action. Never a let down.",The 13th Warrior

Took it to friends place, cooked out, ate, then sat down to watch this movie and no one said a word for 2 hours. Not an exaggeration. We were literally spellbound and could not turn away. Awesome movie. Who cares if it doesn't live up to the expectations of some ""expert?""

357,mandi_borek,A surprise,8,7 November 2001,"Yet again Antonio Banderas has surprised me. I've seen him in many films, and it was first in EVITA that I realised he could act. Little did I know how versatile he was. 13th warrior really displayed his talent, and it allowed him to stretch himself to many levels.I wasn't originally interested in seeing this movie. My husband and I purchased a used copy because it was only $5. Turned out to be a great investment. The story of good versus evil is quite old, but this movie really takes it to it's limits in a clever and absorbing way. With many interesting characters and action scene after action scene, you are drawn in from the get go.The part of the movie that I was incredibly impressed with was when Ahmed (Antonio) was sitting at the fire with the band of Vikings. Over the course of the following minutes, the Norsemen's language slowly turned into understandable words. It was incredibly well directed and filmed with really cool screen shots.Anyhow, if you're up for a fun time with a little mystery and lots of action, pick this one up. It's available as a library rental at any video store, and it's definitely worth the 4.50 you'd pay.",The 13th Warrior
358,dizztrocks,"Without the three major flaws, an excellent film",7,30 November 2007,"First off I really liked this movie. It was thoughtful and inspiring and had a fair amount of blood to keep some of the more bloodthirsty people occupied. It was well directed and well acted.Now, the unfortunate part is the story. The story that was written was entertaining and was fairly good. However, key elements to the story are missing.1)The introduction is just an illusion. Seriously there isn't more than 30 seconds of intro before they get right to the story itself. They missed a huge opportunity here and they pay for it later. Later in the second battle scene I couldn't tell if the guys dieing were peasants or warriors because nothing is known about anyone but Ibn. I found myself asking a dozen questions, such as why would a kingdom on the Black sea help their Norwegian counterparts.2)In the middle(which was very well done) the only problem I had was the prince in the town they go to. Because of a short introduction you don't know anything about this kingdom other than it is plagued by Wendols. The prince just kind of disappears after his crony is killed and left another question is left unanswered. Also they missed an opportunity to meet the villagers.3)The third problem is the ending, it abruptly ends without much explaining. I couldn't believe it was over. They could have showed later back with Omar Sharif in Baghdad or something like that.All in all a missed opportunity as a classic, but still a good movie. It is just asking for a remake and if they do release a directors cut it will most likely be amazing.",The 13th Warrior
359,Balistaff,Viking Saga Well Worth Several Viewings,9,4 November 2011,"I have to admit this is one of my favourite films and I've watched this probably 7 or 8 times; each time I've never felt it a waste of time. There is realism, a believable storyline and a pace that entertains. The odd joke is based more on what I'd guess would be warrior humour especially in tight situations. The weapons and armour, ships and drinking halls all look realistic like Lord of the Rings, rather than the foam and wool rubbish from other films. Myth & Legend is written all over this saga and a actors like Dennis Storhøi I think make the film. The 'Band of Brothers' seem cosmopolitan and this could be easily comprehended due to the trading links of the Viking fraternity in the 10th century. It works, gels and gives an added dimension, especially when the old Norse is being spoken early on in the film. A clever bit of translation right at the very beginning of the film. I like the selection process for both the new Viking Lord and the participants in the quest. Well worth the money and the time to watch over and over again!",The 13th Warrior

361,RBonnick,Inspiring and entertaining,10,28 September 2008,"A lot of people slate this movie for its lack of plot, its supposedly weak story line and apparently poor acting and minimalistic scenes. I would like to remind those people that 13th Warrior is set in a place where expansive scenarios don't just appear and landscapes are not necessary when the movie is based around such a small area. The acting was exactly as I imagine it would be if the characters in the film were real people and the events that took place were real. Every one of the characters in the film seemed on cue in my opinion - which is obviously what these reviews represent - my opinions. And in my opinion, you cannot fault the acting. As for plot... The 13th Warrior is a superb fest of testosterone, larger than life characters and a simple course of events as seen from an outsider. There is no need for complex or boring plots and stories. The film isn't meant to satisfy only those who want such complexities; the same people who would discard any fantasy movie as being too ""unreal"". The 13th Warrior delivers. The inspiration I receive every time I watch this film - and I believe it is about once a month that I put it on again - is staggering. I love it entirely and cannot find a single reason to fault it - other than it is too short.If you can suspend your belief's and allow yourself to just absorb an action fantasy film, this should delight. If it doesn't, then I pity you.",The 13th Warrior

Instead he serves as a witness to the heroics of the Vikings, who are played by folks most Americans will have never heard of. It's a great performance by the star because of its generosity.Some commentators note that the film may have been edited badly. Perhaps. I certainly wouldn't have minded it being a bit longer.I'm a big fan of the Seven Samurai, which may be the single most important action film of all time.

The reviews for this movie were overwhelmingly positive, however it's just not a very good movie...Antonia Banderas is totally the wrong person for this role, a Spanish man pretending to be arab... it's not believable.This story would have been better told from the Norse point of view in the beginning, rather than the 13th warrior. It just feels rushed. And the magical ability to understand language was silly.The score feels out of place as well. Ultimately the movie feels like a missed opportunity.

I looked at the movie as if I had hated it, and I noticed some stuff. Where did all of the horses come from? If they were ""barbarians"" or if they thought they were bears, how would they have been be able to breed their own horses? Where did they keep them all without anyone noticing?

He is sent North, and comes into the company of, for lack of a better term, Vikings, or North Men.A messenger arrives and asks for aid against an ancient evil that must not be named. 13 warriors must go, and the last must not be a North Man. And so, Banderas is chosen.The movie shows Banderas being outcast at first, then eventually earning trust and faith and even the friendship of the North Men. It has more than it's share of blood and sword fighting in it, and it's got the most incredible line in at the end. Not going to spoil it.I find this movie to be exceptionally well done, if not slightly cheesed up. Most of the main cast does die, so at least we can be thankful it was completely cheese.

369,fulton-jim,"The 13th Warrior is the best action adventure movie ever, bar none",10,30 January 2016,"The story is based on Eaters of the Dead, by Michael Crichton, who intended it as a revisualization of Beowulf. Indeed, I can easily imagine it as an intermediate legend from which Beowulf sprang. (Crichton actually took a hand in directing some of the film.) This is one of the few movies that is much better than the book.The adventure aspect of the film is a lushly photographed north land, an unspecified region of Scandinavia, actually shot in British Columbia. Not the travelogue of many adventure movies, here the weather varies rapidly from brilliant sunshine on verdant forests to gloomy, drenching rain to haunting mist, which becomes a major plot element.For action, imagine an Arabian poet, exiled as Ambassador, having to join a band of warriors led by Buliwyf, i.e., Beowulf, in defending King Hrothgar against a large army of ""Wendol"", the ""eaters of the dead"", which the Northmen fear are demons. (The suggestion from the book that the Wendol might be Neanderthal is never mentioned in the movie except through the casting of the extras that portray them.) What makes this movie riveting is the acting of the ensemble. Antonio Banderas gives one of his best performances as the Arabian poet. Vladimir Kulich makes Buliwyf, i.e., Beowulf, a brooding but powerful leader. And Dennis Storhøi delivers an Oscar-worthy supporting performance as the Northman who befriends the Arab. Throughout the movie, the viewer sees not mere characters, but people, men who depend on one another, who live and fight together with all their bravado and superstitions, fears and faiths.

371,dwaynej16-1,The Fun Starts Now!,8,5 April 2004,"I really enjoyed both the look and feel of this movie which I believe is destined to become a favorite of not only Antonio Banderas fans but also of this great action director.  From the start of the film to the last scene, this movie gives the action fan something to grab on to and keeps your interest throughout.  The personalities in the film were well inserted into the plot and right away each main character is easily identifiable as some one that I have known in my life.  The joyous and wise character that takes Ibn under his wing is funny and severe at the same time and much more complex than he appears at first introduction.  The leader of this band of warriors is likeable, courageous, strong and the kind of leader that men willing follow into the lion's den because they know that he is a man of integrity and that he will lead the way.  This movie meant much more to me than the video interpretation of the writer's thoughts, which by the way everyone knows that you won't find a better writer that Michael Cricthon. There were moments in this movie that gave me goose bumbs because of the brotherhood shared by the thirteen warriors and their unfortunate hosts of rag-tag villagers, who they are honor bound to aide in a very dark time. The last 15 minutes of the movie was awe inspiring.  A moment that humbles men of valor and I believe always has throught the human struggle to survive against all opposition.  Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you, there is gore that might be disturbing to the faint of heart and very small children, but the language is very clean for a movie with this type of rating and I felt that every scene was carefully placed in the movie for it's value to the overall story and nothing gratuitous was interjected to sell tickets or cheapen the original story.  I would have loved to see out takes from this one.  In the same vain of great movies like ""The Vikings"" with Tony Curtis & Kirk Douglas, and the all time classic ""Spartacus"" or the little known film ""The 300 Spartans"" starring I believe Richard Egan as the Warrior King, the 13th Warrior is an entertaining and enjoyable movie that can be watched over and over and enjoyed as much as the first viewing.  Of course I won't go into the plot but suffice it to say that a few are sent to help many and that there is no lack of courage in the band of the 13 Warriors.  A great story, a great movie, a graphic portrayal of ""men of valor"", let the fun begin.  I watched this movie recently on DVD with DTS surround and Wow! What an experience.

He had a discussion with another writer about mythes and sages and how the evolved in the century's. So the assigned he took was to take an old sage and to go back to the original story. He took Beowulf.,The 13th Warrior
375,lexfannia,what history can tell us,7,31 January 2005,"I found 13th warrior to be both entertaining and broadly accurate, especially in its depiction of codes of personal honor and the portrayal of pre-materialist views of reality. I even use parts of the movie for a college-level course on Medieval Europe.Some comments:the memoirs of Ibn Faldn - a real person- is the source only for the burial scene at the first of the movie; the ""Wendol"" were evidently extreme berserkers (bear+sark or skin) There are documented cases in the 1100's-1200's, but most were wolves not bears;the mixture of ethnic groups was quite common - warriors went where they could win fame and gold.

I would say that there were some non credible parts to the movie; however, I seem to enjoy it greatly.*Spoiler* The non-credible parts to the movie I would say the ability for Eban, ( antonio banderas ) to easily learn and comprehend the language flawlessly of his viking companions from just hearing them talk. Another part of the movie comes on the epic battle when a few warriors fight off a whole army of wendels and when the wendels have a clear victory they run off into the wilderness. With those errors set aside I believe this would have been a great movie if it was longer and able to develop the story at a pace.",The 13th Warrior
380,iamboaty,Better Than I Remember,8,11 June 2020,"When I originally saw The 13th Warrior in theaters, I remember being let down a bit. It was a mixture of the misleading flavor of the trailer and the drab and darkness of the film itself. I think I originally believed it was going to be a bit more of a corny action flick than it is. I'll just say it wasn't what I expected and that viewing stuck with me the last 20 years.Upon a more recent viewing, I really appreciate the short, period (relatively) accurate story this turned out to be. I also just realized, that I did not recall it was mostly a retelling of Beowulf-and that's despite having read Beowulf in high school. It's not even subtle now. The names in the movie phonetically sound like the characters from the original epic story.Banderas is charming as the narrator of the story. As the lead, he recounts the tale of a more historical interpretation of Beowulf. The rest of the cast of Viking warriors rounds off the storyline enough to give it a good quest feel. The villains could have been fleshed out just a little bit more in my opinion and the final battle was a tad brief. Overall though, for a short, tight plot this movie is pretty loaded with good violent action-if you're into that sort of thing and the story is an interesting retelling.",The 13th Warrior
381,murphcsb,Devling into non-typical folklore,10,12 June 2006,"I found this movie to be quite satisfying. Combining the rich wisdom of the Persia Empire with Norse tradition when most of Europe of ravaged by Barbarian hordes allows for the audience to see the richness of cultures rarely put on screen. Arabians in that era were the keepers of incredible wisdom and this film displays that.Loosely based on Beowolf, the Norse leader is one of the most intriguing characters I've seen in a long time. Director John McTiernan allows the viewer to see how this man truly is wise and brave.The ending isn't as good as the rest of the film, but it doesn't destroy the film.",The 13th Warrior
382,malmros-2,How can such a bad movie be so much fun to watch?,5,5 December 2009,"I really can't explain it. By an objective measure, this is a painfully awful movie. An implausible plot set in a historical anomaly, actors with no concern for authenticity or motivation (""Oh, so I'm the thirteenth warrior? Okay! Tally ho!""), fight scenes that are only so-so (really, if you think they're great, go watch Kurosawa's ""Ran"" and then come back and tell me how they compare). And yet, this is one of my all-time favorite dumb fun movies. And a conversation-starter? Please. All you have to do is intone, ""Lo, there do I see my father!"" and immediately you'll know if you're dealing with kindred spirits. Truly absurd amount of fun.",The 13th Warrior

I found that the action did not translate well, as if the panning shots were too quick for NTSC. I also found the nightscenes very difficult to follow. The dolby digital soundtrack was extraordinary. Maybe there will be another image transfer of higher quality from one of the special houses ( criterion etc.). in the future and it would deserve a place in a collection",The 13th Warrior

The absolute majesty of this movie is amazing.  The last battle scene gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  The acting is outstanding (Antonio Banderas' Spanish accent aside), particularly that of the actors portraying the Vikings.  Dennis Storhøi is incredible as Herger, and I hope we will see him in future U.S. movies (his previous movies are evidently all Norwegian). Vladimir Kulich as Buliwyf is also excellent.  This is a truly phenomenal film.",The 13th Warrior
385,mush-8,See this film if you appreciate folklore and enjoy escaping to another world.,8,27 August 1999,"This is a tale of yesteryear, a bit of fantasy and a bit of bravery. Our narrator is a poet who was banished from his home unjustly and embraced by a group of traveling or marauding warrior Vikings.  The poet does not understand their language, nor do we without benefit of subtitles.  Leaving us to feel his isolation and misjudge these men by our tainted perspective of their actions.  The poet is chosen as one of thirteen men to travel North to fight an evil force that comes in the night.  During the poet's travels, he begins to understand his companions and their language, and with each day he becomes a part of them.  The group of warriors fight several battles for their neighbors at seemingly insurmountable odds, in fact many die. However, the poet lives to recount the tale of these courageous warriors. What I enjoyed about this movie is it transported me to a world so different from my own.  A world and people rarely explored by Hollywood.  A world of simple survival. And the film makers attention to detail in regard to this period, the locals chosen for filming, and the action sequences were excellent. The dialogue was a bit thin, however one might surmise that the warriors were men of action not words. Regardless, the characters are likeable. As a person who enjoys many types of films, I would say to you, ""see this film if you appreciate folklore and you enjoy escaping to another world.""",The 13th Warrior

According to some critics it's still not worth sitting through. I disagree. While they did cut out about 50 pages of the book and do the entrance to the mother of the Wendol all bass-ackwards, it's still a very decent flick, especially if you enjoy watching somewhat historical flicks. Not bad for a spoof on Beowulf. Definitely a film to check out, I gave it a 9.",The 13th Warrior

I knew that the film had been delayed a full year, and that Crichton had to take over for the primary director when he moved on to the Thomas Crown Affair.  With that in mind, I was expecting a terrible film.  I was surprised by how entertaining and gripping the film actually was.  The cinematography is excellent, and the actors carry off their Viking roles with aplomb and believeability.  The dialogue is decent, and the action scenes are well done.  Strange as it sounds, I would highly suggest this film to not only anyone who enjoys a good action film, but also to those who enjoy history, lore, literature, and myths.",The 13th Warrior

390,modano-2,Bad bad bad,2,10 March 2000,I didn´t really enjoy it. The storyline was very vague and predictable.There are misses all through this movie. Like how could the arabs just waltz right into the viking-camp and get food? When the other race was afraid of them? None of this is explained. Another one is why the arab joined the warriors to go up north?! It wasn´t like he owed the vikings or something.The vikings didn´t seem very realistic.

Almost as if some scenes had been cut out.  For example, the history behind the Wendol, or the background on the King's Son Wigliff and his dead brothers vs. Buliwyf, or why the movie ended so abruptly.  Although this was based on a book, this movie had a lot of potential of being more than a good film. The humor, the action, the cinematography all went really well.  It showed how barbarian (in a good sense) the Northmen/Viking types were.  I have and will recommend this to others.",The 13th Warrior

394,T Rock,Kudos to McTiernan et. al.,9,11 March 2000,"This movie was extremely well done... great cinematography, excellent casting, well written script, plenty of action, fantastic battle scenes, and one hell of a plot.  It is strangely wonderful, erie, scary, and exciting all at once. My favorite intelligent transition was when Antonio Banderas learned their language by ""Listening""... My favorite action scene was the first night's battle in the Great Hall... The scariest part was the ""Fire Wurm"" coming down the hill... Talk about grabbing your balls and wanting to run and hide!  Anyone searching for a great period piece, or just some testosterone pumping battle sequences needs to see this movie.  It's too bad that it was abandoned by the studio just before release, with almost no advertising, little distribution and an exceptionally poor release date.. it could've been a moneymaker, I wonder why they dropped it like a hot potato? One of Banderas' best roles, but not hyped the way it should've been.  Oh well, Hollywood. Go figure.  They get something really great, don't know what they've got, and consign it to oblivion because some idiot with no imagination didn't get it... Well, it get's my vote for a great film.

I liked the fact Banderas was not the central hero- he was more of the observer.

Not a one of us thought afterward that there had been a dull moment the whole time!! The story was terrific, the sets were awesome, and the battles were exciting! I have read the book twice, and I thought this movie did a really FINE job of attempting to stay pretty close to it! They even actually ""toned"" down the troll part and made it more believable! Even the ""monsters"" were actually more ""realistic"" and believable than the book portrays them! I honestly was surprised at how well the movie followed the original story!

399,klc-2,Zorro meets Clan of the Cave Bear,3,10 September 1999,"Spoiler alert! The following contains some items from the movie.All movies with Antonio Banderas bother me. In every scene he seems to be flipping his hair around like he's in a shampoo commercial, and can he pose for the camera a little more?Despite the movies lead, I was looking forward to seeing ""The 13th Warrior"". I had read the book ""Eater's of the Dead"" a few years ago and it was pretty interesting.  However, I was disappointed that the movie abandoned the most enjoyable parts of the book and made it into a slasher movie.A lot of people are wondering who the cavemen are. In the book, the Vikings battle one of the last groups of surviving Neanderthals. The book describes them as real beasts covered with hair from head to toe. In the movie, they battle a bunch of cranky skinny guys having a bad hair day.  Were there some scenes cut from the movie? There seemed to be several sub-plots that seemed to go nowhere.By the way, where did the cavemen keep all of those horses? With a couple hundred horses, how did they keep their location such a secret?",The 13th Warrior
400,Gemma-6,The Valhalla of Eyecandy,9,4 September 1999,"""The 13th Warrior"" is not a perfect movie -- it starts off a bit slow and some of the plot elements are just too far-fetched, even for the genre -- but I found it far more entertaining and suspenseful than a lot of other movies out this summer that got inexplicably better reviews.There's *plenty* of action (although the battle scenes are not nearly as well choreographed as, say ""Braveheart"") and some fun surprises, but what I liked best about the flick is that for once, it's the guys and not the babes who are the eyecandy! A lot of handsome, hardy Vikings doing manly things makes it easy to forgive the film's faults. Oh yeah... some guy named Antonio is in it. Eh, who cares. Did I mention the Vikings?",The 13th Warrior
401,Al-236,a film visually rich in detail,9,6 September 1999,"Somebody, or somebodies, did a tremendous amount of research on the lifestyle of this period. The sets/costumes/make-up etc. make what would normally be an average action film a beautiful tapestry of detail. Many of the scenes were so lovingly crafted that I sat amazed as to how they were staged. This is not to take away from the extremely exciting action scenes and the not-so-little tension many of the parts of the movie engendered. Not a ""chick flick"", but one that can be enjoyed several times by anyone out for a couple of hours of emersion into another time, another place, another set of values.",The 13th Warrior
402,KGlogaur,abysmal... and I don't mean the cave!,2,14 September 1999,"The gore was ok, though. To me it all looked a bit like a live-roleplay session with first-choice equipment and the usual improvised plot: <approaching the village> GM: You now come to a very rural village in the middle of nowhere. Player: Do we notice anything special? GM: Yes, there are no fortifications and no fighting men to be seen.<players reluctant to eat the bait to get on with the plot> Village king: Oh, by the way we lost Thorvaldtstaett two years ago and demons burnt Smoerebroet last year. Player: I don't believe that crap. Village king: But we got an eye witness here. Enter the eye witness who starts his lament.<GM: Curses, I overdid the attackers' number, they slaughter the party> Player: This is the end we are about to die here! GM: Errrmm, you hear a distant horn signal and the attackers withdraw. Player: Wow, this was a close one. GM grins...Then, where does the Arab fit in, THE 13th warrior? Apart from fooling around with the sword before reforging it to proper Arabian shape, becoming sick on the boat and puking into the forest there is nothing special about the character or his part in the plot. Maybe, to get another couple of shots in without bleeding the thin plot before time?Agreed, the movie got its moments which in the end makes it  all-in-all the more frustrating. The idea of the supernatural enemy is nice and works really good until they come down the mountain in numbers. The ""kill the brain to get rid of the body""-solution, in the way it was provided, only produces a feeling of nauseous deja-vu in the state-of-the-art movie-addict. No, I prefer to have a go at 7 Samurai for the 13th time instead.My advice: Do not go to your local cinema unless a toothless old hag throws some carved bones at you.",The 13th Warrior

404,Moe-51,Favorable Review,10,24 September 1999,"I wish I was William Shakespeare because only he could say this right. There are some movies which tell a simple story and do it so well that you even after you've seen it you still seem to hold a piece of it with you. This was the effect the 13th Warrior had on me.  Having not read the book, I had no idea what this film was about.  I liked the premise: a group of people get together to defeat and evil presence which threatens the lives of an entire kingdom.  This group stands up to the challenge and fights a truly wonderful battle.  Full of mesmerizing scenery, wonderful costuming and truly amazing actors, this film was like reading a story using subtle images to express a very deep emotion.  I found this film to be of great satisfaction.  I compare it to Braveheart and Henry V (Mr.Brannaugh's version) and if you liked either of these please see the 13th Warrior.  It is a Viking gem, expressing how accepting Vikings were and are as a culture. I look forward to the DVD release.  This is surely a film I will be adding to my collection.",The 13th Warrior
405,pcjones,Lack of heroic centricism refreshing...,10,17 October 1999,"13th Warrior satisfied my movie-going-cravings within: craving for an entertaining story, action at a reasonable and realistic level, and something different. Allow me to explain the latter. Unlike most action thrillers and stories set in pre-modern times, the character played by Antonio was ""not"" the central hero.  While the main character had moments of glory, he was not the one who ""saved the day."" The character's romance was not the focus, either...nor was it distracting. Lack of sexuality permitted the focus to remain on the major issue at hand: a mysterious evil that needed to be conquered. The deep and philosophical expressions throughout added an intellectual element...something usually missing from action movies. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection.",The 13th Warrior
406,foisson,"Good action, but could have been SO MUCH MORE",5,11 November 1999,"This movie gets a 5 out of 10.  The medieval story, incredible scenery, and solid action were all worthwhile.  However, the story of a 10th-century Arab journeying in the Norse World and the Beowulf epic upon which the story is based are barely touched.  The plot had holes in it and was not well-constructed enough to keep you interested.  The action scenes would be more engaging if there was more reason to care. See this only if you truly love a good medieval action film, and can deal with a subpar storyline.",The 13th Warrior

They where using armour from the 15th century in one second and in the next they were attacking cavemen that existed 25000 years ago. Lets say that the story took place just before the age of the vikings ended, about 900 A.C. The amount of people that lived in the viking village were actually believable. On the other hand where did the huge army of cavemen come from??? And where did they get all their horses??? In that time I don`t think you could find that many horses in all of Europe. Why had not the village people met the cavemen before??? They must have lived as close as 2-3 miles from each other. The cavemen lived in the cave close to the sea. The vikings could hear the sea from the village.Strimm, Sweden",The 13th Warrior

Of course I am not trying to compare, but I think some people could not see anything but the violence and the blood. The story is not so good, but some moments are really epic and fantastic. The actors made a great job (even Antonio Banderas) and the battle scenes are amazing. I went out the room as a 12 years-old boy and I forgave all mistakes the movie have.

410,drewinlund,"Entertaining for some, cliche medieval saga for others",6,19 December 1999,"Well I actually did not know about the background of the movie before i went to see it other than it was based on a Micheal Crichton book. As soon as the movie had started, I realized that i had previously read the book, Eaters Of The Dead, which it was based on. That said, i watched the movie knowing the general plotline of the story. Crichton himself took the story from the Beowulf saga, much of which i have actually gone over in the old english. If you have studied any old english, you've probably heard of the story as some of the earliest manuscripts written in English are the tales of Beowulf. It's an interesting saga, and if that's your thing, you might find it interesting to check out.In any case, the movie itself came across as your typical medieval saga. The characters were not as interesting as i would have hoped. There are items thrown in that play no role, such as an apparent love interest that never develops. In general i can say that this is not the best film and won't be on anyone's oscar lists, well, maybe for costumes. That said, I still enjoyed the movie. It was fun for me, but i think more because i knew the background and i've always had some kind of interest in these big sagas, even though they never live up to expectations. I recommend reading the book, Eaters of the Dead, and maybe checking out the beowulf saga a little. The movie will definitely be entertaining for some, but if you're hoping for a film masterpiece, this it is not.",The 13th Warrior

The acting was rather poor and this hopefully will be Mr. Banderas's worst movie.  I thought the fighting was rather dull as well nothing like Bravehearts.  Overall this movie could have been an extremely great film if it was longer and the story was better.,The 13th Warrior
412,nyissa77,History & Fantasy,7,24 June 2001,"This film reminded me of the great fantasies of the 80's, like Labyrinth, Conan the Barbarian, and Excalibur.  The scenes are full of shadowy forests shrouded in mists which give it a mysterious and magical feel.  It helps add a great backdrop to introduce some superstitions, religious beliefs, and cultures of old.  That is one thing I admire most about the movie.  It shows how accepting warriors were of superstitions even with strong religious beliefs.  However, no matter their fear, they still fight it.Except for that brutal violence and the actors' ability to speak more than one language, it still keeps with the feel of those 80's flicks I love so much.  You have  the chosen ones who go on a quest to save a kingdom and some unbelievable battle against who knows what?Watch this movie if your in the mood for action, mystery, and a little bit of horror, you won't be disappointed.",The 13th Warrior
413,mechhunter,Enjoyable Movie,10,7 March 2000,"This was truly an enjoyable movie.  I have read the book 'Eaters of the Dead' and although Crichton is and alway will be a brilliant writer, I think that this was one of his earlier work and it lacks the 'spirit' that his later novels had.  However, with what they had to translate, from the book to the movie, I think they did a brilliant job - more so than his other 'block buster' move from book such as Jurassic Park and Lost world - which in my opnion was pretty FAR from what his novels was about. Lacking the big name actors, super special effects that most movies nowaday uses to pull in crowd and real corny pathetic punch lines that would have landed you in jail if you really did that in real life - this movie was able to stick to what needs to be done, do it and move on. The other thing that I found refreshing was the understanding by the director/producer that a 'movie' is only a SNAP shot into a time-line. Understandably, there will be reference to some deed done in the past that in my opnion, if it wasn't tooo complicated, you should not need to explain it (ie, the comment about the king's son killing his brother).  It gives the movie a much more realistic on-going of the world instead of  pausing here and there for explanation that really would not have been realistic. The fighting was fantastic, realistic without trying to glorify something that is morbid and messy.  Vikings fight with brute force, there's no snappy flashy Kung-fu sword moves.  The difference in youthful brute strength and experience old timer was clearly seen when the blondish Viking challenge and killed off the red-head giant.  The style of viking fight was further shown in the close combat first fight with the 'Eaters of the death'.  In the situation where the 'demons' were trying to win by piling and piling in with bodies, I fail to see how a 'wide angle' shot of the fight scene could have been preferred to a 'feel' of close-up, body, fur and steel. Without saying more, this is a brilliant movie for those who still enjoy a movie without the special effect and big names actors. I have to say that Vladimir, the leader of the viking, was BRILLIANT! - I have NEVER ever seen anyone that commanded such a big screen presence as he did and potray such a regal presence.

414,billyw1,Excellent Movie,10,18 March 2000,"I went into this thinking...ah just another b movie. I was wrong, if you really pay attention, it is very deep and intense. What courage the Vikings had, traversing the Atlantic in small wooden ships and if my history is correct, the only people to ever invade and conquer England. Buliwyf stole the show, a man of very few words, but when he spoke people listened. Their way of life although barbaric to some demanded respect and I loved their philosophy on life. See it if you get a chance.",The 13th Warrior
415,bkeibek,In one word: ridiculous,1,20 March 2000,"Antonio Banderas' performance would have been laughable, had it not been so painful. The plot stinks, the acting is more horrible than the (rather harmless and ineffective) 'monsters' (immediately clear to be people in skins for which they must have killed the entire brown bear population of the old world), the entire experience is one of unbelievable drudgery. A strong contender for 'worst movie ever'.",The 13th Warrior

Antonio Banderas is good in the leading role, and the Swedes are wonderful!

418,singingm,romantic epic,10,23 December 2000,"I would think it would be difficult to upstage Antonio Banderas -- he is usually the upstager, as Armand in ""INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE"" in which Banderas upstaged Brad Pitt.  In 13th Warrior, Banderas is upstaged by Vladimir Kulich or at least, I would call it a close draw.  Kulich makes most other men look somewhat effeminate -- he really is a magnificent specimen of a male.  His acting, in this movie at least, is insightful, focused, cool.  He's so cool he even has ""kul"" in his name.  I really did like this movie.  But then I like costumes and manners and locales. Bloody stuff -- I have to look away during some scenes, especially if I am having any meal but nevertheless, the scenes melt together with a dreamlike quality and it's almost believable.  There seemed to be some editing bleeps -- how did all those horses get onto that tiny ship and where were they?  Below decks?  But this is trivial.  Could this be true?  I remember reading something about this when I was very young.  Who knows?  Kulich is someone I will have to watch more closely.",The 13th Warrior

The uninformed might miss some of the film's subtleties, but the accuracy and depth of the historical research is enough by itself to make the film worth repeated viewings. The use of an Islamic hero makes for a tough sell in today's times, but this is a wonderful and woefully overlooked movie that should be seen by anyone interested in medieval history or just a good action film.",The 13th Warrior

I like Gladiator, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven Bulvif was the best but I liked all the characters. I did not read the book but the story was original.

Not a brilliant one but a good entertaining movie....Now this movie had the potency of being such a movie but it just never got there....An Arab meets a group of Vikings by coincidence and right at that time there is a call for help cause people from the north are attacked by pure evil......They need as the title tells 13 warriors to fight the threat. The Arab, Antonio Banderas, is chosen to help them out.The story line was predictable but that doesn't mean it has to fail....but the feeling of ""wow this is entertainment just never started"". The movie gave me the feeling that they insinuated more then that they worked out....u have a love affair, intrigue possibilities, great battles but instead of going deeper on that they just merely touched the surface of the story...To summarise: this is an entertaining movie but they just cut half of the storyline away......No need to see this one!!!",The 13th Warrior

I believe its one of the first, if not the first, epic movie of the new line of movies. i mean that this is the first modern movie, before the gladiator, to have big fight scenes, and war like action. i love it. nice characters, well chiseled, nice story and plot, you can watch it over and over again without being bored, well at least i can. The evolution of the main character is done very well, and not only that Banderas is not really the main character if you really watch the movie, hes just the guy that goes along with the vikings to their land because that bone oracle said so, and there he doesn't do much just help kill thous things, but the story is seen through his eyes, he is the character we can identify with, he knows as much as we do bout whats going on. great movie, nice ending",The 13th Warrior
427,zman90,One of the Best Movies I have ever seen in my life.,10,17 December 2001,"One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I consider myself to be one of the pickiest people when it comes to judging a film. Seems almost every movie I have seen in my life has what I call the `Cheeze Factor.' That being something in the movie unbelievable or unreal, something that I just say to myself, `That could never happen.'Anyone who believes in Honor and the Glory of wielding a sword in battle will truly love this film. The humor was refreshing and not stupid comedy in anyway. I think the portrayal of the unknown beasts could have been done a little better and in my mind was not as scary as it could have been.You will grow attached to all the main characters in the movie and the more you watch it, the more you will find yourself wanting to be a part of the 13 warriors yourself. Their loyalty for one another and their friendship for even the 13th warrior are things you just don't get in today's world.To this day the poem of Valhalla they recite when going into the final battle gives me goose bumps on the top of my head. If you want to see a great story with and ending that will bring a tear to anyone who still feels honor from the old world in their heart, then you will truly love this movie.I give this movie a 10 only because that is as high as you can rate a movie here.",The 13th Warrior

429,delereum,Personal Review,10,28 December 2003,"i have read the book and also seen the theatrical movie.  hopefully this makes me more of an objective critic.  through following this story there are two points i wish to address, first being the authenticity of the story.from what i have read. the movie does justice to the documentation provided by the book. there are of course items in the book which cannot be properly illustrated by the film only because much of what occurs is due to the readers fantasy, i have not known any director to be able to illustrate this without some variants.  it even seems improbable that a director could make it echo that of your specific account, in reading the subject.I think that this theatrical attempt is one of the best, true to text efforts that you will find.  the movie provides a vehicle to learn or experience the characters in a different manner than reading about the events, which from the account of the narrator are somewhat bland and overly factual.this is a great effort to stay true to the story provided and i personally find that the strange connection and distance that you encounter with the main characters convey the true meaning of what it would be like to experience an event like this - that is without the language and social skills of the environment one is thrust into.so on the whole i think that this is a respectable attempt to recreate the story as documented, without taking too much license at ""artistic additions"" in the film version.  i find that you become attached to the characters even without knowing their names or understanding them on a ""language"" scale. this story is truly about a foreign interaction and a textbook style accounting of the events that haunted the main character even after the experience.excellent for those looking for a real story and not just special effects to entertain.",The 13th Warrior
430,dennis-wood,I liked it.,7,26 November 2002,"I read the book, I watched the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed both.  As a matter of fact I purchased the DVD and have watched it several times. Though Banderas is Spanish and his character is Arabic (how many big name Arabic actors are there in the U.S??) he did an alright job.  No, it isn't Academy Award caliber, but how many movies out there really are?  Even those that win?",The 13th Warrior
431,SiberioS,Why the sword and dragon movie died.,1,27 December 2001,"This movie is summed up best by its ""large"" battle scene. The opposing army slowly plods up to the the city, mechanically throw their torches in order to burn the village down, and then, surprise, is confronted by a rather ragtag assembly of spikes at the gate that somehow make the opposing army actually stop. Funny thing is though just before Banderas jumped OVER the spikes on a horse (real good defense guys) and really, the spikes have the sharpness of a Crayola marker. Of course, the defenders of the city rejoice at this, say a couple witty lines, some bit charactdrs die, they knock off some of the weirdo opposing army, and everyone goes home happy.Everything feels very mechanical. The actors just seem to be going through the motions, the script is standard fantasy fare, and evidently the director decided to just keep everything zoomed in, so you could admire the actors grizzly faces. I honestly don't think there is a scene where any of the actors DON'T take up all the screen.Dreadful, dreadful movie.",The 13th Warrior
432,gandalf_schwarz,A little background needed to enjoy the film,9,15 April 2003,"I see a lot of comments asking why much of what is happening is happening. I think the 13th warrior is not for mass public viewing for one reason. The public is illiterate.  This is a wonderful adaptation of Beowulf, with much Norse mythology thrown in.  With this background it would be impossible for me NOT to like it.  I thought it was a very good movie.  I can, however, see where someone coming to see the movie and expecting an ""Armageddon"" could be disappointed.  The story isn't developed the best because it has been around longer than any written story in Europe or the Americas.  It's a well known story (or at least it should be) and so the need to spell out every little detail seems extraneous.The characters ARE quite well developed and I saw in Buliwyf (sounds a bit like Beowulf doesn't it?) the quintessential Viking warrior/king.  As for the inclusion of the Arab, this was just Crichton's clever way of explaining how the story got out.  The movie felt a need to have a dynamic character and so Banderas was it.  Its hard for a Viking to have a change of heart when they are by nature and belief so resigned to fate.  This came across very well through the characters, and for anyone to claim that the Viking translator was un-engaging is bobby-cock.  He was incredibly entertaining and likeable.Another claim I have heard made is that the ship was too small to carry all those men.  My goodness, do your homework before making such a claim. These ships were used and used in just the way portrayed.  Cross seas travel was a marvel of the Scandinavian age and these ships were the pinnacle of sea travel until the caravel.Overall a great movie, but not everyone will enjoy it, especially the unambitious cynic.  Read Beowulf and a little Norse mythos and this movie is for you.  If you'd rather not, then don't bother, you probably won't get what's going on.",The 13th Warrior

Despite the gruesome scenes, 13th warrior is one movie that you can watch with the family.

Curiosity kept me from turning away and the action hooked me. Antonio Banderas' performance is intelligent and understated. He may headline, but the unknown actors take the lead with very strong performances. Omar Sharif is certainly recognizable, but of limited exposure here. It's sad that he belittled such a great movie because of it's box office failure. This movie has a LOTR feel about it without the high end production. The production here is just right for the story and cast. The main attraction over LOTR is that it only runs 103 minutes. Beware, if you are easily affected by carnage.

The actions scenes are pretty dull and confusing - and the acting is quite weak too.The big plus about this movie is the adventure scenes - the camera angles are very good and make you pay attention to every second, as well as some good dialogue.I'm quite disappointed it didn't turn out as a Viking movie, more as an Aztec flesh eating tribe vs some very hairy men.

He didn't really affect the story very much.All in all, if you're a beginning D&D gammer, this is a great movie to give you some tips on game play, how to make the personalize your character and a little about the Nordic styles.Otherwise, the story was thin and the characters were 2 dimensional.",The 13th Warrior

The final battle was nothing short of exhilarating, and it was a joy to see Omar Sharif on the big screen again. This movie is very underrated and it went unnoticed...I think the marketing for this movie sucked. My biggest disappointment is that Jerry Goldsmith's score in this movie never received any award and surely his work in this one is one of the best ever to be put on film..on par with Randy Edelman's work in the last of the mohicans. The movie is never boring. Running only for 90 minutes there is no one dull moment or space for you to sit back and relax..everything happens fast and straight to the point.

I thought Speedo58's post was superb although, as a Middle eastern historian, I've always thought (1) Arabs should be played by Arabs and (2) Ibn Battuta should have received some recognition from both Michael Crichton and the film's producer and director. As much as I love Kurosawa's work, I can't BELIEVE anyone would confuse this tale with either his ""Seven Samurai"" or Yul Brynner's westernization as the ""Magnificent Seven""?? Too bad Dennis' career suffered a blow as a result of the film's reduction to a bit of a cult film status.

446,cwalldorf,A great film about the psyche of men,10,23 February 2012,"The premise of this story is simple. A lonely village in ""The North"" sends a messenger to ask for help from Buliwyf and his band of Northmen who are informed by a witch that 13 men must go to the aid of the place which is troubled by a dragon or monster of some kind. Other villages in the area have disappeared and no one has heard from them. Ahmed or ""Ibn"" joins them as a Persian prince who slept with a powerful man's wife and has been evicted from his homeland. The king makes him an ambassador to ""barbarians"" who live in other lands. Where he meets up with Buliwyf and his men. The witch says the ""13th man"" must be an outlander, and thus Ibn is recruited to join them. Over time, he starts to understand their language and customs (which he thinks are very barbaric at first) and wins over the Northmen as he and Buliwyf defend the village of an old dying nobleman.This is one film that gives men goose-bumps because it shows the best characteristics of what men do best and every man wants to do. Protect and fight for his home. It's something that was bred in us but that we no longer do. We fight for country but seldom get the chance to fight for village. I don't know any guy that would turn down the chance to join ""Ibn"" and this band of Vikings deep down.A great film that men of the modern age could try to aspire to...to be strong, brave, honorable, and just...and deal with our weaknesses as best we can.

To me, it strikes a very deep chord relating to courage, honor, faith and camaraderie.Clearly, this film cannot resonate in such a way with everyone, but it did for me. It's definitely a ""guys film"". My wife has zero interest in movies like this, but that's cool. The film has a substantial ""creepy factor"", but it's pivotal to the storyline - and setting up the backdrop of fear and uncertainty.

I love medieval and renaissance films and am willing to applaud anything half-way acceptable, but this one had little to offer beyond its supporting characters and visual appeal. The main actor, who played the Arab, totally lacked charisma. He seemed to be sleep-walking through much of the film, he was not well integrated, and his exploits seemed unbelievable. In most respects the writing, including both dialog and plot was uninspired and predictable. The focus of the film was confused.

But, Ebert like most Hollywood elites live in a fantasy world where talking about your feelings, or trying to talk yourself out of a conflict is the ONLY way to go. Face it, life can be really nasty. If a rabid dog is about to attack your children, you do not sit it down and try to reason with it. If need be, you grab it by the throat with your bare hands and choke the life out of it. That is what this movie shows. People in a desperate situation having to resort to brutal means to defend themselves.

Of course I understood all of the norwegian that were spoken, it's very similair. And when they got to Scandinavia I saw trees I have never seen (filmed in canada).

453,chucksantenna,One of the best fantasy/action adventure movies ever made.,10,10 June 2005,"A lot of people have posted very negative comments about this movie. I can only assume they don't understand it. First, it is a modernized version of Beowulf, just for that fact alone this movie is worth seeing. The story is told as it might have happened, instead of the monster Grendel the heroes fight a tribe of primitives who dress and behave like bears(maybe they're Picts?) It's easy to see how primitive people would have mistaken the eaters of the dead for monsters and changed and exaggerated the story over centuries. The story, dialog, action sets, costumes. actors, and everything else involved in this movie is flawless. I only wish there were more movies with the actors who played the warriors. Probably the most important reason that this movie is so good is the relatively poor quality of other movies of the genre. I consider this a fantasy movie even though technically there are no really fantastic elements in it, no real dragons or magic. The only other fantasy movies I know of that can be compared to this are The Lord of The Rings and Excalibur. I challenge anyone to think of a better fantasy movie that was made before this one.",The 13th Warrior
454,zubzwank,one of the best viking movies,8,15 February 2007,"I think this is one of the best viking movies, along with The Vikings and The Long Ships. It contained enough ""sword and sorcery"" content to be the best ""Conan"" movie that didn't have Conan in it. Also, if a reasonably accurate version of Marvel's ""The Mighty Thor"" was ever filmed, the actor who played Buliwyf would be perfect in the role--with a little more dialog coaching in English. The settings were realistic, the brave and wise ""philosophy"" of the vikings was well presented, the action/battle scenes were well done. It seems like a minimum of gratuitous special effects were used. This is a very good overlooked film in an overlooked genre. We need less Romans, Persians, Greeks, etc. More Norsemen!",The 13th Warrior
455,suitcase-2,"far better than it's given credit for, with some excellent performances",8,27 November 2006,"Although I agree that this movie is really well shot, its abiding problem is its lack of light. So much of the action takes place in caves or tents or in the dark that it becomes enormously oppressive. It's a huge relief when the last battle takes place in broad daylight. It's such a pity that the desire for a bleak, claustrophobic northern atmosphere was allowed to compromise the story telling, as this version of the Beowulf tale has much to offer. Dennis Storhoi and Vladimir Kulich are outstanding, but many of the other warriors give performances of great credit in lesser roles. Antonio Banderas is very fine as a fop finding his manhood through exposure to the vikings' positive, almost cheerful fatalism",The 13th Warrior
456,elspethsheyna,Worth it!!,9,3 March 2021,"13th warrior is a simple action movie at its heart but it offers a lot. It has, especially for an action movie, a lot of character development. My husband and I have seen it countless times and is one of his all time favorite movies. It never gets old is always a goto action favorite.",The 13th Warrior
457,bigcat4jesus,Beowulf (with a couple of twists),9,9 April 2006,"This was a very, VERY good movie. While the issues with Norse cultures actually having a written language is valid, the fact that most Scandinavian runic writing could NOT be understood anywhere else on Earth is undeniable. Michael Crichton's 1976 novel, Eaters of the Dead, is next on my reading list. And I'm sure he addresses this in the book.That said, whatever problems there are with the minutiae of the script, they are more than made up for by strong acting by Banderas and Czech actor Vladimir Kulich, good directing by John McTiernan of ""Die Hard"" and ""The Hunt for Red October"" fame and stunning visuals. The fact that this movie did poorly among movie critics simply adds to the list of reasons not to trust movie critics.The trivia note is ridiculous. If Omar Sharif was disappointed enough in this movie to take ""a temporary retirement from acting"", then he should have killed himself after ""Hidalgo"". One must suspect such folly is motivated more by his minimal screen time in the film rather than on the quality of the finished product.",The 13th Warrior
458,MeaghanPryor,Beowolf (poem) vs. 13th Warrior (movie),8,17 October 2005,"I really liked this movie because it is not set in present tense, it makes it unique in many ways. This movie has a lot of thing in common with the poem Beowolf because they both are based on good vs. evil and how good always comes out winning. In the poem Beowolf, Beowolf is called to come save the towns people from a man eating creature where as the movie the 13th warrior, Antonio is just riding around and happens to become the 13th warrior and told that he has to go fight a war with the monster and his mother. There is a fortune teller in the movie that predicts who is going to live and who is going to die for the war to come unlike in the poem where no one can know what is going to happen, you just know what is going right then. There is so much action in this movie and it is something you just have to see to believe! I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and suspense. The action scenes in this movie are so realistic which makes the movie even better, and it is playing out what happened in the poem. It brings the poem to life! As the warriors are riding around following clues to the monster they learn many things about each other and Antonio eventually learns their language and is able to talk to them and understand everything they say. In the bar scene when Antonio finds out that he was chosen to become the 13th warrior he was surprised and he didn't know how to react and what he was going to do but he learned fast. When they found all those bodies all torn up in that house, it was so realistic and it really got you thinking about what is going to happen to them and you want to keep watching to find out. By the end of the movie everyone is glad that the warriors saved the day and everything went back to normal. This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time!",The 13th Warrior
459,lowoodschool,Connection to Beowulf,9,10 December 2005,"This is an excellent film, both artistically and for its connection to British Literature's Beowulf. As an instructor, I use this film in the classroom to engage students in animated discussion after reading the epic Beowulf. I found that it really helps students comprehend the idea of the dedicated warrior--one who lives for the next battle and believes that dying in battle is the ultimate honor. The casting in this film is brilliant and enchanting. You readily accept the connection between the Arab and the Norsemen. In a day and time when many cannot see beyond their own interests and desires, this film helps remind history and literature lovers of a time when honor and dignity included what you give back in this world.",The 13th Warrior
460,threerichs,"Well Above Average, Short, Engrossing Guy Movie",8,27 December 2005,"The first time I saw this little movie, I was struck by the mood of realness this movie carries. This movie comes closer than any movie I have ever seen in depicting the Viking Norse as real people, much closer in depicting them as contemporary historians described them. It helped tremendously to have a central Arab character to act as the narrator as we today come closer to his viewpoint than that of the Norse warriors. In seeing it the second and third time, I was then struck by the simplicity of the story line and the way the characters fill out this movie. Being of ""northern European"" stock myself, I saw the movie Norsemen do things that I saw my father and grandfather do, things the womenfolk called ""nasty"" but seemed perfectly unremarkable to the menfolk. My wife doesn't care much for the movie, but I found it totally engrossing. That may be a product of the central theme of the movie. A Norse colony is under attack in the movie from a matriarchal society of Mother Goddess worshipers who happen to also be cannibals. The Norsemen may be gritty and nasty, but as seen through the eyes of the Arab, they were honest, intelligent, loyal, fearlessly brave, religiously respectful of their elders, and shameless in their devotion to Odin All-Father. This is a guy movie and it has some great actors in it. In the end, the Arab thanked God that these men awoke in him a re-dedication to that which is good.",The 13th Warrior
461,gander2,"Adventure, well acted, and a touch of history.",9,2 January 2006,"Very underrated film. A good adventure made better being based on the actual diary of the main character. The film shows the culture contrasts between the relatively educated and civilized Arab world in that time and the very primitive superstitions of the Northmen. Of course there limits to its accuracy, but it was well acted and entertaining as well. It pushed me to read the book on which it was based. The screen adaptation was different from the book, slightly more restrained on the coarser elements of the narrative, but it retained, even enhanced, the feeling for that period and locale in history. Antonio Bandaras made a creditable Arab adventurer and Omar Sharrif was an elegant mentor for the younger man. The Viking warriors were wonderfully played by a myriad of hardy men of various nationalities. I could not help wondering where the adventure took place - where the viking settlement was. The location shooting was believable as some northern 'viking' settled land - perhaps on the Baltic. The 'manly' humor was well done.",The 13th Warrior
462,tarra_lyn15,From then to now this is what I think.,10,8 February 2006,"From the first time I've seen this movie to this day, I just love the way this movie was filmed. I like how it used the vikings and one of their superstitions! It added a humor in with all the violence that had gone on. There was a wish to stop the ""monsters"" and protect the brethren. I loved the prayer that was said when the Princess was burned with the father at the beginning of the movie, and when they remaining Warriors at the end of the movie. When The movie began I thought it was going to be boring, but as it went on it got better and more enjoyable. I found the humor amusing just by the way it was put in. For Example: the vikings laughing and barking at his horse, because it was smaller than theirs. Slowly I stated to understand the plot and the point of the movie and just found it all interesting and great to watch.All around it was interesting to watch and see what people believe the Vikings did for one another.",The 13th Warrior
463,oake_kspec,One of the most Underated Movies,8,18 November 2018,"Excelent movie , Banderas did a gret job and it is one of the most underrated movie of the 90's in my opinion. It was tough to compete that year with Star Wars - Episode I , The Matrix , American Beauty etc. especially that the adventure/fantasy genre was kindda' dead at that time . Lord of the Rings , Pirates of the Caribbean and even Harry Potter , among others , revamped the genre . If the movie came out 2-3 years later , in my opinion , it's reception would have been much better . Eatherway , the cast was pretty good , great movie and very good performance from A. Banderas and if you're a fan of his , you shouldn't probably miss this one .",The 13th Warrior
464,lyubov-love,"Dark and Flawed, but Draws the Viewer In",8,15 January 2007,"I watched this first when I was fourteen or so. Because I'm a squeamish girl, I nearly gave up on this movie when the first (and probably most) graphic scene came on- a large cottage full of bloody human remains. But something kept me seated, and I made it through.That 'something,' whatever it was, contained a sense of magic that so many films today are missing. It described enough, but not too much, piquing my interest. Even in the end, the questions unresolved didn't leave me bothered. We learned only as much as the characters themselves learned, and the sense of the unknown had an ancient feel.The acting is solemn. It perfectly matches the gritty feeling of every scene. I love Antonio, but I came away from this movie with deep admiration more for the leader of the North-men than him: Vladimir Kulich's Buliwyf (which sounds to me like 'Boolivai'), the solemn and handsome warrior with really sexy hair.The focus was obviously more on Antonio Banderas, but Vladimir Kulich stole every scene he was in. When he spoke in his low, resonant voice, all the other Vikings listened- and I did, too. Throughout the entire movie, Buliwyf demonstrates an excellent capability for warfare and leadership, from his brute strength to the considerate and kind way he convinces Hrothgar to stay with his wife and the other women and children.In some ways, this is a gritty, nasty movie not suitable for children. However, with a little perspective, you'll notice that the copious use of blood in many of the battle scenes is nearly comical (regardless of the film-maker's intent). So, sure, it's flawed, but it's fairly easy to chuckle through such things; and it returns quickly to that sense of medieval wonder, safely tied down with Kulich's demanding presence.",The 13th Warrior
