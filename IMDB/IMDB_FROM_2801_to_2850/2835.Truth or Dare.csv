0,Leofwine_draca,Distinctly unmemorable,4,29 October 2021,"A teen slasher with a FINAL DESTINATION type twist, as participants in a truth or dare game find themselves menaced by a curse that seems them messily offed if they don't fulfil the game's obligations. This is predictable, passe stuff, let down by the central conceit that sees people grinning inanely before the deaths; it's supposed to be scary, but in fact it looks laughable. The acting is below par, the scripting dull, the whole thing distinctly unmemorable.",Truth or Dare
1,SnoopyStyle,not actually scary,5,5 January 2019,"Olivia Barron (Lucy Hale) is a do-gooder who is planning to do Habitat for Humanity over her spring break. She gets pushed by her best friend Markie Cameron (Violett Beane) to join her, her boyfriend Lucas Moreno (Tyler Posey), and friends in Mexico. Carter (Landon Liboiron) comes to her rescue with annoying Ronnie at the bar. Carter leads her group to an abandoned church and suggests playing Truth or Dare.There is a kernel of a horror within this premise. It needs an exposition early on from Carter to lay down the rules of the road. Without it, the first half is way too slow. It struggles to be actually scary. It's like Final Destination without the campy cheesy kills. It needs to be serious but it can never be serious. The premise may be functionally unhorrorfiable. It isn't campy kills. It's not fun. It exists in a non-fun, non-scary horror zone.",Truth or Dare
2,claudio_carvalho,Unoriginal and Laughable Storyline,3,6 July 2018,"I believe any mediocre writer can buy unoriginal and laughable storylines like ""Truth or Dare"" with dots to be filled in accordance with the wished situation and maybe a list of films to be seen with the same storyline to give inspiration to the aspirant writer.A group of __ friends go to ___ and they bring a curse ______ with them. Along the story, ___ will die while the survivors try to find a way to break the curse. Question: will they succeed? (Y) or (No). In case of no, there will be an annex with cliffhangers for the sequel. The End.The storyline of ""Truth or Dare"" is exactly the same as described above, filling the dots with 6 - Mexico - of Truth and Dare - 3 - (No).Based on the IMDb reviews, some people seem to have liked (maybe parents, relatives, friends etc.) or are paid to promote the annoying story. Check with your friends first before wasting your leisure time (and money) watching this garbage. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Verdade ou Desafio"" (""Truth or Dare"")",Truth or Dare
3,nogodnomasters,I know a place we can go.,6,28 April 2018,"Final girl Olivia (Lucy Hale) is talked into going to Mexico on her spring break. While there they meet Carter (Landon Liboiron) who takes them to an after hours mission which has been ransacked. Here he suggests they play ""Truth or Dare."" The college kids are reluctant and concede to his wishes....and as in so many of these films a demon takes control of the game as our group tries to survive as their numbers decrease. If you haven't seen four or five of these films before, this one wouldn't be too bad. The personal relationships make the film what it is, even if the characters fell a bit short. What I liked about the film was the ending. Guide: No f-word. Brief sex. Partial nudity.",Truth or Dare
4,kosmasp,Bending the rules (around the world or even universe),4,31 August 2018,"I understand if people give this a 1 star, I also understand if someone enjoyed this more than me. If you are in the latter group, don't be surprised about the former though. Also don't rate it higher just to make it even. It also helps your cause if you tell people why you thought it was good. Now I think it's cliche overload and the teens act quite annoying most of the time.There's also a lack of likeable characters. Our heroine is less than that. And it's not because of her ""secret"" - who would've thought? And while that makes it somewhat interesting, it's not like a super revelation. The ending - what can you say? I guess you may like it or feel utterly annoyed by it. Both are legitimate. There's an ""unrated"" version out there that makes a bit more sense (like you actally see them drink alcohol which apparently is a no no for the PG-13 rating) - though there is not any nudity as in that either as far as I know. You do get what actually matters in that though: Which is a spike in violence and blood or the depiction thereof. The movie has some fine moments/scares and the cinematography is more than decent. If you don't mind the negative too much, you can have fun with it",Truth or Dare
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Pretty good actually.,7,23 October 2018,"Often I watch a horror, and find myself disappointed, reading the reviews I expected very little, but really enjoyed it. It lacks any true originality for me to score it higher then a 7, it feels very much influenced by the likes of Final Destination, bit all in all it's very watchable. I liked the concept of a demon infiltrating a game, that was clever, and the faces of the victims when taken over were menacing, so it did have a degree of originality. The acting was great, production values were spot on, I find the negative reviews a bit unfair, and just plain wrong.Not bad at all. 7/10",Truth or Dare
6,zardoz-13,Truth Or Scares,1,23 April 2018,"""Kick Ass 2"" director Jeff Wadlow and television writer Michael Reisz must have watched all six ""Final Destination"" movies, ""Ouija,"" and ""It Follows"" before they made ""Truth or Dare,"" a glossy, young adult, supernatural thriller driven by demonic possession. Suffice to say, Michael Reisz has appropriated the centuries old party game True or Dare, which was designed to embarrass and amuse, but he has added a supernatural entity. Although they take the game beyond embarrassing and amusing, Wadlow and Reisz populate it with pedestrian characters. An attractively youthful cast, that could moonlight as fashion models and have done most of their thesping on TV, pose as vacuous victims. Male and female expendables throughout, they are differentiated by their wardrobe and gender. When they agree to tell the truth or take a dare, they've no choice. They must follow through or risk the likelihood of death. The ""Truth or Dare"" supernatural entity is a quirky demon that the filmmakers heighten the 'life or death' stakes of the game. Mind you, invisible demons are the first sign of a low-budget horror chiller. The producers don't have to pay an actor or actress. The special effects crew perform all the demon's fanciful feats. This demon multi-tasks, too. The filmmakers let it circulate will-of-the-wisp style from one character to another, temporarily possessing everyone. During this moment of possession, whatever character that it occupies utters a ""Truth or Dare"" demand. Along with this challenge, the demon warps their faces into the equivalent of an impudent Jack Nicholson smile. Indeed, this sinister smile serves the same purpose as Jason's mask in the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and Michael Myers' mask for ""Halloween"" franchise. Most memorable horror movie villains wear some sort of mask. Not only have Wadlow and Reisz carefully contrived this scary saga for sequels galore, but they've also provided it with a visual trademark anybody can imitate. Unfortunately, the violence is largely kinetic. Virtually no blood erupts from bodies either slain or mutilated. Basically, unlike R-rated movies, PG-13 movies like ""Truth or Dare"" must restrain themselves when mixing blood with violence. ""Truth or Dare"" unfolds as Ms. Goody Two-Shoes college student Olivia Barron (Lucy Hale of ""Scream 4"") plans to spend her Spring Break to building houses for Habitat for Humanity. Olivia's best friend Markie Cameron (Violett Beane of ""Slash"") has other ideas. She persuades Olivia to postpone her Habitat for Humanity plans. Reluctantly, Olivia accompanies Markie, her boyfriend Lucas (Tyler Posey of ""Scary Movie 5""), and a group of their mutual friends, Penelope Amari (Sophia Ali of ""Missionary Man""), her boyfriend Tyson Curran (Nolan Gerard Funk of ""Riddick""), and their gay Asian pal, Brad Chang (Hayden Szeto of ""Fortune Cookie""), on a holiday to sunny Mexico. Another member of their group that nobody particularly likes, Ronnie (Sam Lerner of ""Project Almanac"") tags along without permission. When they aren't cavorting on the beach and soaking up sunshine, they're getting loaded on all the alcohol they can guzzle. Basically, Violett convinced Olivia to join them since this constitutes their last chance as seniors to enjoy this time-honored escape from academia. While they are having the time of their lives, Olivia meets an enigmatic stranger, Carter (Landon Liboiron of ""Forsaken""), at a club who makes a favorable impression on her. He convinces Olivia, Violett, and their chums to party at a forsaken Catholic mission remotely situated in the mountains. These goof-offs ignore the fence that they must climb through around the mission with its warning signs in Mexican about prohibited entry. Carter convinces them to play a game of Truth or Dare while they are boozing it up. What Olivia and her friends don't know is that a wicked spirit named Calax haunts the premises. Earlier, during a drunken binge with his own clique of cursed companions, Carter smashed the bottle confining Calax's spirit and released it. Of course, nothing happens to anybody that evening. Things take a bizarre twist after Olivia and company return to college. Somehow, the Truth or Dare game has followed them. Moreover, the game seems to be playing them rather than they it. 
 
Unlike the night in Mexico when they asked each other provocative questions, Calax possesses each of them in turn as well as strangers and then challenges them to either take a dare or speak the truth. Olivia gets into trouble first when she blurts out in a room crowded with students at the library that Violett has been cheating on Lucas. Later, obnoxious Ronnie accepts a dare to expose himself while standing on a pool hall. When he refuses, Calax possesses him. Ronnie stumbles, getting off the pool table, and breaks his neck with a loud snap. Olivia and the others learn about Ronnie's tragic incident when a video appears on their cell phones. Each experience an encounter with Calax as well as a truth or dare question. Eventually, Olivia learns Carter introduced them to this demonically fueled game because it was the only way he could keep the spirit from meddling with his life. Those who ignore the rules end up dying until the surviving few track down not only a mute nun who once lived at the mission but also Carter. Ultimately, the only way Olivia and her surviving friends can counteract the curse is to coerce Carter into uttering a Spanish incantation seven times, slice out his own tongue, and cork it up in a clay bottle!Clocking in at 100 minutes, ""Truth or Dare"" should have dared to whittle its convoluted melodramatics down to 88 minutes. The demonic smile that everyone adopts during the game grows tiresome and borders on parody. This horror film boasts a minimal number of jump scare scenes. Meantime, the violence is largely antiseptic. Wadlow gives these lame shenanigans a polished look, but the film generates only minor suspense. Aside from ""The Purge"" lenser Jacques Jouffret's atmospheric cinematography, ""Truth or Dare"" induces yawns more than yells.",Truth or Dare
7,oscaralbert,What new horrors lie just beyond the horizon from the Plum Pad . . .,5,8 May 2018,". . . Pervs? After suffering through TRUTH OR DARE, distraught frequent movie goers are wondering if the Haunted House of Plum will next assault such beloved American institutions as Duck-Duck-Goose or Paper-Rock-Scissors. Or will these Weasels of Discontent try to spoil the future enjoyment of Simon Says or ""I See Something Red""? After OUIJA: ORIGINS OF EVIL, other movie producers proved quick to jump on the hearse speeding to pervert our childhood memories with such features as MACHETE'S MAGIC EIGHT BALL, THE OLD MAID STRANGLER, and DOPED & GROPED & JUMP-ROPED. Maybe there was a little opening for such offerings as TORTURED BY TWISTER or SINKING ON YAHTZEE. But did we REALLY need 90 minutes of flagrant abuse in the case of COAL CHUTES AND SMOKESTACK LADDERS or HOPSCOTCHING TO HELL? I, for one, probably will not get tricked into viewing the Plummer's upcoming offerings--BEER PONG BEHEADINGS and HOMOCIDAL CHARADES--no matter how compelling the movie trailers for these atrocities appear to be. I do not even want to learn the major plot points of SCRABBLED BRAINS, GAS WORD, or GRAVEYARD MONOPOLY. As noted philosopher ""Rod King"" once observed, ""Whey can't we all just play checkers?"" I don't think he was talking about serial-killing demons with checkered pasts, either. While most folks play three dimensional chess on their lunch hours, apparently the Plum Crew are leering over the Vivisectional Version. Maybe they need to be boycotted for trashing American Values.",Truth or Dare
8,view_and_review,The truth? This movie was bad,5,23 April 2018,"There's a game I like to play when watching scary movies. No, it's not truth or dare, it's guess who will live.Most scary movies will give away the survivor(s) within the first ten minutes. It's usually a woman because all men either:A.) Are killed first to eliminate any threat
B.) Are killed because they are so macho
C.) Are killed because they are chivalrous
D.) More rare, but killed because they are cowardsPretty much if you're a man in a scary movie you're going to die it's just a matter of choosing how you'll die. The surviving woman can't be a b**** or promiscuous. She generally should be nice, clean, innocent and smart.I'm pretty good at this game I play and I'm right 90% of the time (this is an unofficial statistic as I have not recorded any of this). So, when a scary movie fools me I generally like it. When they are predictable I generally don't like it. That's not to say that I can't like a movie that is predictable with the survivor or can't hate a movie that chooses a different survivor. I won't ruin the game for you with Truth or Dare, you have to play for yourself. I watched Truth or Dare because the premise was cool. A deadly game of truth or dare that you cannot opt out of. I figured we'd get some ugly truths and/or some gnarly dares. Some of the truths were OK and the dares were OK but the total package was weak. I wasn't impressed with the truths that were told and I wasn't all that impressed with most of the dares. Like most scary movies you have to find the source of all the mayhem in order to stop it and again I wasn't feeling it. The source of the deadly truth or dare as well as the solution to stopping the truth or dare were both unimaginative. They got creative with the ending but to me it was just a set up for future movies in case this one did well.If you want a scary movie to watch in theater go see A Quiet Place, that one is exponentially better and actually scary.",Truth or Dare
9,george.schmidt,Lame variation on 'FINAL DESTINATION',1,17 April 2018,"TRUTH OR DARE (2018) *1/2 Lucy Hale, Tyler Posey, Violett Beane, Sophia Ali, Nolan Gerard Funk, Landon Liboiron, Sam Lerner, Morgan Lindholm. Dull and predictable variation of 'FINAL DESTINATION' with six vapid college co-ed buds getting caught up in a supernatural vortex of the titular game with deadly and outrageously stupid consequences. Director Jeff Wadlow shows very little imagination (i.e. let's boost the sound for no reason) and the screenplay he co-wrote with Jillian Jacobs, Michael Reisz and Christopher Roach doesn't even have one scene of say a funeral for one of these 'close friends' once they're killed off. Lame.",Truth or Dare
10,neil-476,Tolerable horror which averts its eyes,8,1 May 2018,"A group of rather mature high school students go on summer break to Mexico, where a stranger talks them into a game of Truth Or Dare. It turns out that this game is possessed. The truths and dares are all harmful, and if you don't do them, you die. There is a race against time to find out how the game got possessed, and how to reverse the possession. Meanwhile, bad things keep happening to the participants.This is an interesting entry in the horror genre. First, apart from the creepy smiles sported by affected characters, there is very little horror other than what is inherent in the plot. Even the deaths are studiously avoided by the camera, so there is no gore. Nor is there any bad language - a teen horror film in the 2010s with no profanity? What's going on?There is, however, a decent story which keeps you engaged, characters who are likeable, if flawed, and a genuine friendship between most of them which their predicament threatens to destroy.The film is unexceptional, but a perfectly acceptable way of passing the time.",Truth or Dare
11,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Watchable if highly suspect mainstream genre effort,4,5 April 2020,"Heading to Mexico for spring break, a group of friends are coerced into playing a demented game of truth-or-dare from a local guide who tells them they must now partake in the game or die like his friends did, causing them to try to understanding the rules of the game before it kills them one-by-one.This one was an incredibly bland and dull genre effort. Among the biggest issues is a general and gross misunderstanding of how the game is played, where the invocation to invite the evil force into their lives is completely missing. The general assumption of inviting evil into your lives is never brought up, instead given a rather banal and underwhelming exercise that amounts to being inside the church-grounds as a means of initiating the next phase of the game. This all comes off without any context or reasoning as if this one was sold mainly on the idea of a game being passed around without much thought since the overwhelming feeling here is one of a complete misunderstanding of how the game goes about. On top of that misguided behavior, the film's idea of playing the game results in nothing more than typical teen melodrama and unappealing secrets. It's not a shock that this one devolves into affairs, clandestine hook-ups and long-held secrets and crushes that are usually featured in such efforts, as that tends to be the main focus of what the game is seeking to exploit. None of these features are interesting or enjoyable when it's the same old formula recycled again and again in these situations, and it's all the same nonsensical melodrama that erupts from these challenges that don't even make the group that appealing anyway, resulting in a wholly unengaging and troublesome effort. Finally, the film is entirely unscary when it focuses on the exploits of the demon going through the cast. The idea of signaling the possession as exactly what's described in the film as a lame filter found on a social media video completely reduces the fear of the demon who's chasing after them when what's supposed to signal his taking over random strangers to denote the next stage of their game. There's no suspense at all from the random appearances as the telegraphed camera movements and musical stings carry all the surprise away. The CGI used to change their faces is atrocious and highly suspect, making it look even worse with the underwhelming secrets that favor melodramatic contrivance over scares and completely banal way of playing the game, making for the films' problematic issues. There are a few worthwhile aspects to this one which are pretty much the scenes of them going through their paces in the context of the games' truth or dare segments. With the first few instances of the group succumbing to accidents giving this a solid grounding at first to the power of the game, the later scenes showing them having to harm themselves or go through painful, dangerous stunts to stay alive makes for a somewhat enjoyable time here. The best is a genuinely suspenseful sequence where a participant must scale the ledge of a house with precarious items just below providing potentially grisly landing spots and a fine finale that makes for an energetic time here, but that's all that works here with some misguided approaches.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and a shadowy sex scene.",Truth or Dare
12,phd_travel,Stupid and irritating,1,3 October 2018,"I Love Lucy but this movie is stupid and irritating.

13,trashgang,too much blah blah blah,5,24 October 2018,"So another entry into the so-called teen horror. Pushed to the teens who loved Teen Wolf just because Tyler Posey is in this flick. I can't say that much about Truth Or Dare except that it was another weak horror flick.Trailer looked great but once the flick is over the only question was, where was the horror? Nothing scary or not one drip of blood. Again, not that you need one drip of blood, therefor Halloween (1978) was a perfect example but that one was scary as hell.The only thing that had a weird feeling were the faces looking rare once being possessed. It did remind me of The Man Who Laughs (1928) which I would recommend in stead of this crap.

14,mm-39,Tries too hard to be campy!,4,24 April 2018,"Truth or Dare tries too hard. Truth or Dare tries to be a campy horror movie, but gets across as lame. In might be just a sign of the times but everyone tries to hard in Truth or Dare. The alpha male is weak, the sleezey gal is not attractive, the jerk is too geekish, the personal story of the gay guy/ dad sub story drags the horror theme. Never tell too much of your characters. Over character development creates a distraction to a campy story. Flat characters make campy movies. The campy main story fits into a true campy horror movies story, but the characters drag Truth or Dare down from campy to lame. Scream/Friday 13th had over the top characters that where spicy. The over stimulated characters compensates for the flat character arch. You really hate or like each character, which turns a lame story into a campy story. Regrettably the casting/acting script made bland characters. The story was okay, and even had the dirty secret ending, but Truth or Dare was lacking. 4 out of 10 stars.",Truth or Dare

19,851222,Not bad flick,7,30 January 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Truth or Dare"" (2018) wasn't a bad horror movie as i expected it to be judging from its low ratings and reviews. It has actually a great concept, unfortunately the story itself could have been better. There are many eye rolling moments in here which involved our heroes doing something very stupid. But acting was pretty OK for this material. And the movie also does not drag - at running time 1 h 35 min i was stupidly entertained.Overall, ""Truth or Dare"" is not bad horror flick, but its not a very scary movie.

Especially considering that 2018 was a dire year and therefore there was stiff competition.It tells the story of a group of friends who find themselves trapped in a supernatural game of truth & dare which has lethal consequences. Fine, it sounds goofy but it's really not.With an unknown roster I was able to see characters rather than actors and I always appreciate that. They do a great job and the premise is fantastic, one that I'd love to see taken further it's even franchise worthy.You see it has limitless potential, there are so many possibilities. Did they utilize it well here? Yeah, but they did bring a long of ""Teen"" angst into it which I felt was one of its biggest flaws.A clever little horror movie this was unexpectedly good. It's not scary, it's not gory, it's smart and I think that's something that horror has been lacking lately.My advice is to ignore the unexplained hatred and give this one a go, I really enjoyed it.The Good:Incredible conceptWell executedInteresting finaleThe Bad:Fire the sound guy""Teen"" angst",Truth or Dare

23,cruise01,Entertaining that keeps you interested but lacks in being scary.,6,19 July 2018,"Truth or Dare (3 out of 5 stars).Truth or Dare seems like a stupid idea of a supernatural horror movie. Which it is with the idea of the plot. But it is nonetheless entertaining to see five teenagers trying to figure out how to survive this deadly game. It does have a similar concept to It Follows movie. Except this time, it is teenagers caught in a game of truth or dare and the results can lead to deadly consequences. The plot is decent and does have some stupid concept. But it works on being entertaining. A group of teenagers played by Lucy Hale, Tyler Posey, Violett Beane, Hayden Szeto all head out to Mexico for a mini vacation. Which leads to lots of drinking and partying. Olivia (Lucy Hale) tries to keep the peace within her friends. When her friend Markie (Violett Beane) tries to flirt and hooking up with others while her boyfriend is nearby. She tries to control her friend. Olivia meets a stranger Carter (Landon Liboiron). Who takes her and her friends to an abandoned church. Were they play a game of truth or dare. Carter than breaks the news that Olivia and her friends are trapped in a deadly game. Were a demonic possession shows up to one of them and tells them truth or dare. If they pick truth, they have to say the truth or dare they have to follow the dare. Otherwise, they will get killed by some demonic thing. The film is quite entertaining. Seeing these group of teens trying to play the game to survive. One's dare is to walk the rooftop while drinking. While truths are breaking relationships and friendships as characters have secrets towards each other. One character has to face telling the truth on coming out of the closet towards their father. Plus, the deaths do get a little brutal with stabbing in the eye or breaking ones hand with an hammer. For a supernatural horror movie, the film does fail at being scary. It was not scary at all. It has some thrills. But it lacks in building the suspense. The direction failed at creating the horror tone. At least, It Follows was creepy and scary in a way. Also, when characters see a demonic version of them telling them truth or dare with an evil smiling grin. It is cheesy. And you see plenty of that throughout the movie. By the time the movie also finishes, you will also be annoyed with the words truth or dare that is said throughout. Overall, Truth or Dare is a fair horror movie. The concept is cheesy and dumb. But it is entertaining to see how the conflict of this deadly game is resolved when these teens are faced with life and death situations. With secrets unraveling and tough dare actions they have to do. The film does lack horror and suspense. So do not expect to be scared.",Truth or Dare
24,TheMovieDiorama,"Truth or Dare daringly goes where no horror has gone before, to the realms of stupidity.",2,18 April 2018,"Incomprehensibly dumb. Categorically absurd. Insultingly boring. I'm done. I'm just done. I know, let's play a game! Truth or Dare? Oh no no, you can't pick truth because it's a rule I made just to make the game that little tiny bit more ""exciting"". Right, so I've forced you to pick dare. Let's see...ahh yes, I dare you to watch this film and not fall asleep. Trust me when I tell you, it is an almighty challenge. Urghhh. So a group of friends go to Mexico during their spring break and encounter a guy who wants to play truth or dare. The game quickly comes to an end...or does it? They return home, the game strangely continues and their lives are put in danger. Blah blah blah who cares, this is utter rubbish. The premise in itself is ludicrous, which is fine I mean look at Blumhouse's surprise hit 'Happy Death Day' last year, but the execution was atrocious. Instead of intelligently crafting a gimmick that easily could've metaphorically represented the break up of friendship over lies, they opted for a more generic storyline that we've all seen before. That third act reveal was horrifically uninspired, I nearly lost all hope. I was so close to walking out, but I persisted. I battled through. Then the ending arrived...! What. Even. Was. That!? I get it, I understand the choice. Yet the lack of character development made the conclusion feel completely out of character. The truths and dares were tame, even in attempting to throw in some plot twists, I didn't care. T'was boring, I was more focussed on which flavour of rice to have with my chicken for dinner when I got home (I chose egg fried rice, a daringly bold choice). The acting was fine, and is probably the only good element to this horror. The chemistry within the friendship group felt natural, although the script lacked any substance or personality which consequently meant I couldn't connect with the characters. This is by far the worst film I've seen this year. Bland, boring and bogus. Seriously though, I dare you to watch this. Just so you can share my pain.",Truth or Dare

27,jtindahouse,Another great edition to the new brand of horror film,8,9 May 2018,"Here's the thing: very few people are able to be scared by a simple horror movie anymore. People are just too clued up about the realities of the universe and how unlikely 99% of the scenarios put forward are to ever actually effect anyone. So, aside from just giving up on the genre altogether, what is the logical next step? To start being smart, creative and fun with your horror movies. And if done correctly it can work an absolute treat. Late in 2017 'Happy Death Day' blew me away with just what a rollercoaster ride in managed to be. Earlier in 2017 'Get Out' was a masterpiece of a film. Now while I wouldn't quite describe 'Truth or Dare' as being as good as those films, it's still a hell of a good movie.It reminded me a lot of the 'Final Destination' series (which I also love). 'Final Destination' was ahead of its time in that it was creative horror before there was a demand for creative horror. 'Truth or Dare's biggest strength is all the possibilities it lends itself too. There are so many tunnels to be explored and because it moves at a rollicking pace it is able to cover quite a few of them.This isn't a film that is trying to scare you in any way (the scariest thing about the movie is probably the image each face forms when it becomes demonised). In stead it sets up solid characters, a fun and entertaining premise and a great pace. I love this new trend in the horror genre and as long as the films continue to be this good, long may it continue.",Truth or Dare
28,stevendbeard,Wait For It To Hit Cable TV,5,14 April 2018,"I saw ""Truth or Dare"", starring Lucy Hale-Pretty Little Liars_tv, Scream 4; Tyler Posey-Teen Wolf_tv, Scarey Movie 5; Violett Beane-The Flash_tv_2015_2018, Flay and Landon Liboiron-Frontier_tv, Hemlock Grove_tv.
This is a teen horror movie that is pretty standard material. In fact, you could-and should-just wait for it to come to cable tv. A group of teens, including Lucy, Tyler and Violett, are partying down in Mexico when they run into Landon. Landon takes them out to an old abandoned church where he gets them to play a game of Truth or Dare. What the unsuspecting teens don't know-Landon knows but he is not telling them-is that there is a curse involved that has a demon that possesses the game players. If they pick truth, they have to tell the truth. If they pick dare, they must complete the dare. Otherwise, they die-usually, in horrible ways. When the demon takes control of the player-they take turns in order and if they survive the game, it repeats with each surviving player until they don't survive anymore-it contorts their face into a menacing looking grin. I read that the producers of the movie even nicknamed it, the Willem DaFoe grin.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, disturbing content, alcohol use, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. If I was you, I would wait until it hits cable tv.",Truth or Dare

31,juneebuggy,Entertaining enough,4,1 November 2019,"This follows a group of college friends who travel to Mexico for spring break and get pulled into a game of truth or dare by a guy they meet there. It turns into a fight for survival after they return home and start getting mysteriously killed off one by one if they don't carry out the dare or say the truth. The supernatural entity or curse bears down on each characters flaws.This was ok, entertaining enough, nothing too gory in terms of deaths, mostly suicides, pencils in the head or falling. None of the characters seemed all that bothered as their friends started getting killed, in one case it's a boyfriend and she's like oh well lets move on. Also someone has sex with someone else's boyfriend on a dare and that's forgotten about immediately, no emotions. Overall this is easily forgotten, I watched it 2 days ago and its almost gone from my mind.",Truth or Dare
32,kluseba,Shallow but fun,7,18 April 2018,"Truth or Dare is an entertaining yet superficial horror movie that is best enjoyed with a couple of friends at a party. It tells the story of a group of friends who go to Mexico during spring break and get lured into an old cathedral by a charismatic stranger who invites them to play a game of Truth or Dare. It turns out the game is controlled by a demon who was summoned by a young nun who got abused by a priest a long time ago. The demon forces the players of the game to complete their quests or else they will die. As the friends die one by one and tension rises between them, they have to find a way to stick together and end the deadly game for good.There are several elements I like about the film. It's overall entertaining and keeps a steady pace from start to finish. Some of the quests are interesting and several characters die under spectacular circumstances. The background story behind the game is intriguing and adds a creepy atmosphere. The film's resolution took me by surprise as it is rather unusual and worth being discussed.On the negative side, the movie only has a few minor jump scares and isn't as creepy as I would have expected. The characters remain quite superficial and one doesn't really care about their survival. The acting performances are disappointingly shallow as any amateur group would have played more intensely than those actresses and actors. Apart of the conclusion, the story isn't too surprising and reminds of a weak mixture of Final Destination and Jumanji.In the end, Truth or Dare is an entertaining horror movie to be watched among friends at a party. It's intense enough to keep it interesting from start to finish and the film's resolution is quite original. However, the shallow acting performances, the lack of scary moments and the poor script ripping off Final Destination and Jumanji are reasons for not purchasing this film for your horror movie collection. Watching Truth or Dare once is fun but it isn't the type of movie that deserves being revisited.",Truth or Dare
33,davispittman,Don't get the hate,9,19 May 2018,"Blumhouse's Truth or Dare is a very entertaining horror-thriller. I decided to ignore the many many negative reviews of the film and check it out. I am very glad I did. This film surrounds college aged characters who mistakenly enter a very dangerous game of truth or dare. They are on vacation in Mexico, its their last spring break. Olivia (Lucy Hale) gets invited by a seemingly innocent stranger who stook up for her at a bar to this mission where he promises them drinks. They get there and start drinking and playing this game, then he announces his true motivation behind his invitation. When this game starts.... bad things start happening. The cast was great, I really liked everyone's performances. Lucy Hale turns in a skilled, believable performance as the lead. Tyler Posey gives a very good performance here too. The rest of the was good as well. The characters were well written and had enough depth to them for me as the viewer to care about what happens to them. For me, caring about the characters is huge in a film, one of the most important things. The writing was well done also, I was kept engaged throughout the whole thing. Very good length too, the runtime was just right. Overall, I highly suggest this film. 9/10.",Truth or Dare

35,Pairic,OK Horror,7,18 April 2018,"Truth Or Dare: Always an interesting game but not usually as deadly as the one in this film. Five college friends and a hanger-on are spending Spring Break in Mexico. Olivia (Lucy Hale) meets Carter (Landon Liboiron) at a bar and he persuades the group to go to a derelict mission church to drink some takeaways. Ten he starts a game of Truth Or Dare but it soon becomes obvious something sinister is occuring. Carter disappears after telling Olivia that failure to tell the truth or carry out a dare will result in death and that he is trying to escape from The Game.The friends return home but The Game is far from over. Olivia hallucinates that a crowd with distorted faces in a library are demanding that she ""Truth Or Dare"", she blurts out that her friend Markie (Violett Beane) is cheating on her boyfriend Tyler (Lucas Moreno). Increasingly the group are faced with telling damaging truths or carrying out dangerous. dares. The hanger-on breaks his neck after failing to carry out a dare, more truths devastate those they are told to/about. The Game continues Round after Round. A participant in a previous round sets a woman on fire with lighter fluid, the police know something strange is going on but do not comprehend the enormity of the situation.This story type has been told before, most notably in the Final Destinatination series and there's nothing novel in Truth Or Dare but it does have an internal logic which many such films lack. It could have been tightened up, 90 minutes rather than its 100 minute running time might have resulted in a better film. Some good frights, interesting origin story for The Game and amusing resolution. Direction (by Jeff Wadlow). dialogue and acting is OK so I'm giving this 6.5/10.",Truth or Dare
36,jfgibson73,Very easy to watch,5,29 August 2021,"I don't have any problems with this movie. It's meant to be a horror film, and it's aimed at kids. It's not terribly clever, but it never gets boring or grossly implausible (given the rules the film establishes). There isn't really anything too memorable or any great performances, but it moves along at a good pace. Not scary or tense, just lighter than air moviemaking.",Truth or Dare
37,aidanratesmovies,Not as bad as I was expecting,7,5 October 2020,"Enjoyable to a fault, Truth or Dare is more often than not a guilty pleasure sort of fun, but it proves to be entertaining all the way throughout- even despite of some weaker aspects. The script is basic, nothing special really. We focus on a bunch of random college kids who can honestly be rather stereotypical. Luckily though, unlike other horror flicks of the same nature, we are able to delve a little deeper into these characters, even if in the end it doesn't really amount to much. The film has some silly moments for sure, what else can you expect from a movie about a Truth or Dare game gone wrong, but it does prove to be quite thrilling at times, and it does have its scarier or at the very least, more intense moments. Lucy Hale provides the best of the performances, and everyone else honestly proves to be rather average, forgettable, or mediocre. I feel the biggest flaw of the film is the ending, not only because it ended on a cliffhanger with a very abrupt nature, but also because it seemed to forced- as if the writers just wrote themselves into a corner and it was there only option. In the end, Truth or Dare is about what you would expect from a Blumhouse film of this nature, but it is entertaining to watch, and it proves to be a good time, if you're able to turn your mind off for the majority of it, and just enjoy.

39,robertemerald,Solid horror in the style of an urban myth curse,8,22 December 2019,"Truth or Dare isn't really an urban myth, but it's very close to being one, the basic premise being all those 'infected' will die unless they somehow beat the curse. In this case that curse came from a summoning way back decades ago, one that was contained at that time by the summoner. So there is a bit of detective work for those trying to survive in the present day, much as with the other current urban myth late teen specials, Slender Man (2018) and The Bye Bye Man (2017). There may be hope but it is very slim: this is the story line to these movies, this is the kick to survival. Truth or Dare is as good as the two mentioned, and, like them, once it gets going it's quite an adrenaline ride. Back in the late 1990s we used to play with a software called Kai's Goo. The filmmakers here are doing the same, and to great effect, but that and fireball eyes is about all the special effects you will see, save a building nearly comes down. In my opinion that's what this movie needed. We needed to see more creepy effects demonstrating an actual evil presence. It's just a small quibble. The actors were really good, and there were plenty of them, a nice touch. It was also interesting to see horror in ordinary suburbia, rather than an already creepy house. That is surely harder for filmmakers, but in this one they certainly succeeded. I really enjoyed Truth or Dare, and I'm pretty confident that I could dare anyone else to enjoy it and, truly, I believe they would.",Truth or Dare
40,rgkarim,Do you Dare To Go In?,6,15 April 2018,"Another weekend, another horror movie to arise in the dim lights of the theater. This weekend, the big advertised thriller of young age adults versus the paranormal has reared its superficial prettiness in hopes of generating big bucks. While the trailers have painted a very skeptical picture, but you never know what lies beneath the snippets edited in the trailers. Robbie K here with the third review of the weekend, bringing some thoughts and observations on the latest films to hit the silver screen. Let's get started with this review of:Film: Truth or DareDirector:
 Jeff WadlowWriters:
 Jillian Jacobs (screenplay by), Michael Reisz (screenplay by) Stars:
 Lucy Hale, Tyler Posey, Violett Beane 
LIKES: Good Pace: Horror movies are a mixed bag of either being too slow or too fast. Truth or Dare is fortunately one of those that seems to hit just the right speed to allow for everything to pan out as it should be. This reviewer appreciated the brisk pace brought about by the pressure of the game, adding some slight edge and mystery as to when the next challenge would arise in a rather predictable plot. Yet, the movie still took the time to allow their characters to semi-flesh out their issues and dive a little deeper than their superficial looks. A nice balance is always nice to see. Pretty Cast: Pretty faces go a long way in this business, and Truth or Dare is chock full of attractive puppets set to potentially meet their doom. This Abercrombie and Fitch models will be pleasing to many eyes, which does a lot of heavy lifting in the beginning to accommodate the typical montage. And even throughout the drama, the looks will garnish more attention than the acting itself. Still, the costume and casting get two thumbs up for fashioning a target audience relatable ensemble. Decent Acting: While the looks are certainly a big picture, the acting is still semi-decent alongside the directing. Most of the cast actually deserves some props for fashioning characters that didn't make me cringe or wish they would die. Hale in particular was my favorite, using her talents to craft a very versatile character capable of being relatable to. Once more a portrayal of morals vs self-preservation, the lovely young woman more than delivered a stellar performance that evolved as her character adapted. A Unique Concept: The Truth or Dare game that is deadly might seem cheesy, but it wins points for originality in my book. A simple child's game (that can get out of control sometimes) as a device of death opened up creative avenues of potential fatality that kept things interesting. While a little over the top at times, (though not as bad as Final Destination), it was cool to see this dynamic stay consistent and the strategy for how to get around the traps set forth. DISLIKES:Character Development: The movie had a good start and a device to drive growth, but sadly that growth was fairly diluted for much of the characters. Most of the cast were still shallow teens with drama that did nothing more than paint massive targets on their backs, falling into the slasher formula that many seem to enjoy. While the game did drive some things to change for the two leads, the movie could have benefitted from a little more branching out. Story Takes Some Dives: The story actually held some gold nuggets in terms of quality, but that quickly dulled into fool's gold as the plot elements dipped. The twist behind the games lethal forces, the other players who had the more sinister characteristics, and even the solutions were hinted at times only to be dropped. More suspense and thrills could have been accomplished had they expanded on this category. They started to clean it up at the end with the solution to the problem and the tension that came with it, leading to a rather engaging ending, but the middle of the movie could have used this treatment. Rushed Deaths: Some of the kills in this movie are intense bouts of our ""heroes"" racing against the clock to stop the game's effects. These kills are the more engaging, changing the odds to a more even split on their survival. Others, are merely cheap wrap ups that the teenage group seem to drink up, which is a little disappointing at not delivering on the potential that was there. Perhaps for the shorter attention span of the modern age, but still could have been better than what was presented. Idiot Syndrome: Where A Quiet Place held realism, fear, and logic, Truth or Dare sadly falls victim to the famous idiot syndrome where the characters brains are absent after the first scene. While this isn't true for all characters, many of them seem to have their logic components absent during much of the film. Why this annoying trait can't be teased out a little more makes no sense to me, but the old stick continues to make for an annoying component that takes away from the characters, degrading them to MTV reality status. The VERDICT:
 Truth or Dare falls victim to the cliché of teenage horror syndrome, in that is a gimmicky display of airheads going up against an unstoppable supernatural force. True, it does have an original medium to terrorize our actors through, pretty cast with decent acting, and a good pace to entertain, it falls shy of being an epic horror. It's good for the teenage and young adults target audience, but for an audience as a whole this movie is better left for renting than anything else. If only the MTV syndrome could have been avoided, because this quality is what dilutes an otherwise engaging premise. My scores are: Horror/Thriller: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0",Truth or Dare
41,rannynm,"As a huge fan of horror films, I loved it!",8,12 April 2018,"Truth or Dare is a new thriller that has the audience questioning their real abilities and intentions behind the fun-filled game. I am a huge fan of horror and thriller films and was so excited to see the amazing acting and suspense behind this work. This film offers jump-scares, second guessing and is loads of fun to watch with friends.Olivia (Lucy Hale) and a couple of her college friends take a trip to Mexico for a final getaway before graduation. Little did they know it would turn into something more. While there, they meet a stranger who convinces Olivia to play a harmless, fun game of ""truth or dare"" with the others. The game starts and so does chaos which follows the group back to their hometown, releasing all their deepest and darkest secrets. The rules are quite simple, but fearful: tell the truth or die; do the dare, or die. No one gets out alive if you don't play by the rules. Or do they?Growing up, my friends and I always played the game ""truth or dare"" at sleepovers. This movie made me question what secrets are we all hide in this game? If the consequences were real, such as they are in this film, how would we react? My favorite part of this film is how I was able to somewhat relate to the characters. They are all teens, as am I. So, it really had me feeling as if I was in their shoes and made me question what I have done in order to survive. I adore the cast, because each one has something to offer to the character they play.The message in this film is about being honest with your friends and family and to trust one another in any circumstance. Olivia and her friends are torn apart towards the beginning of the film, due to their belief about whether or not the game was real. Once their eyes are opened, they work together in hopes of beating the game and surviving. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has a great storyline, cast and cinematography. I it for ages 13 to 18. I recommend seeing it with a group of friends to really get the full effect. Also, it would be more fun! It opens nationwide in theaters on April 13, 2018 so, be sure to check it out. Think about this film the next time you play ""truth or dare"" with your friends!Reviewed by Imani G., KIDS FIRST!

42,vengeance20,Sinister Film,8,13 April 2018,"Didn't know anything about this film being made until seeing a trailer 2 weeks before release. I was excited as soon as I seen it & also after finding out it was made by Blumhouse, I knew I had to!The film is about a group of friends who travel to Mexico for the Easter Holidays only to meet a man named Carter/Sam, who gets them to play a game of Truth or Dare. But things turn sinister as Carter/Sam bails, only to tell them to follow the rules of the game or they'll die. The group heads home only to find that the game itself, the demonic spirit Calax, has followed them back & each time they find themselves being asked Truth or Dare, they must either tell the truth in order to live, or do a dare, but if they refuse to dare, or refuse to play out right, then they die a horrific death!The film was quite fast pacing & good! There were some good deaths, but not gory enough for me, sadly. But they creative & though provoking!The story-line was interesting & kept you interested! But the end left me feeling a little bit mixed as it wasn't your typical of an ending, but hell, it was satisfying enough!Overall a pretty good film from Blumhouse! 8/10",Truth or Dare

44,Foutainoflife,Average Horror Flick,5,12 July 2018,This has been done a million times before. Friends run blindly into a situation which leaves them in the position of each dying off one by one.

48,educallejero,Great idea. I might be too old for this?,4,17 August 2018,"It has plenty of great things, visually and story wise. The idea is awesome. But I don't agree with some decisions, plus some parts of the production are clearly low quality.
For example. The exposition in the first act is embarrasingly bad. Just AWFUL.
Then you have complete scenes that are basically identical. Literally the characters do same thing they did before, but with new information.
The acting is quite bad, but not way worse than in general in these movies.
And the ""personal"" plot of the story (the relationships between characters) are beyond repetitive. Its INSANE how they go around the same things over and over and over with every little bit of new information that we (they) discover.But I can't deny that it has some amazing concepts. It works on a meta level. It works as a metaphor of some things that happened (and happens) in our world too. 
So. Its fine. I would normaly give this movie a five (mediocre, which is ok and not a waste of time), but some things bothered me too much.",Truth or Dare
49,rockman182,Truth or Dare (2018),5,21 April 2018,"I've watched Pretty Little Liars (unfortunately) and I've kind of always thought Lucy Hale wasn't a good actress, so seeing that she was the lead in a film wasn't really convincing. Still, as is the case with everything else I decided to give this film its fair shot. The film had a weirdly entertaining premise but then falls into pitfalls and cliches we see before and ultimately fails to be a good film. Some moments are good but the stale script and non-engagement of the film make it disappointing.The film is about a group of friends who are spending their spring break in Mexico. Once there, they meet a guy who convinces them to travel to a desolate location and play a game of truth or dare. They soon realize that they are trapped in this very real game. If the group do not do a truth or dare properly they are killed. There also other rules to the game that are revealed as the film goes along. The friends must find a way to break the curse of the game before they all die out.The acting from the cast isn't all that and its hard to get invested into any of their characters. Why should you even care about this group of friends. There are many cliches that are so familiar. The friends who don't believe, the friends that cheat on each other, the curse of a foreign location, the final girls. Everything has been seen and done before. The film is also devoid of any scares. Blumhouse productions has been responsible for a better brand of horror so this pales in comparison to other films.There is nothing memorable here except for the insanely stupid looking grinning faces of the characters. This actually feels like it should be a fan made Youtube or something like that. It'll do the minimum of providing a somewhat entertaining time but it cannot be denied that this is a very average teeny ""horror"" film that's been seen and done before and has no chilling moments. Don't take the dare of watching this.5/10",Truth or Dare

After they return from their holiday, a malevolent being forces them to continue playing the game, or face dire consequences. Truth or Dare is a typical horror movie. Sure, there are no moments where you actually get scared during the course of the film. However, it is still super fun to watch, is occasionally creepy & sometimes can be unintentionally funny. The main flaw of the movie is that, you don't really care as to what's going to happen to the characters in it. Director Jeff Wadlow has still given us a fun, time-pass film, that's worth one watch. Lucy Hale is spectacular as Olivia Barron. Tyler Posey is brilliant as Lucas Moreno. Violett Beane is superb as Markie Cameron. Sophia Ali is great as Penelope Amari. Nolan Gerard Funk is excellent as Tyson Curran. Hayden Szeto is good as Brad Chang. The supporting cast is impressive. Truth or Dare is not a must watch on the big screen.

52,dave-mcclain,"a thin premise, but a pretty good movie",6,14 April 2018,"""Truth or Dare"" (PG-13, 1:40) is a horror thriller, based on the adolescent party game, which has existed in some form for centuries and traces its roots to the ancient Greeks. Of course, this being a Blumhouse production, it gives the old game of ""Questions and Commands"" a scary supernatural twist. This obvious new horror franchise (calling it so seems to be a pretty safe bet) is directed by Jeff Wadlow (""Kick Ass 2"", ""Never Back Down"") and is written by Jillian Jacobs (not Gillian Jacobs from TV's ""Community""), Michael Reisz, Christopher Roach (all of whom are brand new or fairly new at writing feature films) and Wadlow. The cast is made up of little-known actors, who've done most of their acting to date on TV and online.Olivia (Lucy Hale) is a pretty and friendly (and dull and responsible) college senior who focuses on doing good deeds like organizing Habitat for Humanity builds, but always seems to make time for her friends, especially her best friend, Markie (Violett Bean), whose father died by suicide years earlier. It's not easy, but Markie convinces Olivia to put her good-deed-doing on hold to join her and her boyfriend, Lucas (Tyler Posey), and some other friends, in going to Mexico for their last spring break together.They all have a grand old time south of the border and, on their last night of vacation, they don't want the good times to end. When the bars close, they follow a guy called Carter (Landon Liboiron), who has spent much of the evening talking to Olivia, to an abandoned (and trashed) old church on a hill. There, Carter suggests a game of Truth or Dare, which goes pretty much as the game usually goes (some uncomfortable truths, some awkward kissing and groping and a naked butt or two)... until Carter has a turn, chooses ""truth"", tells the group he lured them there and tricked them into playing... then leaves.When Olivia and company come back to their lives and back to reality, it seems that the game has followed them home (as Carter said it would, before he apologized and disappeared). They all learn that the rules of Truth or Dare 2.0 (Evil Edition) are that if you fail to choose an option (truth or dare) when asked (by people or writing only you can see), you die. If you fail to answer a question totally truthfully or perform a required task completely, you die. If you insist on always choosing ""truth"" to avoid some dangerous assignment, you... well, you get the point.

53,markthomassintek,Spoiled by giving all of the answers,5,3 May 2020,"REVIEW - TRUTH OR DAREYou've possibility head of the game of Truth or Dare, you may even have played it, for those who haven't you take it in turns to either answer truth fully to a question or do a dare, if you don't you have to do a for fit.A group of young high school kids (it's always high school kids) go to Mexico on spring break, whilst there they are persuaded to go to an old deralict church to play a game of truth or dare.The church is cursed and the game becomes real, if the person either doesn't tell the truth or complete a dare they pay the ultimate fore fit and die.Of course telling the truth and exposing secrets causes trouble between the friends which lead to people falling out and falling off (no spoilers).Sounds like a good film yes? And though as much but......I know the internet can be a great tool but one thing that in these films I will never understand is how after a quick 2 minute search they find exactly what, where, how and who. This film is a prime example and as such the story is spoiled with no anticipation and as such you don't really care about what happens to whom and why or how, which is such a shame because yet again this film has been spoiled by giving all of the answers and leaving nothing to your imagination. Such a shame because this could have been so much better.Rating 5 out of 10",Truth or Dare

63,doctorsmoothlove,Perfect for cheesy movie night!,1,22 April 2019,"Sometimes you see a movie that is so inept in one way or another that you feel like the filmmakers must not have realized how poor their movie was. Sometimes a movie's premise is so dumb that under no one's guidance could it have been good. ""Truth or Dare"" is that special kind of bad movie that falls into both categories. It is so unintentionally humorous in its efforts to scare and supremely stupid you can't help but chuckle.Imagine a world where modern college students must play a truth or dare game that could kill them. That's the entire premise. The game of truth or dare is haunted by a demon that forces participants to pick ""dare"" after every two ""truths"" to give what little plot their is some gravity. If a player refuses to do the dare or lies, the demon possesses them and kills them. The demon can cause players to see anyone nearby smile in a Joker-like manner which signifies turn order. The smiling person then says truth or dare in gruff, ""scary"" voice. The smiling is so exaggerated and happens so often that it's awesome. The demon can also control reflections in a mirror, corpses, and pre-recorded cell phone videos when there aren't any people available. The possession powers are never explained or explored in any manner. It's really funny during the obligatory sex scene to see one of the lovers suddenly look up and say, ""truth or dare.""We get repeated segments of drama for the characters that never amounts to anything to lengthen the runtime. The characters have some tired drama added to their arch prior to death for needless padding. Some of these segments would fit into a teen soap opera, which the film isn't sure if it is. None of the characters save the heroine ever develop a semblance of personality.The main character develops over a reverse character arch. It's the only intentionally successful element of this film. The film begins and she appears to be the only level headed person in the group of party mongers. She even makes videos for Habitat for Humanity for crying out loud! As the film progresses, she shows little regard for the wellbeing of her friends after she is forced to say terrible things about them. The ending totally assassinates her character in a manner that sets up a sequel that should be even funnier than this film.Truth or Dare is actually a low budget ripoff of Final Destination and makes the mistake of trying to be a scary horror movie. If the film bothered to explore the mythology of the demon or embraced the over-the-top thrill kills of Final Destination, maybe it could have been better. The final result is a movie that has no identity. The tv show actors and the use of modern technology will date this film before the end of the decade. Watch with friends and beer and you'll have a good time.",Truth or Dare
64,johannes2000-1,Nicely done non-pretentious horror-flick.,7,5 November 2018,"I kind of liked it. It's nothing special, just your regular dime a dozen horror flick with a group of friends being harassed by some supernatural force and one by one they're being killed in some weird way until the last ones standing figure the whole thing out and save the day (well, in this case they actually don't).
There's nothing wrong with it: the story is good, the script is fine with some nice creepy stuff, the special effects are limited but of fairly good quality - I especially liked the way in which the faces distorted when someone asked the proverbial question ""truth or dare??"", it gave everyone a very sinister look.
The acting is well enough, I guess Tyler Posey was hired as a star to appeal to a bigger audience and he does as fine a job as in Teenwolf and I appreciated it that the director didn't choose to make him outshine the rest, he has a modest part compared to for instance Lucy Hale who is the real central character of the movie.
And the ""solution"" that the group came up with in the last scene, to get rid of the curse, was quite cynical and in that way more interesting and original than the obligatory last scene in comparable horror-flicks where we usually just see (preferably by way of some last jump-scare) that the evil isn't over yet.",Truth or Dare

But if you don't do the dare, or if you don't tell the truth you die. And you get a really stupid grin on your face before you do it because a demon or something invades your body and takes you over and kills you if you don't do it. That's literally the movie.

This joint production between Universal and Blumhouse Productions (the people behind Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious amongst others), was a box office success despite not being the least bit scary. The entire movie comes across like a lame teenage soap opera with a high mortality rate (there's a boring sub plot involving a love triangle), and characters just die in fairly routine accidents like falling off a pool table.

74,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Truth or Dare"" (2018)",6,24 April 2019,"Blumhouse's ""Truth or Dare"" (2018) isn't high art, but it isn't quite as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 for being a passably good fright flick.It's a gimmick horror film, but the gimmick kinda works -a powerful demon possesses an oral game of ""truth or dare"" - then follows its players home from vacation with lethal consequences. It's actually not quite as stupid as it sounds; I had fun with the premise, which sounds like the basis for a decent ""The X-Files"" (1993-2018) episode. An exposition-prone minor character explains to our protagonists late in the game that demons need not infect only people and objects, but also ""ideas"" like games or competitions. The notion of an idea or a philosophy being demonically possessed has a hint of creative brilliance, and I'd love to see it fully developed in an intelligent, well written horror film.Alas, this isn't it. And instead of lovable heroes like Mulder and Scully, we get a predictable, throwaway group of unlikable teens on spring break. The movie's most interesting character is the one it sets up as the stereotypical jerk, Ronnie, adroitly played by Sam Lerner. The film would have been much better if it had fleshed him out as a three-dimensional character, and had the story revolve around him as a surprise anti-hero.""Truth of Dare"" also borrows maybe a bit too much from ""It Follows"" (2014) and ""The Ring"" films (2002-2017).

The films writing is terrible in the film as most of the time, it tries to recreate what teens say these days like ""sick"" or ""rad"". The acting is also terrible and so are the characters they play. I thought Lucy Hale was the best in the film but was still not award worthy and lastly the whole idea of the film, the films idea is stupid anyway but becomes more stupid when you see the way its executed and feels truley more like a dark comedy when you get to the scary parts, but although absouloutly disasterious, the film is also quite hilarious and entertaining and thats my review for Truth Or Dare!

80,Jared_Andrews,So Terrible that it's occassionally Funny and Fun,2,14 April 2018,"You know how some movies can be so bad that they're secretly kind of good? Truth or Dare might be one of those movies.  As far as being legitimately good, it's not. It's terrible. It's littered with nonsensical reactions, silly dialogue, and unintentionally hilarious moments. Maybe those weird smiles that every character makes at one point are scary to others, but I found them funny every time.  The movie is pretty straightforward, but I'll give a brief explanation anyway. A group of friends goes to Mexico on spring break. While there, a stranger invites them to play truth or dare in a creepy abandoned church. It turns out that the game is possessed by a demon who follows them and forces them to continue playing the game until every player is dead. Fail a dare, you die. Tell a lie, you die. Refuse to play, you die.  The game and movie are essentially Jumanji crossed with Final Destination. It's PG-13, so it's not nearly as graphic as Final Destination, which I didn't mind. It all sounds simple enough. But, the filmmakers still changed the rules throughout the movie and also radically changed what we knew about the characters. Maybe these changes were supposed to indicate that the game reveals our true selves and all the previous information was false. But that doesn't totally work because even characters who know nothing about the game change drastically from one scene to the next. This is the sort of thing that makes the movie clearly bad, but also secretly kind of good because you can laugh at the badness. The other part that partially bothered me and partially made me laugh at its absurdity was how emotionally vacant all the characters were. A friend would die, then they just moved on with a shrug. Specifically, when one guy they know (he's kind of a jerk and not exactly a friend) dies a gruesome death, one character watches the cell phone video multiple times. A person snaps his neck, and this character just watches the video with an amused look on his face, like he's watching a dog ride a skateboard. It's messed up. While this character is clearly the worst of the group, none of them are likable. If a movie is going to show a group of people die one at a time, it needs to convince us that we should care about them at least a little bit. Since the characters are unlikable and therefore difficult to sympathize with, I felt apathetic about their deaths (all except one, which I won't spoil). This is another part of the movie that's so bad that it's funny and secretly kind of good.Anyway, I'm dissecting this movie too much. The problems with the movie mostly play as funny while watching. If you want to watch and laugh at a bad scary movie with friends, Truth or Dare is fine. Just make sure you go in with low expectations.",Truth or Dare

No. Not scary, not frightening, not edge of your seat terrifying. Just enjoyable. The most you'll get out of it is a few kill scenes that make you cringe....which compared to many other so-called ""horror films"" these days, isn't all that bad.The story follows a bunch of college kids that play a game of ""Truth or Dare"" in an abandoned and desecrated church during their springbreak trip to Mexico. ""The game"" follows them home because unbeknowst to them they're being haunted by demon that has possessed the game and forced them to continue to play via questions presented through tweets, instant messages, and hallucinations. Failure to comply means death....in a most creative and gruesome way. While watching this, I couldn't help but imagine that if the game of Truth or Dare was swapped out for a videocassette, we'd have ""The Ring"". If it was swapped out for another game, we'd have the film ""Ouiji"". So in the world of horror films, we've been down this road before. It's certainly a rehashed concept, rehashed to death in fact, but despite that and the fact that it heavily relies on a number of horror movie tropes (especially in regard to the characters and their traits....the bad girl, the brainy girl, the partyboy, the nerd...etc...), it's still an overall enjoyable film, atleast on first watch....because after you watch it once, you'll never need to watch it again.",Truth or Dare

It did however suffer from the same issue as Fantasy Island like bad dialogue. I'm telling you this group of writers write like they are making a sitcom. If you put laugh tracks under some of the one liners that characters says you would have a sitcom. An unfunny sitcom but still. I also feel like they are tone deaf when it comes to like 'young people' today, they just go for archetypal character E.g Nerd, Bro, Good Girl ect and then add like random pop culture buzz words.The CGI/Snapchat filter that they pasted over people's face in this movie was hilarious but it wasn't meant to be and what confuses me even more is one of the characters literally says ""it looks like a Snapchat filter"".

91,lucasnochez,Film Review: Truth or Dare/www.nightfilmreviews.com,5,12 May 2018,"Imagine if Willem Dafoe and Jack Nicholson's the Joker had a baby and was captured with that disturbing and oddly sinister SnapChat filter that embellishes your mouth. Now imagine that offspring haunted and followed you around declaring you choose ""Truth or Dare"" in a twisted game of survival, untimely death and mutilation. Well, if you've pictured that perfectly in your head, then you've visualized the type of disturbing and demonic visions torturing a young group of teenagers who have played a deadly game of truth or dare in Mexico. Aside from the film adding to a long list of reasons why young teenage Canadians should NOT visit Mexico during spring/march break, Truth Or Dare is the latest low-budget horror film to come out of the infamous and highly profitable Blumhouse production house, spearheaded by Jason Blum.Blum, who has gained quite the reputation in Hollywood for profiting big on low-budget horror films for the last decade, on film series like The Purge, Paranormal Activity, Insidious, Sinister as well as the extremely well received and Oscar winning film Get Out, seems to still has a soft spot for B-level teenage horror films based on simple premises.With his latest, Truth or Dare, a film that was pitched just from its title and an opening scene that was thought-up of on the spot between director Jeff Wadlow and Blum in a meeting room, Blum surely doesn't intend on showing much originality or any intent on following up with his highly praised Get Out, even if Truth or Dare doesn't even compare to his last film Happy Death Day, a fun film that spins the very familiar Groundhog Day narrative motif on its head, adding the right amount of blood and gore.""Do the dare, or you die. Tell the truth, or you die"" are really all the rules you need to know when it comes to the game, although the game does make its own rules as the film progresses, making it really hard for Olivia (Lucy Hale), Lucas (Tyler Posey), Markie (Violett Beane) and Brad (Hayden Szet0) to come out of the game with their lives.While many of the truths that are revealed between the young group of friends, there isn't much revealed that would be worth losing your life over. Sure, there are some confessions of crushes surfacing, as well as sexual preferences being forcefully admitted to and true loves being named, but other than that, the stakes of their virtues and truth really aren't that menacing. Director Jeff Wadlow, who has had experience in the horror genre with his much better debut feature film Cry Wolf, shows the lack of originality and the dependency of jump scares and cheap thrills that fall flat.While I have always been terrified of menacing faces, the demon Calax, who is possessing this group of teenagers, shaping their faces to those eerie smiles, is lacklustre at best. Looking more like a cheap SnapChat filter, the frights (like the $3.5 million budget) are low in Truth or Dare. While I dare you to find any real character development in these paper thin teenagers who suffer from what would be the definition of 'first-world problems', one cannot help but noticed just how daringly bland Truth or Dare really is. Taking cues from previous horror films whose main demonic entity is completely invisible, like The Final Destination series and dare I say the immaculate It Follows, Truth or Dare seems to emulate too much without offering much else to the genre. Most of all, not that anyone was expecting a film like this to be an Oscar contender in 2019, but these types of films rely heavily on one of its most important qualities, and that is being a fun time at the movies. But like any crappy dare you need to fulfill, watching Truth Or Dare is more of a chore than a pleasure.Truth Or Dare is teenage horror fare looking to cash in on mediocre first week numbers, and a film that will quickly disappear without ever being remembered. Hypocritical from start to finish, boasting way too much exposition from the opening scenes in Mexico to an ending that was way too sinister for its own good (which also one of the few redeeming factors of the film), Truth Or Dare is a film that we hope doesn't inspire a horror film franchise series aptly titled ""spin the bottle"" or ""seven seconds in heaven"".",Truth or Dare
92,skullhead739,Better than the reviews say,7,4 January 2020,"Okay, I'm seeing so much hate and bad reviews for this film when it is by far not the worst thing out there. In my case I actually really enjoyed it, and here's why.Plot:
The plot may seem like the average typical teen horror flick with teens dying and a evil entity behind it. But this film is at least unique, I've never seen any other film about a truth or dare game killing people. Its interesting and shot decent enough to put together a enjoyable experience for the viewer.Acting:
The performances are pretty good, not oscar winning, but good. All characters seem real and interesting, and you feel a sense of care for them through their challenges in the story.Cinematography:
This film is shot well, it has decent CGI, and for the low budget a very watchable piece of cinema. The cgi ""snapchat filter like smiles"" are a unique creepy additive to this film.Conclusion:
Overall this film was interesting, unique and very enjoyable for me. For most people who like quirky horror movie ideas I dont think you will be disappointed with this one. It doesnt deserve the hate by other reviewers.",Truth or Dare

94,iguth,Poorly thought out,3,27 April 2019,"Truth or Dare was a cookie cutter horror/thriller with nothing interesting or unique in the slightest. Although jump scares have of course been overplayed in the horror franchise, a movie like this one really falls flat when it is so predictable. The opening sequence is basic and it only leads into a basic spooky plot that you already knew from the trailer. It is cool when it changes settings but the latter half of the film was really poorly done. A huge negative was the characters that you never really get attached to. A good thriller/horror should have a good concept for an antagonist (not a mediocre one) and the audience should be able to have at least one character that they are disappointed to see go. Overall it really is as bad as people say.",Truth or Dare

96,justinwfirestone,No joy in this curse,4,23 April 2018,"It is, ahem, Blumhouse's Truth or Dare, not just any-old, plain-old Truth or Dare. It's not the sixth installment of the cult classic Truth or Dare? : A Critical Madness, even though it psychologically draws from the same wells. It's not anything to do with Madonna: Truth or Dare. It is its own self, although sex still kills, college kids love to drink a lot on Spring Break, and if there's a really mysterious curse that seems unstoppable, you can always find some kind of answers through clever Google queries, preferably using Apple products whenever possible.Be a good friend and don't be a jerk, or else you are going to get far less screen time than your cohorts, and definitely no nooky. The game of Truth or Dare? is no fun when the truth hurts and the dares maim. In fact, that's the biggest problem with Blumhouse's Truth or Dare: it's not fun. Unlike Happy Death Day or The Strangers: Prey at Night, there's almost no self-awareness that this is a pretty bad idea for a movie, no joy in an insipid plot with senseless violence.You can dare to speak the truth, and you can truthfully respond to a dare, but maybe fate is real and none of us really have any control over our lives, let alone anyone else's. Demons can be sealed in clay pots, but it often requires outwitting the demon and the demon will never forget anything, not even when black-out drunk in Mexico, or probably especially when black-out drunk in Mexico.Spring Break can be a lot of fun, but it also poses many risks, and you should never trust the cute lonely guy at the bar because he's alone for a reason.",Truth or Dare
97,TheMovieDoctorful,How Was I Surprised?,1,5 November 2018,"Why in God's name did I ever think this might be a good film? It's a ripoff of both Final Destination and It Follows, two movies I already consider to be absolutely awful, that lacks the visceral, guilty pleasure violence of the former and the atmospheric, tense soundtrack of the latter. Maybe it's because the last time Blumhouse made a teen Horror film based on a seemingly dumb premise, Unfriended, I actually ended up really loving it. Truth or Dare is basically like if Unfriended was ACTUALLY as terrible, stupid and annoying as people made it out to be.There's only one good performance in this film, and that's Hayden Szeto as Brad. He's a likable presence and at least makes an attempt to give some pathos to his character, a closeted gay teen in conflict between his outcast sexuality and his popular social status. He's the only character that kept me even remotely invested in this film. Landon Liboiron is in this movie as well, who I've definitely loved in other things, but he's so underused in this movie that his performance isn't even worth mentioning. I just find it funny how the most talented actor in the entire film is the one who gets hardly any lines or screentime. This film couldn't do anything right.It says a lot about Lucy Hale as an actress when her career highlight is getting killed off in the fictional Stab 6 from Scream 4. She seems to think that tilting your head incessantly to be ""quirky"" and bulging your eyes out like the Scrat from Ice Age whenever something scary or shocking happens means you're good at acting. Maybe she was going for a Monica Keena-vibe, but Monica Keena acts circles around Hale as a scream queen. Her character is also about as unlikable as it gets. She blows off building homes for the homeless in Mexico to party with her friends.I won't put all the blame at Hale's feet though, because Nolan Gerard Funk is terrible in this film too. Granted, the script doesn't do any favors in making him an outdated and uninventive stereotype of a High School drug dealer (He laughs at a video of a friend commiting suicide on camera), but Funk could at least have brought some entertaingly goofy machismo to this a la Chuck Lane from Snow Day. Unfortunately, he's just as bored as the rest of the cast, so we get a garbage performance AND a garbage character.Sam Lerner is absolutely terrible in this film. For the uninitiated, he originally played Chowder in Monster House and oh how I'm sure he regrets where his career has gone. Calling his sexually harassing, socially tone-deaf bro-creep a caricature would be an insult to the nuances of cartoonists everywhere. His idea of flirting is literally to walk up to girls and immediately ask if they want to have sex. His dialogue is like something out of a 70s Z-grade shark movie.The movie follows a lot of the same story beats as Unfriended, but all it does it just go to show how much better Unfriended handled them. Revelations of romantic and sexual infidelity are leaked, but they hardly have the development or the emotional impact Unfriended had. The movie hardly takes its time trying to build up to the unmasking of the character's deep, dark secrets, and when they're finally revealed, the characters don't seem to take them very seriously at all. Because of this, a potentially thematically interesting film about fears of loneliness, isolation, abandonment and social invalidation instead becomes a brainless kill-fest that lacks the spine to go as gory as it should be. Going back to Unfriended, this was another thing that film handled better. The kills were shocking and memorable; even the more amusing ones were still deeply disturbing and graphic. They stuck with me and the film honestly felt like a straight-up slasher at points. With Truth or Dare, every kill is boring, uninventive and lacks any kind of bite. Think gunshots, PG-13 throat slits, neck breaking with some REALLY bad sound effects, e.t.c.The special effects are embarrassing. I was hoping that stupid snapchat filter that the film used for the evil smiles of the possessed might look better in theaters, but I think it actually looked worse. I have no idea how anyone could look at Baby's First After Effects project and somehow think ""Yes, this looks far scarier than just having my cast give naturally disturbing smiles!""A lot of people have labeled Truth or Dare as ""so bad, it's good"", but I wouldn't call it that at all. It's not something like Gotti or The Darkest Minds where it believes enough in its own crapness to be ""fun bad."" The actors aren't trying, the kills are neutered and boring even in the Unrated Cut and it tries (And fails) way too hard to be unironically funny that it's not even entertaining from an ironic standpoint. It's boring to look at and boring to listen too and boring, boring, boring. Nobody working on this production cared in the slightest and they didn't even attempt to pretend otherwise.Truth or Dare is very lucky this is the same year that gave us The Strangers: Prey at Night and The Trump Prophecy. Otherwise, this would easily be my worst film of the year. The fact that this outgrossed Hereditary, one of the best recent Horror films, is as shocking as it is depressing.",Truth or Dare
98,Sci-FiHorrorFan,I'm Sorry but this movie was Not Bad it was actually Good.,7,6 July 2018,"Yes, I liked the Film even though most people don't, The Film was actually surprisingly Tense and Thrilling And I like the fact that it took the possession concept and did something different with it so it wasn't your typical possession movie that we see a lot.
The movie may start off as a cliche because of the truth or dare games the characters play but the movie later takes a different turn and it becomes a possession movie but done in a unique and interesting way that I've never seen before.
That's part of the reason I liked the film because it uses the game of truth or dare and mixes it with possession among other things which made it more interesting and I think the movie deserves some credit for that.I didn't love the movie but I did Like the movie and it deserves a higher score on IMDB in my opinion.
I'm not saying the movie is Great but it was Good and it was pretty entertaining and intense most of the time.
The characters may not be that good I can admit that but I didn't think they were bad either, I thought The characters were okay and I don't think the acting was bad either like some people have said, I thought The acting was alright, it was pretty much what I expected from this type of movie. Lucy Hale was probably the Best Actress out of the bunch and I liked her character she was definitely the most likable out of the group regardless of her secret.what she did in the past was wrong but it's not like she broke any laws, and the man was more to blame than she was and what he did was Worse. I won't say who he is or what they did because I don't want to spoil it but Lucy's character seemed more innocent than guilty in my opinion. overall she was an okay character and I didn't mind her at all.could there be more character development? yes, there could but the lack of character development did not bother me that much because if they wasted time on character development the movie would be too long and then people would moan about that too, plus we wouldn't get much time with the truth or dare possession plot either.I thought the idea of being forced to play truth or Dare or you die was Pretty interesting and unique. Yes I have seen the other two movies with the same title truth or dare but I was not a fan of them and yes people play truth or Dare in those movies too but it's done a totally different way in this movie, because if they don't go through with the dare they die and if they don't tell the truth they die and if they refuse to play the game they also die because a supernatural force will kill them. So the only way to survive is, to tell the truth, or do the dare, and the characters can never trick the demon because he knows everything so he will know if they are lying or telling the truth, and if they don't do the dare the demon will know too. Call me crazy but that's a pretty cool concept if you ask me, a supernatural force that forces you to play the game and it doesn't matter where you run to or where you hide you can Never Escape the game, that's pretty creepy.This movie is like the Truth or Dare version of It Follows which is pretty cool since I like that movie. This movie also deals with a supernatural force that you can not run or hide from.
I thought Truth or Dare had good writing and good directing and I found the movie surprisingly entertaining.
I liked the use of the creepy sound effects and I also liked how the demon could possess any person that's part of the game and force that person to talk and look creepy, or the demon could make people see strange things. I thought the movies concept was actually pretty good and its a concept I've never seen before done in this way.The movie may not be great but it doesn't deserve to get bashed the way it does either. Overall I Liked the movie okay and I wouldn't mind watching it again one day.",Truth or Dare
99,jburtonprod-802-759029,A Mostly Good Horror Movie That Falls Apart,4,11 August 2018,"I took a chance on this movie and found myself pleasantly surprised. It's an engaging little horror movie with a good premise. It's well crafted and well directed with good performances by a mostly unknown cast. It had me all the way up to the end and then it took a nose dive. I'm guessing the ending as originally written was changed. I'm guessing it was in an attempt to fish for a sequel. I really wish the studios would STOP DOING THIS. If this story had had any kind of satisfying resolution it would've been a very solid movie. Instead what we get is our intrepid heroes going to the origin of their problem. They have a plan to bravely face down their tormentor AND that's where things fall apart. It is such a horrible NON-resolution to the story it makes you feel like you were cheated. The studios have to stop trying to make franchises and go back to making movies that have an ENDING, so you don't feel like you were ripped off for investing your time and emotion. Also, somebody should've have told the film makers that having characters make Jamie Kennedy's 'goofy face' is hardly terrifying. It's just goofy. There's any number of other faces they could've used, the Kubrick Stare, for example would've been much scarier. Other than that ToD was entertaining right down to final 10 minutes and then it takes a total crap. I would've given this movie a very solid 7 but they blew it and this 'expanded universe/sequelitous' obsession must be stopped.",Truth or Dare
100,gerry_barnaby,Poorly executed concept,4,14 April 2018,"The Premise of this film concept of an age of game that everyone at a young age loves, being turned into a deadly game of life and death, you come to wonder if this film could actually be frightening. While the concept is there as someone the acting is not bad in places, it does have a slight atmosphere to the film, it's sadly doesn't have the impact the film needed.Don't get me wrong it's watchable and slightly entertaining in places but there are so many flaws in this film that sadly merits this film to be a poorly made film.which is a shame because the baseline of this film concept is good. This sadly is all I can say about this film being ok but should've been a straight to DVD or Netflix film IMO. Dislikes: There are so many flaws in this film that just destroys its own concept.1. The main concept of a supernatural force control the game of truth or dare, using this face app type image to make peoples faces weird with a stupid grin on their faces was ultimately a mistake, it didn't make the film scary at all. All it did was make it over the top stupid and funny which anyone knows when it comes to horror it shouldn't have comedic moments.This is because these comical moments take you out of the overall feel of the film, making the dark atmosphere of the film disappear completely. There was one moment where the film using the dead body cliche which was the only moment in the film that makes the audience jump, this is how the whole film should've been through the film.If they had used the ghosts of dead people this would have made the concept a lot better and the film would have worked for the theme it was going with, which sadly the concept was good just poorly executed on screen.2. Are the characters them selfs, this was down to bad script writing, especially when someone had died it felt like the characters where selfish and didn't even give a damn about their friends that had died. This made the film so off as it felt like there were no consequences to there action, which made every character in the film look wooden, which is a shame because the casting and concept if done right would have been extremely dark and frighten giving the audience a truly scary film.This film felt just feel cold and flat like it had no passion or heart put into the story, think a face app style to make faces look evil would be a great idea. Sorry but this film for me as a horror fan was just terribly executed and poorly done, this is when these Teen horror films at 15 certs aren't good enough because the certification is restrictive.Horror needs to go back to its 18 certifications so these type of films can have a psychological atmosphere to really frighten the audience instead of cheap jump scares and cheap scares to make a film look frightened.",Truth or Dare

That stupid smile effect that comes on when someone's possessed is stupid and funny and none of the deaths have an impact. The characters are all idiots and the acting is straight up terrible. And also, this film is WAY too similar to Blumhouse's other movie ""Unfriended"" which showcases teenagers being haunted and possessed by a demon and end up killing themselves. ""Unfriended"" is about as horrible as this but at least it had an actual original concept even if it was littered with holes, ""Truth or Dare"" lacks any originality and that somehow makes it worse than ""Unfriended"", a movie so absolutely awful I thought nothing could top it as the worst horror movie ever made. Overall, awful acting, awful and unoriginal plot, bad script, bad characters and it definitely takes the title of the worst horror movie ever made.

110,seige-hound,A silly light hearted horror film held back by its PG-13 rating,5,1 September 2018,"I never really took Truth or Dare as a serious film as I was watching it. It's never outrightly 'funny' in the way most horror comedies try to be by making jokes, but the premise itself, plus how people look when the demon thingy possesses them to ask the main characters 'Truth or Dare' shows its hand as a comedy film in disguise.Truth or Dare is about a group of college kids in their final year of university going on Spring Break in Mexico. While there, they wander into an abandoned convent and accidentally awaken a dormant demon by playing Truth or Dare there. Because of this, the demon continues the game by possessing the people around the main characters, turning them into silly looking photoshop-ish people with uncannily wide smiles. When you say truth, the demon forces you to tell a damaging secret in order to destroy your relationships with your friends and peers. If you chose dare, the demon would force you to do something ridiculously dangerous. If you refuse, lie or otherwise mess up, the demon possesses you and kills you.The biggest issue with this film is that it was severely crippled by being PG-13. PG-13 horror movies can work. One of my favourite horror films The Ring is PG-13, but that film relies less on gore and violence, and rather focuses on a mysterious supernatural tone and mood. There are several moments in Truth or Dare, however, that would have been far more shocking and effective if they were allowed to show blood and gore, and if this film was treated more like a Final Destination film, it would have benefitted the film a lot more. The only reason I could think that they would make it PG-13 is to get kids in seats, due to its more juvenile premise.Besides that and a few character moments that felt a little forced, I thought this film was a really fun and silly horror-comedy that relied on its silly premise and gimmicks to tell an interesting story. It could have been better, but I was happy I paid $3 to rent the film for a night. If there was an uncut version where they added more gore, I'd probably give this film a 6/10 for enjoyment factor, but for now it's a 5/10.",Truth or Dare
111,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Dumb fun with a better ending than it had any right to have,6,25 April 2018,"First things first: Truth or Dare isn't really scary. There are a few chills and jump scares, but overall it's more the type of horror movie where you laugh at how dumb the lead characters are and hang around to see where the chips fall at the end (and i'll touch on the end).Truth or Dare is like a seemingly dumb person that blathers on for 144 inane minutes before shocking you with an interesting final word, salvo that makes an impression. You just have to make it up to that point, that is, be on-board with the goofy premise and look past the mind numbingly dumb set-up. If you can do all that I think you'll have some fun along the way, and maybe even enjoy the ending as much or more as I did. It was pretty damn clever and pretty haunting, in a Twilight Zone type of way. In all honesty, had it not been for the ending I probably would've dropped it a full point in my rating (for all that's worth).Some other points: All of the actors were fine, as was the directing. Nothing really stood out, either good or bad on those fronts. I have to give credit to all the writers involved, one of whom is also the movies director, for coming up with an interesting ending that pulled victory out of the jaws of defeat. This is a movie that could've been a total dumpster fire, but the haunting ending saw me leave the theater feeling I'd gotten my money's worth.",Truth or Dare

113,neener3707,I Expected Bad - And I Got Bad,3,13 April 2018,"One cannot deny the direction mainstream Hollywood ""horror"" films are going in, not a direction of true horror, but one of teen screams and cheap scares. And even though PG-13 Hollywood horror has created some gems like The Conjuring, for the most part they have disappointed this horror veteran. This film was no different, it just plain old wasn't scary, or thrilling, or suspenseful. To be fair I liked some the kills but other than that I could not find anything redeeming. Its another sad attempt by Hollywood at horror, it just isn't scary. Like many other mainstream horror films, I found myself being bored, waiting for the next scare/kill, only to be disappointed by it. But I suppose if you are a 14 year old girl, like the majority of the theater was, then I suppose it might scare you, but for a man who has been a horror nerd since childhood, this just didn't do it at all for me, I was truly disappointed.The acting was just so generic it ruined many aspects of the film. Not only did I not relate with these characters, I didn't care if they died or not, which can be an essential aspect of such a horror film as this. Also in the tense moments of suspense, their acting wasn't convincing enough to make the scene actually suspenseful. And another thing I just cant stand is that stupid CGI face-morphing that goes on. Not just in this movie, but in all movies, where the face screams but its mouth is CGI'ed to make it look bigger. Ugh it just sooooooo takes me out of the scare and honestly makes me laugh in embarrassment for whoever thought it looked good. As a horror veteran, these films make me sad, If you are an easily frightened child, go see it, but if you are a horror veteran like myself, this will only disgust you.",Truth or Dare
114,shannen-l-c,Below average,4,8 July 2018,"Truth or Dare is no different than any other teen horror flick. It's full of bland, undeveloped conventionally pretty young people that are targeted by a sinister game of Truth or Dare. There's no real plot or substance, but it is mildly entertaining in parts. When you see names like Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey, you expect the movie to be well acted, but even the acting was average. I particularly found the ""romance"" between Olivia (Lucy Hale) and Luke (Tyler Posey) dreadfully written and executed. It was used as a plot device to create unnecessary conflict and led to pathetic dares that involved the two being forced to admit their feelings for each other, despite the fact that he was in a relationship with Olivia's best friend who he later admits he is still in love with (what?!).Overall, Truth or Dare is okay if you want to be mildly entertained for a couple of hours and see some mindless violence. However, there's nothing new on offer here, it's just more of the same stuff we've seen in the horror genre. In fact, I'd say this movie is a bad cross between Final Destination and Would You Rather.",Truth or Dare

Although some aspects of it were mediocre (terrible CGI on the ""possessed"" faces and somewhat subpar acting), it wasn't all bad. The idea was unique and interesting and kept me pulled in waiting for what would happen next as far as their truth or dares. Lucy Hale was definitely the star of it and the better one of the characters, but even a few parts of her acting weren't what you'd expect for someone who had just lost several friends to horrific scenarios. I'd say the ending was probably the only decent part of the whole movie and was a twist for sure.All in all, it wasn't a total waste of my time, but not something I'd probably watch again.

Then I had some time to kill so thought I would give it a go and I actually quite enjoyed it. It had some decent parts in it and some cringe worthy parts to. I have seen many horror movies where someone or something does something nasty to some poor victim but in this they do it to themselves so its a good twist.I have to say though that the ending was pretty poor.

Truth or Dare had me intrigued at the beginning but then slowly grew less appealing as the film progressed.It has a final destination type vibe to it, and acted as if all the deaths in the film were portrayed as accidental or deemed as suicides.This film had some kind of vague backstory which at least gives it some grounding but it also personally gave me some 'Bye Bye Man' vibes, a film which had it's moments but also fell dead and failed fo deliver.I'll be honest here and say I didn't expect much at all from this film. But it was watchable. One of the unique death scenes 'involving a pen' made me wince which is always a nice touch.The acting was a bit below average. Lucy Hale (Olivia) felt as if she was just an empty vessel and lacked any emotion in the film. The other teenagers were only slightly better.The film tried to keep you interested with the added modern teenager drama about being unfaithful and manipulative but again you don't care to deeply about any of the characters.I've found with Blumhouse picture movies you could get something surprisingly unique or something that's very cliche, dull and which has been done many times before.Truth or Dare is passable as a horror film, but only just. I don't think it's because of lack of effort. It's just there is nothing new and exciting that comes from these types of films nowadays. It just feels as if you have seen this film and many like it so very often that it doesn't come across fresh or engrossing.5/10.",Truth or Dare

It's difficult to feel afraid at something that's played out like a prank accident which leads to a bigger disaster each turn of the story.The main innovation of the horror was a good idea, it's just not presented in a way where it would be scary.There were no surprises throughout the film.

The characters are annoying. I know some of them are meant to be annoying, but they were literally all annoying. When every single character is like that, it's hard to have sympathy when something awful happens to them. The acting was really bad, except for maybe a few scenes. That creepy smile was only scary the first time I saw it, and that was during the trailer. Seeing it in the movie was just laughable. It looks more goofy than scary. Towards the end of the movie things stopped making sense.

AND to make a script out of TRUTH OR DARE..which has two sides like that of a coin....on one side its a game that can force out stupid and funny truths and goofy and silly dares...but on the other side it has the power to flush out the worst from you,embarrass you,humiliate you and in this movies case..... lead you to deathsIMO this was such a good opportunity for BLUMHOUSE to create a scary and really entertaining and thrilling body horror movie or a horror drama that could've shown to us how dark truth or dare could get but how come JASON BLUM didn't relaise that it's a sinking shipIt could've been as well at least been tagged as HORROR COMEDY and it would've been judged betterBut sticking the HORROR THRILLER tag instead...they made it something that was easily mockableOkay the movie started off with some intensity and had my interest in it at first..but after the thrills were added (which to my surprise....did deliver strictly personal opinion) i had started my eyes rolling gameThe screenplay is the real culprit here and it's written by MICHAEL REISZ...and this was the first time he stepped into the shoes of a screenplay writerThere are so many clever ways to tackle the game but the characters have been written off dumb asfThe chemistry between the lead and her best friend is laughable....not coz of the actors but coz of the writingI can discuss in detail about that in the comment section..coz I don't wanna spoil it...coz there is no point in spoiling a movie even if it's outrightly bad or a masterpieceBut I'll just tell you coz i can't help myself and can't hold it backWHY THE HELL WOULD YOU SCREAM OUT A TRUTH THAT WILL DESTROY RELATIONSHIP IN FRONT OF A WHOLE LOTTA PEOPLE.....can't you just say it in a normal voice or whisper it...HUH HUH??IT THEN EXTENDS TO DARES LIKE SLEEP WITH YOUR FRIEND
COME OUT TO YOUR PARENTSActually those could've fleshed out some good dramatic moments but the former is rushed and the latter completely skips that momentOh then there is the DEMON CALUX who pulls all the strings...a total CLOWN who possesses people to force the victims to play TRUTH or DARE by making a face that looks like one of the funny expression that JIM CARREY would make and then the demon speaks through these possessed humans in an ai tone...CALUX DUDE YOU ARE A DEMON WHO IS AGES OLD...why would you speak in a tone like that.... YOU ARE A SHAME TO THE HELL WORLDThe scores were decent and did highlight the tense and thrilling moments nicely enough IMO
The actors did their part not so badlyUgh but I hated how the lead character who is shown to us in the begining as a good and caring person...who cares for others...and then who judged a dude for being selfish and then ends up being not all that
and inflicts a 100x times damage to the whole world(slow hand clap.gif)I AM OUTTA HERE( I know I know I was a little harsh on this movie and that not every movie is supposed to be logically correct....but I just felt like RANTING so I went ahead and did that)PS the movie is bad but thrilling and watchable IMO so don't skip it reading my thoughts...I ranted out what I thought about it

*The movie doesn't use a lot of jump scares, which is nice considering the awful trend of horror and especially Blumhouse relying on oh so many door slams and cats jumping out of cupboards. There are a few, but not many. 
*The characters quickly tell the others what is ""going on"". An annoying cliche is that when supernatural activities start happening, characters refuse to share information. In this, they start working together pretty quickly. 
*No ghost jumping into the camera at the end. Sorry Bagul. Negatives:
*""We cannot split up"" then splitting up multiple times cliche.
*The voice came off more as silly than scary...Which then made the face look scary. Or as the main characters put it ""A bad snap chat filter.""
*A majority of the characters are made unlikable, or stupid. There is a reason why good horror films have like able or smart characters.Neutrals:

It was all happening because a demon, previously summoned by a young nun because of a pervert priest, and subsequently successfully exorcised and confined in a clay pot, had been released by a foolish young man named Sam during a night of drunken debauchery. The whole premise of friends turning on friends because of Calux the trickster demon truth or daring them, and daring them to tell the truth was absolutely brilliant. The plot flowed smoothly, the sinister ways in which all had to die was mind-blowing and there was no over-blown sentimentality between all the best friends, knowing they were all at risk of an uncertain demise. What made this movie even better was the killer of an ending, I did not see nor imagine this one coming, all kept within this age of social media.

Refuse to play or lie? You die.Now this was a fairly entertaining movie. This formula has been done a thousand times. There were parts that had be interested, and in the next moment rolling my eyes.

The group slowly gets picked off while our main characters try to solve this puzzle.One of the things that I really enjoyed about this movie was the depth of character. There wasnt a load of backstories, but there was enough to flesh these kids out so they were more than butcher meat. You find out pretty fast that Markeys dad committed suicide but the cause of that isnt revealed till much later and it is done in a way that piques the watchers interest. If I had to pic my main negative, it would be the droopy faced snapchat filter that appears over the faces of the people the demon temporarily possesses. I felt this was kind of lazy.

167,TyJustice,Diet Final Destination,3,30 April 2018,"Truth or Dare (2018) is a horror film from Blumhouse that chronicles the ""scary"" reality of a Truth or Dare game coming to life.Lucy Hale, Tyler Posey, and Violett Bean star as the leads in this film, and while Lucy Hale or Violett Bean's performances are nothing to write home about Tyler Posey is probably the worst actor in the bunch, if not the entire movie. The characters they portray are boring, lifeless and just silly iterations of stock horror movie characters like the ""Jock"", ""Goodie Two Shoes"", ""Promiscuous Best Friend"" just to name a few. There's absolutely nothing memorable about any of them and it's legitimately difficult writing about any of them despite only seeing this film last night.The nuance of the film comes from the dumb deformed grins that shows up on characters faces when they're participating in the game, and while I found it somewhat creepy at first it got rather old fast and there was parts in the movie where it came off as just laughable rather than creepy. The writing gets remarkably lazy as they weave through the plot and realize that they need to start kind of making up rules as they go in order to cover up the island sized plothole that realistically they could just answer Truth to everything and the movie would be a whole lot less interesting. At the end of the day this is just a Diet Final Destination, where the major draw to this is not the characters but the prospect of seeing them die in absurd ways but the movie couldn't even do that right.The only props I'll give this movie is there is some parts where the film acknowledges just how ridiculous it is and there's a handful of tongue-in-cheek jokes that gave me a few laughs. That's not nearly enough to say that this movie is worth checking out though.Maybe check it out if you see it on TV or something, but this movie isn't worth spending money on.",Truth or Dare

I liked the movie, it was gimmicky and it had some bad moments but it's not deserving a 3 rating, putting it close to the list of worst rated movies ever. It's not the brightest idea, it was used here and there but i think this is one of the better ones, as the motive is supernatural and the protagonists have to fight something inhumane. All around the characters are kind of bland and it's hard to get around their story, but you can get over those during a rainy day.

173,taylorhammons,Surprisingly not that bad!,6,14 August 2018,"Ok, it's a horror movie, so nobody's expecting genius here, but I'm not sure why everyone is so down on this movie. It's actually a pretty unique premise (at least I'd never seen anything like it) and it keeps you wondering until the end. The final scene is as suspenseful as it is surprising and there were several events I did not see coming. The ending left me in chills too. I'm not one for slasher movies or crazy jump scares. They really just don't scare me. I also find that movies like that tend to be practically devoid of plot, just a bunch of idiotic teenagers making terrible decisions and being hacked to bits. This one didn't rely on jump scares or gore to scare you, but rather built up and then held out the sense of desperation that these people feel, just trying to stay alive. The truths that the game made them reveal were stupid and often even predictable but the game itself and what it would force them to do surprised me several times and escalated in an appropriate fashion.

Stop expecting every movie to deserve a standing ovation or it isn't worth your time/money. There still is some entertainment here. 
The way they are asked ""truth or dare"" was well done and creepy as heck. I did jump twice which is more than I expected. I honestly was expecting an eye-rolling explanation for why they had to keep playing - been there/done that plot twist...but I was surprised - it was clever. 
The acting overall was ok. There was one part that really stuck out to me as poorly executed - where a friend is dead in a characters lap and they were oddly nonchalant about it. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about",Truth or Dare

179,wescarpenter-48666,Truth or Dare Film Review By Logan Coleman,4,20 April 2018,Truth or Dare is the latest film starring Lucy Hale. This is the latest film directed by Jeff Wadlow best known for Cry Wolf and Kick-Ass 2. I would describe this film as urban legends meets Final Destination film series. There are two huge flaws that causes the film to falter on all cylinders. First was the writing being horrendous. Second flaw was all the characters were breaking the rules that were set for the horror film. The one negative aspect of the film that I was not expecting it was shot in a lot of dark and murky scenes that made it hard to see what happen. The characters in the film are not likeable at all. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 4 stars out of 10.,Truth or Dare

Lucy Hale plays Olivia, the beautiful, morally conscious college student. Her group of friends cancels her Habitat for Humanity spring break to force her to join them in Mexico. What could go wrong? You guessed it, they are led away from a bar to an abandoned mission building by a new friend, ""Carter"" and he offers up the idea to play a game of truth or dare for fun. After the game takes an emotional turn, ""Carter"" flees and admits to Olivia that the game is real and to follow the rules or you will die. Let the fun begin! Once back in the states, Olivia is the first to start seeing things. ""Truth or Dare"" appears to be written everywhere (or is it?). She heads to the library to find her friends and is surrounded by students with wicked smiles when she finally cracks. She exclaims ""truth"" and must reveal a secret. Unfortunately, she just yells the secret out loud and her friends are within earshot. However, the next victim of the game is not so lucky and selects ""dare"". When his dare is not completed, he is forced to fall off of a pool table, killing himself. Aha! The game is real, and you must follow the rules. Olivia and friends continue to take turns and unfortunately start dropping like flies. They must figure out how to end the game and stay alive. The solution is on the tip of their tongues! Did they stop the curse? Watch the movie or maybe you will think twice the next time you play the popular party game Truth or Dare!Worst Dare: This one is hard, we're glad our dares only ended in pulling off someone's sock with our teeth, can't say the same for this version!Worst Love Triangle - I like you but I don't love you, ouch that hurts. Don't worry Olivia, we're team Ezria anyway.Best smile - or should we say creepiest - Calax the demon; stealing the faces of millions of unknowing souls.Overall Grade: A-",Truth or Dare

If you're expecting a good horror movie, nope, more like: ""a guide on how to find people on facebook"". If you're expecting good acting: sometimes it's okay but mainly nope. A mashup of the nowadays teen-drama shows on TV is a big part of the cast. If you're expecting interesting sets or good scares? Nope again it's really bad. For example at the ending there was a shot of two guys in london done so badly even the green screen itself would facepalm. And the only time i jumpscared was because the sound was so hard out of nowhere that i thought the room would explode.

Where you can clearly see it's not a good film but if you can laugh at it a bit, you'd be able to find some kind of enjoyment out of it. This little movie doesn't do that. Sure you find amusement in it but it doesn't warrant the overall viewing experience.I'm surprised films like this still get made quite honestly. The acting was atrocious and the film's premise which was silly to begin with is painfully executed. The faces they make are absolutely ridiculous. Literally something that can be done with your phone and some sort of filter. You're supposed to find that scary when you yourself can produce the same effect in a matter of minutes, absurd.",Truth or Dare
194,SmashandNasty,You'll never get the time you spent watching this movie back.,3,12 April 2018,"There is no way to really articulate the exact place where this movie went wrong, other than to say that it did.It lacks the redeeming qualities of some of Blumhouse's other outings: it isn't as charming as Happy Death Day was; it's not a socially aware as Get Out or the Purge franchise; it doesn't have unique techniques the original Paranormal Activity or Unfriended did. While most of those movies have things that are wrong with them (as most movies do), they also had something that made them worth watching. After struggling to find its footing, Truth or Dare had little to nothing redeeming about it. What you're left with is a largely unsatisfying narrative with skewed (and uncharacteristic) character motivations culminating in a fairly predictable climax and then quickly falling from there to a conclusion that - while somewhat elver in its execution - made the film that much more frustrating.In short: It feels a lot like any other teen slasher flick. They just put a different spin on things and then marketed the hell out of it.If you're looking for something more than shallow and undeveloped characters finding an interesting way to get themselves into trouble that they can't manage to ever get out of played by B-list stars who couldn't find anything else to do after the end of their TV careers, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you're looking for strained diversity in a cast with zero emotional depth or chemistry, headed by two skinny white women - this is the movie for you. If you want petty relationship drama, alcohol abuse, bullying, scenes on a ""college campus"", the occasional promise of gore/blood/or anything that might actually be considered scary (followed by the subsequent disappointment in camera angels destined to keep the film PG-13), and jump scares - this movie is for you.It really isn't for everyone, and while we can respect that there's an audience out there somewhere that might appreciate it for what it is, we know it could've been a lot better and feel justifiably disappointed that they didn't seem to try.Featuring: Some weird facial contortions that undercut the film even further, if that was even possible.",Truth or Dare

Interesting plot with interesting build up of character that's showing the douchiness of the friends and a cheater and friends who are dumb enough to cover for that mess.Why I thought this film was crap was when that blonde chick was revealed to have slept with multiple guys. Okay, fair enough she's a slut but the fact that the main character was covering for that and that blonde friend got mad for revealing the truth. The build up of character is all a mess and where their priority lies is just all over the place. The fact that the blonde chick gets mad when she was the one doing all the cheating and the boyfriend Lucas not even getting 1 single bit mad at this fact.

The truth or dare that lies between the blonde, the boyfriend and the main character is just stupid.

224,Eric1485,Truth or Dare....,4,31 October 2018,"Truth Or Dare has a compelling concept, but it quickly turns into the same cliché-filled teen horror film that we have all seen before. One of the main problems with this movie is the characters, they bring no real substance to the film and it is difficult to be invested in their actions or whether they actually survive or not. The narrative also has a bad habit of jumping all over the place, new conflicts keep arising between the characters as they navigate the film and the pacing does not flow smoothly. There are a few decent scares and tense moments sprinkled throughout the film, but it never quite grips you like a good horror film should.",Truth or Dare

This movie is not that bad actually unless you choose to focus on their flaws and not enjoying the movie then you'll probably find this movie is terrible. It's basically some kind of fun teenage type of horror movie where a bunch of teenagers went somewhere where they are not supposed to go but chose to go anyway well because it's Spring Break Everyone!!!

Even though it is similar to Stay Alive's premise, it turns out that the plot is great. But, there's one fatal problem. The plot delivery is pretty awful.When I know that the movie is R rated, I was expected the gore will be similar to Final Destination or (maybe) Saw. Unfortunately, it isn't. It is R rated because of its sexual scenes. I mean, come on. I understand that the movie has teenagers theme but you don't have to include the romantic things into the plot. It's freaking cringy. Especially when you watch it alone *insert sad emoji*There are so many scene that almost made me burst out laughing. The special effect and the death,. The effect is like a Snapchat filter and it's cringy af. The death isn't memorable. I didn't even turn my face from the screen because the death is lame.

I am not sure why the demon didn't just kill them all of anyway if he had that much power to begin with. He could have done that from very early on in the movie. There were some other small logic problems nothing to crazy though. The ending offered nothing new we have seen it from other movies. Here is a layout of the movie. A women is sceen diving in mexico stops at a gas station trys to buy a pack of smokes the clerk ask Truth or Dare seemling possesed she picks dare and has to burn down the mexico gas station.Movie opens up on Olivia who is leader on habitat for humainty which is where the movie starts in front of her labtop for her next mission her best friend cancled her planned trip to build houses so she could blow it of against her will to go on spring break with her instead she agrees cause now she has no plans. A crap ton of B-roll footage shot from a bunch of crappy phones plays offering back story nothing to important. Olivia Barron, her best friend Markie Cameron, Markie's boyfriend Lucas Moreno, along with Penelope Amari and her boyfriend Tyson Curran, and Brad Chang go on a trip to Rosarito, Mexico. In Mexico, Olivia runs into fellow student Ronnie who proceeds to harass her until a man intervenes on her behalf. The man introduces himself as Carter and eventually convinces her and her friends to join him for drinks at the ruins of a mission at an old aboneded church. There, Carter initiates a game of ""truth or dare?"" with Olivia and her friends, plus Ronnie, who followed the group. Eventually, the game ends when Carter reveals that he deceived Olivia as a means of tricking her and her friends to the mission to offer them in his place in the supernatural game of Truth or Dare. As Carter leaves, he explains to Olivia that the game will follow them and they must not refuse it at this point you know it's demonic the demon could just kill them all movie over.At a local college bar, sometime after everyone returned from Mexico, Ronnie dies when he fails to complete a dare. Olivia, having become convinced that Carter was telling the truth, gathers and attempts to convince her friends that the game is real. The game, playing in accordance to the order the group played in Mexico, turns to Markie, having already appeared to Olivia and Lucas, and she is forced to break Olivia's hand. At the hospital, Brad is then forced by the game into revealing to his father, Officer Han Chang, his homosexuality which his father disapproves strongly.The next day, the skeptical Tyson lies when forced to tell a truth and, as a result, dies stabbing himself in the eye with a pen. A drunken Penelope is next forced by the game to drink and finish a full bottle of vodka whilst walking along the edge of the roof of a house. She eventually falls from the roof after finishing the bottle, but is saved by Brad, Markie, and Olivia. The group manage to come into contact with a woman named Giselle the women who burned down the gas station in mexico, who is also a participant in a separate incarnation of the game, and the group go to meet her.Giselle reveals that she and her friends played the game and her friend Sam, the only other survivor of her incarnation of the game, was responsible for the game becoming reality in the first place, having wrecked the ruins of the mission. Giselle reveals that a truth can only be chosen twice before the next player is forced to choose dare. Giselle draws a handgun on Olivia and shoots, confessing that she was dared to kill her. However, Penelope jumps in front of Olivia and is shot and killed. Failing to kill Olivia, Giselle possesed shoots herself in the head.Later, following Olivia, Lucas, and Markie's turns in the game, Brad is dared to withdraw his father's gun and make him beg for his life. However, in the act, Brad is shot and killed by an approaching officer. At the precinct, Olivia learns that Carter is Sam.Olivia and Lucas drive to Tijuana and meet with a mute woman and former nun who operated out of the church in which they originally played the game. The woman informs them that they are dealing with a demon she first summoned, who possessed the game of Truth or Dare and can only be stopped if the last person who evoked it sacrifices their tongue into an urn and seals it with wax after an incantation is made in the church.Olivia, Markie, and Lucas find Sam and force him at gunpoint back to the ruins of the church in Mexico. There, Sam begins the ritual and is about to sever his tongue when it becomes Lucas' turn to play the game. Lucas is dared to kill either Olivia or Markie, which he refuses. Possessed by the demon controlling the game, Lucas is forced to kill Sam, before the latter can complete the ritual to end the game. He then proceeds to slit his throat and die.Olivia forces the demon to reveal to her whether or not there was a definitive way to end the game with Markie and herself alive. The demon reveals that now that Sam is dead, there is not - but they can draw more people into the game and prolong their turn in it. Olivia hastily records and uploads a video to YouTube, warning of the game and its rules, before challenging the viewer of the video to Truth or Dare, initiating them now they all have to pick truth or dare.",Truth or Dare

253,darksketcher,The Truth and Dare of Truth or Dare,6,25 March 2020,"So this movie came on and when I immediately saw the Blumhouse Production was involved I immediately tuned in. Blumhouse Productions have been known for several good movies; Sinister, Get Out, and etc.Great start to the movie as it focuses on friends gathering together over spring breaking Mexico City. Everyone is having a good time and on the last day they encounter a stranger who leads them to a burned down church where he suggests they play Truth or Dare. Things get a little awkward as some intimate secrets get leaked out between them. That's when the stranger announces to everyone that he lured them in a trap and they had to continue to play the game Truth or Dare. If you don't tell the truth, you die. You don't do the Dare, you die. You don't play the game, you die. Interesting concept as friendships are torn a part by Truth, mistrust, dares and death. But the movie starts losing the audience by introducing the concept that the game is demon possessed, although an interesting concept, takes away the scare factor as the demon possession takes place after a nun, knowing a ritual of how to summon a demon, summons it because she and her friends were being molested by the priest. Fast forward, the last survivors of the friend group found out the only way to stop the demon is to say seven times in Spanish some chant and cut out the tongue who freed the demon in the first place. News Flash the demon possess the boyfriend, kills the only chance of dealing it and the boyfriend. The girls believe they have a way to stop the demon by tricking it to play the game. At this point you think the demon is going to say ""dare"" and the girl is going to Dare the demon to kill itself but instead the demon said ""truth"" and she says tell me how we can end this in which it replied ""you can't""How it ends? They record a video and post a YouTube video of them explaining the demon possessed Truth or Dare game warning the viewers all around the world to be cautious in which she says ""I just got one question for you, Truth or Dare?""Overall this movie was ok. It had potential to be great but making this movie based on a demon possessed game took away the scare factor. This movie would of been great if they would of kept the mystery of how was everyone dying and just kept it like the mysterious entity or cursed game.

259,AlihasanAgha,Pretty Okay Actually,5,14 July 2020,"A bare surface value Truth Or Dare was an entertaining horror flick with a decent cast and an interesting concept. A game of truth or dare which takes a dark turn and has bodies dropping right left and center. Forcing players to tell the truth or complete the dares.
The plot itself was unfortunately mediocre for the majority of the movie, revolving mostly around teenage drama which also was entertaining in parts but seemed to just endlessly drag on and felt forced at points, as if characters were looking for more drama. The supernatural plot which was introduced later into the movie was actually pretty interesting and gripping and kept me invested for the rest of the near two hour runtime. The ending was anti-climatic though sadly, could have been far better but was still enough to warrant a second movie which honestly, i would watch.
One cool factor was the movie did hold a eerie atmosphere throughout the movie, with a very psychologically tormented tone, showing characters to be absolutely helpless and struggling to survive.
The cast is pretty decent, most characters are very one dimensional, feeling as if they are forcefully trying to be more, yet still felt predictable and stereotypes. Few characters stood out, Ronnie despite being the typical comic relief was still a very entertaining character with some fun dialogue. Characters who were related to the more supernatural side of the film turned out to be more in depth and multi-dimensional.
I felt as if Direction was a field where the movie took some blows. I personally believe that the PG-13 rating was very unnecessary and the movie felt inhibited. With very good death scenes which could only have been better with atleast a rating of TV-MA. i may be incorrect but it came across as restrained for Netflix only. There were also multiple 'goofs' throughout. Scenes where the boom mic can be seen, factually incorrect scenes like small amounts of lighter fluid causing people to completely burst into flames. The cinematography was unremarkable too.
Production on the other hand was pretty well done, hallucinations are not simple or cheap to create and with a budget of 3.5 million USD. It feels well produced to the extent where the audience does not feel as if special effects or props or sets were cheaply made. The special effects actually were good too, immensely adding to the eerie atmosphere, the best perhaps was simply the unnervingly stretched smiles which were used throughout the movie
Despite a slow build up and scenes which did drag on, Truth Or Dare proved to have a few good moments and a well made atmosphere, a decent attempt. Allowing the audience just enough to want to come back for a sequel.",Truth or Dare

At least nearly all. This is let down by downright terrible storytelling.So the premise is a demon has taken over the game of Truth or Dare and when people are asked, they have to do what they choose. If they don't, they die. This is all going well until quite late in the film the whole premise of the game is downright ruined by the demon actually ignoring the rules of the game, taking control of a body and then stabbing who it admits is the only person that could have stopped the game.So the whole premise of the film is thrown in the toilet there and then. The point behind the whole film, ruined. Why did it need to play the truth or game? It didn't, the demon could have simply done what it wanted all along. A bad ending can't ruin a film completely, the positives are still there, but it leaves the worst taste and knocks the film down dramatically.",Truth or Dare

268,vacantskies00,Final Destination meets Ouija,5,18 July 2018,"A group of teens find a supernatural entity that is using a game to kill them off one by one; unless you play by the rules. Director Jeff Wadlow is no stranger to the genre. The underrated meta-slasher Cry Wolf was a simple, yet intelligent take on PG-13 horror/thrillers. With Truth Or Dare, and Blumhouse in tow, he attempts to capture similar teenage themes of trust, denial, and the fact that your closet friend could be a liar. What works for this film is its ever evolving sense of menace. The entity really bares down on each characters flaws. Each ""kill"" has relevant motivation and pushes the rating to the max. The facial effects are decent and creepy. What works against the film are the characters. Most of them are disposable. Merely there to add death scenes and nothing more. Additionally, several scenes which could've added more to certain character arcs simply cut away to move the story along, but leave possible dramatic elements to rot to get to the ""horror."" The most notable negative is the cast. While not god awful, they did well considering, it was hard accommodating a bulk of the cast. Half of which were total dicks, the remaining cast holds so many secrets from each other that we wonder how they managed to be friends so long. Oh, long enough to fill an hour and a half. If you love mostly forgettable characters, twists on familiar games, and twisted rule based supernatural thrillers like Ouija and/or Final Destination; Truth Or Dare is for you. Give it a spin. I dare you...",Truth or Dare
269,kevinlemenager,All Smiles,2,3 June 2018,"Blumhouse's Truth or Dare, or simply Truth or Dare, is all about the game... well truth or dare. I first found out about this movie when I clicked on the trailer. Which makes a horror movie out of a silly party game. What's next Blumhouse's Hide and Seek or Blumhouse's Spin the Bottle. Well regardless of how dumb I thought the concept was, I was still interested in seeing it. It's safe to say Blumhouse is pretty much the king of horror movies at the moment and since I loved Happy Death Day (also released on Friday the 3th) I figured I'd give it a shot. Truth or Dare follows a group of vacationing teenagers who end up playing a game of truth or dare at an abandoned church. The game is cursed, it follows you wherever you go, and you have to choose truth or dare, or you die. What makes Truth or Dare especially creepy are the smiles. The people who ask you truth or dare all have stretched out smiles that look something like a Snapchat filter. Which is different then most horror movies that use creepy eyes. I've actually never played truth or dare in my entire life. Mostly because I don't think I can handle revealing something about myself or doing something I'll regret. The movie is sort of like the game in how it's a good way to kill time. It's also kind of a rip off of my favorite horror movie It Follows. Both of which deal with a supernatural curse that follows you wherever you go. I liked Truth or Dare fine enough, but I knew to expect a stupid movie from a premise like this. Now I have to ask you something... truth or dare?",Truth or Dare

271,Signe2005,I would buy this on DVD,5,17 August 2020,"I first watched this movie on Netflix, as just a random horror movie to watch in the evening on a Sunday afternoon. Although, I didn't expect it to be rather good.
The acting was good, the effects were good, even the general story line was quite good.
Although, I feel as if there could've been more story to the characters in general, the dares could've been a lot more extreme for the main characters - I mean, they're being haunted by a demon that likes to ruin and kill people's lives, they could've done something more with the demonic possession and the demon itself.
I'm a bit 50/50 with the ending. At the same time I think it was a huge plot twist but a also an extremely frustrating one. At the end of the story, Olivia's and Markie's intention was to STOP the demon's wrath and contain the curse, instead Olivia broadcasts it to the internet and curses a massive population of innocent people just to save her's and Markie's ass. That was the thing that rather frustrated me. It could've been a better ending.Overall, it's a worth-while movie to watch, and I do recommend it to anyone that just wants a small scare. However, the detail on the actual demonic game itself deserved more screen time and praise. Long story short, I would probably buy this on DVD and I'm never playing truth or dare ever again with my friends.",Truth or Dare
272,martitah_1,I dare you NOT to stop laughing,2,22 April 2018,"When I walked into the cinema, I was already certain that it was going to be bad based on the ratings here on IMDB. What I wasn't expecting was it to be so bad that it was more of a comedy than an actual horror movie. The whole room was laughing at the ""death scenes"" and strange facial distortions on the characters...
When you see what looks like a Snapchat filter on the characters' faces, you start wondering if the budget was so low that they didn't have better ""special effects"" to make it more realistic and not so ridiculous.The plot is bad, the acting is bad, predictable jumpscares... You can pretty much tell the exact moment when you are supposed to get scared (only you don't).All in all, avoid this movie at all costs. Unless, of course, you are like me and you are too bored and there's nothing else at the theater that you haven't watched yet. The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because I actually had a bit of fun while laughing at how bad it was.When you think that the ""pool vacuum cleaners throwing up after getting wasted"" scene on Scary Movie 5 is bad enough to make you want to pluck your eyes out, there's always this one. The only thing that could actually make it worse would be also having Lindsay Lohan or Charlie Sheen in the cast.",Truth or Dare

274,blindmcblind,"Fun and entertaining, like Happy Death Day",7,2 November 2018,"I saw the negative reviews on here and on Reddit, and I'm astounded.I almost exclusively watch horror, it's my favorite genre, and I'm depressed that I've exhausted almost every horror film and series. I tend to prefer supernatural horror, dark atmospheric stuff/dark fantasy, and I'm not really into slashers or zombie flicks (with some exceptions like 'Happy Death Day').This movie was supremely entertaining to me, it was exactly what I needed, and by the end I was sad that there wasn't more of it. I actually spent a good couple of hours trying to find something similar, and couldn't find anything as fun. I settled for 'Unfriended', which ended up being another decent, unique horror movie with a fun vibe.If you're looking at this from a ""film school perspective"", then it isn't anything spectacular about it. Although, I'd say some of the acting was way better than I expected. They at least tried with the story (they gave it some back story), and I didn't see any need to develop the characters in a movie of this type.It isn't going to make you jump out of your seat, or have you sleeping with the lights on for the next week. What I liked about it was that it was dark, twisted, fun, and supernatural. I didn't think the ""troll faces"" were meant to be taken particularly seriously, after all, the supernatural entity causing the visions is supposed to be a trickster - so it's perfectly fitting, and it was exactly as creepy-but-not-serious as I expected it to be.There are a few plot-holes, primarily that the story could have ended in a multitude of more satisfying, or more sensible ways. They really missed an opportunity for a memorable ending here.But yeah, it's basically just a non-scary, fun, popcorn-flick horror movie like Happy Death Day. I'd say these two movies deserve to be watched back to back, as part of a marathon with your friends. Maybe you have a few drinks, whatever else, it's going to be a fun time. Obviously I love the serious, lasting, eerie horror movies as well - but right now I'm wishing I could find more movies like 'Truth or Dare'. Stuff that's just fun, engaging, quick, dark, and creepy - but not aiming for an Oscar like Oculus or Hereditary (you know what I mean).",Truth or Dare

I really ended up getting into this movie. It's so different, very unique, filled with creative ideas, and entertaining throughout. The movie held my attention and it flew by. But the ending is where this movie will be remembered the most. It is without a doubt one of the most CLEVER ENDING's I've ever seen. The ending alone is worth going to see this movie. I have a strong feeling that too many people went into this movie with a negative bias, thus the reason for all of the negative reviews. It is also clear that most people clearly missed the entire premise of the ending, otherwise there would be more people on here raving about the brilliant ending to this movie.

I am a big fan of horror films and have felt that too many times the same old formula has been repeated. This is fresh and new!

298,marcosgdmo,I should have picked Truth....,3,26 April 2018,"I wouldn't call this movie ""so bad it's good"", but there where some momments when the incompetence made me enjoy the movie more than what I should have.But I want to talk first of the, if you can call them as that, strong points of the film.
While the material they had didn't help them, there are some decent performance from some of the actor, mainly the two female leads, who showed talent and effort trying to convey emotion, even if the script was celarly an obstacle.
So, Lucy Hale, Violett Beane and maybe Hayden Szeto, are actor from who I expect to see more in the future.Now, there is an apparent complete lack of ability from the director, it might be a consequence of studio intervention, but knowing Blumhouse... I have my doubts. He does nothing for the film.
You can point out a lot of time when the way the movie was filmed kept it from leaving a greater impact. Just see the first scene, where the lighting is distracting. This will repeat during the whole film in one way or another.But the script and story are the protagonist of this film, and not for good reasons. Many where quick to judge the film for its premis, but it could have worked, if executed better. There is a major problem in the way the story is constructed, how characters are presented and how the choices they make affect the story.
Characters are presented as a group of friend and then start acting mean to each other for no reason, while the game that is accidently hilarious because of the stupid face the ""demon"" makes. And then the way in which the Dares the players have to complete are shown in so dull and inadequate ways. These scenes are so flat that it just becomes boring. Maybe, if the movie had the guts, they could have been executed in more gruesome ways, trying to at least appeal through Shock-Value. But the absence of visual reference to create an idea of what the characters are facing, but no, we are left with a quick cut to the characters reacting to what they are seeing, with actor who try to give their best, but are directed in so poorly that they don't get the chance to shine.",Truth or Dare

Movies that end with no resolution are so unsatisfying and frustrating.And there were many ways they could have stopped the game from continuing.For example the last two people to play, before they asked the demon, chose dare. They could've easily chosen truth and then the demon would've had to pick dare because the rules were changed. I know they didn't think of it until the last minute but they could've tried harder to come up with a plan.Or the writers could've have written it so the ending took less time, because it wasted 10 minutes of my life.

I mean people are kind of harsh, or at least it seems to me that way. Don't get me wrong, as a huge horror movies' fan I can list all the things that could've been different in this, in order for it to be scary/ -ier or anything else. I don't think that's the point though... Sure I would like to see less predictable jump scares, less cliches about the characters or the relationships between them, more suspense on the events happening and better dialog in order for the viewer to get a better sense of the game and the situation going on... Sure I would like all those things in every movie I watch... Except no, not every movie I watch. There are some movies I choose to see exactly for the same reasons I chose to see this one. It lacks many of the elements that make a good scary horror film, thus it lacks the complexity and the weight that they usually leave you with. I don't really think the point of watching this movie is getting scared. Why watch it then? Pass the time with something that makes you leave all logic behind and kind of enjoy it. I don't think I would actually recommend this to someone, but I also wouldn't say it was a complete loss of my time. I mean what do you expect? The plot is about a group of young people getting unlucky and trying to escape the situation. Sound familiar?",Truth or Dare

After watching many horror films from popular to barely known, there was a period where I got tired because every film just seemed the same. Every once an a while I would hit a jackpot horror film like this one and fall in love with the genre again. A little comedy added to it changed its category a little bit, which was forgive-full. The only negative side about this was the main character (Olivia) had a very easy game of Truth or Dare. The demon hooked her up with someone she loved but was too scared to confess. The demon also convinced her to expose the suicidal father that was about to rape his daughters best friend. The demon was very nice to her, lol.Demon: ""Truth or Dare?""

While the general plot was intriguing, the acting, ""demon faces"", humor, and pace ruined the movie. For one, the movie moved way too fast. The director was clearly trying to ram ideas into a a specific amount of time. The actors featured teenage favorites who did a decent job, but the lesser known actors didnt do so well. The movie is also very melodramatic, and there are times when characters die and the rest seem unphased.

A ghost with a robot voice, it's a joke .. that the ghost goes in and kills the lyre player who can end the game, its in itself another joke. Had the ghost been able to kill, it would obviously have killed everyone without wasting time on a bad game when the ghost is still out to kill everyone (according to the rules of the game).That the hero in the film spreads the game around the world when she still wanted to save everyone is the 3rd and biggest joke when half the film was about her trying to save the world and that she is the only one who is caring and cares about everyone.

Whenever one of the friends die, everyone just seems to look past it like nothing happened, there is no real emotion what so ever, which makes the movie even more unrealistic than it already is, also the premise is silly and cliché. A group of teens play a game of truth or dare and doesn't realise that a demon has possessed their game and now tries to kill them one by one if they don't play by the rules.

The problem with this is that there is no way for someone to ask him truth or dare or anybody to make a dare or a truth for him to do/tell and furthermore there is nobody to make sure he does the dare or says the truth and if not to kill him. Technically he could kill himself and ask himself truth or dare but that would be dumb asf and wouldn't really work. Which just brings up 1000 more questions like how does a demon die or kill himself e.t.cAnyways... I was thinking and couldn't come up with a solution to this plot hole my girlfriend suggested that since he is the maker of the game he doesn't have to follow rules and can just cast himself out e.t.c which is dumb I need the solution to be based on the actual movie we are not told that since he is the maker he doesn't have to follow rules he obviously did in the movie so based on the movie to me there is no obvious way to fill this plot hole.",Truth or Dare

No total destruction of cities during some big fight which is totally unbelievable. You cause millions of dollars of damage to the city and nobody has trouble believing that. Really. It has a plot that is believable for this type movie. I personally thought it was as good or perhaps better than Get Out. Doing a brain transplant in the basement of your parents home by yourself?

The worst thing about the movie was that there was no chemistry in that group of friends. Why do they even hung out when they despise each other so much? So when one of them dies, kind of no one cares. ""Oh, she died! poor girl, well, who's next?

392,Fifth_H0r5eman,"A fun concept, an interesting ending, if slightly frustrating",7,2 April 2021,"So it's been a while since I saw this film, but recently caught the latter half again.While not particularly scary, containing nothing more than the unsettlingly stretched facial features, it's a fun dark-thriller at best.The frustration however comes in when the writers attempt to create a twist ending using a game with very strictly defined rules:You tell the truth or you die
You do the dare or you die
Refuse to play and you die.With an extra rule seemingly arbitrarily revealed only when it becomes relevant to the plot:Only two truths are allowed in a row - After two Truths, the next person is required to choose Dare.This last rule is the one which kills the ending. The antagonist trickster demon Calex ends up playing the game with Olivia as the only other player. Markie was previous in the turn order and had just (accidentally, and very letter-of-the-law-ishly) completed her dare.This leads to Calex entering the game and choosing ""Truth"". Olivia asks how to end the game, to which he states it's now impossible since prerequisites for a game ending ritual can no longer by fulfilled.Olivia then invites thousands of people to the game at once, perpetuating it.However: considering Olivia was willing to sacrifice both her and Markie's lives to end the game, the correct order of events should now be:Olivia chooses Truth.Markie's turn: Dare. Refuse to do this (As she's just refused a moment ago but accidentally completed the dare anyway) and thus die.Calex: Either Dare, in which you dare him to end the game. Or Truth.Olivia: Truth.Calex: Now forced into a dare. Again, leading to an end to the game.",Truth or Dare

I may have had different opinions if I had seen this as the only version, but after watching the movie it was based on, I can tell you that this one is good.No, it's not an original classic, or something that people will speak of in years to come, but it has good acting, the story actually makes sense, and it's not gore for the sake of gore.After watching the film it's based on, this version has more of everything while keeping the important bits the same. The abrupt ending worked in this version as opposed to feeling bereft of anything in the other. I only wish there could have been a solution to the end, as I tend to prefer horror movies where the final girl actually seems to survive past the credits.I was slightly more terrified watching this if for no other reason than I actually felt something for the characters and 10/10 would watch again.",Truth or Dare

413,garrettrussell264,One of the most inept horror films I've ever watched,1,3 July 2018,"Horror films as of late have actually very much improved the past 2 years. We have been getting some good quality from not just independent horror, but blockbuster horror as well. From The Witch and Get Out, to IT and A Quiet Place. And it only serves as irony that the week after one of the best movies of the year, A Quiet Place, comes Truth Or Dare, which is one of the worst the genre has offered in a while. 
The plot follows a group of idiotic college students as they take a lovely trip to Mexico, and come across an odd stranger who befriends them, and takes them to an old run down temple... a great premise as you can tell. And once they get there, they start to have a night of foolish antics, until they decide to play a harmless game of Truth Or Dare. Everything seems fairly normal until they get back to America, to find that all of the friends start seeing strange and disturbing images. People around them contort their faces into HIDEOUS smiles, demonic voices asking them to play the game, and some of them... EVEN START DYING! *dramatic stinger So each of the friends must follow the rules of the game that the demonic force creates in order to overcome it, and save themselves from all dying in horrific ways. 
Now the premise might sound interesting on paper, but the moment the film begins, the problems immediately show their face. The dialogue is horrendous, the acting is extremely one note from each of the stereotypes of characters the film offers us, and everything that happens in the film is extremely predictable and cliched. But, once the characters return home after they first play the game, and people start smiling like they're the Joker, things get absolutely ridiculous to the point of comedy. The demonic smiles on everyone's faces in the film never comes off as creepy like it clearly wants it to, instead coming off as cheap and silly. Leading to many moments of the film that are so over the top serious that it caused me, my friends, and the people around us to erupt in laughter.
And like I mentioned, the characters are all absolute morons who do things that no normal person would do in this situation. And most of the time, they are flat out horrible to each other for no reason. For example, the characters of Olivia and Markie become at odds with each other because the game forces them to reveal the truth about themselves, when realistically, they should be caring much more about the fact that they will die if they refuse. Which ultimately causes all of our sympathy for the entire cast to disappear.
And with that, I need to discuss the ungodly ending to this monstrosity. In summary of all of the events that happen, the remaining people must contact the person who brought them into the game, to hopefully end the terror once and for all (total It Follows rip off). So they all travel back to the Mexican temple from the beginning where they complete a certain ritual that will end the game, and guess what, they do,... for the demon to decide to change the rules. Now, Olivia has to spread the game to other people to keep the cycle going to buy them some time. So the final scene has her sharing a video around the Internet asking people to play the game, despite having the title on it being, ""DO NOT CLICK ON THIS!""... In the end, the solution for the characters is to doom the entire world...
Blumhouse has been bringing us some great films as of late, and the fact that this abomination came after the successes of Split, Get Out, and The Visit really perplexes me. This is a scare-free, ill conceived, and repugnant attempt at horror that brings the genre back 15 years.",Truth or Dare

Wow the irony!!,7,23 November 2019,"Your best friends or everyone in the world but said friends are gonna live?The movie was overall okay, it was an enjoyable one to watch if you had nothing else going on at the moment but man I just loved how they showed you can be a hero, a saint in your mind and for this case (first scene at the church when they asked her this question) her answer was true for her and you could tell it was true because they already started playing the game and she was punished cuz in her mind she was being honest.And that is why I really liked the ending, it was not just one twist where she just got smart, she also got the chance to act out her answer for the decision she made when she was in the church playing a game with her friends in her comfort zone (and you could relate to this because most people, when asked, would choose to save a billion people over a six or ten). But this time, when the question practically asked for real this time at the end of the movie, she chose to be selfish. She practically sentenced the whole world to die eventually. And despite it being selfish it still is also relatable in real life. You are not always going to do the right thing when the time comes even if you believed you would do it. Because when you make that theoretically hard choice, you never expect it to actually become real, you can't imagine the real consequences.Anyways, that was a spot-on scene but probably also the only scene that will stay in my mind about this movie. Rest was just ok. 7/10",Truth or Dare

They might not like the film personally, but that shouldn't generate a biased low score. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, this one actually had a backstory as to the origins and reasoning for the game--I was surprised with that. I expected it to just be a scary game with no purpose, but I genuinely respect that they added a backstory. 
Next, this movie is overall just unique and cool. Unlike other cliche horror films where some demon figure is ""haunting"" the house, this film takes a unique approach by having a group of friends end up being the ones that have to do the ""haunting"" and ""killing""; this concept also played well on friendship and family bonds/truth telling and trusting one another.

The small sidelines which are provided before the game begins connect the truths and the dares very craftily. For ex., when Olivia tells the truth in the library due to the game and while leaving, Markie replies in disgust that she will break her hand if she touches her, which she did, acc. to the dare in her turn, Tyson's lie about forging prescriptions, Lucas's love dilemma, everything is connected to the truths and dares.
The part which would make you wanna hate the movie is what Olivia does in the end, of roping half the people of the world in the game. It is to test the selfishness of a person's life over other's. She was asked in her truth at the mansion if she would vouch for her friends or world in a apocalypse, and boom, that truth of self also clarifies itself in the end. All in all, a a very good story told in not so good screenplay which could have minimized the horror part where there wasn't any, I liked the movie very much.

Literal kids, the only adults there were some parents, myself and my partner so we just knew we were in for a treat. The acting is god-awful, and what is it with these bad horror flicks and having 30 year olds act as teenagers/college students? Every single character is so exaggerated and unlikable, you don't feel any sympathy whenever somebody dies because they're all so badly written and don't act as normal people do. There's a scene where the main character is confronted in a library by ""the game"" and is forced to yell out to everybody in the library that her best friend has been cheating on her boyfriend. For the rest of the movie she is treated like the bad person, but what about the girl that cheated on her boyfriend? How is this the main character's fault? As a matter of fact even the boyfriend has a go at the main character for ""lying to him this whole time"" but is he not even slightly pissed off at his girlfriend? I mean there's literally a scene where he sees her wasted and grinding on some random guy at the club and yet he acts surprised when he finds out that she's unfaithful? Give me a break. Whenever a character dies, nobody seems to care and it's never really brought up again, the characters just move on immediately. Don't even get me started on the ridiculous jumpscares. When will Hollywood learn that loud noises =/= scary? There are multiple times in the movie where there are just loud noises for no reason, there's one scene where the main character is down in some basement looking around and there's this extremely loud noise however it's just her turning around to see her friend behind her. It's just completely unnecessary. The worst thing about this movie is the fact that at the start of the movie, our main character is asked whether she would sacrifice all of her friends in order to save the entire population of Mexico to which she responds yes of course. However at the end of the movie when all but 1 of her friends are dead, she is willing to infect the ENTIRE POPULACE with this stupid demon thing in order to save just herself and her friend. Her character completely changes. Everybody is unlikable, the dialogue and camerawork are reminiscent to an old highschool film you might've put together with your friends, the plot is illogical, characters make stupid decisions, and the very last scene is just the icing on the cake. Please DO NOT waste your money to see this film, just wait for it to come out on Netflix or something because it's barely worth your time let alone your money.

However, those who have seen it, may get bored. This 2018 movie is a bad rip off. The storylines and characters are very similar, though the 2017 version is bolder and edgier. It's exiting and nerve racking. The characters are better developed and their friendship seems more real than the 2018 version. The 2017 movie is truly twisted and sick, sending its viewers on a rollercoaster just by the plot's development. Sadly, the 2018 version needs unnecessary and, for the lovers of this genre, quite predictable jump scares. It fails to thrill the spectators without excessively showed a sort of distorted face, which by the way would make an 8-year-old cry of laughter instead of fear.While the 2018 ending is quite plain and straightforward, the 2017 ending leaves you guessing.

445,jholmes-37192,Only enjoyment I got was laughing at a few scenes.,4,6 February 2020,"When I initially saw trailers for this movie, I was like. ""Oh boy, that's gonna be bad"". But even though I had that gut feeling I went into the movie with a clear head and tried to stay optimistic however the end result was it was just as bad as I thought it would be. Horror movies need a relatable cast that you can actually root for and would hate to see die or else there is no tension. This movie does not deliver that whatsoever. It also really destroys the tension whenever the move is also going for a real dramatic scene but its so badly written that I can't help to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. At one scene in particular one of the main girls chooses truth and she narcs on her friend stating she has been consistently cheating on her boyfriend. Decent setup to make characters start drama with each other. However there is no followup and the girl actually says she's sorry for saying it. Now I don't know about you but I wouldn't actually feel bad at all for calling someone out for cheating even if they where someone I know. Characters constantly show an ill nature to them. I started to actually root for the demon because they all had it coming. Those goofy smiles don't do anything for me by the way. Looks ridiculous to the point of laughter and not scary in the least. Lastly I'll go over the premise.

447,matt_hall-18443,More of a Comedy than a Horror,3,14 April 2018,"The film lacks so many qualities, when the trailer was first released I was dubious on what the final product would bring and was right to think like that. A production from Blumhouse for Horror gave me slight hope after a few creditable low end budget films in the past such as Get Out and Paranormal Activity. However, Blumhouse have released the latest rock bottom horror film that is one to forget as it contained minimal and predictable jump scares, a poor range of acting throughout however some possible potential from lead character Lucy Hale.If you're thinking about watching this film, don't spend the money in the cinema because it's just not worth it and will probably be shown on TV or be on Netflix or Amazon Prime within the next year.",Truth or Dare

I watched it for what it was, a scary movie. I didn't jump out of my seat. But was surprised 2 times and that was good enough for me. Although the ending was obvious... the characters did a great job, there was a plot, there was a storyline. I enjoyed it. Was it my favorite NO, but it was by far better then Medea's Boo Halloween. No comparison. I will say this, to all the movie goers... these days, when they say turn off your damn cell phones, DO IT, Stop talking through the God Damn movies and for goodness sake, if a patron is sitting in a seat in front of you keep your damn feet off of the back of the seats.. This poor girl got told last night that her feet were awful smelling and I would appreciate it if she would move them. 12.50 to see a movie is allot, I hate when other inconsiderate patrons crap on it!",Truth or Dare

451,ilayschipz,A Blumhouse Blunder,5,17 April 2018,"A truly terrifying horror movie does not rely on sudden loud sounds, horrid imagery, or even suspense (although these things can certainly help.) Instead, the use of tone, unnerving concepts, and a consistent backdrop of uncertainty are what makes a good scary movie, memorable. Blumhouse Production's Truth or Dare attempts to follow these principles but fails horribly in its execution.If there is one thing Truth or Dare should be charged guilty of, it's repetition. Despite a good introduction to a somewhat chilling concept, Truth or Dare falls flat when it somehow manages to reenact the same scene several times over using different characters and different lines. The somewhat creepy ""Snapchat filter""-as the main character Olivia calls it-that is superimposed on the actors during their hallucinations loses its charm after about the third or fourth time it's shown on screen. The constant use of suspense and sudden blaring peals is smothering and lose their effect very early on in the film.Perhaps worst of all, there is little to no uncertainty in the film. Of course, there is the short-term kind of uncertainty contained in the suspenseful parts of the film, but there is no build-up. Humans are naturally fearful of the unknown, and this is generally what gives horror movies their edge. But with a lack thereof, the movie is mediocre and tenuous. Truth or Dare is best reserved for monster movie marathons or late-night chills but, by no means, deserves a spot on the big screen. 5/10.",Truth or Dare

The storyline is more involved than Final Destination and the characters (and audience) are engaged in far more interplay between destiny (death) and the ability to affect their fate (life).This movie does not focus on the gruesome but rather, the gymnastics of morality when death, especially your own, is on the line.",Truth or Dare

Then the ending was just complete trash. the fact that the guy picked dare, ""one of you would have to do it"". NO they were litterally seconds from stopping the curse and you wouldn't have to do it, if you literally just told the truth, even if it continued to the next, it would have bought at least a min or 2 which would have been long enough for the curse to be stopped. Then the morally right character that always did the right thing doesn't do the right thing and end herself with her friend so that the curse would stop, that was the only way to stop it, and she just let it continue. Terrible ending that felt rushed and made up just to make a squeal if it did good.",Truth or Dare

It also gets a heads-up for actually delivering a background story. You can notice the authors gave some thought as to how to explain all what was going on.Nonetheless, it is a cheap and a non-scary movie. The smiles the possesed people had looked more like a snapchat filter than a real demon-like face. The movie had more funny moments than scary ones. Some of the actors were also dreadful and the sequences felt like a Teen Wolf production, rather than a cinema movie. It is entertaining, but would have rather watched it on television than on the cinema.",Truth or Dare

If you are looking for a movie that you can switch off to and just watch a movie that is mindless entertainment then Truth or Dare is a movie i recommend it if you can look past of the cliche horror tropes.

THAT is what kept my attention.Instead of the a weird JOKER like GOD or DEMON possession, it should have just been more digital, emails, text messages from unknown accounts. That's more realistic, annoying AND scary... especially if a call came in on the house phone like ""Scream"" and a million other movies.Point is.... everything in this movie was done x100... so it wasn't an EPIC fail.

The movie stars the great Lucy Hale one the most influential actors of this time! Every movie she does she shows som much effort, all her characters are never dry their all clever and original and she goes deep into the character every time. The movie stars other people too but Lucy Hale shines through it her performance never gets dry. Im always on the edge of my seat when I watch this movie, the jumps scares are always effective, I especially love the twist ending... but I don't want to spoil it because you have to watch it for yourself. All the credit really goes to the director and writer ( I don't remember their names) who make the movie so grounded with all the drama on top of the scares. Jason Blum is a god compared to directors like Bong Joon Ho, all the movies he produces are masterpieces aside from Upgrade ( bad cinematography, bad writing, bad acting, and bad lighting). Every time I here there's gonna be a new BLUMHOUSE movie I kill a cat, I'm estatic. I can't wait for BLUMHOUSE Fantasy Island.",Truth or Dare
471,alexandermarijuantuck,Truth or Don't,1,17 October 2018,"In truth I never committed to watching this film with high expectations, it was an impromptu, last minute decision so the film choice wasn't given much thought. And I say with complete sincerity, that this is by far the worst horror movie I have ever seen. 
What makes horror fils enjoyable and exciting is the effective creation of suspense, the constant feeling in the back of your mind that something isn't as it seems, or that you will suddenly be met with a jump scare or shock. At no point in this film was I scared or shocked, nor did I feel any great deal of suspense and therefore it has nerve to even describe itself as a horror film, or even a thriller. The scariest part about the film was how shocking the editing was and how poorly structured the scenes were.
Furthermore, it is a classic staple of most horror movies that they tend to lack much of a meaningful plot. However, this was honestly something else. It was so predictable that I was able to anticipate about 60-70% of what actually came into fruition. It shows that this film lacks much individuality and is a testament to how lazy the writing was. It's almost as if the writers just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible and thus tried to fit in every horror cliché that they could, and even this wasn't well executed.
I found myself feeling no connection to the characters at any point, to the extent that I had no idea what any of their names were and thus the concept of ""truths"" was lost on me, this was because they fit the classic horror movie stereotypes, but not even well. There was very little meaningful character arc or development and thus i just did not care when any of the characters died. 
The evil entity ""Callix"" or ""Callux"", I honestly don't care how it's spelt, was not scary in the slightest. I get the sense that the directors were going more for a creepy than scary vibe and yet the lack of a physical embodiment of the great evil other than a pitiful attempt at a creepy smile on the characters really took away from the threatening nature of the character.
The only redeeming factor about this movie was that the character, Ronnie, was incredibly funny and this is why I have afforded it at least a star rating, but once he was killed off, that sense of comic redemption was lost and the film continued to be very disappointing.
Overall, would not recommend, do something better with your life.",Truth or Dare
