0,bkoganbing,Who You Gonna Call-------Snake Plissken,5,2 March 2010,"Kurt Russell revives his Snake Plissken character from Escape To New York where several years later Los Angeles is now also a place for all the exiles to go. Except now there is a much wider definition of just what is an outlaw.If you thought things were bad then, a certain rightwing preacher played by Cliff Robertson who managed to get himself a certain amount of credibility by predicting the big one finally hitting the west coast and Los Angeles becoming an island. He rode that to the White House where a constitutional amendment has made him president for life. And to further drive home the point of who we're talking about, the capital of the nation is moved from Washington, DC to Lynchburg, Virginia.So under our new president we've got all kinds of biblically based laws and those who deviate from them can accept exile in La with all kinds of real criminals as well. And there is no Escape From LA.But even the best preachers have some troublesome kids and he's got a beauty in daughter A.J. Langer. She's stolen the black box which contains the codes to some advanced satellite weaponry and she's defected to Los Angeles where Che Guevara type leader Georges Corraface is now reported who will turn the weaponry on the USA and lead all these third world countries on an invasion. After all you can't imagine with this kind of country we've got too many allies left in the world. You can't even imagine Laura or Jenna Bush doing this to dear old dad.Based on his track record of rescuing one president from New York, of course Cliff Robertson sends for Kurt Russell for this job. He's even got another Lee Van Cleef type soldier as Russell's handler in the person of Stacy Keach who has the equally ruthless Michelle Forbes working for him as well.That by the way is the biggest problem of Escape From LA. Escape From New York was imaginative for its time in 1981, but I think director John Carpenter should have put Kurt Russell in some new situations. He took so much from the first film and just reworked it for Escape From LA.He did give Kurt Russell a new outfit, one I think more to fit in with what would be considered a socially deviant crowd in Los Angeles. Russell looks like a leatherman's dream in what he's wearing.For what it's worth Escape From LA is kind of fun, but it does suffer horribly from a lack of imagination. On the other hand you've got some fine players really hamming up there parts like Steve Buscemi as the talent agent gone bad, Bruce Campbell as the surgeon to the stars, and Peter Fonda as an old surfer dude. They're the best reason to see Escape From LA.",Escape from L.A.
1,Leofwine_draca,The beginning of the end for John Carpenter,3,8 July 2016,"This is a misfiring sequel on all accounts to John Carpenter's 1981 sci-fi classic, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. I call it a sequel, but it's more like a remake: a few things are changed, like the city and the characters, but for the most part this plays out exactly like the first film. The reason for this is that Carpenter and Russell just wanted to have some fun by returning to a film they both loved making. Fair play to them, but this is a film that never needed to be made: it's utterly cheesy, full of pathetic special effects, and completely predictable. Fans might enjoy it, but you'll need a lot of goodwill to get through this one unscathed.I'll admit now that I like Russell, and I liked his reprise of the character Snake Plissken. Sure, there are some cheesy one-liners and dumb moments, but he's okay. Another plus is that Carpenter has assembled a fantastic supporting cast. Steve Buscemi is around, acting weird as usual (but more over the top and not as funny); good old Stacy Keach is on hand as an officious bad guy and very good he is too, the best in the film; Pam Grier is cast as a transsexual; Peter Fonda is an aged hippy surfer taking part in the film's cheesiest effect, where he and Russell 'ride' a tsunami; Bruce Campbell is unrecognisable (apart from his voice) as a mad plastic surgeon. The only weak link is George Corraface as the bad guy. Okay, he's dressed up as Che Guevara, but that doesn't make him a good bad guy: he's actually incredibly wishy-washy and no threat at all. His fight scene with Russell is laughable.The plot is a string of action scenes, some okay, some poor. The motorbike/car chase was the highlight for me. After that it becomes too involved in parading a string of odd characters while throwing in all the movie clichés imaginable. It is fun, in a kind of low rent way I suppose, and there's a twist ending which isn't bad, but it's not enough to make this a good film by any stretch of the imagination.",Escape from L.A.
2,SnoopyStyle,Embrace the camp,6,17 March 2014,"In 2000, an earthquake measuring 9.6 strikes Los Angeles separating it from the mainland. The moral President for life (Cliff Robertson) declares Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States, and all undesirables are deported to the island. Once deported there, no one ever comes back. It's 2013 and Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is getting deported to L.A. The President's daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) hijacked Air Force 3 taking a secret package to L.A. She's suspected of running to gang leader Cuervo Jones, and Snake is offered a deal. He has less than 10 hours to live and must retrieve the black box. The girl on the other hand is expendable.John Carpenter returns with long time contributor Debra Hill and Kurt Russell. This time the L.A. culture is being dissected with surfers and plastic surgery. They are fully embracing the camp. They're having a little bit of fun with Snake. This would be too stupid to take seriously. However if you join them and embrace the camp, this could be an enjoyable film.",Escape from L.A.
3,Prismark10,Surfin the LA channel,2,26 May 2015,"I once saw John Carpenter on a UK television show in the late 1980s discussing horror films. He was about 40 but looked like he was in his 60s and smoked like a chimney. Now he is a few years shy of his 70th year he probably looks like he is 120 years old. Maybe he should had realised by now smoking is bad for you so do we really need all the wise ass cracks about smoking from Snake Plissken in this movie?Escape from New York was a low budget cult film with cheapo effects (James Carpenter was one of the F/X guys.) Escape from LA is a big budget film with cheapo effects. Most of the budget presumably went on Kurt Russell's salary who also gets a writing credit.Russell reprises his impression of Clint Eastwood as he is tasked by the deranged President of the USA (Cliff Robertson) to recover a remote control to a super weapon stolen by his daughter.What we get are scenes clearly filmed inside a studio with a mundane script, little humour, dull characters and bad CGI including that surfing scene. Even the action scenes look uninspiring. It seems Carpenter only made this film for the pay cheque. Most of the actors here are just wasted ranging from Pam Grier to Stacy Keach.I have heard that Carpenter hurt by the financial failure of The Thing is one filmmaker who does not give a damn, hence the misanthropic ending to this film.However Escape to LA was hyped up before its release and arrived at the theatres as a damp squib.",Escape from L.A.
4,claudio_carvalho,Another Entertaining Adventure of Snake Plissken,7,2 October 2020,"In 2000, when a powerful earthquake hits Los Angeles, the decadent city turns into an island. Then the criminals and outcast of the moralist laws created by the American president (Cliff Robertson) are deported permanently to the island.In 2013, the daughter of the president, Utopia (A.J. Langer), is seduced by the terrorist Cuervo Jones (George Corraface) and flees to Los Angeles to meet him with a remote control capable to use satellites to destroy all electronic devices in any country that opposes to USA and allows the president to dominate the world. Now Cuervo is threatening to attack USA with Third World forces using the satellite control.Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is ready to be deported to Los Angeles and the president offers him full pardon if the recovers the remote control. Further, he infects Plissken with a virus to force him to accept the mission.""Escape from L.A."" is another entertaining adventure of the anti-hero Snake Plissken by John Carpenter. The storyline is very similar to ""Escape from New York"" but with different and funny situations and dialogs. The action scenes are excellent, and this sequel is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fuga de Los Angeles"" (""Escape from Los Angeles"")",Escape from L.A.
5,kosmasp,From East to West - in 15 years,7,16 November 2020,"I understand that some felt underwhelmed by the sequel. I personally liked it. The original may have been a raw masterpiece (to some at least) and this is more a polished effort. But if you feel in love with the character Kurt Russell portrays, I don't know why you shouldn't get into this? There are many reasons you can and should enjoy this.It may have been 15 years since Snake was last seen (still his prefered name to be called), but he has not lost his edge. He seemed to have forgotten that you can't trust the govermont though ... although maybe he didn't? Only the movie will be able to tell us that. And talking about that, I can see the similarities between this and a Guy Pearce starring Science Fiction movie, but I didn't feel like the other movie was a carbon copy ... then again, when money talks ... things happen.The ending is suspensful and a bit of a callback I'd say to the first movie, but this makes less sense if you think about it. But what we endure in the name of making something as exciting as possible. Good sequel and I would not have minded to get another one to be honest ...",Escape from L.A.
6,gavin6942,A Very Strange Sequel,6,4 December 2015,"Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is once again called in by the United States government to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported.John Carpenter insists that it was Russell's persistence that allowed the film to be made, since ""Snake Plissken was a character he loved and wanted to play again"".Commercially, the film flopped and critically it was mixed. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars (which seems absurd), while Kim Newman of rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, ""Apart from a few good characters, this is really not up to scratch in most departments especially the ludicrous plot."" Newman is definitely more accurate. This film is far too cheesy to even be associated with the original.Oddly, it seems the film today may be better known for the soundtrack than the movie itself. The soundtrack (which is very edgy, very 90s) stands up twenty years on. The film has gained a bit as far as nostalgia value goes, but few would call it their favorite Kurt Russell or John Carpenter film.",Escape from L.A.
7,lee_eisenberg,Maybe it's already like that.,6,16 January 2006,"This time, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) has to venture into Los Angeles - which got separated from the rest of the country after an earthquake and turned into a maximum security prison - to find the president's daughter. Maybe the movie is just a rehash of ""Escape from New York"", but it's not bad. Steve Buscemi turns in a really cool performance as Map to the Stars Eddie, and Peter Fonda plays a surfer waiting for a tsunami (maybe that seems a little inappropriate nowadays, after the tsunami that swept South Asia, and Hurricane Katrina, but it was still a neat scene). You might say that the movie is looking at urban decay, or at how our prison population keeps burgeoning. Not a masterpiece, but pretty neat.",Escape from L.A.
8,jboothmillard,Escape from L.A.,4,15 April 2012,"From director John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing, Starman), this sequel to the director's original Escape from New York is rated lower, and as I found the first film a good watch I was interested to see how the follow up would fare. Basically it is the year 2013, and a series of earthquakes have caused the city of Los Angeles to separate from the country, and just like New York it is a giant prison for criminals to live in. It is there that terrorist Cuervo Jones (Georges Corraface) has kidnapped Utopia (A.J. Langer), the daughter of the President (Spider-Man's Cliff Robertson), and brainwashed her to steal a device that controls an EMP weapon system orbiting the Earth. The only person who can stop the bad guys and retrieve the doomsday device is former soldier, and the man who survived New York, one-eyed rebel Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), who only agrees a deal to help the good guys in exchange for his freedom and his life. To make sure that he does the job he has been injected with Plutoxin 7 virus, which will kill him in ten hours, he only be cured when he has retrieved the weapon device, and possibly even killed the President's daughter. The President is unconvinced the war hero turned criminal will do it, but Cmdr. Malloy (Stacy Keach) knows that he will do anything to get his own way, and of course save his skin, all they can do is wait for him to contact them. Plissken is helped along the way by rebel fighter Taslima (Valeria Golino), crosses paths with dodgy swindler Map to the Stars Eddie (Steve Buscemi), and meets up with old friend Hershe Las Palmas (Jackie Brown's Pam Grier) the transsexual gang leader. By the end, Snake successfully recovers the doomsday device, defeats the bad guys, and all along he wasn't actually infected at all, it was a trick to make him do the job, but with a hologram and the real device handy, Snake gets his own back and activates the device, to bring all power and electricity to the world to an end. Also starring Peter Fonda as Pipeline, Bruce Campbell as Surgeon General of Beverly Hills and Michelle Forbes as Brazen. The cast is all fine, and the story is relatively interesting, the only problems are that some of the special effects could be much better, and you feel like it is something you have seen before, which is true, but there are some likable enough explosive sequences, so it is not a completely terrible futuristic action thriller sequel. Okay!",Escape from L.A.
9,ccthemovieman-1,One Of The Most Bigoted Movies Ever Made,1,5 June 2006,"John Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" wasn't bad, and was a hit movie, but this sequel - some 15 years later - is pathetic....and one of the most offensive anti-morality films I have ever watched. The hero is typical Kurt Russell (until the last few years when he seems to have mellowed in his roles): an anti-hero, anti-social and super macho man. The storyline of this movie is so anti-God, anti-Christian, anti-family, etc., that is is past ridiculous and downright laughable it's so absurdly left wing. This film should be put in vault as Exhibit A of exactly how much hatred the film industry has against God and Believers. You don't have to wait for them: many are in the first 10-15 minutes, and some more good ones at the end.Examples? Well, the story is that the absolute worst thing has happened in the USA: those narrow-minded religious people, led by a President who prays but orders his own daughter executed, have taken over the country! They have exiled sinful people to Los Angeles, which is now an island. The President's daughter, portrayed as some fanatic with a machine gun a la Patty Hearst, has stolen some dangerous object and Russell is assigned to go retrieve it. The daughter, by the way, wears a Christian ""True Love Waits"" button on her blouse. They make sure we see that. The President has moved his headquarters from Washington to Lynchburg, Va. (home of the hated Rev. Jerry Falwell). Meanwhile, Muslims, atheists and even sweet-looking innocent kids have all been exiled to L.A. by this hate-spewing Bible-touting President! I'm telling you: it's unbelievable. Picture something like this coming out against any other group and getting away with it. This absurd bigoted screenplay was co-written by Russell, Carpenter and someone named Debra Hill.The only positive parts of this film are the special effects, a few funny jabs at L.A. and surfers and Steve Buscemi, who always seems to play someone interesting.",Escape from L.A.
10,Tweekums,Snake Plissken is back in a cheesy sequel,7,28 November 2019,"Following a cataclysmic earthquake the city of Los Angeles has become an island. The new president has decided that this was divine judgement against the sinfulness of its citizens. The new island city is declared to be no longer part of the US. Strick laws are enforced on the mainland and undesirables are stripped of their citizenship and deported to LA. When the president's daughter Utopia, who opposes his draconian actions, steals the control system for a doomsday weapon that will destroy technology in the target area and takes to LA where she gives it to a terrorist. There is only one man to get it back... Snake Plissken. He isn't keen but since the authorities have poisoned him with a targeted virus that will kill him in ten hours and he will only get the cure when he returns with the device. Once in LA he crosses paths with various characters, some of them dangerous, before facing the person who has the weapon.It must be said that this is nowhere near as good as 'Escape from New York'; it is however rather fun. The story is basically the same but that doesn't matter as it provides action and laughs in equal measure. The epilogue tells how LA became an island and tells of how the religiously extreme president has become 'president for life' without wasting time trying to explain how all the checks and balances in the US system didn't prevent it... and rightly so; why waste time when most viewers just want things set up quickly so Snake can do his stuff! Once in LA Snake meets a variety of quirky characters; most notably a tour guide, played by Steve Buscemi, and a surfer determined to ride a tsunami, played by Peter Fonda! We get treated to two bad guys; the US president and Cuervo Jones, the Shining Path revolutionary who now has the controls to the doomsday weapon; each is entertainingly over the top in their own way. There is plenty of action although it must be admitted that some the special effects haven't aged too well... and probably weren't great at the time. The cast is solid; they never take things too seriously hamming things up delightfully. Overall this may not be a great film but it is rather fun so I'd recommend checking it out.",Escape from L.A.
11,ma-cortes,"Passable but inferior sequel filled with thrills , spectacular scenes and frantic action along with enjoyable sly humor",5,23 November 2014,"Exciting and spectacular rescue into Los Angeles destroyed by earthquakes, floods, mudslides, and become a top-security prison . This thrilling picture results to be an inferior sequel to Escape from N.Y. , the latter become a real Cult Movie . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , bits of humor with tongue-in cheek attitude and a weird atmosphere with dark and surprising ending . Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell, he was the only cast member from the original film to appear in the sequel)is once again called in by the United States government (Stacy Keach as officer , Michele Forbes as deputy and Clift Robertson as President) to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported and finds itself under siege by violent gangs . A previous war hero named Snake Plissken gone rebel must execute a daring adventure and bring up a powerful artifact in twenty four hours . Snake must recover it and along the way facing off villains like Cuervo Jones (George Corraface) . He's only helped by a sympathetic rogue underling (Steve Buscemi who took the part in this film to help fund his directorial debut, Trees Lounge) , and action women (Valeria Golino, Pam Grier) . As Snake Plissken to get in and out of Los Angeles . The film is a comic book plenty of action , fun , adventures , suspense , thriller and surprise-filled entertainment . Magnificent plethora of characters with decent performances by its entire cast . Middle-budget by Paramount Pictures , in fact its President Sherry Lansing was a fan of ""Escape from New York"" and wanted John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and Debra Hill to make the sequel in the same vein as the original. Kurt Russell as tough and valiant renegade is terrific . At the beginning of the film, Kurt Russell wears his costume from the original film, which still fits after 15 years . Kurt Russell not only came up with but wrote the entire ending of the movie , in fact it was the first and only writing credit . Escape From LA was caught in development hell for over ten years . A script for the film was first commissioned in 1985 but John Carpenter thought it ""too light, too campy"" . An initial script was written , but it remained dormant until Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together with frequent collaborator Debra Hill. It was Russell's persistence that got the film made ; Snake Plissken was his favourite character, a character he loved and wanted to play again . Support cast is frankly good such as Peter Fonda , Cliff Robertson , Valeria Golino , Stacy Keach , Pam Grier , Bruce Campbell , Michelle Forbes , A.J. Langer and Peter Jason , Carpenter's usual . The picture contains an imaginative and memorable production design by Lawrence G. Paull . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe . John Carpenter also made the atmospheric music score along with Shirley Walker . The movie likely to satisfy action enthusiasts and Kurt Russell fans .Director John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale on the style of comic books and old Sci-Fi serials . His films often feature important visuals shown from a video screen , as the end-of-the-world transmission from the future in ¨Prince of darkness¨ (1987), the Norwegian recordings of the expedition to uncover the aliens in ¨The Thing¨ (1982), various TV sets and the general anti-TV motif in ¨They live¨(1988), etc. ¨1997 escape from N.Y¨ was realized during his best period in the 70s and late 8os when he directed classics as ¨Halloween¨, ¨The fog ¨, ¨Christine¨, ¨They live¨ , ¨Big Trouble in Little China¨ and ¨The thing¨ . The sequel ¨Escape from L.A¨ rating : average but entertaining . The movie will enjoy to noisy action fans but packs a roller-coaster thriller and wholesome amusement . The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts . A third sequel was going to be made titled Escape from Earth which would have had Snake escaping Earth after a dark matter experiment. However, the negative reaction to this film prevented the sequel from being developed. As the movie was a notorious failure on release, making around $25 million , just half its budget , at the US box office. Many reviews criticized the film for being too violent or for being too similar to the original film .",Escape from L.A.
12,Quinoa1984,"about as pulpy as an orange in Snake's (err, Plissken's) gun holster; fun times late at night",7,13 January 2007,"I'm not sure whether I'm in the minority or majority, or even in the middle ground, in saying that I do think Escape from NY is a better movie. It had more ambitions in being an insane punk/futuristic/spaghetti-western hybrid where somehow Lee Van Cleef and Ernest Borgnine were on the side of good and Isaac Hayes played one of the hardest villains in modern sci-fi history. And, of course, in returning for Escape From LA, is Kurt Russell, who in his dingy would-be Clint Eastwood imitation is a revelation of bad-ass-ness, and through both films him and his character can be apart of that little club of amazing anti-heroes in movies. But even with the flaws I found in Escape From LA- and I should've been a little more forgiving in watching it at 3 in the morning (albeit glued to the screen), it's still John Carpenter having the fun that he loves to have as a filmmaker, with an extremely well-rounded cast and a few really memorable set-pieces.Recyclable could be what is taken from the story of 'NY' into LA, only here it's made wonderfully preposterous by the idea that LA, through a massive earthquake, separates the den of vice and misery into its own turgid island, where now convicts run the land. And, this time, a dangerous government secret has been hijacked onto the island via the President's wayward daughter, fed up with where the totalitarian country is at in 2013 America. Who else to turn? To a man who couldn't give a rat **** about anything in the country, but has no choice due to a time-sensitive virus planted in him. So away he goes to the island, and encounters a wacky, dazed surfer (Peter Fonda), a wormy little guy with the 'maps of the starts' (Steve Buscemi), a woman who just wants to help, though not for long on this island (Valeria Golino), and other oddities, including an ex-partner of his turned trans-sexual (hilariously played by Pam Grier). Again, massive amounts of criminals, a dastardly cunning villain, and lots of balls-to-the-wall violence.So why doesn't it make for one of the great exploitation/sci-fi movies of the 90s? Well, I just couldn't get over how the special effects sometimes came off, for one thing. When Snake is going in the sub towards the island, one can immediately sense by the exterior shots how really far CGI has come along since 1996 (especially since Carpenter's real bag in dealing with special effects are matte shots, not computer animation with virtual reality sharks). And one of the most entertaining set-pieces, involving Snake surfing with a bullet in his leg right alongside Fonda, still feels a little weakened when one can see how it's not seamless in style at all. Sometimes the production design is eye-catching, though I was waiting usually for the grand, epic-style shots from 'NY'. And Golina's character is the only one I would say is a fluke, or at least unnecessary. They're not extraordinary flaws, but I did notice how the gears were churning at a much more ""Hollywood"" rate. But even with all of this to pick out, it doesn't mean there's a lot of juicy, bloody fun to be had with the picture, highlights include: Bruce Campbell's hilarious cameo as an over-the-hill/insane plastic surgeon (one of the sharpest commentaries made in the movie, even if so short); Buscemi's whole archetypal performance as the uppity-talky kind of character who plays any side that's convenient; the Roman-style gladiatorial competition with the basketball; the hilariously tongue-in-cheek bits of dialog ""...draw"", capped alongside the anything-goes level of violence, like when they escape in the helicopter. The ending, too, could be mentioned as a highlight, as it's the one thing that topped over the original- it's a lot smarter this time around, and with a clever wink to those who get the message (however not that hard not to get). The satire in the film isn't particularly strong, not least of which compared to some of Carpenter's past film, but he still keeps it humming along at times, especially in the ending. And his style still is always in keeping with a western in mind, if not spaghetti-flavored in homage this time. With his guns on each side of his hips, his stare and swagger always stone-cold, and his attitude as inviting as a vice, Russell keeps alongside Carpenter's best intentions with the character, and he's always capable of making the movie watchable. In short, makes for a good few chuckles and a lot of grinning in the dead of night, just as long as you don't expect great art.",Escape from L.A.
13,Coventry,Some Snakes Never Change,7,26 August 2008,"Call me a hopeless optimist, if you must, but I'm strongly convinced John Carpenter and C° never had the intention of making a sequel that would be equally overwhelming and morbidly unsettling as the original ""Escape from NY"" was 15 years earlier. The producing parties presumably wanted the belated sequel to pass as some sort of identical remake to attract audiences from a younger generation, but I believe John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and all the other cast members simply considered it a good opportunity to elaborate further on the apocalyptic themes, the political satire and the eccentric anti-hero character of Snake Plissken. ""Escape from LA"" is an enormously trashy and entertaining sequel with an all-star cast that clearly enjoyed themselves, and a screenplay that is stuffed with ludicrously over-the-top action stunts. The plot is, as said, extremely similar to the one of ""Escape from New York"". In the not so distant future, the new President turned America into a prudish nation with enormous restrictions and very stern legislations. LA became an island since a very heavy earthquake and now serves as a prison colony for criminals and moral sinners from all over the USA. But when the President's rebellious daughter Utopia threatens to hand over her father's biggest secret  a doomsday device  to the self-declared leader of LA, the authorities call upon Snake Plissken to go to LA and recover the device. Injected with a lethal virus and armed with only his legendary reputation, Snake infiltrates into the desolate wasteland of LA and encounters a whole army of unreliable and double-crossing weirdos. This is a pretty cool flick as long as you interpret it as a light-headed spoof and intentionally OTT action movie. Carpenter and co-writer Kurt Russell are at their best when mocking typically American  and then preferably Californian  phenomena, like plastic surgery, crazy surfing and celebrity-spotting. The absolute coolest sequence involves a totally unrecognizable Bruce Campbell as a deranged surgeon who continuously has to renew his and his patients' skin in order to stay alive. These are, in fact, also the only truly new and inventive sequences in ""Escape from LA"" as all the other footage  although a lot of fun  are merely recycled ideas of the original. There's the cowardly president (Cliff Robertson replaces Donald Pleasance), Snake's sport match to life or death (basketball instead of boxing), the unlikely alliances, the government agent with a secret admiration for Snake (Stacy Keach replaces Lee Van Cleef), the running jokes about Snake's personality and so on. The soundtrack is awesome and the (deliberately?) dated special visual provide the film with a charmingly cheese 80's atmosphere.",Escape from L.A.
14,michaelRokeefe,"""Snake"" is the best man for the job.",4,1 September 2004,"John Carpenter, Nick Castle and Kurt Russell bring the Snake back. Russell reprises the role of the clever criminal Snake Plissken, who rescued the then President(Donald Pleasence) in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK(1981). Also back is the cool whispering reply...""Call me Snake."" A 9.8 earthquake in 2013 separates L.A. from California mainland and becomes a hell-hole of an island infested with gangs of several different ethnic backgrounds. The two faced Bible-thumping President of the U.S. States(Cliff Robertson)has Snake injected with a deadly virus and offers the antidote in exchange for a doomsday weapon that was taken into L.A. by the President's p***ed off daughter. Snake has ten hours to get the job done with plenty of bad guys wanting to stand in his way. There's plenty of loud and energetic action to keep you interested and a real cool double double-cross finale. The Snake proves to still be able to walk the walk and kick some ass.

16,Theo Robertson,Very Poor Sequel,2,9 November 2003,"Despite being one of the worst sequels a major Hollywood studio has produced ESCAPE FROM LA gets off to a fairly good start as we see an earthquake hitting California , but unfortunately the film plays out almost exactly like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK , and I do mean exactly . For example Snake is given a mission in LA which has been turned into a prison just like in the original , he`s injected with something that will kill him if he tries to abscond just like in the original , he faces conflict in an arena just like... In fact it`s absolutely ridiculous how much this film mirrors the original , lazy scripting of the lowest order which means there`s no surprises .There are one or two aspects that might market it as being original like satirical touches ( The plastic surgery sequence is the only clever bit of the movie ) and scathing attacks on the fundamental christian right and political correctness but these two attacks are locked together and when have you seen a politically correct fundamental christian right winger ? I should also point out that the special effects are nothing short of pathetic, I`ve seen cartoons with more realistic effects",Escape from L.A.
17,LeonLouisRicci,A Cartoon Parody of All Things AmericanA Misunderstood Movie,7,31 December 2015,"After the initial shock that was experienced by Fans of the Cult Classic ""Escape from N.Y."" (1981) wore off and it was understood that this was NOT done in the same ""serious"" Sci-Fi-Noir tone, but was an all-out, fully-throated, over-the-top Parody of all things American, the howling and the hooting calmed down and more respect for the Director's vision won out.The Film has not gained or even come near the Cult Status of the original, it's just not as hated anymore and viewed with the intent it was made. A violent Black Comedy on Pop-Culture, Politics, Religion, Religion in Politics, and so on.Kurt Russell returns in the call me ""Snake"" Plissken Role and was the driving force behind John Carpenter to get it made and have much fun doing it. So the Director utilized its fairly big budget to stretch the limits of SFX at the time. Stretch them to the point of absurdity. The many matte shots and other tricks were so strained they looked phony and corny and that's exactly what Carpenter was looking for.That's part of the laugh, part of the Satire, and part of the fun. There are overblown Characters, like in the Original, ""Map to the Stars Eddie"" (Steve Buscemi), The literally Bible Thumping President of the United States who moved the Capital to Lynchburg, Va. (home of Jerry Falwell), Hershe (Pam Grier), Pipeline (Peter Fonda), The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills (Bruce Campbell), Cuervo Jones (Georges Corraface), and Stacy Keach as the Military Leader.Overall, You have to be in on the Joke to enjoy this for what it is. Taken seriously it fails mightily on every level, but as an Adult Cartoon it works great.",Escape from L.A.
18,poolandrews,Fun but not brilliant.,6,17 April 2008,"Escape from L.A. is set in the year of 2013 when an Earthquake has separated Los Angeles from the US mainland & a Christian nut-job has become President (Cliff Robertson), anyone convicted of a crime or immoral act against the US is deported to Los Angeles which has been tuned into a prison island to rot. Notorious criminal Snake Plissken (co-producer & co-writer Kurt Russell) has been caught & is about to be deported when he is offered a deal. Snake is told that the US President's daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) has stolen a vital guidance system that controls a ring of satellites around the Earth called The Sword of Damocles that can deliver a strong EMP pulse anywhere on Earth & render any electrical device utterly useless. Utopia has gone into Los Angeles & given the device to terrorist Cuervo Jones (Georges Corrafce) who is threatening to send the US back into the dark ages, it's up to Snake to stop him & get the device back in order to secure his own freedom...Scored, co-written & directed by John Carpenter this was a sequel to his earlier excellent sci-fi action film Escape from New York (1981), well I say sequel but it feels a lot more like a remake. The script by star Russell, director Carpenter & producer Debra Hill really is a rehash of every good idea from the original, the plot for instance is virtually identical. Intstead of New York the action shifts to Los Angeles but the principal is still exactly the same, a run down island used to house prisoners. Snake is injected with some sort of poison which will kill him after a certain number of hours in order to keep him honest. Snake is offered a deal to retrieve some sort of vital electronic device. Snake has to survive attacks from gangs & all sorts of other criminals & the most well protected gang leader holds the key to his success. The boxing match from the original is replaced with a deadly game of basketball, the 'I thought you were dead' line is replaced with 'I though you'd be taller' & I could go on & on about the similarities in character's & events all day long. Having said that I still enjoyed Escape from L.A., it's a good solid fun sci-fi action flick with a good pace, a reasonable story, some nice action scenes & a decent stab at satire. From the plastic surgeon scene to the character of Eddie who sells maps so you can find your way around are obvious nods towards present day trends taken to their extreme. The idea of freedom is also touched upon, whether it's the freedom to do whatever you want & live the way you want in the lawless Los Angeles or the repressed freedom of Government. The ending is also interesting, the way Snake fools everyone & sends the entire Earth back to square one as he believes neither side is fit to rule.Director Carpenter needed a hit after some flops at the box-office & it does feel a bit like desperation to go back to maybe his single most successful film & make a sequel which is practically identical. Escape from L.A. is a mixed bag to be honest, there are some great scenes here like the bike & car chases but then there are also poor ones like the silly surfing & hand gliding sequences. Some of the action felt a little static & dull, the end sequence in particular just felt shoddily made & lacklustre. The violence is relatively tame, there's some fights, some shooting & an off screen decapitation. The basketball sequence is cool if a little improbable although having said that Kurt Russell made every hoop including the full length of the court one which is quite amazing actually.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Escape from L.A. was a well funded film, the sets are good, the majority of the special effects are as well although there are one or two which don't hold up these days. Apparently shot in Los Angeles, Florida & Texas. The acting is alright & Kurt Russell is great, I must admit I've always liked Russell in anything I have ever seen him in. There are a few fun cameos too from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda & Bruce Campbell.Escape from L.A. is a considered success for me, it has some good ideas & some good action scenes but overall it feels like a poorer remake of Escape from New York rather than a sequel. I liked it & it entertained me but I doubt I would want to see it again anytime soon.",Escape from L.A.
19,utgard14,"""Welcome to the human race.""",5,7 July 2014,"John Carpenter's totally unnecessary sequel to his classic Escape From New York. It's really just a retread of that movie with a very similar plot, similar characters, lines, situations, etc. The biggest differences being now there's a lot more campy humor and some very poor CGI. Also the supporting cast is nowhere near as good and, unlike the first movie, everybody seems very aware that they are in a sequel to a popular movie and play it up as such. It's likable enough and watchable. This is mostly due to Kurt Russell's screen presence and the little Carpenterisms sprinkled throughout. But it's not a patch on the original and ultimately there's not a lot to recommend about it to anybody who isn't a die-hard Carpenter fan.",Escape from L.A.

21,zardoz-13,"More Fun Than the First ""Escape""!!!",9,8 August 2011,"If Snake Plissken had an attitude problem in ""Escape from New York,"" wait until you behold the havoc he wrecks in the long-awaited, slam-bang sequel ""Escape from Los Angeles,"" a memorable apocalyptic science fiction satire that more than compensates for many of the shortcomings in the original.In August 2000, an earthquake has separated Los Angeles from the California mainland. An ultra-conservative Jerry Falwell-type politician, who predicted the earthquake, has exploited his good fortune to win the presidency for a lifetime in the next election. He rewrites the laws so that he can hang on to the post for life then relocates the nation's capital to Lynchburg, Virginia. A new morally white-washed America has emerged by the year 2013. Cursing, smoking, pre-marital as well as extra-marital sex, and eating red meat now constitutes crimes. The government deports anybody who doesn't conform and sends them to the gang-infested cesspool of Los Angeles. The U.S. Police Force maintains a chain of forts along the coastline to repel the efforts of a South American revolutionary, Cuervo Jones (George Corraface of ""Christopher Columbus""), who plans to spearhead a Third World invasion to reclaim America. Things take a turn for the worse when the President's naive daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) steals the black box. The black box contains the remote control to activate a necklace of lethal satellites designated 'the Sword of Damocles.' These satellites encircle Earth, and they can fire a magnetic pulse beam with pinpoint accuracy that can disable any kind of electric engine. Utopia hijacks Air Force 3 and the jetliner crashes in L.A. She allies herself with Cuervo Jones who threatens to use the weapon against America. The U.S. Police Force dispatches a rescue team, but all die. Enter 'war hero' Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell of ""Tombstone""), unshaven, sporting a black patch over his left eye and his typically surly attitude toward authority in general, in handcuffs with a police escort. The only thing Snake seems to be interested in is where he can get his next cigarette. The police infect Snake with a deadly virus that gives him less than ten hours to retrieve the black box. Reluctantly, Snake agrees to take the mission and rides a nuclear mini-sub into Los Angeles.Snake shares the sentiments of Marlon Brando's motorcycle maverick from ""The Wild One."" When asked what he rebels against, Brando's black-leather clad biker replies: ""What have you got?"" Whatever it is, Snake is against it. Snake thumbs his nose at the rules and the rule makers. He is the ultimate anti-hero, sent to save a civilization that he abhors. Former Disney star Kurt Russell reprises the tough guy tongue-in-cheek role he created in ""Escape from New York."" No, you don't have to have seen the original to appreciate ""Escape from Los Angeles."" His fastidious performance boasts equal amounts of put-on and posturing. Russell delivers his dialogue in a low, rasping monotone that parodies Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name"" bounty hunter character. Snake resembles a fashionably rode-hard but put-up-wet Marvel Comic super hero clad in skin-tight, black garb, with matching pistols. Nevertheless, Snake hardly qualifies as a super hero. The filmmakers have a great time poking fun at their one-eyed protagonist. Instead of calling him 'blue eyes,' they refer to him as 'blue eye.' Everybody who comes into contact with Snake for the first time expresses surprise that Snake isn't taller. Snake acts rather gullible on occasions when he has to depend on characters who double-cross him.While the first ""Escape"" represented a triumph of style over substance, the ""Escape"" sequel triumphs both in style and substance. ""Escape from New York"" attained classic cult status as a darkly comic, industrial-strength escapade where Snake rescued a U.S. President from a grim maximum security prison on Manhattan Island. The story generated at least a modicum of tension because Snake had to contend with the severe time restriction. He had been injected with a poison that would kill him if he failed to accomplish his mission by its deadline. Strictly a follow-the-numbers formula melodrama, ""Escape"" benefited from its gritty looks, fantastic orchestral score, and the eerie atmosphere. The beauty of ""Escape from Los Angeles"" lies in the producer's refusal to stray from its formulaic origins. Moreover, the filmmakers have beefed up the budget, broadened the scope, and pumped up the story. Once again Snake battles the clock in his strenuous efforts to recover a device that can trigger world-wide destruction. There is a far greater sense of urgency in this ""Escape"" as we see Snake cutting corners and blowing away the opposition at every turn to save time. Director John Carpenter never lets the story slow down so we can catch our breath. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, he pulls a fast one with a clever surprise or two that enlivens this ""Escape."" ""Escape from Los Angeles"" pushes the envelope further in all directions. Carpenter penned the script with producer Debra Hill and Kurt Russell. Snake's mission is no picnic. The filmmakers plunge Snake headlong into one rigorous, hair-raising adventure after another. Several familiar faces pad out the cast. Stacy Keach of ""Mike Hammer"" fame plays the same role Lee Van Cleef had in the original. Keach ranks as the top cop who coordinates between Snake and Cliff Robertson's scene-chewing president. ""Rain Man"" co-star Valerie Golino and ""Pulp Fiction's"" Steve Buscemi help Snake navigate through the rubble of Los Angeles. The only thing ""Escape from L. A."" doesn't do better is repeat the same orchestral score. John Carpenter received credit for the music, but Shirley Walker of ""Batman"") puts a spin on the theme that doesn't compare favorably to the original. If you thought the first ""Escape"" remotely entertaining, ""Escape from L.A."" should blow your mind. Watch out for all that R-rated violence and profanity.",Escape from L.A.
22,Boba_Fett1138,Escape from Lalaland.,4,24 July 2004,"Incredible stupid B-action movie with some Playstation like special effects but still entertaining.What surprised me about ""Escape From L.A."" was how incredible B-movie like this movie was. Everything about it was extremely medi-core and some things were simply extremely horrible. I kept waiting for Jean-Claude van Damme to show up! It was that horrible at times...A.J. Langer was painful to watch and Georges Corraface was a stupid standard villain. Further more there are needless characters and the movie is filled with stupid 5 seconds cameo's from famous people who are billed first in the opening credits. Yes, only exception was Bruce Campbell who is always great to see in a cameo. Snake Plissken is still one cool guy but a bit silly and over the top cool at times.Far from a good movie but also not that painful to watch.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Sounds familiar.""",6,5 August 2009,"That sums up one of the most undeniable aspects about this flick: It is enormously reminiscent of the first. Whether or not that's a negative thing is up to the individual. It still holds great surprises, and is definitely a fun ride. There is more satire in this than the first. The tone of this is often overdone and campy, in stark contrast to how serious that of ""New York"" was, and there are those that will miss that. This is humorous, if a few gags and jokes fall flat. Everyone but Russell(who nails the part again) is newly cast, and the choices are all fitting. This has some rather memorable occurrences(a couple of them for sheer weirdness and imagination), and certainly puts several breathtaking visuals up on the screen. The effects vary, though there are excellent ones herein. Dialog has quotable lines, and is well-delivered. The music is cool. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The acting holds good performances. While it does bear a striking resemblance to that of the original movie, the script of this is interesting, creative and well-done. It has a nice pace, and you gotta admit that it's packed with action. Each sequence is exciting and intense, and differs from the rest in some way. There is strong violence and language in this, as well as disturbing content. This is bigger than the '81 film. Unfortunately, it also cost a larger amount of money, and only made about half back. It's too bad that Carpenter's work has a tendency to not be appreciated by the masses(only the fans and/or cult following) when it is initially released. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to watch it, the two aforementioned groups in particular. 6/10",Escape from L.A.
24,Uriah43,Cartoonish and Campy,4,11 September 2021,"This futuristic film begins in 1998 with a Christian televangelist warning that-because of this nation's godless immorality-a powerful earthquake will hit California and cause massive death and destruction. By sheer coincidence, California suffers a catastrophic earthquake two years later which is so severe that it physically separates Los Angeles from the American mainland. Not long afterward that same televangelist is elected President of the United States and he immediately suspends all democratic processes and transforms America into a theocratic dictatorship where those who don't swear allegiance to him and totally concur with his political and religious views are either killed by electrocution or forcibly relocated to the ruins of Los Angeles where crime and chaos reign supreme. Needless to say, not everyone agrees with ""President Adam"" (Cliff Robertson) and one specific person is his own daughter ""Utopia"" (A. J. Langer) who has become enamored with a Peruvian revolutionary in Los Angeles by the name of ""Cuervo Jones"" (George Corraface) who declares that he will return power back to the American people through whatever means he has available to him. To help him in that regard Utopia gives him with a special device she has stolen that controls specially designed satellites which can effectively shut down any electronic system in the world. Naturally, President Adam and his assistants are furious about this new turn of events and in desperation coerce a former Special Forces soldier named ""Snake Plissken"" (Kurt Russell)--who had just been convicted of several violent crimes-to go to Los Angeles and retrieve the device within 10 hours. To further ensure his compliance he is injected with a powerful virus known as Plutoxin 7 that will kill him within that exact same time frame and for which they have the only known antidote. Not only that but he is also ordered to kill Utopia while there as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film followed the same overall plot as its predecessor ""Escape from New York"" to a noticeable degree with only a few minor changes here and there. So on that note it was somewhat disappointing. It does, however, have better CGI-but since it was produced 15 years later that shouldn't be too surprising. Along with that, it also takes a rather cartoonish turn later on in the film with the introduction of ""Hershe Las Palmas"" (Pam Grier) which I didn't really care for either. Be that as it may, I honestly didn't think this film was nearly as good as its predecessor and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",Escape from L.A.

The President sends Snake Plisskin to L.A. to find his daughter, kill her, and retrieve a satellite control box she had. He is injected with a virus, which is another dead steal from the first film. John Carpenter pretty much directs his worst film with this piece of garbage. This is from the same director who made one of the great horror films in Halloween. Kurt Russell reprises his role as Plisskin and appears to be more super human. Stacey Keach plays the stereotypical villain who attempts to render Christianity the bad guy. Peter Fonda has a useless role as a surfer as a bad send off to his Easy Rider performance. Also featured is Cliff Robertson in not one of his best moments. Steve Buscemi plays a character named Map Of The Stars Eddie. If that is the case then perhaps Buscemi should fire his agent. Escape From New York wasn't the best in terms of special effects but it had a genuine futuristic vision and intriguing characters.

The United States has become a more moral society. Cuervo, a Cuban terrorist has used the President's daughter to steal a device that controls a special orbiting EMP weapon system. The President has called upon mercenary Snake Plissken, and to ensure his cooperation, they have implanted a virus inside his body, and it will inject the virus into his body in 9 hours, so Snake must stop Cuervo, and get back the Weapon's device.....Less of a sequel, and more of a remake, EFLA, is a lot like Evil Dead 2, Carpenter has decided to make the same film, but with references to the original.And this is where the film gets criticised, people wanted something different, and to wait sixteen years to make a sequel, is a long time, and to add salt to the wound, its a remake, and to a brilliant cult movie.But I enjoyed it, and I enjoy it now as much as I did when I first saw it in cinemas in 1996. Russell is great as usual and Carpenter still knows how to craft a movie, but it still goes back to the original so many times.Losing your vehicle when you first reach the island, playing a sport to survive, call me snake, and many more.Other characters are great, but utterly pointless, and the special effects just add to the charm.If your not a Carpenter fan, or don't understand the concept of irony of self referential movies, you will hate this.I liked it, it was great to see Plisskin back on the big screen, and it was a whole bunch of dumb fun.",Escape from L.A.
28,Aaron1375,I am sorry to say this...I liked it better than New York. I am so ashamed.,7,6 November 2008,"Yes, I thought this movie was a bit better than New York. Not by much mind you, but this one has a much lower score so I know I have chosen the wrong one to like. Snake is back, and Kurt Russell once again really brings life to the character. I am sure even those who did not care for this movie can at least say he did a credible job. The plot is a bit different a bit the same. The president's daughter has joined in with a criminal from LA, which is somehow an island now and a maximum security prison just like New York. America is now ruled by strange laws combining the worst of conservatism and liberalism. Add to that the fact other countries wish to invade the US and are using what the president's daughter has to try and make their plans work. What does she have you ask? Some sort of device that controls satellites that can cut power off to all machines and such. It can do this to any region or even the entire earth. Well once again Snake has been captured and once again he is duped into going into LA and retrieving the data, but not the president's daughter. So off he goes with a cool new outfit and some nice weapons and gadgets and just like the first one things almost immediately. He gets caught a couple of times in this movie, once by a strange bunch of people addicted to plastic surgery. He also has to play a deadly game of basketball and fly off with his ""allies"" in a strange helicopter. Hell, there is even a crazy surfboard scene with Peter Fonda. The movie is a bit goofy compared to New York, but I rather like the over the top way this movie is done. The effects are hit and miss, the actors are hit and miss and so is the action, but overall I think this movie is rather cool. Of course, I may think that only because Snake is back.",Escape from L.A.

This film very much lacks in originality, mostly due to it completely ripping off its predecessor. In fact; it could be said that this film is a remake of the first. However, what it lacks in originality is made up for with a great cast of support characters, which includes Steve Buscemi, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda and a great little turn from the god of B-Movie, Bruce Campbell himself. Kurt Russell returns of course, as the film's anti-hero; Snake Plissken, complete with a very cool new look; courtesy of a long black leather coat and leather trousers. Kurt Russell's performance in this film is pretty much the same as in the first movie, whereby he is only required to look cool for the duration; and that is something he does well. The support characters, however, are this film's main asset. Obviously Kurt Russell is the star of the show, but it's the colourful characters around that really make the film interesting. The effects in Escape From LA, considering it was made in 1996, are awful. Whether or not the effects are bad on purpose as a tribute Escape From New York, I don't know; but I really felt that they could have done more regarding the effects. Escape from LA is a very silly film that many people will find hard to take seriously, however if all you want is to enjoy yourself for 100 minutes or so, and not use your brain too much; Escape From LA is your movie. Originality aside, I would say that this film is on par with Escape From New York.",Escape from L.A.

It's for that reason that I will always have a soft spot for this movie, shortcomings and all.And those failings can be significant, seeing as ""Escape from L.A."" runs on familiarity. It repeats the formula of the first movie to a T, and it's a clunky satire (at best). But we also want that familiarity; to see Kurt Russell don the eyepatch again (the guy wears Snake Plissken like a glove) and witness his signature brand of anarchy.

32,namashi_1,Kurt Russell Steals The Show...,6,22 June 2011,"'Escape From New York' became a CULT film. It left a lasting impression on film buffs. John Carpenter and Kurt Russell got the credit for making the action film memorable, as carpenter directed it and Russell ripped it up with his performance as War Hero Snake Plissken. 'Escape From L.A', which is a sequel to 'Escape From New York, and which re-formed the team of Carpenter and Russell, released years and years later since it's prequel and flopped at the box office. I had seen 'Escape From L.A' years back, and I remember enjoying Russell's performance. I re-viewed 'Escape From L.A' recently, and even though it doesn't leave a strong impact as a film, I really enjoyed Russell's performance once again. He Steals The Show, in a role, that, probably, he has immortalized for his fans. The patch in his eye, the rusty look, his body language, everything seems perfect. In 'Escape From L.A', Snake has been given the responsibility to bring back a potential doomsday device from L.A, which is now reduced into an autonomous island where undesirables are deported. And he has been given a Time Limit. Carpenter and Russell's Writing appeals in bits and pieces. The film begins well, and Russell helps you grab the narrative with his dedication. But, the writing loses pace in the latter portions. The climax is decent, but the desired impact is missing. Also, Peter Fonda's character has been given no importance. Carpenter's direction is decent and you only wish if his writing material could've been tighter in the latter portions. Cinematography is good. Editing is fair. Art Direction is well-done. In acting, it's only Russell who stands on his own and holds the film. Snake Plissken and Russell gel well. Stacey Keach is okay. Steve Buscemi is fairly nice. Peter Fonda gets no scope.

It might not come close to its predecessor, but the combination of Carpenter and Kurt Russell was always a win-win situation. Coming almost 15 years after the original, Carpenter probably wasn't in his prime during the mid-90s (although I believe ""In the Mouth of Madness"" to be one of his best) but I found his films in that period to be rather enjoyable. ""Escape from LA"" is a big-budget (although it doesn't look like it) rehash of the original, but a lot more camped up and amusingly satirical (very heavy-handed on Hollywood to the government) with an excellent cast attached of character actors. Where I see it get constantly attack is how the digital effects are lousily executed and the cheap sets look plain. Sure the quality of the visuals does come up cheesy, but it remains a colourful, if bleak wasteland backdrop. The pulpy story might not be its strong point along with a silly script, however Carpenter's up-beat tempo moves along through its stagy, but excitingly expansive set-pieces with enough insanely cartoonish action, a jaded rock soundtrack and disposable wisecracks backing it up. Some instances depended on too many coincidences, but an interesting aspect it seemed to create a spaghetti western vibe, and the character Snake Plissken can be seen as a throwback to that. Sometimes it felt like Russell was channelling Clint Eastwood. Russell reprising his role is tough as nails as the rugged outlaw Snake.

Needless to say, there's plenty of people who want to stop him and he's not going to have an easy ride.There's plenty of old franchises that get resurrected nowadays (Indiana Jones, Rambo, Die Hard) so much that it's almost become a trend, but twelve years ago in 1996 John Carpenter decided to make this belated sequel to his classic early eighties action hit Escape from New York. If he was hoping to renew any popularity he couldn't have failed more miserably.The film looks remarkably cheap and tatty for a big studio production. Carpenter appears to be trying to copy the original film's style, without taking into account that a whopping fifteen years had passed since the first film had come out and modern audiences wanted a more modern, fresh looking film. With a plot that is exactly the same as it's predecessor, this film totally fails to capture the tense, edgy sense of claustrophobia and tension that film had, with drab action scenes that looked better in the original film fifteen years before.On the cast front, Russell still makes the role of Plisskin his, as the surly, growling eye patched bad ass, but the material just isn't there for him. Meanwhile, an array of supporting actors just fill in the blanks. Steve Buscemi pops up in a comedic role, doing his quirky, wise quipping thing but failing to make anything better, Valeria Golino, of Hot Shots! fame, has a terribly written role as a possible love interest, while Pam Grier practically cameos in her role.Russell, and Metallica's Devil's Son (which plays over the end credits) are the only high points of this otherwise dreadful sequel. *",Escape from L.A.
36,bowmanblue,"Inferior, but enjoyable sequel",7,6 February 2019,"For some reason, despite being a fan of both (actor) Kurt Russell and (writer/director) John Carpenter, I never really went for their team-up movie 'Escape from New York' back in the seventies. On paper it had everything I was looking for in a film, but it just left me cold. However, I was in the minority there and plenty of people lord it as a 'classic' dystopian action/sci-fi film of the seventies. Now we come to the sequel, 'Escape From L.A.' around twenty years later. Sequels normally have trouble living up to the original, let alone if there's a huge gap between them ('Basic Instinct 2' I'm looking at you).Unfortunately, 'Escape From L.A.' kind of came and went from the public's conscious and no one really noticed. It never came close to generating such fondness with audiences and is generally considered a 'flop' in filmic terms. Even though I'm no 'mega fan' of the original, I can see why people enjoyed it. Maybe it's because I don't have as much love for Snake Plissken's original outing that I can appreciate the sequel and not expect so much from it. And I do think that setting your expectations quite low is the key to enjoying it. It's certainly no classic, but there are definitely worse out there.The first time around Kurt Russell played snarling anti-hero 'Snake Plissken' as he was recruited against his will by the Government and forced to rescue the President from the - now sealed off - city of New York. Guess what, this time round he has to rescue someone from L.A. (and defuse some sort of nuke-type device - it's not that relevant!). So, expect more (one-eyed) snarling from our protagonist, plenty of gun-play and the odd one-liner thrown in to show that the film kind of knows that it doesn't take itself too seriously.Along the way, Snake encounters plenty of colourful characters to aid and/or hamper his quest. Steve Buscemi is right up there as the main one that you'll remember, playing his typical 'wise-guy' kind of wheeler-dealer who you never know which side he's really on (besides his own!). However, my personal favourite was the group of humans who became addicted to plastic surgery in Hollywood and now are constantly hunting victims to steal their bodyparts. This gang is headed by (the ever-awesome) Bruce Campbell. Here, my only complaint is that this plotline isn't explored enough - seriously, I could have watched a whole film that revolved round this aspect! In fact, most people Snake meets are enjoyable to watch and add to the story... possibly apart from the one person who matters, i.e. the villain. He's about the most paper-thin character of them all and, when you have someone as iconic as Snake as the lead, you really need to look hard for that special kind of villain to match him.'Escape From L.A.' does feel a little dated now, especially when it comes to special effects. These basically aren't that special. Most are blatantly shot up against a bluescreen and it does tend to drag you out of the action. As do the numerous establishing shots of a post-apocalyptic L.A. which are obviously just drawings.However, it is just a B-movie and, if you keep telling yourself that then there's definitely entertainment to be found here, even if this is probably the last time you'll see Snake Plissken in action on the big screen (Box Office returns, combined with Kurt Russel's age, seem to dictate that this will be the last!).",Escape from L.A.
37,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Snake is Back, baby",6,24 January 1999,"Summer 1996 really was NOT the right moment to bring back Snake Plissken. America was caught up in Olympic fever and was riding the mad, patriotic wave extremely high with the release of ID4 and other huge action hits such as Twister and Mission: Impossible. A sobering reality check of the grim, forthcoming future instigated by a hypocritical government with a cynical, outcast anti-hero was NOT what anyone wanted.I remember sitting in the foyer at the now-demolished ABC cinema in Edinburgh on September 21st 1996 (we had to wait a month after the US release) waiting for the screen to open. A couple of young women exited the previous screening loudly proclaiming ""That was the worst film I have ever seen."" Bad Boys II had not been made at this point.I don't think that Escape from LA is a bad film, but it is a failure on many levels, not the least of which are the shoddy CGI effects which look like they came from a mid-90s CD-ROM.Since the massive spike in crime in America in the late 1980s, and the subsequent transformation of Manhattan into a prison colony, the United States Police Force and their religious lunatic Head of State has slowly but surely erased all liberty from the American people, denying them the rights to swear, have sex, eat red meat, smoke, or drink alcohol (all for their own safety of course), while at the same time expanding their empire by pushing into foreign territories.Any of this sound familiar? In 2000 a massive earthquake strikes Los Angeles and the city is transformed into an island, declared no longer part of the United States, and becomes the new, west-coast prison colony. Whether you're a murderer or an atheist, you lose your citizenship and are dumped on LA Island. Unless you opt for a quick electrocution before deportation.It had been 15 years since his famous escape from the Big Apple, but Snake had remained a strong cult character and had a big following. This time he's dropped into the Big Orange in 2013 with the promise that if he retrieves a doomsday device he will be able to walk free.""Freedom? In America?"" asks Snake. ""It died a long time ago."" This was 1996!Carpenter and Russell could clearly see the dark path their country was heading down. If only they conveyed their ideas and satire in a more cohesive, intelligent fashion. Escape from LA has big ideas, huge ideas even, but a cheap 101 minutes is not the best way to fully explore and develop such satire. As with his previous movies, Carpenter's vision is epic, but the execution is implied. This may work with horror movies like Prince of Darkness but it fails here. It really, really fails.When Snake shuts down the Earth at the end of the movie do we see the effects of such devastation on the planet? Do we see highways and cities go dark, do we watch mankind revert to the stone age as the juice he has relied on to keep him warm runs dry? No. Instead we see a couple of lights go out in a drab police compound. Wow! That's so not freakin' exciting, Carpenter! So much potential, so much disappointment. At the very, very least it works as a trashy action movie but it should have been so much more.",Escape from L.A.
38,851222,Snake Plissken at it's best,9,10 January 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Escape from L.A."" (1996) is an ultimate flick with one of the screen bad asses - Snake Plissken himself. This is a great action / sci-fi flick that features a lot of action, very cool settings and a simple yet entertaining plot. Kurt Russel once again star in a underrated but iconic role of the 80's hero, or in this case maybe antihero, as Snake Plissken never was a ""save the universe"" type of a guy, he as well as John Macklane were dudes that always were in the middle of events that they didn't want it to be. There are cool special effects, great cameos, cartoonish but cool for the flick characters and so on.Overall, ""Escape from L.A."" is a very cool and unfortunately underrated gem from 90's. It features everything that pure escapism picture could have. Do your self a favor and check this picture - 2 hours of pure escapism is a guaranty.",Escape from L.A.
39,The-Sarkologist,Essentially a remake of Escape from New York,7,26 January 2012,"There are some good things about this movie, such as the setting and the ending, but generally I think the original, Escape from New York, is a far superior movie. The plot was exactly the same and in essence it was simply a remake of the original movie with better effects.The thing that irritated me the most about this movie was Snake Blisken. Now I like Kurt Russell but I thought that this character was very contrived. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a cynical and selfish character rather than simply falling into the role. The character seemed to smooth out later in the movie, but at first it seemed to be very contrived.The plot is that the daughter of the president stole a disc that gives access to a defense network and gave it to an anti-American terrorist and the government blackmails Snake into getting it back for them. So he has to go to Los Angeles and get it back and for doing that he is given his freedom.As I said previously the setting is actually very good. The United States had become a cesspool of corruption and people feared for their lives. In the year 2000 a huge Earthquake struck Los Angeles turning it into an island. Later a new president was elected onto a purely moral platform and he declared that Los Angeles was not apart of the United States and would exile people guilty of moral crimes there. The United States thus became a theocracy and a police state where all who refused to be Christian were considered dissidents and exiled.The ending was good, but bad as well. Snake Blisken walks out on top and the bad guys - the Americans and the terrorists, were all killed. The president, who was a sadistic man corrupted by power and deluded by this to believe that he could change America and make it a state of morality. In the end his beautiful state is destroyed, all through the actions of Snake Blisken, who simply did not care.Another thing this movie addresses is the reliance that we have on technology. The key to this are the good old fashioned stick matches. They were the only non-technological things in the movie, and they symbolised that Snake did not need technology to survive. Throughout the movie, the President uses the threat of destroying people's technology as a measure to keep control, but he relies on technology to do this. In the end Snake uses the Presidents technology against him and walks off lighting a cigarette with the matches showing us that he really does not need technology to survive.I guess the reason that I gave this movie such a high rating was that it got better after the start, but there were still some really bad things about it, such as the scene where Snake surfs a tidal wave and catches up with Steve Buschemi's character. Once again, the plot was contrived on the original plot in Escape from New York, and I would suggest that if you wanted to watch a movie like this, go for the original rather than this one - it is far better.",Escape from L.A.
40,poe426,Escape From New York plus...,10,9 October 2008,"I ventured, at the time of its release, that ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK might one day prove prophetic (as had THE CHINA SYNDROME). Then came Ronald Reagan and his Reaganvilles and John Carpenter's poke at it all, THEY LIVE. Roddy Piper and Keith David were struggling to survive (as were we all) in the Reagan Republic. In the end, of course, it turned out that the Moneyed Folks were in on the coming alien takeover. When Carpenter more or less followed up, years later, with ESCAPE FROM L.A., he and co-writer Kurt Russell envisioned a U.$. Theocracy in which personal freedoms were being whittled to nothing- by Law. At the time of the movie's release, I was urging everyone I knew to see it. Unfortunately, most of them saw it as nothing more than a remake of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. Which means they didn't really get it. I argued that this was a movie that, like the 1984 version of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and THX-1138, was a movie that needed to be seen by everyone in this country.

45,Anonymous_Maxine,Horrendously prophetic.,4,9 July 2006,"So I watched Escape From L.A. after having recently made my way through both of Bruce Campbell's books (the latter, unfortunately, seeming to have been thrown through the publication process simply because of the cult success of his literary debut), and I have been half-heartedly watching all of the films that he was in. Sadly, his role in this movie is one of the most ridiculous that I have ever seen, and I mean in general, not just Bruce Campbell roles. He is the epitome of the doomed B-movie actor, but why hire someone with such a massive cult following only to completely change his appearance in the movie? I find it difficult to believe that they worried about him bringing down the Hollywood status of the movie; Kurt Russell is one of my heroes, but he's hardly a Hollywood superstar.I saw Escape From New York when I was a kid, and I remember hating it passionately, and although I found this movie to be highly unimpressive, I wouldn't say that I hated it. It makes quite a strong political commentary, with a religious fanatic in the White House (this time, frighteningly, appointed to a lifetime term), whose own daughter, curiously named Utopia, says things like ""Now is the time to rise up against the president's corrupt theocracy of lies and terror!!"" Mr. President has decided to move the nation's capital from Washington D.C. to his hometown, Lynchburg, Virginia. Lynchburg?LA, at any rate, is now ""the city of sin"" (which makes me wonder how Vegas is doing), and Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), is ""the most notorious criminal in US history."" As is to be expected, no attempt is made to assign Plissken with a history that would in any way justify such a title, we just need to know that he's a real bad guy. He runs around talking like a real bad guy and acting like a real bad guy, all the while trying to retrieve an antidote from the real bad guys (the government) who have infected him with a virus which will give him 10 hours to retrieve a stolen black box containing the codes to control the world's energy transmission satellites. That, unfortunately, is not only more of a mouthful than I can form into a coherent sentence, but is also more of a mouthful than this movie can handle. Any movie with a main character that is called ""the most notorious criminal in US history"" and then later features that same character surfing a tsunami wave down Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles and then jumping onto the back of a moving car off of his surfboard is living dangerously if it tries to support too complex a premise. He is also, at one point, forced to play basketball for his life. There is something of a duality in this movie, in that it could just as easily be enjoyed by people who are genuinely impressed with the story, acting, and special effects as it could be by people who look at it as great fun just because of how wildly over the top it is. I guess I fall somewhere in between, because I thoroughly enjoy watching bad movies, although I have a hard time with special effects in general, which so often are a tool to cover shortcomings in other areas. This movie is packed with both special effects and shortcomings, so maybe the combination of the two creates something that is more than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, maybe it just comes out as a great big senseless mishmash of shoddy production values. Either way, I had a blast watching for the LA landmarks",Escape from L.A.

A satire of big budget Hollywood action movies. A satire of Southern California culture. The problem is that it overwhelms the entire movie, and everything else feels like an afterthought to his quest to zing his targets.There are still a few worthwhile moments tucked in amongst all of the flotsam and jetsam, and Kurt Russell doesn't miss a beat after a fifteen year absence from the role of Snake Plissken, but it's just not enough to save this well-intended misfire.",Escape from L.A.

Is back in his most iconic role ever as Snake Plisskin & this time his mission is in the apocalyptic wastelands of Los Angeles & it's so much cheesy action fun.
LA is a great action film but not in the same style or tone of the CLASSIC gritty ""Escape from New York"" but it's still a great sequel & has so much cool stuff in here like the production design & the look of Los Angeles in ruins is fantastic & the music is very cool & exciting but the main villain/bad guy is terrible!!!! he's ridiculously not scary or tough or even threatening at all he's too comical & that's not good in this apocalyptic LA, you should have a really scary tough villain for snake!!! La had a bigger budget than New York & the destroyed Apocalyptic LA really does look great like i said fantastic & that bigger budget really shows in those sets & action set pieces.
Kurt Russell is still great as Snake Plisskin here & has alot of fun with his tough hero character with lots of action & stunts & shooting up the place, so yeah a very cool & exciting Action Thriller & so glad Carpenter directed again!!!
La is underrated but i have alot of Nostalgia for this as i brought it right bk when it was first released on video & i actually saw this way before NY!!!
So i have alot of love for this fun action Thriller & i still think IT'S one of ""Carpenters"" best & also one of his most underrated films but hey it's definitely a ""Cult"" film now.So yeah a good fun watch especially at night, it's great late night entertainment & has an awesome music score i love it so much.
A great sci-fi adventure fantasy through a ruined Los Angeles with Snake how can this not be cool?
I still remember buying this on video for £7 pounds at my nearest Asda way back in the 90's & i fell for it's exciting Apocalyptic action charm & have watched it many many times especially late at night as that time fits this fun adventure.
I like LA just as much if not more as NY probably because of My Nostalgia for it like i said buying it on video & because it was the first Snake Plisskin movie i saw!!! Didn't see NY till much later, years later!!!
LA is a very underrated but big fun Action B-movie really & a great underrated John Carpenter film & almost completely forgotten but there's some fans out there like myself so it has become a cult classic!!!
LA has a great score again by Carpenter & it's a good looking movie but i do admit that it's not as dark,grimy & gritty as NY,it's more cooler looking though with a bigger budget spent on production design so it does look Awesome.
LA is great fun & an excellent sequel to the CLASSIC NY & both movies are excellent but LA is more fantasy fun & very cheesy at times with goofy humour here & there & some great pure 90's fx that only adds to it's 90's old school charm!!!
My most watched Kurt Russell film probably? & it's a great sequel to a true cult classic.
My favourite if i had to pick, would probably be ""Escape from LA"" as it's just more entertaining,fun & adventurous than ""NY"" in my opinion.
Both escape films are excellent!!!
Both 10/10 films but i do get NY is the main Cult CLASSIC of the two & it's got that darker classic carpenter atmosphere but if I'm in a ""Kurt Russell"" mood or a ""Snake Plisskin"" mood then i usually would pick ""LA"" to watch for it's nice easy fun atmosphere & late night action tone!!!",Escape from L.A.
50,I_Ailurophile,"Escape from New York, Part II: Electric Boogaloo",8,7 January 2021,"Let me get this out of the way right at the top: I LOVE this movie.The narrative thrust of 'Escape from L.A.' very much echoes that of 'Escape from New York': Snake Plissken, antisocial antihero, is the only person that can get the job done, so the government sends him in with the promise of a pardon (and the threat of an unpleasant demise) to retrieve an all-important person or item. Along the way he encounters many denizens and dangers of the new society created in the sequestered ruins of the old, makes new enemies and new friends, and returns with ever more spite in his one beautiful blue eye. With every step, we in the audience are treated to exciting action, witty dialogue, and fantastic performances.While there are certainly enough differences to make this a new film all its own, make no mistake that EFLA is like watching its classic, rightly adored predecessor through a funhouse mirror. The main musical theme itself is but a re-imagined version of EFNY's, and the moment it begins playing over the opening credits, you know exactly what you're in for. The very first time I watched this movie, I laughed giddily at the obvious wink.'Escape from L.A.' is a movie that knows exactly what it is, makes no apologies for being over the top, and runs with it from start to finish. From surfing the ruins with Peter Fonda to hang-gliding over an amusement park alongside Pam Grier; from Bruce Campbell's creepy cabal of near-cannibalistic, overtly satirical caricatures to Steve Buscemi's happy-go-lucky, duplicitous gopher and guide; from the George Corraface's Basketball Court of Death to the dystopian welcome home by the US President For Life Cliff Robertson: this is a fun, silly movie, portraying a serious narrative, rounded out with very non-serious scenes, that winks and smiles at the audience and dares you to dislike it.What a cast! I don't need to list them all, though I already mostly have; just scroll through the names and it's a veritable who's who of cinema of the mid-90s. And we get still more of Carpenter's regular collaborators, including the ubiquitous and lovable Peter Jason, the unmistakable Al Leong... and, of course, Kurt Russell, returning to form with Snake Plissken and giving the action antihero a palpable air of tired spite. Russell plays the character with such convincing disdain and moral exhaustion that even as we laugh at the ridiculousness of the scenarios he finds himself in, our protagonist anchors the film with resounding, defiant contempt.Costumes, lighting, sets, props, effects--at worst they play directly into EFLA's nearly parodic intent, but mostly they are spot-on and make this movie as believable as it could want to be.I love Carpenter's score, and the music by popular artists selected to round out the soundtrack. I love Debra Hill's production. I love the screenplay, accordingly co-written by Carpenter with Hill and Russell.By no means is this for everyone. Several years before the misunderstood deadpan brilliance of 'Ghosts of Mars' cemented how very little people understand John Carpenter, EFLA dropped a pretty big hint. The storied writer, director, producer, and composer began his career with a less than serious film, and throughout his many features has masterfully guided us through genres including horror, sci-fi, thriller, comedy, and even romance. Ten years after undisputed classic 'Big trouble in Little China,' the release of 'Escape from L.A.' nonetheless perplexed many with questions of ""What is this guy doing?""The answer is: The same thing he'd always been doing. Folks just don't pay attention.If you watch 'Escape from L.A.' expecting a no-nonsense, serious-minded thriller or action flick, you will be disappointed. You don't have to be a John Carpenter devotee to appreciate it, though it doesn't hurt; you don't have to be entirely in on the joke, though it helps. Just keep your mind open, relax, and enjoy the show.Welcome to the human race.",Escape from L.A.
51,Jonny_Numb,"Welcome Back, Snake!",7,3 May 2008,"Two years after Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" courted worldwide controversy for its black-humored lampooning of the American obsession with wholesale murder, and 3 years before David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" both disgusted and amazed audiences with one man's disenfranchisement distilled into bruises and broken bones, John Carpenter unleashed one of his most audacious (and best) films upon unsuspecting box office patrons--""Escape from L.A.,"" a wildly irreverent sequel to 1981's genre-defining ""Esacpe from New York"" (and every bit as subversive as the aforementioned films). From ""Assault on Precinct 13"" through ""Ghosts of Mars,"" Carpenter has always made his contempt for authority (or the blurry lines between authority and criminality) known, and Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) has become the ultimate icon for such a mentality: a man of few emotions who is seemingly out for himself, weathered by a hardened apathy, but who derives an understated delight in ""sticking it to The Man."" The setup and progression of ""L.A."" tweaks ""New York"" in delicious ways, transforming the titular island (shook loose by a massive earthquake) into a haven for ""heathens"" no longer permitted in a morally purified America; in an extreme fit of youthful rebellion, the President's (Cliff Robertson) daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) hijacks Air Force 3 and has in her possession a device that could throw the world back into the dark ages with the push of a button. The reluctant Snake is called in to find the device and kill the daughter, or else a slow-moving virus will kill him (sound familiar?). Of course, part of the fun of Carpenter's post-post-apocalyptic adventure is watching the side-trips that Plissken makes on the way to karmic redemption: a game of basketball with deadly consequences; a hospital populated by plastic-surgery disasters; surfing with burned-out hippie Pipeline (Peter Fonda, in a great cameo) down Wilshire Boulevard; and an aerial assault on a theme park converted to a rebellious rendezvous point, among others. The cast is populated by game character actors like Stacy Keach, Fonda, Robertson, Steve Buscemi, Bruce Campbell, and Pam Grier (as a transsexual who once ran with Snake), who play the material with the right amount of straightness and tongue-in-cheek satire (the film never dives into the ridiculous silliness of a Michael Bay-styled action flick). And while the film contains a few fleeting instances of bad early CGI, one must admire Carpenter's adherence to practical effects and stunt work; there are some matte paintings that brilliantly portray an epically burned-out Los Angeles. Bottom line: ""Escape from L.A."" is a more-than-worthy follow-up to ""Escape from New York,""--intelligent, bitingly satirical, and action-packed.",Escape from L.A.

I think this is one of John Carpenter's best films, and I think it's a large step up from Escape from New York.In my review for the first cinematic adventure of Snake Plissken I wrote that it was hampered by extreme budgetary constraints and some odd structural issues with its narrative, insisting that it really needed a script polish before shooting at the very least. Well, I feel like the script for Escape from L. A. is that script polish. Yes, Escape from L. A.is a beat for beat remake of Escape from New York. Snake Plissken is brought to infiltrate a city-sized prison of crazy sub-cultures in order to rescue a piece of technology held by a resident of the White House, setting up a conflict with the local warlord, meeting up with friends he lost along the way, and ultimately getting off the island to come face to face with the true nature of presidential leadership. There's even a moment where Snake is put into an impossible to survive gladiatorial gauntlet that he ends up not only surviving but getting the audience to cheer him on.But, much like how I prefer Only Angels Have Wings to Ceiling Zero, I feel like Escape from L. A. does more with the plot points in far more interesting ways.John Carpenter has dealt with a lot of crap from Hollywood. A lot. He worked his butt off for decades trying to make Hollywood happy with him so that he could raise money to make movies he wanted to make. By the late 80s, he seemed to give up on the studio system with a pair of independently financed films (an experience that lead to lawsuits with the independent company), and Carpenter returned to trying to work within the studio system in the early 90s. By 1996, presented with $50 million to make a sequel to his cult hit from the 80s about a Clint Eastwood impersonation breaking into and out of jail, Carpenter seemed to decide to just burn all of his bridges at once, making a deeply cynical satire of all of Hollywood.It wasn't just Hollywood, though. Carpenter also hated Jerry Falwell, faux-revolutionaries, and pretty much all of modernity. Escape from L. A. is a work bred from hatred of a lot of things, and it is the nadir (one might say zenith) of his nihilism and cynicism, and that, once again, is centered on Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken.The variations on this story from the earlier film is that it's not the president himself lost in the citywide prison of New York, it is the president's daughter, Utopia (A. J. Langer) lost in the citywide prison of Los Angeles. She stole a weapon from a government lab (somehow, I'm okay with this) that has the power to destroy electronic capability through satellites in orbit. It can be directed or generalized, and with threats of invasion from South and Central American countries, the president (Cliff Robertson) is determined to get it back. The president is modeled after John Carpenter's perception of Jerry Falwell, and he's president for life after predicting that earthquake that cut off Los Angeles from the mainland and a new constitutional amendment. He's a fervently Christian man who has set up a theocracy in America with morality laws that determine people's behavior with the lawbreakers being exiled to Los Angeles (or executed if they so choose).If that were the extent of the film's satirical bent, it would rub me the wrong way, but the movie goes far beyond that opening and targets seemingly everyone. The most prominent is Hollywood itself. The twisted world of post-prison Los Angeles that Snake finds himself in is a circus of exaggerated cultures that Escape from New York had only been able to hint at. Much can be said of the substandard CGI in the film (it's bad, and it looked bad in the 90s), but most of the money in the production went into this physical creation of a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. There's Cuervo Jones (Georges Corraface), the revolutionary leader in the city determined to lead the third world revolution against the theocratic America who also seduced Utopia into stealing the weapon for him and now has her as a trophy on his car (complete with a disco ball, just like the Duke of New York). There's the different roving gangs that Snake has to move around, and the centerpiece of imagination are the Surgical Failures led by the Surgeon General of Beverly Hills (Bruce Campbell).One example of how L. A. does it better than New York are the comparable characters of Taslima (Valeria Golino) in the later film and the girl in the Chock Full o' Nuts (Season Hubley) in the earlier film. The girl in New York shows up very briefly, begging Snake to get her out of the city, before she's taken into a hole in the ground and disappears completely from the film. In Taslima, the later film actually takes some time to build the smallest of connections with Snake. He helps her escape the clutches of the Surgical Failures, and she even offers up a bit of backstory as she tries to help Snake in his mission. When she dies, Snake has this twinge of guilt as he holds her dead body. This moment does a fair bit for Snake's character, making him more than just a walking body of cynicism that hates everyone. He was in the opening stages of making a real connection with someone before she dies, and the brief moment shows us Snake is capable of more but also that his cynicism is a level of protection. It goes a good way of personalizing the cynicism of the movie as a whole and a way out for Snake. He could find people, good people, in the world to connect with, but the world is so messed up that it becomes impossible.Another example of how I find more favor with L. A. than New York is the feat of strength. In New York, it was a somewhat awkward battle between an injured Snake and an opponent that probably should have overpowered him easily. Here, it's Snake on a basketball court pulling off an impossible feat of scoring ten points on a ten second shot clock. It's also completely ridiculous in a way that I find affectionate. And the scene ends with another improvement on the central idea by, instead of having the Duke of New York scurry away all of a sudden without resolving the Snake problem, Cuervo Jones trying to snipe Snake despite Snake winning. Cuervo is no pure alternative to the theocratic president. He's an awful person, not dedicated to his ideals but only his quest for power. With Utopia by his side suddenly seeing this terrible side of him she ends up functioning as a continuation of Taslima. Snake lets her go when he probably shouldn't, considering his orders.There are still two moments where Snake gets rescued randomly, but they end up playing better even if they probably still feel too convenient. The first is when he gets picked up by Map to the Stars Eddie (Steve Buscemi) after Snake loses Cuervo for the first time. The second time is after the basketball feat when he gets lost in the sewers, coming out miraculously right next to Peter Fonda's Pipeline, ready with two surf boards and the incoming giant wave that's going to ride right next to Map to the Stars Eddie's car driving on the road next to it. It's a bit much, but the absolute gal of the film to make such a ludicrous decision is one reason I love the movie. So, yeah, the construction maintains some of my issues with the first film, but the execution is so balls to the wall out there that I admire it at the same time.The movie embraces ridiculousness more and more as it heads towards its conclusion with Snake meeting up with Pam Grier's Carjack to get some gliders and fly to Cuervo Jones' embarkation point for the invasion of the United States where they fight from the air, steal a helicopter, and only Snake and Utopia end up making it back to the mainland.I love this movie up to this point. It's crazy and fun, but the ending is something else. This is John Carpenter raising his middle finger to the whole world and saying, ""Screw you all."" This is Carpenter taking out all of his anger out on everyone he can in a movie. Russell, apparently, actually came up with the idea for the ending (getting his sole writing credit in his long career), but it was Carpenter who loved it, approved it, filmed it, and edited it in. Snake takes the EMP weapon and does the only thing someone who hated everything would do. He's sick of everyone's bull, and he's going to take out his anger out on the whole world. Is this a healthy worldview? Probably not. However, I love it as an ending. It's the sort of nihilism that you don't see in large productions for good reason. It doesn't sell well. People don't want to see it. I'm fine if they don't want to see it, but I like seeing it from time to time.I love this movie completely. At the same time I get why it doesn't play well with most audiences. It's big and brazen in a certain kind of silliness while being completely and thoroughly nihilistic and cynical at a level that many people find unpleasant. I don't, though. This movie works at a level that I really appreciate, and I think it's massively misunderstood and underappreciated. It's one of my favorite movies Carpenter ever made.",Escape from L.A.
55,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Escape from L.A. (1996),5,29 December 2011,"More of a remake than a sequel. This has Snake going into LA (now a prison) to retrieve something for the president. He's blackmailed into it, he gets into a fight, has one of his legs injured etc. etc. It's too similar to be really enjoyable, but there are some nice moments. The plastic surgery people were comical, grotesque, and a dig at the world of Hollywood. This is what the film could have used more of. Satirical wit would have elevated it into a whole new ballpark, as such an absurd premise is perfect for looking at the world in its current state. The effects are so terrible that they add to the charm. See Russell and Fonda surf with the poor CGI. Picks up towards the end, but you may as well watch Escape from New York.",Escape from L.A.
56,RainDogJr,Escape from New York: Deluxe,8,23 December 2007,"In the year 2000, Los Angeles suffers an earthquake; that cause it separation from the mainland. Now L.A. is not more part of the US and is a like a prison just for the people that don't accept the new ""moral"" laws. In 2013, Cuervo (a terrorist from L.A.) steals from the president's daughter a doomsday device so the new mission of ""Snake"" is to bring back that device and kill Utopia (president's daughter). To force ""Snake"" to do the mission, they plant in him a virus so he must return in 9 hours to get the cure.If we take a fast look into the plot of this film, it looks like ""Escape from New York"". Mostly is the same but in this film we have a great critic to the US, maybe that's why this film wasn't a commercial success. I mean, the thing that the government did in the film to L.A. is like a critic to the racism that exist in the US. Also the dialog of the ""land of the free"" is great. And also in this film ""Snake"" most deal with a problem that involves all the human race and that can change the future of the world so things like that saves the plot of ""Escape from L.A.""The cast is great, Kurt Russell is great like in the first one; is always cool to see Steve Buscemi and in this film is great. Also the cameos of Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, Bruce Campbell and Isaac Hayes (uncredited) are great.So this film is like ""Escape from New York: Deluxe"", since the budget ($7,000,000 to $50,000,000), the magnitude of the problem in the plot and of course the expectation of all the fans of the first one.For me this is a very good film that was really misunderstood when it was released and that have a cult following but there will be always the magic of the original in which Carpenter creates an environment that is not easy to recreate and in my opinion is one of the best environments in sci-fi/action films ever. Conclusion: if i have to choose between the two ""Escape from..."" films, i will always choose New York but for me this is a very good film that works because of the great political and social critic and of course because of the great ""Snake"". 7.5 out of 10PS: the end is nothing but great, in part similar to ""New York"" but in the very end with the phrase ""welcome to the human race"" is truly one of the best ends ever.",Escape from L.A.
57,Rob_Taylor,Escapism from L.A.,8,21 July 2004,"I think thats what a lot of viewers reports of this film have failed to recognise. It's pure escapism. Based around LA, how could it not be? The movie is a send up of the original Escape from New York, and played much more for laughs than the original.Personally, I like both movies and the sequel works for me becasue it offers a change of mood from the darker original. The original was an unknown quantity. Here, in EfLA, you know Plissken is not going to get killed right from the start. It's a foregone conclusion and you are left to enjoy the process of him getting from one point to another.Along that journey we get the likes of Steve Buscemi (and any film with him in is never going to be that serious) and even Bruce Campbell makes a brief appearance as The Surgeon General of Beverley Hills.It's campy and hokey, but great fun nonetheless. I've probably seen it more times than the original now, yet every time it comes on I find myself watching it again, even though I know it backwards by now.Carpenter's portrayal of a future American president as a bumbling, religious nutcase is also highly amusing, as is the society he presents where everything fun is banned. It's interesting to see (as a non-American) how more apt this description is becoming as the years go by.The ending of the movie, for me, is one of the most fitting to come out of Hollywood for a long time and really plays up to Plissken's anti-hero image. It's nice to see a hero who is likeable, yet still dark and menacing at the same time, which probably explains why I like such films as the Dirty Harry movies and Pitch Black.If you like the strong, silent hero type of movies, then this one will be right up your street, providing you don't mind the campiness of it all.",Escape from L.A.
58,PredragReviews,"""Snake is back!""",7,10 May 2016,"Yet, again another cool action sci-fi from the master of genre movies John Carpenter, although its not quite as good as the original it's still a lot of fun and certainly still stands up as a cult classic sequel, the story is pretty much the same as before accept it's L.A. that's now also been sectioned off and the whole island is now a prison, the presidents daughter with the black box has fallen into terrorist hands within the walls of L.A and only one man can save the day, Snake is captured once again and promised a full pardon for the bad things he's been doing between movies, this time around there's plenty more action and shootouts and going underwater, flying, and lots of crazy effects, some of the effects are a tad cheesy but its the mid 90's and they still look cool, the cast has a few more famous faces this time with Steve Buscemi, Valeria Golino, Pam Grier, Bruce Campbell.The costumes and sets are very good and make the dystopian feel of future L.A. completely believable and engrossing to experience. This film is a Sci-fi romp with a little gore and black humor thrown in for good measure, as only John Carpenter can deliver it. The movie itself leaves a lot to be desired. In short,if you're not a Snake fan you probably won't enjoy it.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Escape from L.A.
59,winner55,"thing fall apart, the center cannot hold...",7,28 June 2006,"This movie represents the beginning of a decline in the work of Director John Carpenter. Vampires and Ghosts of Mars were both very disappointing. When I first saw Escape from LA, I was disappointed in much the same way; but after repeated viewing it began to grow on me in a way the others never have.But let's start with the positives: The openly satirical episodes (e.g., the 'surgeon general' sequence) may at first appear just too obvious, until one realizes that much of their humor relies on Russell's dead-pan response to them. He knows the surgeon general is a loony, but he doesn't have the time to be amused, and he can't afford to be afraid. Once we get this, a lot of the comedy develops a Swiftian pointedness - even Russell's Snake Pliskin is a bit of a parody, but even if he knows (and he does) he has a job to do and can't stop for self-reflection. So the reality of post-apocalyptic LA, however absurd, must be taken at face-value, if Pliskin is to do his job and survive.Once that is accepted, than we can also recognize that we have a host of really charismatic actors here, who all make their rather disreputable characters not only believable (given the situation), but even almost likable.And certainly, the action sequences, which are clearly intended to be slightly less than credible (what, you thought the surfing sequence was to be taken seriously? i think not), are so over the top as to not only exciting but amusing.Very well; now we need to address what does not work in this film, because the same problems show up in the later Carpenter films as well.The most important problem has to do with narrative construction. Prior to EFLA, Carpenter's strongest ability was to develop a story in such a manner as the audience was left with the sense that not an episode could be cut - what didn't actually move the story still further enhanced the theme. But there are episodes in this film that don't actually seem to be doing anything, even when they are amusing in and of themselves; the 'surgeon general' sequence is a case in point. Once I got the humor of this episode, I then had to find a place for it in the story as a whole, and discovered that I couldn't. Take this scene out, and not a thing about the rest of the movie is altered.Most of what I am referring to here is not on as large a scale as the 'surgeon general' episode; but there are just too many useless bits and pieces cluttering up this movie.Which brings me to a larger issue. When this sort of thing happens, and a film begins to feel over-long because of extraneous material, it means only one thing - self-indulgence. It means the director has lost the ability to view the material in an objectively critical manner. If an idea occurs and the resources are available, it goes down on film and gets shipped to theaters.While a couple directors have actually turned this temptation into a virtue - even a life's work, as with John Waters - self-indulgence is really a director's vice, and the cause of a loss of creativity and of the ability to communicate with one's audience - Think Costner and Waterworld, or Spielberg and 1941; think Cimino and Heaven's Gate. Audiences don't want to see every idea a director has; we only want to see 'just enough' - possibly even less.One more really big problem with this film, that darkens even further carpenter's later work: Although the politics of this film are openly libertarian, which has both positive and negative statements to make about contemporary America , what's disturbing is the development of a real paranoia coupled with a profound pessimism. Mixing paranoia and pessimism is like slugging a fifth of gin to wash down a jar full of sedatives - a real downer. And I freely admit that I am alternately paranoid and pessimistic - but it's the alternation of these attitudes that keeps me cheerful. With Carpenter's later films, I'm afraid they come bound together. If the universe is really as bad as we see it in Vampires and Ghosts of Mars - quick, gimme the sedatives and gin, let's get it over with.Well, if it weren't for Buscema and Russell, EFLA would be just as dark. But Buscema adds a touch of dumb capitalist optimism, and Russel a touch of savvy survival ism (as well as his dead-pan response to the absurd), to the extent that we can overlook how terribly bleak this world has become for Carpenter. And setting aside that dark view is what we need to do to appreciate the comedy, and thus stunts, that actually make the film worth viewing.",Escape from L.A.
60,Gislef,Corny and Cheesy don't equal Good,3,1 October 1998,"Yes, I realized the movie is supposed to be corny.  But...so what?  That still doesn't make it very interesting to watch.  It's such an imagination-poor re-make of the original that one wonders why Carpenter bothered with this, when he could be out making a decent Halloween sequel (as opposed to what we got in H20, but that's another story...).  There's a few variations:  Stacey Keech has none of the muted respect that Van Cleef had for Snake in the original.  But Escape from LA just goes for such blatant parody (particularly Cliff Robertson as the Republican/religious right-wing nutso) that you care very little in the end.  The movie has a bigger budget, but they should have spent it on a new plot.",Escape from L.A.
61,mentalcritic,A remake that only succeeds in showing the continuing relevance of the original,7,26 October 2004,"Escape From L.A. is one of John Carpenter's more debated works, with many writing it off as a horrible failure of a film. The essential problem is that tries to recapture the spirit of the original film, but in so doing does little to distinguish itself as an independent work. While some elements constitute an improvement upon the original, many others come up short.As usual, Carpenter's mastery of the Panavision frame works as an incredible asset to the film. It is films like this that motivated the long overdue decision to widen television standards to 1.78:1 - there should be a law against cropping films such as this to fit the old shape of television. Add to that one of Carpenter's best scores, and you already have two solid ingredients for a masterpiece. Oddly enough, however, Carpenter elected to add pieces of contemporary music to the film. One wonders if the extra money offered by record companies helped complete the film in the manner Carpenter wanted.The cast is also more solid in this outing. Steve Buscemi, Georges Corraface, Stacy Keach, Michelle Forbes, Pam Grier, and Peter Fonda all deliver enthusiastic performances that keep up the entertainment factor. The problem is that in contrast to the setting and theme of the film, they seem so bright and bubbly that one could accuse them of overacting. While the plot is especially relevant, and takes many a well-deserved pot shot at the anti-choice mentality that is killing democracy, the ending feels overextended and poorly thought-out. The repetitive no-it's-in-her-pocket/his-coat business really distracted. The first moment when we are told that the Plutoxin 7 virus is not actually lethal is a childish device of plot convenience. When they repeat the point, it is just insulting.What I fail to understand, however, is why people knock this film so much. Granted, it isn't the innovation that Escape From New York or Halloween were, but compared to garbage sequels like Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it may as well be. Some sequences, such as the basketball game or the attack upon the final rebel gathering are excellent examples of how great a film can be when it applies a little imagination or creativity. The fact that the characters Snake runs into during this mission have more distinctive characteristics helps a lot, too.I gave Escape From L.A. a seven out of ten. Given that it is enjoyable when watched every so often, I think that's more than fair. It's not the most brilliant thing you'll ever watch, but it's not nearly as bad as the IMDb consensus seems to be making out.",Escape from L.A.
62,ODDBear,Snake STILL kicks ass!,7,13 June 2005,"Snake is back, this time LA is his playground. Sent by the president himself to the island of Los Angeles to retrieve a CD and save the world in the process. Sound familiar? More like a remake of Escape From New York than a sequel. But still, if you like the original there's practically no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this film as well. While the original can hardly be considered a classic it was a hugely enjoyable B-movie. It was highly original and with an irresistible appeal to it, ""the John Carpenter feel"" as I like to call it. Escape From LA works only as a complete reminder of the first film. The plot is almost the same, some scenes nearly identical and the ending, well, cd or a tape, it's pretty much the same conclusion. That said, Escape From LA is highly entertaining. Kurt Russell is a total bad ass as Snake, one of the coolest Anti-heroes around. The action scenes are good and plenty and the cool music from the original is also present here, albeit a little altered.John Carpenter doesn't make bad movies, sometimes he falters a bit (Vampires, Ghosts of Mars, Invisible Man), but they're never boring. His lesser efforts are always at least watchable. Escape From LA is a very watchable, totally brainless yarn in the best B-Movie tradition.",Escape from L.A.
63,phubbs,Escape from L.A.,5,10 November 2013,"So the first film was set in the distant future of 1997. In this sequel a massive earthquake hits LA and practically wipes it out in the distant future of the year 2000. And now in the present day of the year 2013 Snake Plissken is brought back to once again rescue the USA. I just find it amusing how these now old films are out of date with their distant future dates. Also on a personal note it sorta affects the films impact for me, dunno why, I guess it doesn't hold the same futuristic feel obviously.Snake is back! he's still bad, he's all in black and grunts more than ever (did he really need that heavy full length trench coat?! oh wait...it was for the coolness factor wasn't it). Was this specific adventure required? no not really, the plot is exactly the same as the first film, swap a President for a black box. I think the problem here was everyone wanted to see more from Snake and we all knew damn well it had to go down the same route really. I mean sure we could see any kind of action thriller with Snake but it had to have that same kind of lingering dread, the same countdown threat for Snake to feed off. In that sense the film works well and does offer another nice apocalyptic atmosphere.Yet despite Snakes awesomeness we all know how badly this film turned out. I think the main issue was the fact the film simply plods along from one set piece to another like a video game, accept the plot in between is very thin. It also comes across very obviously that Carpenter wanted to include as many extreme sports/situations for Snake as possible with no real reason for them, just to boost the coolness levels. We see Snake surfing on a tidal wave!, hang gliding whilst using a sub machine gun, riding a motorbike (although admittedly that was uber cool), playing basketball like a pro etc...Like many sequels/reboots/remakes Carpenter makes the classic mistake of going totally totally overboard with everything when he didn't need to. The first film didn't have all these extravagant set pieces, it was just Snake being the epitome of a badass in that epic Clint Eastwood/man with no name kind of way.From the very beginning the film just follows the first film too closely. Plus the initial narration makes little sense, the President seems to know about the pending quake yet no one else does? no one does anything? It conveniently leaves LA as an island...like the President said it would? wut? how did he know?? Why didn't they just create their own area for the unwanted instead of waiting for a quake which may or may not do what they were waiting for?...or so it seemed.The other main poke in the eye was the absolutely horrific CGI and bluescreen work all the way through the film. I saw the film when it was first released in the cinema and I do recall thinking even back then it looked a bit hokey, of course at the time it was fine but looking back now its dreadful! The sequences of CGI look amateurish at best, the underwater sub sequence is bordering on the kind of B- movie trashy CGI you'd expect from The Asylum...if not worse. Lets not talk about that hideous Universal Studios homage with the 'Jaws' appearance. Coupled with that you then have some awful bluescreen work throughout which just sticks out like a big red sore thumb. The casting in the film is good, again don't get me wrong not everything was bad, but it just wasn't utilised correctly. Did we need government men being all gruff like Van Cleef from the first film? Bruce Campbell and his plastic surgery nightmares were a good touch but all too brief and again highly campy, Pam Grier is in the dictionary under cult movie star but her role here is just plain lame and not fully realised, Fonda's character is pointless and the main bad guy Cuervo was like an old campy Bond villain...plus he has been clearly modelled after Guevara. It really is such a shame as everyone wanted more Plissken badassery and this film was like a bit of an insult really. There are some nice touches dotted around don't get me wrong, Snake on the bike was cool, seeing an old Snake was cool, the brief showdown with Bangkok rules was nice errr...I'm struggling. Carpenter pretty much rehashed everything from the first film but made it more campy, the grittiness was gone and replaced with lame characters from a panto. Name of the game...campy.Its a strange mix really, a blend of top ice cool imagery and quips alongside watered down camp hijinx, with a small small smattering of blood. The film seems to be almost parodying the genre yet at the same time going along with it and trying to be semi serious. Myself I do like it to a degree mainly because of Snake but I just wish there was another chance to make up for this damp entry. The film does end with a good setup for 'Escape the Earth' or maybe how about some Snake Chronicles? we need to see Snake once more before its too late (and no new casting with reboots thank you very much).5/10",Escape from L.A.

66,ivo-cobra8,A Science Fiction/Action bad ass underrated worthy sequel,8,15 October 2015,"Escape from L.A. (1996) American science fiction action film co-written, co-scored, and directed by John Carpenter, co-written and produced by Debra Hill and Kurt Russell, with Russell also starring as Snake Plissken. A sequel of Escape from New York, Escape from L.A. co-stars Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Bruce Campbell, and Pam Grier.You may have escaped from New York, but this is L.A.A Classic Science Fiction/Action underrated film. A sequel 16 years after the original was released Kurt Russell proved that he can still act. And he Is still Snake Plissken. I know a lot of people hate this sequel to an original classic film Escape From New York (1981) even my friend does not like it. I love it, I thought is the last good action sequel that Kurt Russell did. Still predecessor Is far superior than this film but I still love it. Because of Kurt Russell and his performance, Stacy Keach Is also good in it. Snake on a surf board is awesome. Escape from L.A. is a bad ass underrated sequel. I love it and I don't care what anyone else is saying it. ""Draw."" His best line.After sixteen years, Snake Plissken is back. A long overdue vacation if you ask me.Escape from L.A. starts off with the new America. After a devastating earthquake, L.A. is now an island on the coast of America. After a new president takes over, L.A. becomes a deportation point to ""take out the trash"". However, after being apprehended, Snake is forced to go to L.A. The setup beforehand is nice. The interaction with Snake and the local authorities is good stuff. Snake has his mission. The look of the new L.A. is quite something. The land is destroyed, the chaos is frequent, and the locals are quite lethal and always watching their backs. Makes sense. This is not going to be easy.Kurt Russell is great as Snake. He admits that Snake is one of his favorite characters to play. He had fun here. The plot works. Would make perfect sense if this did happen. Cliff Robertson is cold and calculating as the president. The action is fun. The look of the movie is perfect. L.A. looked like a wasteland. Be on the lookout for an appearance by Bruce Campbell. He has a small, but memorable role here.The plot Snake Plissken is once again called in by the United States government to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported.Escape From L.A. isn't the greatest sequel ever made but it is my favorite follow up to a cult classic film Escape From New York (1981) but it is a still a good sequel cause the action scenes are kind of good. I love Action films and this is an Action film and I don't care about the haters of this film. In my opinion is the last good Action film from the 90's. So leave this film alone if you have high expectations. It is my second favorite and best film of Kurt Russell the first one will always be Escape From New York (1981). Escape From L.A. (1996) is very hated and underrated movie, Even my friend did not like this movie I always did and do and I have watch it when I was 13.years old. First I thought it was Escape From New York (1981) but I was surprised to learn that it was a sequel. I haven't saw both of the movies in years until a week a ago I got both of the movies on Blu-ray and after re watching Escape From L.A. (1996) I was stunned from action scenes and how the film was entertaining and fun to watch. The only thing I had the problem with the movie Is that It was a hoax's and he never was infected with deadly virus they screwed him over and that really angered me.Escape From L.A. (1996) is very good underrated hated film from the 90's. Even you can see Hollywood in flames in this movie the same scene was used in Demolition Man (1993) In the beginning of that movie. I like action movies from the 90's and I really like a lot Escape From L.A. (1996) not much as I Love Escape From New York (1981).8/10 Grade: B Paramount Pictures, Rysher Entertainment Starring: Kurt Russell, Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Bruce Campbell, and Pam Grier.

67,FilmOtaku,Plissken is back!....Unfortunately,1,19 September 2003,"While Escape from NY was not a fine example of cinematic artistry, I can certainly appreciate its place in cult film history.  Having said that however, that should not automatically give license for a sequel to be made. A friend of mine had mentioned that he had seen this film and that it was so outrageously bad that I had to see it.  Not one to turn down outrageously bad films (unless they feature the likes of Meg Ryan or J. Lo) I was still leery of watching it.  The result?  An unholy need to cleanse my retinas via blowtorch.  What made this a bad film?  Oh, let me count the ways:  Let's see, there was Kurt Russell, having brushed the mothballs off of his Snake Plissken costume, who gave a great performance in the vein of his roles as Captain Ron and Gabe' Cash.  I absolutely could not get enough of his mumbled lines, his catch phrase of `You got a smoke' and his general joie de vivre.  There was Pam Grier, playing an Amazonian woman who inexplicably has a voice lower than the joker who sings for Crash Test Dummies.  Rounding out our featured relics from the 70's was Peter Fonda who played the wafer thin surf dude. And speaking of surfing, let's not forget the not-so-special effects that included the shockingly bad surfing scene in which we see Fonda and Russell badly outlined against a blue screen, surfing a wave along an L.A. highway.  This film was released in 1996, the same year as Fargo, Big Night and Trainspotting.  It is both absurd and abjectly sorrowful that someone would have actually walked up to a multiplex box office, possibly looked at these posters on the wall and still said, `Here's my 6.50 for Escape from L.A.'  I am beyond even imagining that this film was meant to be campy.  This film is so beyond reproach that it's very existence is an insult to anyone who has ever attempted to make a film, anyone who is a student or lover of film or anyone who has even seen a film.  *Any* film. I've seen the work of Jon Waters.  I've seen the films of Ed Wood.  Pink Flamingos and Bride of the Monster are like Citizen Kane and Taxi Driver compared to this tripe.  I wouldn't even suggest this movie be watched on a bet.  In fact, I am so disgusted with myself for spending this much time and effort on this review that I have an uncontrollable desire to either shower so I can towel off the memories or gouge my eyes out in a fit of ancient Grecian angst.  My suggestion to the developers of the sequel to The Ring? Feature this movie as the next `death tape.'  At least that way we as an audience will understand why these saps are dying.  --Shelly",Escape from L.A.
68,roedyg,Hopelessly Inept,2,3 July 2006,"This is the movie George Miller (Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome) might have made in kindergarten.It had an intriguing premise, and fell completely apart in execution.It was trite, boring and lame. The violence was as silly and chaotic as Monty Python's women's club reenacting WW II in a football field, in drag.Kurt Russell's Snake character was so one-dimensional it could equally well have been played by a Chatty Cathy action figure.The special effects looked like something out of a primary school play.The only character you have any sympathy for, a Muslim woman exiled for her religion, dies in the first reel. You don't care if someone decapitates Snake, or the president's daughter, or the president. _Everybody_ in this movie is obnoxious. You don't even care if the whole world blows up if all it contains are the greedy, loud-mouth, losers that populate this film.I give the writers credit for an emotionally satisfying ending to a movie without heroes.",Escape from L.A.
69,redkiwi,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,11 April 2000,"A sequel to escape from New York will just be more of the same, pointless mindless violence for the sake of it.Or so you'd think.  This was actually surprisingly fun, as Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken had far more dialogue, and got to deliver some excellent lines as the character as a whole was developed all round.There were some good action scenes, but the star as ever was Steve Buscemi in a role that only he can play in this way, as the ""agent"" for the Shining Path leader who is attempting to hold the USA to ransom.Worth seeing definitely.",Escape from L.A.
70,Bogmeister,Snake slithers into a Silly L.A.,7,14 January 2006,"We are not really meant to take much of this seriously. This comes across as almost a parody of the much earlier ""Escape From New York"" of '81. It's intentional, because the locale has switched to Los Angeles from New York City. Where New York is gritty, L.A. is just silly. NYC is dark; L.A. is light - you get the idea. At least, L.A. appears to have been co-opted by all the silly elements known for the area: plastic surgery, wave surfing, vapid residents and so on. There are some nice wave / quake FX in the prologue, explaining how L.A. is now an island. Then Carpenter moves into full dark satire mode, introducing a deranged religious fundamentalist obsessive (Robertson) as the President of the USA (Carpenter seems most comfortable taking potshots at the Presidency, even though this was during the Clinton era). The film pretty much duplicates the plot of the earlier film; in this case, top cop Keach substitutes for the van Cleef character. Snake (Russell) is drafted once again into a 'mission impossible' journey, looking angry during the whole thing.Once again, Snake encounters weird natives in a land which, though technically part of the U.S., seems to be on another planet (actually, we learn the crazy Prez did strike L.A. off the U.S.map). L.A. is anarchy, with everyone doing whatever they're into, usually weird stuff. We're back to the premise of what strange thing will Snake see next? But, though there is dangerous gang activity, as in the previous film, I'm surprised even the grim Snake didn't break into a grin or even start laughing at some of the ludicrous elements he encounters. You keep picturing his thought processes, such as 'you gotta be kidding me,' for most of the film. The entertainment value is there - especially for fans of the darker ""Escape From New York."" At least they have the Snake character back for one more outing, even if in an 'Escape-lite' version. When we get to the execution-style basketball challenge, replacing the standard arena of the 1st film, I was ready to think 'ok, this is too much' - this crosses the line for silliness. But, I admit, that's probably the one scene I look forward to seeing again in re-viewing the picture. I also admit I like the finale - it's pure nihilistic Carpenter / Plissken.",Escape from L.A.
71,Peach-2,"Good idea, terrible outcome.",5,29 November 1998,"When I heard they were making a sequel to one of my favorite films I was excited to say the least. When I heard that the same creative team was behind the sequel that was behind the original I couldn't wait. When the movie finally came to theaters I was there first. After viewing the film all I could think about was ""what went wrong."" This movie is bad. I'll give them a little for effort, but John Carpenter should have done more with this one.",Escape from L.A.
72,stevelomas-69401,Inexcusable garbage,4,4 March 2019,"What was Carpenter up to? Effects, script, cinematography and acting are all sub par in a pointlessly deritive load of nonesense.",Escape from L.A.
73,dr_foreman,Can't touch the original...,3,27 June 2007,"""Escape from New York"" is by no means a classic film, but it's memorably dark, seedy, suspenseful and even funny. You might call it a worthy cult favorite. Alas, ""Escape from L.A."" is not nearly as memorable - in fact, it plays out like a tired remake of its far more amusing predecessor.Both films have essentially the same premise; corrupt government officials send criminal tough guy ""Snake"" Plissken to infiltrate the ruins of a once-great city and retrieve some MacGuffin for them. In both films, Snake is reluctant to cooperate, but the government secures his compliance by threatening his life. So, Snake duly treks off to an urban wasteland, wasting thugs and meeting a variety of wacky characters on his way to completing his desperate mission.Because the two films are so similar, I find ""Escape from L.A."" tedious - it simply doesn't break enough new ground. And, to make matters worse, this tepid sequel does everything worse than the original movie. The villain is inferior, the president is inferior, and even the special effects are inferior (note the positively laughable CGI when Snake pilots his submarine to L.A.; the approach to New York in the first film is infinitely classier.) And, though both films are comedies (of a sort), I find that the jokes in the first are simply better. In ""L.A.,"" there are some attempts at social satire, but by and large they don't work. For instance, the much-praised ""plastic surgery"" segment feels really isolated and pointless to me. It's a one-joke sequence that goes nowhere and contributes nothing to the plot. Ultimately, I think the first film has the edge in the comedy department because it was co-written by Nick Castle, who reportedly lightened up the script and was quite a wit in general (though Castle is credited on this movie, I believe it's only because he wrote the original film.) Perhaps the crowning aggravation of ""Escape from L.A."" is its exceedingly preachy social commentary. Now, I happen to be fairly liberal, so I agree with some of this film's criticisms of the religious right - but I also find the presentation of these criticisms to be superficial, condescending, and obnoxious. To be perfectly blunt, this movie is not literate enough to have serious political aims. It's just too silly and in-your-face; it doesn't have the subtlety to work as a satire, and it certainly lacks balance. Suffice to say, if you're conservative, this movie will annoy you, and even if you're an open-minded liberal, it will probably still annoy you by representing your views so poorly.Yeah, this is basically a dud, though I sort of enjoy the Luddite-like sentiments in the concluding scenes. It's got some good cameos, a few decent scenes, but in the end...it just ain't the original. What a waste of 50 million bucks!",Escape from L.A.
74,LebowskiT1000,Slightly better with a second viewing.,8,10 February 2003,"I remember seeing this film a few years back and really didn't like it, although I did like ""Escape From New York"".  Not too long ago I watched ""Escape From New York"" and then after watching it I thought I'd give the sequel a second chance.  After watching it again and having super low expectations I have to say it wasn't as bad as I remembered.  Granted, it still has some MAJOR flaws in the film, due to John Carpenter in my opinion (not a fan of his work, as you can tell from my other reviews of his films).This film really could have been great, without too much work and editing. First of all get rid of the stupid Surgeon General of Beverly Hills character...in fact get rid of the entire scene (Bruce Campbell, I love your work, but I'm sorry, you've got go).  Secondly, get rid of Peter Fonda's character and any scene involving surfing within the film.  Next, axe Pam Grier's character, or at least give her a character overhaul and rethink the whole transsexual thing...pretty dumb!  And lastly, make a few minor adjustments here and there on various things and you've got yourself a pretty decent movie.I remember being less than impressed with the film's special effects when I first saw it.  With this second viewing of the film, I found them to be much better than I remembered as well, or at least tolerable.  Sometimes they were really good, and other times not so much, but in most cases, good enough for the film.All in all, I couldn't in good conscience say this was as good as the previous installment, but it had some good things going for it. Surprisingly enough, I liked the story in the film quite a bit, it was rather interesting and quite original.I did like seeing Steve Buscemi and Bruce Campbell in the film, even though Bruce's character was just god-awful.  Steve was a pleasant surprise though. Kurt Russell did a fine job in the role of Snake Plisken, even though I don't care for his whisper-voice in this film.  Pam Grier and Peter Fonda both did fine jobs acting, but their characters are less than great.  A.J. Langer was the only cast member I was truly impressed with, not really because of acting skill (although she isn't bad), but because she is quite the looker.  I'll be keeping a watchful eye for her future work.  The rest of the cast was ok, but nothing worth mentioning.I must say that the soundtrack/score in this film is FAR better than the atrocious music in ""Escape from New York"".  ...And the end credits song, White Zombie's ""The One"", is probably one of my favorite White Zombie songs to date.I don't think I would go around recommending this film to everyone, but if you are a fan of John Carpenter, then go ahead and check it out.  Why someone would be a fan of his work is beyond me though.  I would definitely recommend seeing ""Escape From New York"" first though, and if you like that one, then go ahead an give this a shot, but remember...low expectations.  I hope you enjoy the film...and if not, perhaps you should give it a second chance, someday down the road.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Escape from L.A.
75,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Escape from L.A. (1996),6,14 August 2005,"Kurt Russell partners up again with John Carpenter to bring back to the screen one of my favorite film antiheroesSnake Plissken. He's half John Wayne and half Man with No Name but pure Snake. Sixteen years after his infamous and daring rescue of the then president from the penal island of New York Plissken is once again suckered into service for his country with the promise of a nasty viral death. The new president (Cliff Robertson) has some domestic issues he would like Snake to help out with, namely retrieving a suitcase containing the controls to the most dangerous weapon conceived. The weapon was stolen by his daughter and delivered to a terrorist who has set up shop on the penal island of L.A. Snake must retrieve the weapon and tie up the president's loose ends before the US gets invaded.I'm very fond of ""J.C.'s: Escape from New York"" and was very excited to learn of a sequel being released. Sadly ""Escape from L.A."" didn't live up to my expectations. The script is so unabashedly hokey it becomes laughable. Outlandish set-pieces follow at regular intervals trying to outdo the previous ones and only succeed in making the viewer role their eyes. Long gone is the low-tech down-and-dirty original and out came the big budget action bonanza with some of the worst CGI scenes of the modern age (some would have looked cool in ""The Last Starfighter""). What we basically are given is a remake with very little of the original's charm. Russell's Snake still has his venom but some of the dialogue he is forced to spit out pretty crazy. One of the few highlights of the film are the wide array of actors that pop up (Bruce Campbell , Pam Grier , Stacy Keach , Peter Fonda and Steve Buscemi to name a few) who pop up at regular intervals. The music score is also an updating of sorts but this time you get the prerequisite metal and rock soundtrack for commercial purposes. It is safe to say I was very disappointed with the end result. I do like ""L.A."" in a bad movie gone horribly wrong fashion but it really could have been a lot better.",Escape from L.A.
76,thekingsdom,Good old cheesy fun,7,25 August 2018,Hehe..this is so cheesy it's great. Loved every cheesy minute of it!,Escape from L.A.
77,markovd111,Turn off your brain and enjoy!,7,26 December 2020,"Outdated effects, over the top action and cheesy main character, ""Escape from L.A."" feels like what I expected from the first movie, but done in a worse way. It often feels almost exactly like the first movie, but less serious and atmospheric (not that the movie lacks atmosphere, it's just that it's less dreadful and tense than the one in the first movie). Still, it's a movie where you can see Kurt Russell's character surf on a terrible CGI wave. Then he jumps from the board to the car driven by Steve Buscemi's character and slams his head into the steering wheel. It's dumb and looks bad, but it's a blast of fun if you like stuff like this. Oh, and the ending is phenomenal, just like the one from the first movie. So, yeah. 7/10 from me! Don't go in looking for a good movie. Go in expecting a cheesy action move from the 90-s and you won't be disappointed!",Escape from L.A.
78,rocknrelics,No classic but great fun!!,7,25 May 2020,"Hugely enjoyable film, sure it's cheesy,and some of the effects are woeful, but does its running time fly by? Absolutely! I guess I can see why it was somewhat out of place when it was released in '96, as it really feels like more of an 80's movie than a 90's one. If you're looking for a beer and popcorn movie, leave your brain at the door, and watch this! Great blu ray transfer too.",Escape from L.A.
79,chrisbrown6453,"I guess that the director insisted on attaching his name to the title so we wouldn't confuse John Carpenter's Escape from L.A. from, say, Woody Allen's Escape from L.A.",6,20 July 2001,"This futuristic, action-packed adventure is dark and cartoony, but it provides a few good laughs here and there. It has been 15 years or so since Plissken (""call me Snake"") escaped from New York. If you thought that the Big Apple was a hellhole, wait until you see the Big Orange. A massive 9.8 earthquake (finally the Big One?) has separated Los Angeles from the rest of California making it an island. Orange County to Malibu is now the dumping ground for all the undesirables as defined by the militantly puritanical US Government. Sunset Boulevard hasn't changed much. It is lined with hookers, and one looks suspiciously like Divine Brown. The Beverly Hills Hotel is pretty run-down now and is a haven for those who've had too many face-lifts and those who are looking for other replacement body parts. So what else is new? Motor-mouthed agents like Map To The Stars Eddie (Steve Buscemi) still try the fast-talk routine, though the entertainment business is a thing of the past. Wildfires burn out of control around the landmark Hollywood sign. Snake has come to town, against his will, to recover a little black box that can control the world. The villain in charge of LA island is named Cuervo, a Latin strongman who looks like a youngish Castro. Before it's over, Cuervo will force Snake to play hoops for his life in the LA Coliseum. With a firing squad waiting for him to miss the basket, ""shot clock"" takes on a whole new meaning. Snake also meets up with an aging surfer (Peter Fonda) whose favorite word is ""tsunami."" Together, they get to hang ten on a well-timed wave down Laurel Canyon. Not quite totally awesome due to some rather horrible special effects. There are also fun times with a transsexual gang leader named Hershe (Pam Grier, sounding like RuPaul with a chest cold, but sporting bigger hair) and Utopia, the renegade daughter of the President (Cliff Robertson), who wears black leather hot pants and thigh-high boots. She doesn't look a thing like Chelsea Clinton.This movie should be thought of as a spoof of the brilliant original Escape from N.Y. and nothing else.  I did rather enjoy the ending though.",Escape from L.A.
80,Rautus,Snake returns,10,3 June 2007,"I really enjoyed John Carpenter's Escape from New York so when I saw the sequel Esacpe From LA I bought it, Kurt Russel returns as Snake bringing more of a bad attitude in a even more hostel prison island that was once LA. The film sees Snake going into LA to assassinate the Presidants daughter who has gone to LA with a powerful device that can shut down any part of the Planets power source, Snake must also retrieve the weapon to the President since they injecting him with a virus similar to the charges injected into his neck in the first film.Snake encounters a couple of people along the way, some friendly and some not like the Surgeon General of Beverly Hills (Played by Bruce Campbell) and Map to the Stars Eddie (Played by Steve Buscemi). Escape From LA is a great sequel to a classic that shouldn't be missed. 10/10",Escape from L.A.
81,PyrolyticCarbon,Poor attempt at a sequel of a cult classic.,4,4 August 2000,"This is an awful cheap shot at creating a sequel to a cult classic by filming exactly the same sequences, with an almost identical script and adding a special effects set piece, which is so badly done it looks like it was created before the original. The main characters are all there, just some different actors and slightly different mannerisms. There is an amusing dig at people addicted to plastic surgery, a gang who suffer from serious sagging flesh. Unfortunately the same thing was happening to this script!The first film was written with some seriousness and a low budget, the humour and the over the top acting and plot came out a bit more subtely than the sequel. If you've read this far you'll realise that this film is not great, it's a parody of itself and a poor, poor copy of the original. Miss it, and miss a big bucket of cheese.",Escape from L.A.
82,emperor_bender,Interesting enough,7,2 September 2008,"After seeing ""Escape from New York"", I heard about the sequel, ""Escape from L.A."". I did not know what to think, but I'm glad I saw it now.Kurt Russell returns as the great Snake Plissken. And he is just as good as he is in the first movie, despite a 16 year difference. Steve Buscemi was great as Map to the Stars Eddie. I wouldn't say AJ Langer was anything special though, but she wasn't terrible. Same with Georges Corraface. Stacy Keach was good as Malloy, the Bob Hauk replacement. Pam Grier was really good as Hershe. Cliff Robertson wasn't half bad as the President, but he was no Donald Pleasance. Valeria Golino was promising as Taslima. Peter Fonda was really good as ""Pipeline"", the surfer. and Michelle Forbes was good as Brazon, Malloy's assistant.The shots of the earthquake were amazing, and the overall plot was great.However, there was some really really bad CGI in this movie that was not necessary in most parts.Besides plot holes and bad CGI, this movie was still good.7/10. Fans of the original should see this one.",Escape from L.A.
83,charchuk,Worse than the first,3,7 May 2007,"I wasn't especially fond of Escape from New York, and this one was even worse. Worse acting - save for Kurt Russell - worse script, and, amazingly, worse visuals. The submarine ride and the surfing bit are really quite terribly animated. Not even an attempt to look realistic. The story itself is such a blatant ripoff of the first that they don't even try to hide it. It's kinda enjoyable, but it's of such low-quality that it's really quite cringe-worthy at times. About the only redeeming aspects are Russell, Bruce Campbell's cameo, the production design, and the end. I thought the final showdown was quite well down. Other than that, this is a terrible movie.",Escape from L.A.
84,akshatmahajan,Entertaining as the original,6,26 July 2021,"From last few days, I have been watching John Carpenter's movie. I read alot of good things about Escape From New York and watched it. I enjoyed that movie and decided to watch this sequel even after knowing that it got less positive reviews than the original and also flopped at box office. For your info, this movie is now considered cult classic and it deserves to be.After seeing critic reviews, my expectations weren't high but I enjoyed it more than I expected. The movie was dramatic and tense. The story was the same as original. There were just a few changes, rest everything was same. Even some of the dialogues were also same. Like the original, the execution was good. The environment created in the movie was also good but this movie didn't have that much strong environment which one first created. One big complaint which I had with the movie was the special effects. They were so bad. It was looking like video games. Jurassic park which came 3 years before this movie had far far better graphics than this one. I don't understand where did the producers spent $50M?If we talk about performances, I loved Kurt Russell and others were also good. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween, The Thing and Escape From New York.Overall, the movie is good and entertaining. You will enjoy watching it except this movie did some mistakes which were not in the original.",Escape from L.A.
85,room102,Only good in comparison to an Ed Wood movie,3,21 June 2013,"The movie is almost a remake of ""Escape from New York (1981)"". The plot is almost identical, taking place in LA instead of NY. I tried to watch it as a B-movie and treat it that way. That didn't work either. Bad acting, bad blue screen effects and worst of all is the CGI - it's hard to believe this movie was made 5 years after ""Terminator 2"". The CGI looks like a concept thing made by the effects team before the actual CGI - yes, it's that bad. I thought that maybe it's due to budget constraints, so I checked IMDb and couldn't believe the budget for this movie was $50 million! That's half of the budget of ""Terminator 2"", which was the most expensive movie at the time.Perhaps worst of all is the lazy writing, which includes gems like:""Oh, you tried to shoot at us? We've thought of that and put blanks in your rifle!""""Oh, you tried to jump and attack us? We've thought of that and we're holograms!"" (only to walk by his side 2 seconds later)""This hologram is good for 8 minutes, but you can only use it once"" The ""instructors"" stand next to Snake just before he gets into the (badly-rendered) vehicle and 2 seconds later they are in the command room. A motorcycle falling on the ground is blown away. It almost feels like an Ed Wood movie. Even the slow-motion parts are done by slowing down the frames instead of shooting at high speed - how cheap can a movie get at a $50 mil budget???Even the Plastic Surgeon scene is a missed opportunity. It's an obvious commentary about the rich life of LA and it had some good potential, but it's made into a silly scene and it adds nothing to the plot.",Escape from L.A.

Okay we saw millions of sequels so why not this one, after all was Escape from New York watchable but then you have forgotten about John Carpenter. What the hell is wrong with him? He should know better being the veteran he is but not only is this is a complete copy of the original (only the decors seem different plus some stupid inventions that even wouldn't make it in James Bondscripts) plus if you don't have the budget to do special effects please don't make them at all... Just watch the scene in where Snake is ""surfing"" on the waves (such poor effects aren't even made in cheap musicvideos) or a helicopter that seems to be made of  painted plastic...come on, you aren't making movies for Teletubbies!!! Totally unnecessary sequel, even an episode from The A-Team is better!",Escape from L.A.
87,jcbutthead86,Underrated Action-Packed Sequel! Snake is Back! One Of Carpenter's Best!,10,31 May 2012,"Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance.Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen, antihero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)has been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure.I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the future,Escape From L.A has a light,campy,satirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakes,agents,gangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agents,surfers,nutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequels,mocking the clichés with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball game,you have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael Jordan,Magic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this film,with Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslinger,the villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a brown,dirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and bold,EFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence.Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snake,almost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloy,the warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopia,the President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as Brazen,Malloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a B-movie lovers dream cast.John Carpenter's direction is wonderful,moving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewer,it's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White Zombie(The One),Tool(Sweat)and Sugar Ray(Ten Seconds Down).In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Escape from L.A.
88,Trevor-Kerensky,Not the best action film but had some interesting scenes,5,19 May 2018,"As the followup to Escape From New York, I didn't pay much attention to this movie until I entered high school. I'd heard someone say it wasn't that great, but I told myself that it was just one person's opinion and it was nothing to lose sleep over. So I rented one Spring Break and watched it.Turns out it wasn't that great after all.As one of the many of my friends and acquaintances who didn't care for it, I must say I now agree. In my opinion, the special effects looked like they belonged in a video game and some of the characters felt two-dimensional. But there were some interesting scenes that held my attention, though I wouldn't say there were many. As of now, I watch some of the clips on YouTube just for the hell of it. Still, I don't think I'll watch the whole thing from start to finish again.",Escape from L.A.
89,TheMarwood,So much better than its rep,9,5 June 2014,"Escape From L.A. doesn't waste a moment of its running time. It begins with Snake already in custody and about to be shipped off to LA like garbage, when he's propositioned by the president to do a mission for a full pardon. It's a subversive satire within a very ridiculous action film. Whether in the moral US or decadent LA it's full of self important wack jobs that Snake doesn't take serious and could care less about, which is the perfect character to follow in this type of film. After the theocratic president of America orders Snake on his mission, Snake gives a snide, but honest remark ""who are you?"" Perfectly sets the tone of the film and character. Once he reaches LA we are introduced to an assortment of characters who aren't so much quirky as they are absurd and fit in wonderfully to this nonsensical world Carpenter created. Even though this much maligned sequel has been marginalized as one of the bottom of Carpenter's films, it's miles better than its reputation and consistently hilarious. It's also impossible not to notice, or mention the truly awful visual effects. Effects this terrible are clearly the case of the studio pulling the money plug on a film they probably knew was too expensive to make back a fraction of its costs - not because of incompetence. There isn't a single effect that is polished or finished, but the slapdash vfx don't detract from how much the film gets right.",Escape from L.A.
90,flicklover,"Sorry Snake, but this sequel sucks!!!",5,17 April 2021,"I have tried the couple of times that I've seen this film to like it. I just can't!!! It's definitely not horrible, and has a certain sense of humor about itself but as a sequel to a very cool cult classic like Escape From New York it fails.Even though Escape From New York may not be a cinematic masterpiece it is a well done, low budget action movie from a director that I think is a his best when he has a small budget to work with. In the first one, John Carpenter had to focus on small details and made the most of the small amount of locations tgat he had to use as New York. In this film he had more budget and makes full use of L. A. landmarks as targets to satarize. That to me is the biggest problem with Escape From L. A. The tone of this sequel.is very campy where as the original was more straight faced and intriguing. It is a virtual clone of the first film. Snake Plisskin is brought in by a new theocratic President of the United States to retrieve a weapon that can shut down power worldwide. The President's daughter stole it and Plissken needs to return it and kill her. A generic villain named Cuervo that looks like Che Guevara is pretty lame. Like in the last one, Snake in infected with a virus that will kill him, this time in 10 hours if he doesn't return the weapon. This film has more action, more sets but it us so preoccupied with skewering L. A. and Hollywood in particular that it just isn't very exciting. Kurt Russell is good as Snake again but what surrounds him is so campy and jokey that he seems out of place. Tge action scenes are only ok. The final one is kind of fun but the film is not exciting enough as an action film and not funny enough as a comedy.It has a couple clever moments but not enough.Not a good sequel to a cool cult classic.Grade: C-",Escape from L.A.
91,coconutkungfu-30704,Successful At Parodying and Paying Tribute,8,18 February 2020,"Snake Plissken returns in this well-made parody/tribute to the first film that deliberately mirrors both the plot and whole scenes from the original.Features Interesting action scenes, some funny moments and a great soundtrack.Another good Carpenter film, this one deserves an 8 out of 10",Escape from L.A.
92,bazmitch23,It's really the first movie again but with a bigger budget and bad CGI,7,13 October 2013,"Yeah, this is not as good as the first film. It's just a silly 90's action film (set in 2013!), but a fun, silly action film.Things I loved: The rock remix of the theme tune. (Even if you hate this film, you have to admit the theme tune is awesome.), Kurt is brilliant as Snake, the action sequences are great, the pacing is a lot faster than the first, it's epic, I loved the prologue and Utopia was sexy in her leather shorts and knee high boots.But the CGI is indeed horrible. Everything looks like a PlayStation game. Whereas the first movie had miniatures that still hold up to this day. The CGI in this is just laughable. The worst example is when Snake is in the submarine and it's the ocean.The surfing scene also looks fake and how is Snake able to surf properly despite having no surfing training whatsoever? And how is he able to stand up straight after getting shot in the leg?The movie's biggest flaw is that it recreates scenes from the first movie. John Carpenter can't write sequels because when he does, it's the same as the first. Halloween 2 for example.Remember that great scene in the first film where Snake had to fight the big guy in the wrestling ring? What do they make him do in this one? Make him play basketball............. Yeah.Also, he manages to get the ball into the hoop despite having no basketball training what so ever.But what about the ending? Yeah, it liked it. It's something Snake would do. Despite the fact that there could've been someone who needed an iron lung or life support machine to help them live. And Snake breaking the fourth wall just ends this epic of cheesiness.I'm a big 90's kid and I love 90's films. Every time I watch one, I just got nostalgic.",Escape from L.A.
93,ivanmessimilos,Underrated movie from Carpenter and Russell,8,24 May 2020,"Escape from L.A. came out 15 years after the first part of Escape from New York which has great reviews. A little too long to wait for a sequel, and the reason lies in the script. Although it was written a few years after the first part, Carpenter was not happy with what was written because it was too light and bright for him, so somehow the film was left aside. In 1994, a real earthquake hit Los Angeles, and that affected this film and gave them an idea. Kurt Russell certainly deserves a sequel because the role of Snake Plissken is one of his favorites in his career and he definitely wanted to embody it once again, so he wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Carpenter. Great script, if you ask me. The first and last time Russell wrote the screenplay. The first and last time that Carpenter directed the sequel.
How much Russell cared about the role is shown by how he practiced for months to regain his form and fit back into the same suit he wore in the first part, 15 years ago. Snake Plissken is one of the biggest badass you can imagine, a former World War III decorated operative, lost his left eye and wears a pirate bandage, cynical, a man of few words, uses black humor, doesn't care about anything. Like I said, one of the biggest badass you can imagine.After watching in 1981 what awaits us in 1997, the sequel from 1996 shows us the year 2013. The plot is very similar, Snake has before him an impossible mission that he must complete in a very short time.
After numerous earthquakes, Los Angeles separated from the rest and became a prison for those of the worst kind, separated by a large wall so no one could escape. Snake must reclaim the weapons of the end of the world (because he can turn off all energy sources on Earth) that is in the possession of a particular terrorist who is, of course, in the middle of Los Angeles. Yes, he was blackmailed by the government because they injected him with a virus from which he will die in 10 hours if he fails in the mission, and along the way there is the president's daughter, aptly named Utopia. If the description of the plot itself did not attract you to watch the film, then I have nothing more clever to tell you.The film, when it came out, got bad to mixed reviews, and grossed little at the box office, only half of what was invested. Some of the reactions say it is too similar to the first film, others say it is too dark and violent (almost the entire film was shot at night). Carpenter himself says this film is ten times better than the first part. Judge for yourself.Carpenter's genius is evident in some seemingly minor details, as he already knew how to do in previous films. The way he portrayed the then futuristic 2013 is almost prophetic, he created a satirical world to point out the shortcomings and mistakes of the United States. You probably can't fully notice the amount of detail on just one look.The film is also contributed by a colorful gallery of characters: Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Cliff Robertson, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda and I must certainly single out Bruce Campbell who with a smaller role raises the quality of the film by half, if not the whole rating more.The ending itself (at least to me) is one of the best endings ever, and Russel delivers one of his best one liners in his career. Certainly one of the most underrated films in the careers of Russell and Carpenter and one of my favorite post-apocalyptic films.",Escape from L.A.
94,jameselliot-1,Disappointing remake,5,2 July 2020,"An expensive remake of Escape From New York, this movie is good for Snake Plisken/Kurt Rusell fans. So many elements from the first film are used that there's no real surprises. The extortion of Snake with a virus instead of an implanted device. The urban city used as a prison for loonies, criminals and deported people. Using a sub instead of a glider to sneak in. The gadgetry and countdown watch to keep him in touch with the command center. The anti-police attitude (oddly prescient). Stacy Keach taking over for Lee Van Cleef but not as interesting. Snake getting another injury to his leg and limping again. Woman who approaches him getting murdered. The fake out ending with the president is also basically a copy of the original. The effects for 1996 are CGI cheesy.",Escape from L.A.
95,ccunning-73587,If you saw 'Escape from N.Y.' don't waste your time watching 'Escape from L.A.'... It is essentially the exact same movie.,1,26 January 2019,"So lousy on so many levels... If you saw 'Escape from New York' don't waste your time watching 'Escape from L.A.'... It is essentially the exact same movie. It is also a continuing theme out of the cesspool called hollywood, hostility and animosity towards all things Christian. Both presidents are portrayed as weak. Both LA (After an earthquake) and NY are islands surrounded by a wall and the same police with the same orders to shoot. Russell uses the exact same lines ""Call me Snake!""/""Call me Plissken!"" in the exact same order at the beginning and end of the movie. He gets shot in the leg in both (Though I do not now recall if it is the same leg!). He uses 'high tech' gear on him and to enter NY (Glider) & LA (Submarine) and he is supposed to use the same manner of travel to get out but can't because they get destroyed. Plissken goes into NY for the president who is carrying a strategic level audio tape and into LA for the president's daughter & a strategic level weapon. Everyone he befriends or uses as an ally along the way dies... The list of identical events goes on and on... Again, don't waste your time if you saw the original.

96,son_of_cheese_messiah,So-so in LA,5,12 April 2012,"The satirical elements in this work very well. The sly look at LA's cosmetic industry with future failures needing fresh injections of living flesh is a delightful concept, as is the over-the-top dig at surf culture. It is only a pity there is not more of this. There is perhaps too much dumb action however. Most of it looks good but is rather silly. This is particularly the case of the hang gliding sequence, which would have left Snake and co as sitting (flying?) ducks in reality. But I realise that this is not a film to be taken too seriously.My main beef is the framing sequence. The American President is depicted as a one-dimensional baddie capable not only of electrocuting his own daughter but summarily executing Snake in front of a world wide audience. It is unconvincing and shows Hollywood once again seems to want to depict Christians as inhuman monsters.",Escape from L.A.
97,pumaye,a really underrated movie,7,24 July 2001,"Comparing it with the first exploits of Snake Plissken, this Carpenter own's self parody of the previous box office hit is normally dismissed as a bad movie, a remake of the first one without any redeeming qualities. In fact, the movie is very good as a long ride in fun, full of splendid little in-jokes, cameo roles to fill your list for months to come, sapid sentences.

98,RogerBorg,"""Haven't I seen that in Grand Theft Auto?""",8,1 July 2008,"Is what the missus kept asking me, and the answer was frequently in the affirmative. This - not Escape from New York, at least not directly - is the film that inspired the developers of many of the 21st century's iconic software titles.Snake can be seen strutting his stuff across AAA titles on PC and console to this day, hissing out his subzero one-liners. He does the things that we now do when we've got a joypad or a mouse in our sweaty hands - pushing the boundaries of the script, testing the limits of the simulation. Supporting characters flit in and out of EfLA like stage allies, their existence entirely dependent on the demands of the narrative.Escape from Los Angeles is a flawed film in so many ways. The budget just isn't there on the screen; the score and cinematography are workaday; the characterisation is effective but necessarily truncated. And yet... and yet. The drive, the sly knowing comments, and the finale. That finale. So inevitable, so demanded by the characterisation, and yet still so satisfying.If Escape from Los Angeles isn't a tour de force, then ask yourself this: why do you keep dropping sixty dollars to play versions of it over and over again?",Escape from L.A.
99,CrassActionHero,Welcome to L.A.,7,23 October 2006,"After sixteen years, Snake Plissken is back. A long overdue vacation if you ask me.Escape from L.A. starts off with the new America. After a devastating earthquake, L.A. is now an island on the coast of America. After a new president takes over, L.A. becomes a deportation point to ""take out the trash"". However, after being apprehended, Snake is forced to go to L.A. The setup beforehand is nice. The interaction with Snake and the local authorities is good stuff. Snake has his mission.The look of the new L.A. is quite something. The land is destroyed, the chaos is frequent, and the locals are quite lethal and always watching their backs. Makes sense. This is not going to be easy.Kurt Russell is great as Snake. He admits that Snake is one of his favorite characters to play. He had fun here. The plot works. Would make perfect sense if this did happen. Cliff Robertson is cold and calculating as the president. The action is fun. The look of the movie is perfect. L.A. looked like a wasteland. Be on the lookout for an appearance by Bruce Campbell. He has a small, but memorable role here.The Last Word: Fun. Escape from L.A. is a fun ride through the bleak future. Not as dark as Escape from New York, it's a lot more lively. The humor at times has poor execution. Other times it works. The special FX is quite cool looking. Especially the underwater scenes. Good stuff. Enjoy.",Escape from L.A.
100,skullhead739,What a flop,3,28 April 2020,"This film is the sequal to the phenomenal escape from New York. But this is far from even good. The original had a budget of only 6 million whilst this has a budget of 50 million and is produced 15 years after the release of the 1981 film.Acting:
Snake plisskin instead of being someone that can say a 1000 words with one stare. Gets down right cheesy with all the BS the writers have him say. The other characters are equally just as cheesy and little to no characterization or charisma is added. You just couldn't relate or care about any of the characters.Special affects/cgi:
Holy crap this film has aged insanely bad. The CGI looks incredibly fake and insanely horrible even for the time. What's even worse is that theres so much of it in here. Every 10 minutes theres another crappy CGI render that looks like a shark boy and lava girl repeat.Story:
Somewhat of a interesting plot but let down by all I've stated so far and more. Theres lots of plot holes and things that dont make sense. One scene they are on gliders for what seems to be forever that look horrible, cheesy and clearly on cords. Everything that happens is written extremely poorly with convenient timing and events all the time. The beginning was pretty bad but interesting. The middle I lost all hope of this being a good movie. The end was okay if I didnt see it coming and hadn't been totally put off already.Summary:
This is the typical sequal where it mocks the original by losing everything that made it good. I can handle b movies but even this was too bad for me. I wouldnt reccomend watching this.",Escape from L.A.
101,JeffG.,What a disappointment.,3,6 November 1999,"""Escape From New York"" was a great movie. This sequel isn't. In fact, it's probably the most disappointing sequel since ""Highlander 2."" You'd think that with a much bigger budget and this kind of cast, Carpenter would be able to make a better film, right? Wrong.One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it's practically a remake of the original. Carpenter had the opportunity to either expand on the universe set up in the original or take things in a different direction. What's the point in doing a sequel if you're just going to copy the first film? Another problem is that every character in the movie is a stereotype. For that matter, the entire movie is really cartoonish. The first movie did really well in avoiding these traps. Granted, the original had a real comic book feel to it, but not to the extreme that this movie took. Especially heartbreaking was seeing Kurt Russell turn Snake from the anti-hero we admired in the first movie to a something of a parody.And the visuals? Well, the set designs were quite good. Even if pointing out every L.A. landmark got rather old after a while. But the special effects were so cheesy. They were more like the effects you'd see in a direct-to-video film (which is where this movie should have gone).I still like to believe that John Carpenter still has the old magic in him. And I hope one day (hoprfully soon) he'll rediscover it. It's sad to see a man of Carpenter's talents reduced to this.",Escape from L.A.
102,joshi_3592,Not bad at all!,7,6 September 2009,"Let me put it this way, Snake Plissken as a character saved this movie. I mean he's just awesome and seeing him escaping yet another prison island is just extremely fun for an each fan of ""escape from New York"". Many people have criticised this movie for being to similar to the prequel, but I say that's the point. I was amazed how they had managed to create such identical events but doing them in an entirely different fashion.The story takes place in 2013, 16 years after the events of ""escape from New york"" and the US is even more screwed up than before. L.A. was turned into an island during an earthquake in 1998, and all criminals, prostitutes, atheists, or people who simply think radically, are being dumped on the island. The president's daughter has rebelled against Americas new ways and hijacked Airforce 3 and stole the controls for a bunch of doomsday satellites (I won't tell you what they exactly do, it'll ruin the fun). She crashes in L.A. and joins a rebel faction. And of course, once again Snake Plissken has been captured and they'll offer him his freedom if he can get the control back. Now I'll stop here and let you enjoy the rest of the film.Now except from a few slightly a dumb and corny scenes (I've seen worse)this is an truly entertaining movie. Snake is as bad-ass as ever and the stakes are the same as before, his life. I really don't have any more to say, if you're an ""escape from New york"" fan or simply liked the movie, you MUST SEE this one. If not you might find it a little bit hard to understand and you'll have a hard time appreciate what you see. The prequel was better but this was not bad at all!",Escape from L.A.
103,MetalGeek,Snake Rides Again...,6,13 September 2010,"I didn't see ""Escape From L.A."" in theatres, but I do remember seeing the trailer for it when I was there to see something else, and I will never forget the whoop of joy that arose from the audience when the words ""SNAKE IS BACK"" appeared on screen. Unfortunately, when the film was released that joy apparently didn't translate into big box office money, and the film sank pretty quickly. Despite that, I thought ""Escape From L.A."" was a fun ride when I finally saw it on video sometime later. Like most B-Movie fans, I had loved 1981's ""Escape From New York,"" but I had honestly seen it so many times over the years that I had made myself sick of it; therefore I was simply happy to see Snake Plissken in a new adventure.The main problem is that ""Escape From L.A."" isn't exactly a ""new"" adventure - it's basically a re-tread of the first movie, just with a new location (the West Coast) and with a whole lot of cheap CGI thrown in. Kurt Russell's still bad-ass as Plissken of course, and it's fun to see him in action again, I just wish they'd done more with the story.This time it's 2013, and Los Angeles has been separated from the mainland U.S. after a massive earthquake. The uber-religious U.S. President for life (a hilariously over the top Cliff Robertson) has declared L.A. to be a ""sinful"" place and it is now used as a dumping ground for anyone unlucky enough to get deported from the ""new"" America for smoking, for eating red meat, for practicing the wrong religion, or thinking for themselves. L.A. is controlled by a gangster/revolutionary named Cuervo Jones, who is amassing an army in preparation for taking back the American mainland. His assistant is the President's turncoat daughter Utopia, who has stolen an important ""black box"" from Air Force One containing some sort of ultimate weapon and is now part of Cuervo's gang. The President and his men know there's only one man bad-ass enough to recover the girl and the package before the invasion - Snake Plissken, who's now in federal custody after an unexplained adventure in Cleveland. Once more, Plissken is impressed into service (via an injection of a virus that will kill him if he doesn't return in 12 hours) and dropped into the ruins of L.A., where he runs afoul of just about everybody in the city on the way to complete his mission. His trek through L.A. leads to mucho ass kicking and some funny bits featuring dependable character actors like Steve Buscemi (""Map to the Stars Eddie""), Bruce Campbell (as the insane ""Surgeon General""), Pam Grier (""Her-She"") and Peter Fonda (as a survivalist/surfer dude). It's all very light hearted and un-pretentious, which is fine by me.Much criticism has been thrown at the film's use of (cheap) C.G.I. I'll say that it works well in creating the ruined landscape of Los Angeles, giving the backgrounds the feel of a comic book, but when Snake and Fonda the Surfer dude ride a wave caused by a tsunami into the middle of the city, the effect is so obviously fake that you can't help but roll your eyes. Still, Russell and the rest of the cast are clearly having a ball and as with most Carpenter films, there's a sly sense of social satire throughout the proceedings.""Escape From L.A."" is not a classic by any means and ""Escape from New York"" is still the superior movie, but it's still worth a watch if you catch it on late-night TV or find it in the Wal-Mart $5 DVD bin (which is where I got mine).",Escape from L.A.

And I agree, but for some reason I find that very entertaining. The effects are cheesy, but done with purpose. Snake Plissken is the coolest man on the planet, he is even too cool for his own good, which makes his character not believable at all, but still I like this movie. Explain to me how I can like a movie that is so poorly done throughout? Well I think the answer lies in the fact that it is so heroic and exaggerated that you just sit and smile during the entire thing. Snake got more cool lines than anyone and he delivers them with such an ""I really don't care"" attitude that you just have to love it. Most of the people I know don't like this movie, most actually hate it intensely. Well I don't. If you are looking for the most brain dead action available in the shop, why don't you rent this one?

Personally, they tried to incorporate far too much CGI into this film and it was done so poorly that the end result is abysmal.There are too many scenes to count with bad CGI, but my personal favorite (i.e. the worst) is the surfing sequence. First, you can totally tell it's not Kurt Russell surfing, and then you incorporate Steve Buscemi driving next to the tidal wave it's an absolutely disgusting scene.I loved Escape from New York and it has a fantastic story but this movie clearly didn't need to be made.

106,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Escape from LA,7,24 August 2015,"When I watched L.A, the long-awaited sequel to the Carpenter classic Escape from New York, I enjoyed it. My now I'm sure you've realised my taste in movies is utterly terrible, right? Well, unlike most people who waited over a decade for Snake Plissken's return, I wasn't even born when Escape from Ney York came out. Therefore I didn't have that hype building up. If I did, I'm sure I would have disliked it, much how I didn't like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull after waiting ages for an Indiana Jones sequel. Like Ghosts of Mars, I can't argue that it's a good movie, because it's not. It's cheesy, campy, the special effects are laughably bad and the movie is more of a remake of New York than a sequel anyway. But I can't help it if I enjoyed the cheesiness and campiness. LA was Carpenter's attempt at pushing a long-in-production sequel into reality and from what I've heard he wished he hadn't bothered. I had a ball watching it however. Russell slips back into his signature role perfectly and the b-movieness around him is a delight to watch – there's a scene where he has to put a basketball into a hoop in an allotted time or die, and even a part where he surfs a wave down a street. Nowhere near as impressive as the original, which is legitimately a good film. Oh and whisper it, but the budget for LA was a whopping $50 million (compared to New York's measly $6 million), making it the most expensive Carpenter film and one of his biggest bombs. In fact, both Escape films work perfectly at showing what was right with Carpenter's earlier career and what was wrong with his later work.Best Scene: The part where Snake's submarine device swims through the sea is when I stopped taking the film seriously, but I'm gonna go for the ending, which was one of the ballsiest I've seen.",Escape from L.A.
107,CaressofSteel75,Snake is Too Cool for Just One Movie,7,14 March 2019,"Escape from New York didn't really leave a whole lot of room for a follow up, but Snake Plissken is just too cool a character to limit to one movie. The result is actually the original movie done over again- public enemy Snake Plissken gets blackmailed again into serving the President and this time has to storm into the no man's land of future Los Angeles to save the nation. This time he's got some good backup in the supporting cast with Pam Grier, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi and even Bruce Campbell in a one scene role.John Carpenter directs into some recurring themes of loss of freedom, fascism, etc., but if you watch closely you'll find that his ideology is kind of confused, perhaps purposely so. Anyway- we all know how this is going to work out in the end, so enjoy it and the good, tough sounding soundtrack that goes along with it.",Escape from L.A.
108,Space_Lord,Snake's back!,7,25 May 2005,"I honestly believe that this film is just as good, if not slightly better, than Escape from New York. It's essentially the same flick... Plissken coerced by the government of moral America to rescue the President's daughter in this case. But it follows the same formula. Break into prison compound, meet and deal with oddball characters, rescue hostage, get out and get the antidote to whatever poison they injected Plissken with. I can't quite place my finger on why I like this film... I'm just into this kind of stuff. Kurt Russell rules as Snake, and there are some useful cameos, most namely by Bruce Campbell. And the ending is something to think about, wouldn't it be great if that happened for real!!",Escape from L.A.

However, John Carpenter was making a good point of how we rely too much on technology, politically correctness, and how intrusive the government has become in our lives, When Stacy Keach said ""America is a smoke free, alcohol free, no red meat, and no sex unless you're married state"" Snake replies, ""Land of the free, home of the brave"" Keach says ""Exactly!"" At the end, Snake lights a cigarette and said, ""Welcome to the real world!"" Point taken!",Escape from L.A.
110,mrspasm,Escape From LA and into my Car!,10,27 July 2009,"This remake of Johnny Baker's 1981 classic Escape From NYC is superior in every way. The acting is better, the excitement is higher, the graphics are awesome (especially the extraordinary surfing scene) and the story is wildly different. Whereas the first film saw Sneak having to 'sneak' into NYC and rescue the president before the time runs out and they both die, this one sees him having to sneak into LA and rescue the President before the time runs out and they both die. There is no comparison. Kurt Rustler re-creates his role from the first film with more style, guile, wile, and skile (skill). He has certainly grown as an actor and surrounded by a terrific and huge supporting cast (Steve Buscemi) we are sure this is going to be an immortal film.The film starts in fifth gear and races into top gear from there. Snake is captured by the army and blackmailed into rescuing the President of a country he doesn't care about. Snake is a rebel, a loner, an anti-hero, he lives and plays by his own rules and doesn't have time for The Man. In a homage to an earlier Carpenter character (Napoleon Dynamite from Assault On Policeman 13) Snake repeats the line 'Got a fag' throughout the film. Of course all the one liners he made famous in the prequel make a not unwelcome return: Snake Plissken: The name's Stilskin.And in the spooky and 'I didn't see that coming' shock ending he creates a new favourite: (after having shut down all machinery in the world) Snake Plissken: Welcome to the party pal! Snake has many fights with bad guys here, and all the characters have cool names: Mappy, Pappy, Joe The Dyke, Crusher Frankenpower, Ligthening Jack, Terry Spitfire, Trashcan Bandido, Cabbie Borgenine, and Timothy. There are explosive car chases; neck snappings, gunshots, and an insane game of netball which just has to be seen to be believed- you won't believe it! In an exciting cameo, everyone's favourite chainsaw wielding idiot Bruce Gambell appears! Basically he flaps about backwards for a few minutes chasing his hands about a room before Snake gets bored and shoots him in the ear with a dart. 'I'm your King, Baby' he quips bewilderingly.The central themes of all John Computer films are here- the loner against the world, living on the edge of a right wing government, standing up against those in power, fighting for individual rights and freedom in a collapsing world, siege warfare, scary masks, spectacular set design, high quality synth/country music. For some reason this wasn't a success, but this is clearly both John Carpeter and Kurt Ruskill's best film.Best Scene: It has to be the surfing scene where snake infiltrates the city via a magic surfboard on a huge wave, jumps off, and has to sneak through a building full of guards. He has to hide in various cupboards and ceilings, then swing down, break the guards necks and hide the bodies. It is very cool and has never been seen before in any medium.",Escape from L.A.
111,rorygunn,Lacks what made the first one great..,5,8 May 2021,"I don't mind this being a re-tread of EFNY but the things that made that one great are missing from this one. Cuervo Jones is just not an interesting villain like The Duke. He doesn't seem to inspire that same kind of fear like the Duke did. There also doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency like the first one. In EFNY Snake had to get the President out and to the conference with Russia and China or the world would be in trouble. That doesn't seem to be the case here. As for characters there aren't any that are memorable like Cabbie,Brain and Maggie. When they died you felt it because you came to care for them. There is none of that here and Map To The Stars Eddie is no Cabbie nor is Hershe anywhere in the league of Brain. Instead of focusing on the danger of L. A like they did with New York they went for a send-up that didn't seem to work for me. The tone was just all wrong for this one. Bottom line.

That's not 2013, more like 1998, again, but the effects are decent for its time. Great as for 1996, not so good as much later. Augmented with a colorful array of nuts and loonies, but the stererotypes almost ruin it. Communist rebels, Cuban attacks and a deeply religious fundamentalist president but unrealistic tech.

114,wpirotte,Carpenter pandering to someone,5,18 April 2019,"First, the overall. Carpenter's music theme, startlingly original in the New York movie, is nicely revisited. Russell is weary and less virile, which actually matches the movie plot. The special effects and production range from merely okay to sub-amateur. Snake checks his watch at 7 hours and subsequently is told he has 7.5 hours, so continuity review isn't happening much. Generally speaking, it is a sequel without energy. It needed an Adrienne Barbeau type chick to keep you interested. The crazy people aren't all that crazy, the vicious people are not that scary, and the nemesis antagonist person is actually more personable than anyone else in the entire movie. I want to buy him a drink because I can't believe he is going to nuke us later.To be honest, I loved it back in the day. However, a modern viewing reveals perhaps more than was originally intended. The melodramatic depiction of the hypocrisy of the religious right could have come straight from 2019 Hollycoms. Since the New York legislature is currently giving standing ovations to itself for legalizing infanticide, perhaps the religious right ought to get a break. Perhaps more importantly, the utter decay of California and the need to surround it with a wall hits a nerve. The unexplained presence of deported children in the film is, again, more Lefty fun. The cute muslim chick whose sole crime is being muslim, more Lefty fun, but more interesting today as we hear about Sharia-driven: sedition,  huge enclaves in Minnesota, rampant public antisemitism, etc.A lot of professional reviews, and Carpenter himself, have tried to say that the film tried to be camp and fun, and just failed by accident. I don't think Russell would have pushed as hard as he did for camp and fun. I think the goal was supposed to be preachy and nihilistic, and it came off as...dull.I have always been a huge Carpenter fan, and I am half afraid to go back and review the films I used to love. But I honestly don't believe he pulled this crap in his other movies.Perhaps the public felt the same way, since the movie grossed about half of its production costs.",Escape from L.A.

116,badfeelinganger,""" The more things change, the more they stay the same""",10,7 October 2014,"Both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. are decidedly anti-establishment films. They both have this cynical view of the government; in these films, the government is not to be trusted. There are terrorist attacks aimed at the government on both films. ESCAPE FROM L.A This second one is tongue in cheek every step of the way. Watching Escape from L.A. feels like watching a cheap Italian Rip Off like 2019: After the Fall of New York (1983), but with a bigger budget. Actually, Escape from L.A. has a lot of similarities with 2019: After the Fall of New York, so in a way, this is Carpenter's pay back for all those cheap Escape from New York rip offs that the Italians made. Ultimately, I love both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. for different reasons. And for all the tonal differences between both films, they still have many similarities. No matter where, Snake Plissken will always be Snake Plissken, you can tell Russell has lots of love for this character. Plissken is what kept me watching. The opening and closing segments of the films are extremely similar as well. And here's where we get to the best part of the film, the ending. Not gonna spoil it don't worry, but I will tell you that it is the best thing about the movie. Russell himself came up with it and I applaud him for it, it encapsulates everything Snake Plissken is in terms of attitude. That idea that maybe the world would be better off if we simply started again, from scratch, screw the way things are, let's try something new! Welcome to the human race my friends, welcome to the human race.t does criticize fascist forms of government, it also criticizes rebellious leaders who instigate their followers towards committing violent acts. So it doesn't side with anyone. On this film, both sides are wrong. The film pleads for a new beginning, it's asking governments to forget their old grudges and start from scratch. Snake himself says it in one scene: ""I shut down the third world, you win, they loose. I shut down America, they win, you loose. The more things change, the more they stay the same"" This is one of the ideas presented in the film that I truly liked. The idea that both sides should just call it quits and bring on the peace, bring on the freedom. Again, this last bit demonstrates how much of Kurt Russell's Libertarian views are on this film. After all, he wrote a lot of it himself along with John Carpenter and Debra Hill. These are three life long buddies writing a movie they would find amusing, which makes this film a labor of love. This is probably why the film has a more laid back, 'were having fun here' vibe to it.",Escape from L.A.
117,Chance_Boudreaux19,A sequel that improves upon the original,9,11 January 2019,"Many complain that the sequel to Escape from New York is basically the same movie but much dumber. But that is the point, this movie is what the first one was always meant to be. John Carpenter finally had a big budget to make a badass, ridiculous, action-packed Snake Plissken movie that he wanted to make. Escape from NY had a great concept but due to the budget it was kind of slow, this one just takes it to a whole other level with Snake making full court basketball shots to save his life and surfing a fricking tsunami! Despite all this it still has the political commentary of the first. I love this movie, I love Snake Plissken and I wish the 3rd movie Escape from Earth was made back in the day.",Escape from L.A.

Snake Plissken, played by Kurt Russell, is forced to retrieve the device for the government.  He is poisoned with a virus that will kill him in a number of hours to ensure his co-operation.I have never seen the original Escape From New York, and this film repels me from doing so.  It is so stupid and dumb.  It lacks credibility and has so much unnecessary violence.  The acting is horrible and the premise is also quite average.  I must admit, there are a few good scenes, I liked the ending, besides one aspect that I'm probably not allowed to mention.  I also like the character of Snake Plissken, but he deserved a better film, which he probably had with Escape From New York.Australian Classification: M 15+: Medium Level Violence, Medium Level Coarse LanguageRating: 34 out of 100 (for a few good scenes)",Escape from L.A.
119,uroshnor54,Better than the Original,7,6 March 2015,"I'll admit, I'm not a huge fan of Escape from New York. It has a ton of plot holes and none of the characters were all that likable. I usually like Kurt Russell's performances (he was quite good in The Thing, Executive Decision, and Tequila Sunrise) but I didn't really like his performance in EFNY. I thought he was trying too hard to talk and act like Clint Eastwood. But I decided to give Escape from L.A. a chance and I actually liked it quite a bit. And I kind of have gained a bit more respect for the original after watching EFLA. I think the original could have been like this if it had a larger budget. EFLA has basically the same story but its budget allowed it to be far more over the top. There definitely are plot holes in ESLA but I just didn't care.I really like how EFLA doesn't take itself seriously at all. There's this one scene where Snake Plissken surfs off a tsunami onto a car driven by this one guy played by Steve Buscemi. And Kurt Russell is far better here than in EFNY. You'd think a character who unhesitatingly sends the whole world back into the Dark Ages would be unlikable but Snake Plissken was actually a likable character.Some of the special effects are bad and the sets aren't the best. But the story just has a charm that is lacking in other films with far better visuals, like the insanely imbecilic 2009 Star Trek reboot (I really, really, really hate that movie). It's too bad Escape from Earth is probably not going to get made. I'd really like to see what happens to Snake after the events of this movie.",Escape from L.A.

122,Colonel Ted,Shoddy in the extreme,2,5 April 2000,"Escape from New York was not one of John Carpenter's best films, but it's a masterpiece compared to this utterly dreadful sequel, made 15 years later with the benefit of CGI technology and a budget of $50 million, compared to the original's tiny $6 million. Where did all that money go? Feeding the film crew on caviar and champagne? It certainly isn't up on the screen. In fact Carpenter managed to produce an infinitely superior film in Escape from New York on that tiny budget. Plot wise, LA is nothing more that a tired rehash of the first film. Kurt Russell repeats his Clint Eastwood impression as Snake Plisskin, who is given a few hours to go into LA, now a prison, to retrieve a doomsday device stolen by the President's daughter, before a virus injected into his body kills him. Sound familiar? Wait till you see the actual film because the script lifts dialogue, characters and even entire scenes from the original film. Carpenter has clearly attempted to satirise the action genre and the eclipsing of democratic rights in America, only he horribly misjudges the film with a fuzzy plot, dull characters, unspeakable dialogue and one of the most risibly lame endings in years. Add that to the awful special effects, the balsa wood sets (I can't believe Blade Runner's Lawrence G. Paull designed them) and the poor photography and you've got an unexciting mess that cannot even be enjoyed as camp. My review of Escape from New York at IMDb queries why Carpenter didn't start making films on higher budgets.

Well I'll share a few of its virtues with you:1) It's got Kurt Russell in it.2) The main Character is Snake Plissken3) There are no child actors.4) Snake Plissken destroys all the world's electronic equipment.5) He also surfs a tidal wave and then jumps into the back of a moving car.Come on guys! How often can you have all of those things in one film? Well you just can't, but John Carpenter did and people choose to sneer at him because of it! Well shame on you all!

But perhaps, some thought (i.e., moi) this flick would help expand Snake's alternate universe. From the moment it starts, a strong sense of deja vu washes over you. This isn't really a sequel, its just a rehash, with a few names and words changed, and some scenes shifted around. This was made on a much bigger budget than the original. But bigger hasn't resulted in better. Apart from a spectacular earthquake sequence, most of the special effects and production design looked shoddy, even back in 1996. Amazingly the film looks far more dated than the original 1981 movie.Kurt Russell is still cool as Snake Plissken, but some of the big names in the supporting cast either ham it up (Cliff Robertson), or are completely wasted (Valeria Golino).

My only sadness is that it didn't seem to do well at the box office which is a crying shame as this movie had it all and was very SNAKE.If your a fan of the legendary 'Snake Plissken' your going to love this movie. It's terrific and I wish there could have been at least one more movie to provide a trilogy to the Snake Plissken saga. Alas with the barely scraped back budget I doubt that's ever going to be a possibility.To conclude this is a movie for fans, it's not a movie for winning Oscar's or achieving amazing accolades in special effects etc, it's a down and gritty 80's style film, which is at the core of the Snake character.For those who are not aware there was a Snake Plissken comic book(which I of course own)that got a single issue. It's worth while reading if your a fan too. (Just trying to assist fans as sadly Snake is constantly overlooked and I'm certain Marvel would do well to bring him back to the big screen today. Kurt Russell could still play Snake without blinking an eye lid(that's a single eye lid, you have to have the patch).

He was even quoted expressing his utter disdain for the films now saying they looked ""...like cartoons."" Well with this film, he has no room to talk! The plot was...mediocre but what really suffered was the entire film. I actually thought that Carpenter said ""Print"" on the outtakes and either thought the camp was gonna do for this film what did for New York. Too bad it was in the middle of a CGI revolution in better and economical storytelling. Now I also know why Russell hasn't written another action flick much less starred in much of 'em. The camp worked for New York I suspect was because it came in around ""The Road Warrior"" and the 2nd Star Wars. Unfortunately he was too late in making L.A.

But he still commands the screen. The movie is told through his perspective - as a noble but burnt-out man trying to salvage one last assignment at the government's bidding for a chance to live.Along the way he encounters every specimen of dastardly vagrant, villain, and vermin.But Plissken (Russell) is unfazed and he's nonchalant at every turn.

As a teenager, I didn't like it because the effects were cheesy and the action didn't build up in a meaningful way. The colors were unpleasant and the antagonists were strange. And, let's be honest, I was a teenage boy and I wanted to see more women in skimpy outfits.Twenty two years (1997 for HBO release) later and my opinion has changed. The movie is hilarious. Only a few movies have their protagonists surfing into action (Die Hard 3 with the Dump Truck for example). You have the same story from Escape From New York, but this movie punches the goofiness level into the stratosphere.There are some awesome moments which are surprising. The basketball court scene wasn't impressive when I was younger, but when you put it into perspective, it's a simple and effective scenario. The jumping of a motorcycle into the back of a pickup truck looks goofy, but it works for this film. The special effects are terribly dated, but it's charming when you look at other movies made around the same time and realize that they too were just learning how to do CGI.Is it amazing? No. Is it fun. Absolutely. This is a movie that we should all be laughing with.",Escape from L.A.

The host asked him why he was growing his hair out. Kurt smiled at the audience and said ""getting ready to play Snake!"" He was expecting cheers and applause. He was met with the air conditioning clicking on. Then the week it opened, he was promoting EFLA on Jay Leno. They went to the surfing scene, and Kurt looked like an uncomfortable salesman demonstrating a product he knows nobody wants. When the scene was over, the audience reacted with polite, strained applause.Not that this really bothered me. Escape from New York was one of those movies that I loved and most people hadn't heard of. I liked it that way. I did, however, want to see the sequel succeed and maybe launch a franchise.Didn't happen.A movie I had been waiting for most of my childhood/teenage years finally arrived and landed like a big, wet turd on the sidewalk. Critics hated it, nobody went to see it, and I couldn't blame them one bit. I wanted to like the movie. i really did. But I couldn't. I found the effects awful, the acting lame, the action scenes totally lifeless (not to mention ridiculous and stupid), and the whole movie a flatly shot, lazy retread of the first . I left the theater seething and hating John Carpenter.I still can't say that I like the movie. I still think all the things above. But I have come to appreciate some other aspects of EFLA. The current state of politics probably has a lot to do with it. I've always loved John Carpenter's movies, but is the guy psychic too? Islam illegal, all moral undesirables outlawed, etc...Patriot Act in ten more years? A religious nut for a president...Robertson even looks like Bush. A Police controlled population...we're on our way. As I watched this again (I finally forked over $5 for the DVD - the only Carpenter film I didn't own) I began to see some of the brilliance in this movie. I'll bet the screenplay read a lot better than this movie was executed.I still don't get the cheesiness of it - the original was serious as a heart attack and so much more subtle. This is a clunky, over the top satire that to me sits uncomfortably next to EFNY.I do love that ending though. American Spirit baby.",Escape from L.A.
137,heinigrunbaum-786-20424,Wasn't what it should have been,6,12 July 2016,"I wish John Carpenter, one of my favorite directors since my early teenage years, had taken this project more seriously. Escape from L.A. completely misses the atmosphere and seriousness that Escape from New York had.In Escape from New York you were on your toes all the time. A shadow in the background or a flash in the distance made you tremble in your seat, and Snake Plissken gave you the true feeling that the whole world could go fxxx it self for all its wrong doings.Escape from L.A. seemed more like a poppet show that didn't expect to be taken seriously. A meet up of good old friends having fun hanging out on a set together and getting paid to do so at the same time. Nobody was focused at the project at hand, but I am sure they all had a great time doing the movie.The character of Che Guevara was misplaced as most of the characters were. Sad. This could have been a great John Carpenter movie even with the same copy-pasted script that tried too hard to be a more futuristic version than Escape from New York was.I somehow wish Escape from L.A. had never been made. Just like Godfather part III totally ruins the magnificent end of Godfather part II (another sad story in the history of great movies).Only the character played by Pam Grier was interesting, but that part was only taken seriously by Pam Grier herself, not by John Carpenter.You never realize that Escape from New York is a somewhat low-budget movie. The team worked their way of that and made a true masterpiece (that I personally have rated with 10 stars here on IMDb). With Escape from L.A. they had more money and what not, but it truly seems like a low-budget flick that no one would even remember if it wasn't for the cast, John Carpenter, and of course; Escape from New York.Sad sad when great directors loses their ""touch"", but it happens all the time. I still love John Carpenter for all of his great movies, but this one the world and the John Carpenter-legacy could have been with out!",Escape from L.A.
138,kheops,That's how we should speak about freedom of creation,10,8 February 1999,"Snake is back, and they shouldn't have tried to f*** with him. This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies these years, because first it's not serious at all, we see that John Carpenter is one of the most creative directors in the world in general and in USA in particular, that's why this movie didn't work, he doesn't have limits to his purpose, to the characters, he dose what he wants, and that's why he's not appreciated as he ought to be. That's also why he's appreciated here in France, we appreciated the character, Snake Plissken, very independent, not like those fake heroes as in ID4 or ""Armageddon"", Snake Plissken is a kind of anarchist, nobody can make him do what he doesn't want to except if his life depends on it. He's called to save the world, he says f*** off. The end of the movie is one of the best ends of a movie in these last years. The cast is really good, with of course Kurt Russell, Steve Buscemi and Pam Grier (wow!) in a different role than ""Jackie Brown"" but the end is why I loved this movie, I didn't know that there were still free men as Carpenter in art creation in the USA.",Escape from L.A.
139,m0ds,Plissken doesn't disappoint!!,7,7 January 2012,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie, but I was really glad I watched it! Bad-ass Snake is back and his new assignment sees him enter a run-down LA in search of a 'black box'. Standard ""Escape"" stuff, again we assume he's been drugged and has no alternative.The visual effects come thick and fast: There is a mix of some really great effects early on and some equally awful ones, but as this was the dawn of ""comic book style"" films they're all totally acceptable in the film world. A lot of them were really nice, even the tacky nature of them still holds good value. But what I really liked were the epic long shots and large models that I thought really gave LA and edge over New York.The plot does twist and turn more than you expect. Just as I was getting to like Plisken's love interest...BLAM! Just as I thought some boring secondary cast member is about to join the plot - BAM - it's Steve Buscemi! The next minute Plissken is surfing a mini-tsunami through LA!! This film really delivers and personally I think it makes a great sequel to NY. There's more attention to sci-fi detail, some gripping sequences and wonderful locations. The supporting cast don't do a bad job of it either. There's dramatic irony and also whatever the reverse of dramatic irony is - bits you just won't predict happening...Kurt himself as Plissken is a joy to watch - never says a lot - you often wonder what he's thinking and Kurt plays this part of unease and uncertainty about Plissken really well. The fact Snake's reputation follows him in this film also adds to the fun factor.There's no need to take this movie in too deeply, I did not - and that way I really got into it and enjoyed the world it portrayed. The final shot of Plissken is hilarious and made me clap out loud because it's just the perfect finalé to the world of Snake.I really hope they bring Kurt back for a third film, because the effects could be at a whole new level in this day and age. And definitely get Shirley Walker and John Carpenter to write the music together. The progression in LA from Carpenter's classic slow synth style through to Walker's upbeat 20th century classical really interested me.If you're looking for light entertainment, a fairly mature sci-fi romp with Kurt Russell from a time when computer effects in films were really beginning (though the use of real locations (and some big ones!) were not to be outdone by computer graphics in this film) - be sure to watch this!! Oh and please finish the trilogy Kurt!! PHAT",Escape from L.A.
140,Bryan-15,Campy fun,8,19 August 1998,"This movie is really good for simple reasons.  First, it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's approach to spoofing action and b-movies is great.Many people don't realize that this movie is intentionally corny and cheesy.",Escape from L.A.
141,antoinecatry,"Underrated, so singular",7,13 April 2011,"Some 15 years after its release, this film appears as a minor film in all of Carpenter's work, one director who appears himself to be a minor director in the whole cinema history. Few creative people have the gift to divide between fans and haters like Big John, and in view of my recent re-watching of Escape from LA, I do intend to defend one of my favorite directors. Carpenter is full of superlatives, in my opinion : he is one of the last artisans making his films with low budgets and maximum viewing pleasure, he is not ashamed of his positions : not anti capitalism, not pro socialism, with touches of anarchistic and cynical denunciations, but the purest fans know he is just a free thinker and doesn't give a... about political labels. This film illustrates what he is in the best of ways : shutting down the Earth's technologies instead of favoring one camp or the other ; criticizing our system's superfluity like the surgical failures - whose chief is Bruce Campbell - who have to indulge to some sort of cannibalism to survive ; a resurgence of primitive and tribal ways of life in the midst of nuclear chaos, etc. This film is excellent in that it deals with most of science fiction's classic themes and reveals the so unique all-against-the-grain-not-giving-a-...-about-it attitude that characterizes Carpenter and his alter ego Snake Plissken. I suggest this film should be reinterpreted in our times of crises and rediscovered as one ""excellent yet minor piece of cinema""... Get on your couch, grab a can of beer and grow a pair of balls and listen to the Snake Plissken/Carpenter part of you.",Escape from L.A.
142,thechidz,Don't get on Snake's nerves ...,9,4 April 2006,"Snake (who was never the most even-tempered of men) gets to crash an extremely expensive boat into a buggered Los Angeles after being forced there by a woman I swear I've seen in a Stallone movie. After his arrival he kills just about everyone he comes across whilst scowling a lot and wearing a vest. Amongst the targets of Snake's unreasonable temper are a man who's dressed like Che Guevara, a REALLY freaky looking plastic surgery guy, and loads of Mad Max movie extras on motorbikes. After escaping LA by the skin of his teeth alongside Foxy Brown, Snake (who by this stage is bloody furious) throws the human race back into the stone age ... presumably because it's got on his nerves.God alone knows what would happen if Snake found himself yet again forced to go on some wild goose chase around say, Las Vegas? If he did I would recommend we all found a different planet to live on, just to be on the safe side.",Escape from L.A.
143,shagya49,Escape from L.A . rehashes original plot,5,12 August 2007,"I disagree with people who think this is a better film than Escape from New York. Plots rarely improve with recycling. The opening scenes are like a comedy club imitation of the original. But one thing is still all right. The dictator on the ""inside"" is as rotten as the outside. But is this really new? I liked the character of Snake ... well up to a point. Making fun of religious nuts is okay but Russell needs some new material here. I'd like to point out one thing just at the end of the film. Actually the neutron bomb doesn't work this way. By changing the casing of a fission device more neutrons could be released in the explosion. Originally thought as an anti-tank weapon the NB would not, beyond a short range, be much different to a ""conventional"" nuke. The idea, if you can call it that, was to produce a weapon which would tend to spare more solid objects while killing as many people as possible. The neutron bomb was also called an 'enhanced radiation device'. The weapons displayed in the film (I appreciate this is science fiction so the rules tend to get bent a little) appeared to be some kind of X-ray laser similar to the Strategic Defense Initiative ""Star Wars"" thing dropped in the 1980s. It's true that real EMT would screw up modern electronics over a fairly short range but most of this stuff could be rebuilt. The ""end of electricity"" idea is ridiculous.",Escape from L.A.

Although not a good film, it really isn't bad, either. Let's just call it the Judge Dredd of 1996: fun but cartoon fun. Kurt Russell isn't acting his best in this film as Snake Plissken, but Snake is a likeable character. There is a good group of actors, but they are not very good in this movie. Any of them.

These days, I really have to ration my movie trips for reasons related to time & $$$, so I hadn't seen this till tonight. I figured this would be a nice little follow-on to Escape From New York, which I really liked, but have to admit I didn't expect a lot more than just a thrill ride.Got the thrill ride to be sure, but so much extra brain candy! Loved Peter Fonda's apocalyptic surfer, Steve Buscemi's slimeball entepreneur, Georges Correface's Che clone, Pam Grier's tranny, and especially Cliff Robertson's Son Of A Bush! I have to admit, my worst nightmare scenarios about W's reign are fully realized in this movie, and Cliff Robertson played the antiamerican to perfection. The ending was surprising and, I found, surprisingly satisfying. I now love John Carpenter just a little bit more than before.",Escape from L.A.

None of the supporting characters are memorable, except for an interesting appearance by Pam Grier.

It reminds me the fact that those who constantly complains about EFLA didn't get even Escape From New York  this visual style, atmosphere and other great surrounding stuff, as everyone praising these days, doesn't make a good movie, it was, is and will be the story, and as for the richness of this Escape From L.A. is definitely far better including that it's the most personal Carpenter movie ever that is kind of philosophy on the freedom and also today's real problem in modern America.

148,MikeT-9,Carpenter's Worst,4,29 October 1999,"What happened to one of my favorite directors; John Carpenter? He used to make moody, atmospheric flicks that I could watch over and over again, many of which rank as my all time favorites. Now he seems determined to drain every ounce of credibility from his name by churning out lifeless, disjointed, seemingly intentionally awful films.""Escape from LA"" is far and away his worst. I love the original and was thrilled when they announced a sequel. Once I saw it, I sat in amazement at how bad it was. Cheesy effects, stupid music, cornball over-acting, and a storyline that simply rehashes the original but is nowhere near as effective. Some say it was done on purpose. OK...why? The first film is a serious, suspensful film with underlying statements about our future. Why make a sequel that spoofs films like it? ""Escape from LA"" plays to the original like ""Airplane"" plays to ""Airport"". I would think the Zucker brothers made it if I didn't know better.Was Carpenter being a rebel and made a terrible film on purpose to waste Universal's money? He hates big studio politics, and they gave him 5 million to direct, so I guess he took the money and ran. To bad he had to ruin a good potential franchise in the process. Hopefully, John Carpenter will decide to put his considerable skill to good use and make an entertaining, thought provoking film for the first time since ""They Live."" When ""Vampires"" is your best work of the decade, you know something's wrong.",Escape from L.A.

The action and the special effects are cheesy but enjoyable and the music is some of Carpenter's best since Halloween. The cast is great and the film's style is very detailed and really looks like a real bleek future. Snake is greatest anti-hero ever and anyone who watches this film will instantley like him and will root for him throughout the film.

151,megavenganceman,Misinterpreted and underrated,6,7 July 2004,"Now ""Escape from New York"" is a darker, grim action thriller that suits the environment where the story takes place. When one thinks of New York, you think of a dark, seedy, big, bad city. This is not what comes to mind when one thinks of L.A. You would think sunny, plastic and strangely creepy. Hence the change in tone with this looser, tongue in cheek near self-parody. Now the reason why I say the film still works is Snake Plissken. The only character who is played completely straight against the stable of B-movie cliches and skewed Hollywood stereotypes. Maybe in a few years this film will gain the respect it deserves. Still, although I reasonably enjoyed the picture (especially a few choice cuts like the ""Bangkok rules"" scene) I must admit I liked the first one better too.",Escape from L.A.

These one doesn't have those cool characters from the first movie, the ones like Cabbie (Borgnine), Brain (Stanton) and Hauk (L. Van Cleef), but has some OK ones like Eddie(Buscemi) and Pipeline (Fonda), and these is one of the ""two"" issues that i have with the movie, it could've had some more funny characters... and the other thing that i wasn't pleased with and that stays as a weakness of the sequel is the special effects, which by all means in some scenes made the movie look like a B category movie. My favorite part, by all means, was the end which was almost in the same level with the first one... And the best thing that could happen from these ""action-saga"" is a sequel, with the old Snake being sent somewhere for a final mission, with someone new on the director's chair (Carpenter is kind of too old to return) that would follow Carpenter's dark vision.",Escape from L.A.

I thought Kurt Russell did great but the script is almost like the original Escape from New York; it begins like the first one,same kind of storyline, same kind of situation, same ending, but I know that Carpenter is losing his touch on being able to tell a story through cinema because of his lack of checking through the script and being able to check if the movie would make sense to everybody else.

It has way too much humor in it for a story that was dark. I mean i like Steve Buscemi, he's kinda funny, but what was the point with him being in the movie? I also didn't like how they turned Kurt Russell's character of Snake Plissken into a character that says one liners, i mean we already have enough of those! They tried to turn Snake Plissken into a character that he shouldn't be. And the whole Cleavland references are just plain stupid. I hate this movie a lot because too much humor can kill a movie and that's what it did here. I mean the original was very good, but this one sucks!

Even the special effects were crappy (the wave in the much spoken of surf scene was as unrealistic as I ever have seen).It has been a while since I've seen Escape from NY, but as far as I can remember, at least *that* film was entertaining.

Oh,and i can not remember a script as horrible as this. On the first movie,he goes in to save the president after he crash landed his airplane in New York, A city that is entirely a prison. Then, on the sequel,he goes in to L.A. (which is also a prison)to save the president's daughter. I could have wrote one myself better than this.

Sure, Carpenter's use of effects is often obvious (though occasionally brilliant). Sure, the film is nothing but a slab of highly fragrant cheese, but it's FUN cheese. It's unapologetic cheese. It's the extra $1.50 of gooey, greasy, slimey mozza that you throw onto your 16"" meat-lover's... sure, it's excessive--maybe even unhealthy--but it makes the pizza.Escape From L.A. is pure, unabashed, old-fashioned fun. It's one of those movies that everyone claims they hate, but they really love in that deep place, way down in their mind, where belching contests are still fun. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than entertainment--and it's good entertainment at that. When I first saw the trailers for this film, I groaned. Kurt Russell's faux-Eastwood-does-pirate routine rubbed me the wrong way, and I was unfamiliar with John Carpenter's work. After having seen the original Escape, Halloween, The Fog, Vampires, The Thing and especially Big Trouble In Little China I know that Carpenter is interested in one thing: giving his audience an escape from reality, and this film is perfect for that. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief, but in to paraphrase Roger Ebert: Who can hate a film where Kurt Russell and a transsexual Pam Grier swoop from the sky in hang-gliders firing automatic weapons at an amusement park compound?Add to the mix a delightful turn by Steve Buscemi and an amusing (albeit unrecognizable) cameo by Bruce ""Don't Call Me Ash"" Campbell, and you have a really fun, really dumb, really cool MOVIE!Recommended for the 10 year old boy in all of us.",Escape from L.A.

165,TIDQ,And you thought LA was bad now...,5,25 September 2004,"It should be noted first and foremost that I have not seen Escape from New York, the predecessor to Escape from L.A.If movies were graded solely on their concept, Escape from L.A. would be an absolutely fantastic movie. The city of Los Angeles has finally been hit with ""the big one"" and fallen away from California. The anarchy escalating from the '89 riots has made it the haven of moral degrady and thus becomes forcibly ceded from the United States by the new theocratic dictatorship government. It creates a beautiful scene. A post-apocalyptic setting before the apocalypse even happens.Indeed, the scenery throughout the movie is gorgeous, and though a desolate ruin, everything in the movie reiterates the distinct ""This is L.A."" feeling, from the car-graveyard highways, to the plastic surgery patients turned organ-hungered freak shows. Aside from the now-outdated computer effects in some scenes, it's an extremely appealing movie, visually.The problem in the movie is the execution. The plot, the acting, the general meat of most good movies. While there isn't any downright ""bad"" acting, Kurt Russell as Snake Plisskin is essentially a typical action hero. He can't talk in any tone other than the gruffest, most manly voice that humans are scarcely capable of. He also is incapable of talking in anything other than catchy one-liners. This probably would have annoyed me, had I felt the movie took itself seriously.One CAN'T take the movie seriously, because there's just WAY too much belief to suspend. Then there would be many questions the movie can't answer. Why would any country willingly give up all its civil rights and liberties so easily? Why is it that Snake can barely walk with a bullet in his leg, but he can surf perfectly on that same leg? When apparently ten or so aftershocks happen everyday in Los Angeles, why is it that the one that occurs when Snake is in the sewer causes a cave-in, when the last 200 didn't?Steve Buscemi does his usual great work as the wormy map peddler, and he was the most interesting person on the screen anytime he had a scene. I noticed Bruce Campbell's name in the opening credits too, whom I'm a fan of, but I didn't even recognize him through his makeup when he appeared. His voice was unmistakable though. It's a shame he had such a small part, though.Good ideas, good production values, nice vision, the laughs are well-paced, but typically subpar action movie execution.

A ridicule of all things a sequel is thought to be? I thought so.Listen to the soundtrack, to the songs in the background. What are they telling you? Mostly that you've been here before. Listen to the dialogue. John carpenter doesn't just write dialogue to fill gaps around the action. Look at the situation Snake finds himself in at the beginning of the film, same deal as E.F.N.Y, with the virus in his system.Then take a look around at what Carpenter and all have created for you, an America not too different to the real one right now! And they were meant to poking fun! Also have a look at the Hollywood setting and listen to how everyone talks. It's all about deal making and clearing a profit and screwing people over to get it. But it's also a survival film, with everyone out for themselves, a situation I'm sure many film makers have found themselves in over the years.This was a new breed of action film. A film with many layers and great characters. Which is the next point. The film's look is very retro, right down to the choice of actors. Nothing in the film is there by mistake.The topper for me is the surf boarding sequence. I can only imagine Carpenter sat there thinking that there would be no way studio executives would allow it in the script but low and behold it ends up in the movie!

So when this opened up - I was like wow - 15 yrs later? 10-12 years too late IMO. It seems like NY was more gritty, serious, forward moving, cutting edge, and the graphics and special effects used were great and fit well. You'd expect the next level for LA, but it fell way short of expectations.Acting is not as good. It wasn't as gritty or cutting edge. Some of the scenes just looked staged, not as authentic. The CGI was mediocre at best. I love Carpenter's work, all of his movies in the 80s had this deep ominous and gritty edge to it. Suspenseful, kept you guessing or surprised you. This LA version lacked a lot of it unfortunately. Some of the scenes were predictable too, especially the ending.

While I and many other people see a bad review and go, ""god, this thing sounds terrible, I have to see it!!""... I really mean it this time, avooooooid it.

Being a fan of early Cyberpunk and apocalyptic films, that one was the truly great film.This movie is good, in it's own way. Most of the cast is known B-movie and character bit actors, people that I didn't have to strain myself to recognize. The premise is good, the action scenes are fun, the various lines have some great moments. But several of the big special effects scenes are weak, and the script is almost an entire copy of the original. While I haven't done it myself, I have heard that you can play New York and LA side by side, and have almost the same general events happening at the same time, down to where and how he gets injured. The only nod to this is having the police recognize Plissken's planned duplicity from his actions in the earlier movie.I would agree that the ending is a great one, especially the last scene, which I won't describe here. If you haven't seen it, this scene alone is worth the cost of buying this movie. (If you can't find it for less than seven and a half dollars, you're not looking in the right places.) But I'd make a point of having Escape From New York also.My final critique? It's a decent film, but if I had been able to recommend Kurt Russell doing a sequel to one of his John Carpenter films, I'd have voted for Big Trouble In Little China first, The Thing second, then Escape From New York.",Escape from L.A.

Certainly a bigger disappointment.EFNY is a proper dystopian stone cold classic. This is awful, forgettable. A cheap cash-in.John Carpenter calls EFLA more mature. What, Snake Plisken looking silly on a surf board? It's the Superman IV of the franchise. This movie doesn't take itself seriously at all, and is more like a comedy trying to be Big Trouble in Little LA. Not a dark scifi thriller. It's totally at odds with the gripping original.Special effects are horrible. They filmed it at night, but everything looks a little more...brighter and cleaner. Not dark dingy and sleazy like the first movie.The new characters are bland. At least in the first movie they all had a lot of depth and character to them, it was much better casting. Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasance, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes. Lots of good actors.More violence? Still have flashbacks of Snake planting that spike in the back of that ring fighters head in the first movie. The ending of EFNY is amazing with the chase on the bridge, much better than this. This ending was kind of predictable in this sequel.The whole soundtrack of the first movie is amazing from beginning to end. The atmosphere is just lost on this.The only disappointing thing about EFNY is that Carpenter didn't include the scene of what put him in NY in the first place, but at least it's on blu-ray in the extras now. I always watch that bit first even though it's not cleaned up.When I think of Snake Plisken, I can only think of EFNY. It is no wonder this flopped badly.

They just load the script into the word processor and replace ""New York"" with ""L.A"", ""Mr. President"" with ""Mr. President's daughter"", and you got it! Beside from originality, The movie suffers from creditability. Some scenes are obviously against the scientific laws. In the bright side, the movie has a very good ending, though quite similar to the first movie. The actions are better, the pace is much better. The environments and effects are comparable to the first movie. If you cannot get the picture, think of some high-budget B movies you see on the cable. It's about that.I recommend this movie for action fans that haven't seen the first movie (Escape from New York). But for those who have seen the first one, it's your choice. For those who are not action fans, I recommend you find something else. ""The Matrix"" (for post-apocalypse settings) or ""Platoon"" (for anti-politics theme) is a good start.",Escape from L.A.
179,recognizablethemes,"John Carpenter's Escape From L.A. is underrated 'Plissken looks ""so 20th century.""",10,2 October 2016,"The film exults in its imagination of the greater Los Angeles area as a ruined metropolis, with the Santa Monica Freeway well underwater and the Universal Studios theme park beset by real sharks instead of the Spielberg variety. In the action climax, Disneyland--stripped of its familiar branding following a corporate bankruptcy--is invaded from the skies as Plissken drops in, gun blazing. (It's not the movie of a man who's entirely happy with the machinations of Hollywood studios.) Carpenter later said he wanted the scene to be reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, which figures. With its aggressively whimsical dream logic, the only way this movie really makes sense is if Snake wakes up in Kansas in the final reel.What's memorable are the film's gaudy visions of excess. Escape from L.A. has a brighter and more colorful look than the resolutely dim Escape from New York, which may have been a deliberate decision to embrace a sunny Southern California palette, though I'm guessing it also had something to do with the presence of cinematographer Gary Kibbe, rather than the wizard Dean Cundey, behind the camera. The friendlier look goes conceptually with the picture's more overtly jokey approach.Escape from L.A. is at least partially model-led on westerns-- Plissken is actually described at one point as a ""gunfighter""-Pam Grier plays Hershe--it's pronounced like ""Hershey,"" thus it's an insistent play on race as well as gender. See, Hershe is a trans-woman with hairy 'pits and an uncharacteristically deep voice who used to be a buddy of Snake's known as Carjack Malone. When Snake finds her, he gets in close, runs his hand up her thigh to her crotch and declares, ""The more things change, the more they stay the same,"" before intimidating ""Carjack"" with the gun he found there. When she insists, ""I'm no longer Carjack Malone,"" he hisses in response, ""I don't give a f'ck what you are."" Yes, Plissken has story reasons for threatening Hershe. But, absent that greater context, the film plays here exactly as though Snake is threatening a hate crime.The surprisingly character-driven script, too, wouldn't fly today. Rather than focus on elaborate set pieces and action sequences, Carpenter, Hill, and Russell give their actors ample time to talk and double-cross each other.The most satisfying payoff of seeing Escape From L.A. today is in realizing that 1996 imagined 2013 so as to fantasize about regressing.",Escape from L.A.

People who loved Snake's camp in New York will love this. People who loved Snake for his bad-ass charm and the creepy moments in New York wont be as pleased.Snake's a regular action-here in LA. One-Liner's and angry sneers all the way. And the creepiness has been replaced with campiness... this is essentially a polished B-movie.Gotta love the villains.

181,absartist,It Could be a Hell of lot Better!,2,19 September 2021,"This movie, the 5th Element, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are the only movies from this cheese-crusted era of filmmaking I have in my personal collection. Normally I dismiss the majority of movies from 1995-2007 since they are over-the-top and rife with stereotypes more insulting than any slur, or offensive nickname. But I digress. EFLA intrigues me since it answers the question: ""What would John Carpenter's Escape from New York look like if it were made on the threshold of the actual 21st century?"" It's interesting because it shows the downfall of America. Not from nuclear missiles, or foreign invasions, but from the overzealous elements from within the government. We enter the world of an alternative 2013 (since the real 2013 was almost a decade hence) in which America is a Statzi-like police state in which every vice (including profanity, booze, drug, red meat, firearms, and extramarital sex) has been banned. Controlled by a right-wing Christian fundamentalist lunatic that's a cross between Pat Robertson, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-Un. A dictator...er um...President that is so deranged, depraved, and psychotic that he defends the U. S. with a satellite weapon that contains an EMP device that could bring the Planet back into the 1600s. Really? Brilliant strategy, Tsun Tsu. How did you manage to get that past Congress and the U. N.? Not to mention the fact, that thanks to his million-dollar security team, the Black Box that contains said Doomsday Weapon has been stolen by Lord Dictator Brylcreem's daughter. This is where Snake Plissken comes in. He has to get said Black Box and the Brylcreem's daughter back stateside in ten hours since the fascist overlords of the U. S. P. F (United States Police Force) has implanted a fatal virus into his bloodstream as extra incentive to finish his mission.I have to say it's a rather nice tour through post-apocalyptic Los Angeles from Universal Studios now an underwater attraction along with City Hall and the San Fernando Valley to Man's Chinese Theatre and the Beverly Hills Hotel. Speaking of which, Beverly Hills is now a hellscape inhabited by cannibals with facelifts. This is an interesting plot for a John Carpenter thriller alone. Bruce Campbell's cameo is an outright crime, who should've been the main villain or the second-in-command. This is where I begin to dislike this campy action romp that ""goes for broke"". To me, it's more broke. In Escape from New York, there is a foreboding atmosphere and aura of mystery, danger, and savagery. Here, it's all given away in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Why? Where the hell is the mystique? The enemy leader should be heard of but not seen until the last two acts of the film! Not only that, they brought this movie too close to home. Radical politics (either side) are running amok even in the White House, terrorists in possession of a nuclear device, and the government controlling every aspect of people's lives is kind of disturbing in 2021. Don't get me started on the ending, please. How is destroying the modern world going to solve anything? You'll have diseases that were once contained at the CDC and any bio-lab leak out into the open. Hospital patients on ventilators will die, planes crash, and so on and so on. What's worse is that Snake is the one who pushed the Doomsday button. So much for our hero, huh? Don't you think a proper sendoff is a war between America and the 3rd world? Nah.

187,samuraisuave,John Carpenter's Embarrassment,1,27 May 2008,"This is one of the dumbest movies I have seen in a long time. And I mean that; the stupid is just OVERFLOWING out of this film. I watched it immediately after watching Escape from New York, and be sure, this monstrosity of a sequel does no justice whatsoever to the first film.Let me do a recap of just SOME of the stupid for you: - The terrorist in this film is the PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER and she joins forces with a bad Che Guevara knockoff.In one of the opening scenes of the film Plisskin inexplicably tries to blow away two of the people sending him on his mission, despite the fact that he NEEDS THEM in order to carry out his mission. His gun makes a lot of noise but doesn't harm them, at which point the two people tell him, ""We thought you'd do that. That's why we filled your first magazine with blanks."" GENIUS! They totally KNEW that Plisskin would randomly try to kill them for no reason whatsoever.-Shortly after this scene, Plisskin embarks upon his journey to Los Angeles by way of a jet-powered submarine that can SOMEHOW GENERATE THRUST UNDERWATER (as if it were a a fighter jet) DESPITE THAT THIS VIOLATES BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS. While underwater, he puts the thruster into 100% overdrive, ignoring his commanding officers (the ones he randomly tried to kill earlier) who advise him that he shouldn't do so. What follow are shots of Kurt Russell in his submarine careening through one of the most laughably bad CGI sequences ever put to film. The highlight of this sequence is that, as Kurt Russell is underwater, he passes the wreckage of Universal Studios sign, and a giant shark comes out of nowhere and tries to eat the submarine, but misses it completely. The shark is completely unconvincing and wreaks of not only a poor special effects budget, but also a poor effort on the part of the effects team all around.-A scene in which Kurt Russell surfs a giant tidal wave in a sewer while AT THE SAME TIME Steve Buscemi is cruising alongside him in a hot ride. (I can't make this stuff up) -And finally, in order to save his life, Plisskin must earn 10 points in a basketball court. Plisskin DOES accomplish this heroic feat (we are literally shown Russell running up to the goal to make lay-ups) and yet the bad guy (the Che Guevara knockoff) STILL decides to shoot him, but remarkably, Plisskin just hops over the fence and escapes unscathed. (Also of note in this scene. We first see a guy who doesn't get 10 points, and so he is shot. The way this is done is so brainless... basically there are tons of set up right outside the fence, lining the basketball court. So picture the basketball court as a rectangle, and there are guys EVERYWHERE, on all sides of the rectangle, tons of them. Well, when they are ordered to kill the guy, EVERY ONE OF THEM fires blindly at the guy in the center of the court. If this movie had an ounce of intelligence, most of the bad guys would be dead from shooting each other!) -Toward the end of the film, Plisskin hangglides (along with Buscemi and the president's daughter) into a warzone, mowing guys down with a submachine gun, all the while remaining completely unscathed.Now rest assured -- if you consider yourself a connoisseur of the stupid, there is PLENTY more of it in this film. What I offered are simply SOME of the highlights. And no, none of this is intended as camp. I have SEEN camp, and this is not it. This is ATROCIOUS and indecisive writing that tries to do a lot of things and FAILS at everything. As if the barrage of stupid weren't enough, the plot is also incoherent and unclear.What really kills this movie for me is the wasted opportunity it is. Escape From New York was at its core an enjoyable movie that took liberties with reality but ultimately followed it more than it deviated. In EFNY, Plisskin was just a badass war veteran taking people out with his silenced TMP submachine gun. In EFLA, Plisskin is some kind of borderline comic book super hero with a trench-coat and placticized toy-looking guns that have no place in reality. Really, NONE of this movie has any place in reality, which made my suspension of disbelief IMPOSSIBLE. The events of EFNY were a little ""out there"", sure, but not to the extent that I couldn't suspend belief and enjoy things.EFLA is dumb trash, plain and simple. I don't even recommend this movie to hardcore EFNY fans as you have already seen this movie -- the GOOD version.",Escape from L.A.

Also Escape From L.A. is kind of timeless in a way that it satirizes all what America is known for, from motorcycle gangs, hookers, Hollywood agents, face-lifts, politics, freedom, violence TO implied peculiar American (created) all movie genres (sci-fi, action, comedy, western) to movie characters (typical US movies bad guys/good guys), music (typical western score, typical US orchestrated score), dialogues, typical US action movie scenes and especially parodying Hollywood stupid copycat sequels. You can find so much about America through this film, you just have to know how to watch it.Also i think the fact that the story of this film is only borrowed from EFNY is done partially on purpose because Russell & Carpenter wanted to do it with familiar story and highlight especially those aspects only characteristic to contemporary America and make fun of them. Carpenter did surely one of his best films ever that already no doubt surpassed his inferior classic Escape From New York. Gee what amazing piece of work Carpenter created do you even realize that?

The story is so silly that it is obvious that Carpenter was making a parody of EFNY (escape from NY). This is a great disservice to his fans as they saw him having an opportunity to expand upon the world of the first movie and only making fun of it in the end. It is obvious that Carpenter either had little time to contribute to the script or he just didn't care about the quality of the film so he just wrote a script that paralleled the original movie, and did a horrible job. Don't get me wrong - I am a huge carpenter fan which makes this even more disappointing to me. So if you are also a big fan of Carpenter's early works stay away from this one... and I guess you could say that for most of his later works too. I'd say the turning point was Mouth of Madness.

It is a shame that such a fun plot line was made into a dull predictable story there were to many minor plot twists that just were not interesting enough to follow, and the few great action scenes were just that, few. I do have to say that it was enjoyable to see Snake in action again. But when he stuck it to the man in the end, (what we want to see Snake doing), it was again poorly conceived. I don't want to spoil this as many may enjoy, but I will only suggest it if you are a big fan of ""Escape From New York"".P.S. I do recommend all other Carpenter/Russell movies",Escape from L.A.
195,Anarchiste,I laughed at how Hollywood doesn't understand guns at all!,6,7 October 2021,"There's a scene where a man is executed by gunmen placed in a circle around the guy. Think about it. In real life, if you want your guys to kill each other you ask them to do exactly that.The rest of the movie is a rehash of the previous movie, of course, but yu already knew that right?Not much to see here, but I guess if you saw Escape from NY, you should see it too.",Escape from L.A.
196,guilherme-alfieri,"It is not just a remake of ""Escape from New York""",8,24 January 2007,"The film has been critized unfairly as cosmetic remake of ""Escape from New York"". I don't share this viewpoint. There is something new in ""Escape from LA"". In the movie America is a high-tec ultraconservative Christian society. In addition to banning cigarette smoking, the society threw atheists and Moslins into the same garbage can as prostitutes and drug addicts.The other camp,'the enemy' is led by a Che Guevara-like type called Cuervo and he reminds of a typical image of a traditional Latin American 'liberator'. but he is as ruthless and cruel as his counterpart in Latin America.There is no bad guy and no good guy only the human race.I like particularly the final scene of the movie as a western like music was playing in the background Plissken finds a packet of cigarette with the suggestive name 'spirit of America',lights up a cigarette and finally inhales his Way out to Freemon,at least in his mind and says:-Wellcome to the human race.",Escape from L.A.
197,Atlvid,A comedy pretending to be an Action movie,1,21 June 2008,"On the one hand this movie is one of the worst of all time. But on the other it may become a cult classic. It reminds me of Plan 9 a bit in it's writing & execution. It could also be used in film school as to how to not make a sequel. They could have used the first 10-15 minutes of escape from NY in place of the opening, except just do a voice over of ""LA"" in place of ""New York"" and a little cheesy CGI of ""LA"" whenever ""New York was used"". That would of added another layer of cheesiness to the whole concept. I can almost picture them at the writing conference in trying to top each other with the oddest, strangest situations and escapes they could think of. On second thought, maybe they included all of their thoughts in the final script.",Escape from L.A.
198,zeterminator,The Worst I have EVER seen,1,13 October 2002,"Believe me I have seen some corkers of movies yet this is the worst. I must admit I enjoy some of the clichéd lines from films but this has some of the worst cringing ones, delivered by the terrible(in this film) Kurt Russell('My name's Plissken')also the basketball scene is awful, in fact all the scenes are awful, recently I have been trying to write summaries on some of my favorite films but it has proved extremely hard, as for drivel like this its easy....1/10",Escape from L.A.
199,DeathSlayer,Good But Not Better Than The First One,9,28 August 2003,When I First saw Escape from New York I thought Snake Plisken was a great character and Kurt Russell gave a great performance. Then when I saw Escape from LA I thought to myself good but as good as the first one. I found it shorter than Escape from New York but it had a lot of action which made the film good but the ending was dull.,Escape from L.A.
200,Janko,Has the right attitude,9,10 October 1998,"This is one of the most underrated films that I've seen in recent years. The audiences didn't like it nor did the critics. Well, they're wrong. You just have to love a movie with an ending like this. Even if the rest of the film sucked the ending would be enough to save it. Suck it doesn't but takes delicious digs at such American sacred cows like political correctness, the so-called moral majority, the institution of president and Hollywood itself. The action scenes are so over the top that it satirizes it's genre. Kurt Russell is great as Snake and can see that he's having fun playing him. If you go to church every Sunday, want to be a soldier when you grow up, have a crew-cut and think that Lynchburg is an apt name for your capital, you probably won't like this film. If these aren't your affinities you'll have loads of fun.",Escape from L.A.
201,George-47,Nothing but a 2 hour cigarette commercials,1,6 October 1998,"This movie was obviously funded by the tobacco companies. The gratuitous speech by the Snake at the end of the movie on the freedom to smoke was almost as nauseating as the smell of burning tobacco.Yet another, not so subtle, attempt by the tobacco companies to use movies to induce people to smoke. By associating the act of smoking with the act of ""defiant independence"" (one of our  Americans core beliefs, BTW). You subtly convert a lot of impressionable people, kids mostly, into thinking ""I want to show I'm independent, therefore I'll smoke.Parents, beware. Unfortunately, this subliminal advertising works.",Escape from L.A.
202,D Angel,Great Movie,6,20 November 1998,"I felt that this was a great movie.  Almost everyone in the movie thought that they could just push Snake around and he could do nothing to them, mainly because he was injected with a virus that would kill him in 10 hours unless he got the antidote.  In the end he goes back to the U.S. and gets completely even with them.  I think that if anyone was in the position that he was, they would do the same.  That is why I feel it is a great movie.",Escape from L.A.
203,dardass,Can making a basketball shot save Russell's career?,4,13 August 2003,"Wow.  I've seen it all now.  Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken saves his life by making a full-court basketball shot in this futuristic action movie. By making this shot, not only does he save his life, but he sways the interest of several hundred underground rebels who previously wanted him to be slaughtered and killed.  I can imagine one of them thinking ""Hey, I wanted this jerk to be maimed and destroyed, but hey! He's great at making a 100 foot basketball shot!  Let's chant his name!""  Of course, 10 minutes after the basketball scene, Snake goes surfing in the middle of Los Angeles with Peter Fonda.  I gave this movie a 2 based on the fact that it wasn't Soldier, and solely on that.  Kurt Russell seriously needs to stay away from futuristic action thrillers, or else he may have to ""take a shot"" to save his flailing career.",Escape from L.A.
204,connorisrad,Needs to be re made,10,8 June 2019,"Make this movie again, just as hardcore, same cast. Make it again, modern, even more evil/gorey",Escape from L.A.
205,nfu-41998,Great fun,10,13 November 2020,"No this is not Escape from New York. Instead it is great action, fun parody of the first film. Some excellent touches, fine acting and good direction. Bold, ambitious and BIG.... This movie is a classic.",Escape from L.A.
206,themovieraid,Can Be Good or Bad,7,31 March 2021,"Escape From LA is another adventure where Snake gets caught once again from the government forcing him to do a suicide mission in exchange for a pardon of all crimes he has ever committed in the U. S.If your familiar with Escape From New York this story is no different in comparison. Snake gets hurt the same way shown in New York, has to retrieve an important item and so fourth.This film can be coined more of a remake than a sequel, it can actually be a ""what if"" if the viewer isn't favored for Escape From New York and vice versa.Kurt Russell still sports the effort making this character but overall this film is basically a copy or a change of mind from John Carpenter.Don't expect this film to be greater or less it's pretty much a stand still of a sequel.",Escape from L.A.
207,spainrat1,Escape From New York was much better/L.A. is cheesy,1,23 February 2007,"I watching both movies, comparing the two is like comparing the real cities in life. Escape from NY is gritty, grainy, dark movie for it's time, the cast was perfect, and NY was at the time the most dangerous place to be in the late 70's early 80's. Escape from L.A. appears to once again redo a new york movie in order to appeal to Cali people,(death wish movies/out-of-towners etc/ crocodile Dundee in L.A.... and the L.A. remakes are always done poorly at that.Escape from L.A. seems cheesy, basically same plot, except like the Hollywood type of criminals in L.A. do not appear scary. Cuervo??? please??? the criminals in the movie were comical compared to the sense you got from the original. If you want a cult classic gotta love NY",Escape from L.A.

210,foxwilly,Worst Movie by John Carpenter,1,29 August 2003,This movie is one of the worst movies by John Carpenter. It borrows heavily from the Escape from NY movie without success. The plot is lame and the acting is non-existent. Lets hope there are no more Escape movies.,Escape from L.A.
211,tpaul369,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,1,30 August 2003,"It's been a long time since I watched a movie that has vied for my personal ""Worst Movie of All Time"" award. I had the displeasure of watching Escape From LA recently, and in spite of the fact that I was watching an astonishingly awful movie, I had to keep watching to find out if the movie would keep plummeting on it's downward spiral. Rest assured, it did.
I am admittedly a fan of the original Escape from New York. The original was dark and somewhat believable with an admirable supporting job by Lee Van Cleef. Escape from LA is essentially the same movie, moved to the west coast, and with the special effects possible in this day an age.
Note to self (and anyone else): Spending money on special effects does not equal a better movie.One last word on this movie - I think Escape from LA has one of the worst single scenes in any movie I've ever seen. I thought Jean Claude van Damme punching a snake (and knocking it unconscious) in ""Hard Target"" was bad, but watching Snake Pliskin ride a tsunami on a surfboard, then jumping into the back of a speeding car, may be worse.I'd advise watching this movie once, just to enjoy just how simply bad it is. But consider yourself warned.",Escape from L.A.
212,broncoi40,Ecape from the theater,1,26 May 2012,"When an actor can get a job, what do they do? A remake. I guess it's better than standing on the unemployment line. The copy/Paste key on the computer it's very useful. I was waiting for ""the duke"" to re-appear or ""Brain."" But then I remembered, they died in the original. The only one good thing was to see Valeria Golino,( God I love that woman) and ""Snake"" surfing :) HA HA HA. Was a Cuervo Jones using the duke's car with all the chandeliers? Wearing the same stop wrist watch. and the "" I am going to kill you, when I get back line?"" But, in the end what were we expecting? the title was ""Escapr from L.A"" so I think we should have expected the same movie with a different title",Escape from L.A.
213,liquid_snake0074,"Understanding the mind of Capenter. Don't 'watch' this movie, rather, LISTEN TO IT.",9,26 August 2013,"It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was, but then again, to appreciate it, you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first, which for many, wasn't possible, as sadly, most tend to look for the external eye candy, glimmer and glitz of HW today, rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes, Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens, T2, etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this, because that is not where is heart, mind and soul are placed. You see, you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time, Esquire, GQ, or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie, or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that...Many of his films focus on political and societal issues, and the schisms within our world, the main one being freedom vs tyranny, and those trying to break out of the current matrix, or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem, government isn't what it seems, laws aren't what they seem, and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended, due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996, which takes place in 2013, and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film (and its prequel), well, all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history, my friends.One of my favorite scenes in the movie, and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today, is with Snake and Tamisla (Valeria Golino, some will remember her from Rainman). She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim, which was criminalized after some time. Well, its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere, in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam, but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the anti-Muslim approach has been overwhelming today, with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of, as well as all the attacks on Christians today, where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon, want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops, which of course, is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases, with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools, prayers, the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle, and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet, the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people, unwanted and the ATHEISTS', are thrown into LA. Well, see, this is more hypocrisy, we because all know who the real atheists truly were, because if they were moral and real Christians, including the lunatic President, they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here, is a HUGE, and i mean, HUGE allusion to real life today.He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well, now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says, or practice whatever faith they like, without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see, Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie, when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission, 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well, its sad to admit, but yes, quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today, and that's a fact, jack.In the first film, you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake', when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see, he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self', or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them, which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end, when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake, i have a deal for you. A job, you and i, we'd make a great team'. Here, Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here, Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions, not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them, as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day.But these things here, is what Carpenter is touching on.Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all, take pride in your freedom, because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. :)",Escape from L.A.
214,ninjaplease,I don't know why this movie isn't one of the 150 worst.,5,16 February 2005,"First I would like to explain why I gave this movie a half way decent rating if I thought it was such a horrible movie. It has everything! Any stupid, strange thing that you could throw into a movie is right here. First off I know this is a sequel therefore the character must keep the same name, but Snake Plisskin?? What is he a ex-mercenary polish man? My skin shakes with fear! Moving on, I usually love Stacey Keach but he must have had a few Johnny Walkers too many while filming this stinker because his acting was hardly believable and unlike his drinks, watered down.Here are just a few scenes that I was laughing hysterically about when I first saw them. OK, the basketball game of death. They capture Snake and do not torture him or cut off limbs, they force him to play basketball for his life, which is not only way over-acted but totally unbelievable. The next scene that literally blew my mind was the surfing (out of no where) and then the jump from a board to a moving vehicle on the Los Angeles freeway. A horrible movie showcasing how desperate Kurt Russel has become.",Escape from L.A.
215,twicedying,For the fans,8,17 December 2007,"Personally, I just don't understand why many people hate this film?! So what, if the plot was almost identical to ""Escape from New York."" Did anyone expect Snake to play a house sitting father or a fisherman in the sequel? No! Snake is a trained killer and decorated war hero. It would seem appropriate for Snake to save the President of the United States for the second time. What else can he do? He can't do anything else but save or kill people with a bad ass attitude and this is why I thought Escape from L.A. was great! Not to mention, Kurt Russell returns as Snake Blissken. Russell has strong screen presence as Snake and his performance doesn't slow down. There was two cameos from Peter Fonda as the lonesome surfer and horror legend Bruce Campbell as the general surgeon. Steve Busemi, Cliff Robertson and Stacey Keach filled the rest of the supporting cast. The rest of the actors were played by ""no names"" but still gave decent performances. John Carpenter is excellent as usual and I don't think I need to say more about him. My only complaint about the film was the special effects. There was a few scenes in the film were I shook at my head in disbelief because the effects were that bad (Check out the surfing scene if you don't believe me). Also, the basketball scene was a bit cheesy. Although, if you watched ""New York"", you can find a few scenes that are mindless as well. All in all, as if you loved ""Escape from New York"" and Snakes Blissken's bad ass attitude, sit back and enjoy.",Escape from L.A.
216,jonas-mieschbuemier,Call me Snake...,7,7 January 2007,"The sequel to Escape from New York Starring Kurt Russell is one of the better Post Apocalyptic world action movies. To me Kurt Russell is a tough guy, and in this movie he is a little too tough, but thats just what he needs to be to engage the audience. The supporting cast is just as well known as the star itself going from Steve Buscemi as the know-it-all Map-to-the-stars-Eddie or Bruce Campbell as the LA Surgeon and they add some flare to the film. The films ending is original which is new to most mid-90's action flicks. So all in all i do recommend this movie to anyone who likes tough guys and smart one liners with a bit of suspense action at the same time.7/10 for me with a cast rating of 75% Watch for a late night action fest",Escape from L.A.
