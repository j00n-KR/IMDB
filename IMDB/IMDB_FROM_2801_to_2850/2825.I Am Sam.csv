0,SnoopyStyle,the movie tries very hard to annoy but can't stop rooting for family,6,27 June 2015,"Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is mentally handicapped. He has a daughter but the mother runs away right out of the hospital. He finds himself as a working single dad to Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning). He gets his reclusive neighbor Annie Cassell (Dianne Wiest) to help along with his mentally challenged friends. Calgrove (Loretta Devine) and the Department of Child and Family Services go to court with prosecutor Mr. Turner (Richard Schiff) and take Lucy from Sam. Sam finds Rita Harrison Williams (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the Yellow Pages who has trouble communicating with her own son. She relents to do the case pro bono.This is such a heart-wrenching movie. I really want it to work out for these characters but the movie doesn't make it easy to like it. The light comical tones get really annoying. Some of it is sort of cute but the movie really suffers from it. I don't want to laugh AT Sam and his friends. I want to laugh with them. And the movie is also trying very hard to manipulate the sentimentality. Sometimes less is more.While Sean Penn overacts sometimes, I still like his character. And who doesn't love Dakota Fanning's character. Pfeiffer is the overwhelmed working mother character. Then add Dianne Wiest to the mix. It's awkward at times. It tries way too hard but I want good things for all these characters. That carries the day for me.",I Am Sam

2,jboothmillard,I Am Sam,3,29 September 2017,"I knew this film was about a man with severe learning difficulties who has a daughter, and I know the leading actor and actress, but I did not realise it got mixed to negative reviews, it was a bit surprising, but I had to see what I thought of it for myself. Basically in Los Angeles, Sam Dawson (Oscar nominated Sean Penn) is a man with autism, a developmental disability, following the abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman who ""just needed a place to sleep"", he becomes single father to his daughter, Lucy (Dakota Fanning). Despite his limitations, Sam is well-adjusted, with a job working at Starbucks, a supportive group of friends with developmental disabilities, and kind, agoraphobic neighbour Annie (Dianne Wiest) who takes care of Lucy when he cannot. Though Sam provides precocious Lucy with a loving and caring environment, she surpasses his mental ability, he has a mental age of 7, other children tease Lucy having a ""retard"" as a father, and she is too embarrassed to accept that she is more intellectually advanced than Sam. After Sam's parenting skills come into question and the authorities threaten to take Lucy away from him, Sam is advised by his friends to approach high-powered lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer). Rita has a reputation as being cold and unfeeling, due to a brusque manner, fast-paced schedule and difficult personal life, to prove to others that she is not heartless, Rita surprisingly agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono. As they work together to secure Sam's parental rights, Sam unwittingly helps Rita with her family problems, including encouraging her to leave her cheating husband and repairing her fractured relationship with her son. Sam and Rita share an emotional moment, both feeling that they have never felt good enough to solve their situations, they sob and hug each other. At the trial, Rita does everything she can to prove that Sam could be a good father to Lucy, but Sam breaks down following the counsel opposition that he is not capable of all responsibilities of being a father. After the trial, Lucy is put in foster care, residing in a home with Randy Carpenter (Laura Dern), who does everything she can to prove herself as her new ""parent"", while Sam is promoted and finds a new apartment in the neighbourhood. Lucy continually escapes from her room in the middle of the night to go to Sam's apartment, she tries to convince him that they should run away, but he returns her to the foster home each time. Randy realises she cannot give Lucy the same love that she has for Sam, the foster family decide ultimately not to go ahead with adopting Lucy, she will return her to Sam, Randy will tell the judge that Sam is a suitable and better parent for Lucy, they also make an arrangement that Randy will help raise her. The final scene takes place at a soccer game, Sam is refereeing and Lucy is playing, Randy and the foster family, Sam's friends and newly single Rita and her son are watching. Also starring Loretta Devine as Margaret Calgrove, Richard Schiff as Mr. Turner, Brad Allan Silverman as Brad, Mary Steenburgen as Dr. Blake, Joseph Rosenberg as Joe, Stanley DeSantis as Robert, The Green Mile's Doug Hutchison as Ifty and Ken Jenkins as Judge Philip McNeily. Penn is just about passable about the disabled man with a passion for Beatles music, but it is obvious this performance is for vanity, Pfeiffer is a little stereotypical as the lawyer who learns life lessons through helping her innocent client, and Fanning making her big screen debut is alright. You could argue this portrait of mental illness is offensive, inaccurate and even unhelpful, the script is overly sentimental, it is only mildly funny in moments, maybe for the wrong reasons, and it is perhaps a little too long, you could just shun it is Kramer vs. Kramer meets Forrest Gump, or Rain Man, but I went with it, a sort of uncomfortable but not completely awful comedy drama. Adequate!",I Am Sam
3,moonspinner55,"Worthy sentiment, but the arty presentation is illogical and shallow...",6,18 August 2006,"Sean Penn plays a mentally challenged man whose close relationship with his smart 7-year old daughter is threatened by the local legalese after an encounter with a prostitute (!) and is pursued in the courts. ""I Am Sam"" exists in an almost alternate reality: nobody talks the way normal people speak, and many of the situations are manipulated to be effective, yet bear no resemblance to real life. Penn's performance is occasionally agonizing, but he is also extremely sensitive, intentionally funny and sad; Dakota Fanning is likably wise-beyond-her-years as his little girl. All the performances are commendable, but the script is a tangled mass of ideas that either don't work or don't build momentum (the hooker episode is just a pretense to get us into court, and it's execrably staged). The arty presentation (with herky-jerky cinematography and colors that are either cartoon bright or steely blue) is another liability, but the finale is moving and Penn's energy nearly makes it all worthwhile. **1/2 from ****",I Am Sam
4,Quinoa1984,"Better watch out, or Sean Penn will get you",3,10 February 2002,"Jessie Nelson's I Am Sam tells the story of, well, Sam, played by Sean Penn in a role where you can feel touched, frustrated or amused (depending on your cruelty to mental people level) from his work.  It's not his best work of the year (The Pledge, which he directed, takes that cake) and while he does try, he's in a story that is total sap.  The story takes him as a father who is able to take care of his daughter (Dakota Fanning who at times seems like the smartest person of the movie) until she turns eight, and then she is taken away from her.  This prompts him to get a probono lawyer (Michelle Pfieffer) who is a workaholic who through the course of the movie will learn the importance of family from her client and all that mumbo jumbo.  For fans of tear-jerkers, it's worth it I guess, but fans of Penn be warned, this is a bit too much to take (which is a sign for non-fans and non-tearjerker moviegoers).  Beatles covers don't help much either (why couldn't they just get the real songs?)  C+",I Am Sam
5,michaelRokeefe,The walrus looks for Lucy in the sky.,6,4 January 2003,"A wonderful movie about a mentally challenged man(Sean Penn)fighting for custody of his daughter(Dakota Fanning)who has been taken by the State to place in a foster home. The man seeks help from an attorney(Michelle Pfeiffer)to represent him in court. Penn is fantastic, but I'm afraid that Miss Fanning has that way about her to steal the show. Also in the cast are Brad Silverman, Dianne Wiest and Luara Dern. The soundtrack is most impressive featuring covers of Beatle's tunes by the likes of Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, The Wallflowers, Grandaddy and The Black Crowes. Delightful, funny and uplifting.

6,sunwarrior13,Sean Penn's Great Performance,9,1 October 2012,"I Am Sam is a drama written and directed by Jessie Nelson.It features Sean Penn as a father with a developmental disability, Dakota Fanning as his inquisitive seven-year-old daughter, and Michelle Pfeiffer as his lawyer. Dianne Wiest, Loretta Devine, Richard Schiff and Laura Dern appear in supporting roles. It is based on the real life story of Sam Mikkelsen.Sam Dawson is a developmentally disabled adult who has been working at a coffee shop and raising his daughter Lucy for seven years. Sam receives help in his parenting duties from a circle of trusted confidantes, including his ADD-afflicted best friend Ifty, the paranoid Robert , an agoraphobic neighbor, and his other disabled pals, Brad and Joe. Although he provides a structured and loving environment for Lucy that includes regular visits to IHOP, video nights, and karaoke, Sam's daughter is beginning to surpass him in mental acuity. When Lucy begins intentionally stunting her own growth so as not to hurt her beloved father, social worker Margaret takes action, removing the girl from her home and placing her in the temporary care of a foster mother, Randy. As the day of his hearing looms, Sam seeks out the aid of driven, obsessive lawyer Rita Harrison, who takes the case only to prove to her colleagues that she is willing to accept pro bono work. Opposed by county lawyer Turner in court, Rita gradually comes to care for her client and his daughter, even as they force her to consider the limitations of her own abilities as a parent.It is a film that characterized by great performances particularly that of Sean Penn; and of a great soundtrack consisting entirely of Beatles cover songs by such contemporary artists as The Black Crowes, Eddie Vedder, the Wallflowers, and Aimee Mann, among others.But unfortunately,it does not get the highest rating due to a somewhat contrived plot and it is somewhat manipulative and it oversimplifies some complex issues such as the illness experienced by Sam.",I Am Sam

8,Theo Robertson,Highly Manipulative Despite The Very Strong Lead Performance,6,22 November 2005,"I can't say I've ever been a fan of Sean Penn an actor some critics have labeled "" The greatest actor of his generation "" . I've followed his career for twenty years ever since he married you know who . I found him okay in WE'RE NO ANGELS while his performance in CASUALTIES OF WAR was so OTT he was in danger of going into orbit . In other words he's rather hit and miss but I was totally taken aback with Penn's acting in I AM SAM . All too often an actor playing a mentally or physically handicapped character lays it on with a trowel but at no point in this film did I ever believe I was watching an actor ( Far less an actor called Sean Penn ) playing a character called Sam Dawson - I was watching Sam Dawson a man with the mental age of a seven year old , a man working in a coffee shop , a man trying to bring up a baby daughter a real life person . I've never seen MYSTIC RIVER but I can't wait to see Penn's Oscar winning role if this is the type of character acting that he's capable of It's a pity that the only that's successful thing about I AM SAM is Penn's dynamite performance . Ironic too because if Penn's nuances are subtle everything about the movie is hammered home far too obviously . Jessie Nelson has a background in television or more specifically in television movies , but even the most naive TVM producer would baulk at this heavy handed story . As soon as Sam's partner has given birth she runs off holding the baby - I mean that in a literal sense so Sam has to bring up a baby that turns in to a young sweet child called Lucy Diamond . She is so sweet I'm surprised that everyone around her hasn't died from diabetes and I'm sure a few people who have seen this movie have needed insulin injections such is its sugary sentimental storytelling . I certainly feel like I'm getting emotionally blackmailed by Nelson into feeling for the characters which eventually feels like manipulation . Certainly I would have respected the film a lot more if there'd been a lightness of touch , a lightness of touch which is totally absent here . As it stands it's still worth watching because Penn's amazing performance",I Am Sam
9,grantss,"Great, incredibly moving movie",9,12 April 2015,"Great, incredibly moving movie. Starts off slowly, and confusingly, but gets better and better, and more emotional, as it goes on. Ending feels a bit rushed, but that would be the only criticism.Sean Penn gives a superb performance as the mentally challenged Sam. Deserved his Oscar nomination and very unlucky to miss out in the end (went to Denzel Washington for Training Day). Solid support from Michelle Pfeiffer as the tough-as-nails lawyer. Dakota Fanning is great as Lucy, Sam's daughter.Aided by a great soundtrack, consisting of covers of Beatles songs by various artists. Artists include Ben Harper, Eddie Vedder, The Black Crowes, Cheryl Crow, Rufus Wainwright and Ben Folds.",I Am Sam

11,Boba_Fett1138,"Annoying, stupid, over-dramatized, bittersweet drama.",4,1 November 2005,"Sorry folks but this movie was just plain bad! The story is incredibly over-dramatized and over-the-top sweet at times. For me this was a very annoying movie to watch.Even though Sean Penn is good in his role his character is far from a believable one. The way his characters acts and time and says some things makes his character totally unbelievable and perhaps a bit over-the-top at times. Really a horrible portrayal and perhaps at times even offensive portrayal of a mentally disabled person. There also is some totally misplaced humor in the movie with Sean Penn's character mentally disabled friends, which I found to be totally unnecessary. Thankfully there also still are some good character portrayals in the movie by Michelle Pfeiffer, Dakota Fanning, Dianne Wiest and Laura Dern.The movie doesn't only over-dramatize it also wants to be overly artistic at times. The camera-positions and style of editing are at times completely pointless. The camera-work in general is also too intense for a movie like this one. The intense camera-work by Elliot Davis worked for a kind of movie like ""Thirteen"" but is completely out of place in a drama movie like this one. I still like his style of lighting for this movie though.Another thing that annoyed me was the musical score by John Powell. The score was incredibly simple and had no beauty or what so ever in it. In fact it truly annoyed me at times and distracted from what was happening on the screen (not that much interesting or new was happening on it though).The movie is way too bittersweet. The movie has some totally unbelievable and over-the-top sweet and moralistic moments in it. The movie its intentions were good but it simply tries too hard to be emotional and dramatic in almost every aspect. The ending was also totally lame and left an incredibly bad aftertaste and was completely unsatisfying. Why so many people fall for this annoying over-dramatized movie really puzzles me.With currently a 7.2 rating, this movie is terribly overrated here on IMDb.com.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",I Am Sam
12,view_and_review,Tears You Apart and Pieces You Back Together,8,4 February 2021,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Losing Isaiah"" are my two favorite child custody movies (if I've ever even seen others). They are the two by which all others will be judged.Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) was a mentally deficient father of a baby girl with no wife or partner to speak of to help him. If I were to use the spectrum of mentally handicapped movie characters: Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man,"" Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump,"" Billy Bob Thornton in ""Sling Blade,"" Leonardo Di Caprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" Kevin Bacon in ""Digging to China, or Randy Quaid in ""Of Mice and Men;"" Sean Penn's Sam Dawson would be a Rain Man/Ricky Schroth (Kevin Bacon). He spoke more like Rain Man but had the dexterity with children like Ricky Schroth. Sam was able to, with the aid of his neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest), take care of his daughter for seven years. He made one costly mistake and the ubiquitous department of child welfare services stepped in to take his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning) away from him.To his credit, Sam didn't go down without a fight. He got attorney Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him pro bono. It wasn't an easy fight and it didn't go exactly the way Sam or Rita planned, but fight they did.""I Am Sam"" is a touching movie without even trying. How can your heart not be affected by seeing the brilliant and darling Lucy, who is wise beyond her years, enjoying the time with her very simple father? The subject matter alone is enough to extract tears, and it's only amplified by the two stars. Imagine how you felt seeing E.T. being torn away from Elliott.Each side is seemingly fighting for what's best for Lucy and it's no slam dunk. Sam is so honest, pure, and good you want him to win custody of his daughter. Besides, who can bear to see them split apart? But just because something is sad or painful doesn't mean it's any less right. Being a parent is hard for the most astute, most nurturing, most academically accomplished person, so what more for a single father with the aptitude of a seven-year-old? I'd hate to have to make the decision. This movie will tear you up before piecing you back together again, and I'm not mad.",I Am Sam
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,I just can't stop crying!,10,21 January 2004,"I loved this movie so much. It is so well acted and the actors were amazing. Every time I watch this movie I cry, the father/daughter relationship is so touching and wonderful. I would recommend this for daughters and fathers. Or for anyone else. 10/10",I Am Sam
14,MovieAddict2016,A great performance by Sean Penn in a good movie,7,11 July 2006,"""I Am Sam"" is a film with a main performance stronger than the movie itself. Sean Penn was Oscar-nominated for his role as Sam, a mentally retarded father who hires a savvy lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him in a custody trial involving his daughter (Dakota Fanning).The courts think Sam isn't fit to be a father due to his mental limitations, but Sam feels otherwise. As Pfeiffer begins representing Sam she realizes he is a good father and feels an emotional attachment to the case that she hasn't experienced when dealing with criminals and the sort.This film came out and received generally negative reviews in 2001, which I was surprised at considering it's an enjoyable movie. The performances are admittedly much stronger than the actual film (which has kind of been done in the past) - Penn deserved his Oscar nom and Pfeiffer is strong and perfect for the role of a lawyer.If you're a fan of the actors you should watch this, but if you don't like Penn or Pfeiffer you should be more reluctant since it's basically a performance film.",I Am Sam
15,sddavis63,Effective Performance By Sean Penn,7,25 November 2002,"I have to confess off the top that I am not and never have been a particular fan of Sean Penn. I have no specific criticism to make of him; as an actor he simply doesn't appeal to me. Because of that bias I approached this movie with low expectations. The story of a mentally handicapped man fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter sounded intriguing, but it starred Penn. But what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be!Penn is actually very good in this role. He brings a realism to the character of Sam Dawson, and portrays him sensitively and with real emotion. In fact, I thought the only performance that was better than Penn's came not from Michelle Pfeiffer (who disappointed me a bit, actually) but rather from little Dakota Fanning as Sam's daughter Lucy. She seemed so natural in this role, and I would hope that we see more of her in the years to come. Pfeiffer, on the other hand, (as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison) just didn't carry the role off that well, and even the courtroom scenes to me lacked the tension one would have expected from such an emotionally-laden issue.The movie weakens in the last little bit, going for the sappy (and highly unrealistic) ending - unrealistic particularly in the way Lucy's foster mother (Laura Dern) ends up handling the situation.Having said that, I still enjoyed this movie very much. It's raised my assessment of Sean Penn's acting abilities and I would recommend it to others and would watch it again.7/10",I Am Sam
16,ElMaruecan82,Sorry but the real world ain't no Beatles' song...,6,26 June 2017,"And that's why we loved ""The Beatles"" because their songs were invitation to a better world, one different from our reality. But Jessie Nelson's ""I Am Sam"" approach the Beatles like a real Gospel of life.This well-meaning drama is about the group's number-one fan: Sam, a Starbucks Coffee employee with the mind of a 7-year old child fighting for the custody of his daughter of the same age, needless to say that we're supposed to root for him. His lawyer played by a Michelle Pfeiffer, starts like your typical shallow, self-centered, publicity-seeking executive women who, learns in the process one thing or two about love. Love, that's the film's motto, the whole purpose of the film is to prove that one's ability to love is enough to raise a child.I'm sorry but as a parent of a four-year old little girl, it's not true. The film mixes up two elements in a way that insults intelligence: loving and raising. One is a matter of the heart, it's something of universal value that transcends the barriers, but rising is a practical thing, requiring a decent amount of both mental and physical ability. It is such a painstaking occupation you can't deal with it alone, whether you're Sam, a blind woman or even two parents. But this movie wants to make us believe that love is the one and only requirement. The premise is fallacious from the start.Critics pointed out that the film makes an effort to show a father capable of taking of her child despite his handicap. Actually, the film can't even afford to be manipulative, as it contradicts the very points it tries to make, some situations were so embarrassing that I started to question very early whether this film was serious or a joke? Starting with the birth, Lucy's mother doesn't even have a glimpse on her child and she leaves the hospital as if she had just thrown a used Kleenex on a trashcan. And Sam leaves the hospital with the baby in his arms!!!People leave a hospital with a baby in a Moses' basket or in the mother's arms if they're going to a car or a cab. That sight of Sam with little Lucy in his arms, in the middle of a subway, exposing her to all the germs of the world and with no one being ever worried about it, it could look like a kidnapping after all, killed all the film's credibility. If the point was to show a capable father, well it's a fail. Later, he can't understand why his daughter is crying and needs the help of Annie, the benevolent next-door neighbor, to tell him that she needs to eat every two hours.Didn't he know? Didn't he prepare her birth? Didn't he train from diaper-changing? Does this guy have any family? How much time did pass before Annie came? Before you ask too many questions, the film makes a convenient ellipse with the Beatles' music in the background (the musical leitmotif) Lucy grew up and turns out to be a bright little girl, played very well by Dakota Fanning. From this chronological leap, we've got to assume that nothing went wrong until she started to outsmart Sam, and refuses to learn anything to stay on his level.You can tell the writers needed to make this as pivotal as possible; he's also arrested in a weird scene involving a prostitute, which raises a social worker's attention. Loretta Devine plays the 'bad guy' part while we're supposed to feel in comfort when Sam goes buy shoes to his little girl, with his friends also suffering from mental handicap, some played by actors. Not every girl has a mother but I know shopping and buying clothes is a girl or a woman thing. I refuse to believe that Sam doesn't know any woman who could go have a woman-to-woman moment with Lucy. Seeing little girl surrounded by a bunch of grown-up adults talking weird isn't heart-warming, it is downright creepy.Or at least, that's what the directing applies, what's with all the weird camera short and hand-held filming (with some weird zooms), you can tell some parts want to make you 'aaw' well it's either embarrassing to watch or unintentionally funny. The performance of Sean Penn has been deemed as 'full retard' by ""Tropic Thunder"" and you can tell it's the kind of one-note approach that doesn't work in movies, especially since he's not always in the same level of smartness, he's capable of detecting hidden messages beneath the Beatles songs, but sometimes, he can't even handle a client in his Starbucks shop. His level of mental retard fluctuates according to the requirements of the plot.The whole experience of ""I Am Sam"" feels like someone tried to make a film in the same vein than ""Philadelphia"" with the subplot involving the lawyer. But even Michelle Pfeiffer can't save this and I thought she was too miscast, she's just too 'beautiful"" for that face; they made an effort to make her so appealing to the camera it was distracting. As for the message, well, we're supposed to believe that Sam is capable, because of the Power of Love.I'm sorry but I agreed with the prosecutor and in the one scene where he asked Annie a valid question about Sam's capability to raise Lucy when she'll reach puberty. Annie eludes the answer and asks him if he would (as if the issue was gender) and instead of asking the question again, the prosecutor turns into a sort of villain who asks a sensitive question about Annie's personal background. She cries, she becomes the victim, and the question is left unanswered.That's the film in a nutshell, too many good sentiments preventing the good questions to find answers while they're too obvious not to be seen.",I Am Sam
17,g-bodyl,All You Need Is Love!,9,16 April 2015,"I Am Sam is a very inspiring tale and an emotional movie that can be hard to watch at times due to the subject matter. Along with such films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape, this film tackles a very tough subject in mental illness and it creates a theme about how anyone can love, even if the person has a mental capacity of a seven-year-old. Sean Penn is at his best here as he delivers another fine performance, even if his performance is questionably full-fledged. This film is about a man named Sam who has the mental capacity of a seven-ear-old, works at Starbucks, and is obsessed with the Beatles. One day, a homeless woman gives birth to a girl with Sam as the father. The state fears that he is incompetent as a father and take his daughter away from him. Now Sam enlists the help of a hotshot lawyer named Rita to help him win the case. As said before, Sean Penn delivers a magnificent performance. People have questioned his performance, but the purpose of acting is to become a different character and that is exactly what Sean Penn did. Michelle Pfieffer delivers a strong performance as the lawyer, Rita who learns the lessons of love along the way. Dakota Fanning musters a strong, natural performance as Sam's daughter. Finally, Laura Dern does a good job as the foster mother. Overall, I Am Sam is the kind of film that teaches people to love all over again. If you have any children, remember to say how much you love them. This is a drama that could take place in reality, thus giving the movie even more of an emotional bite. A very good, powerful movie thanks to Sean Penn's effective performance. My Grade: A",I Am Sam
18,secondtake,"Both strained and touching, improbably and likely...give it a shot!",7,1 July 2010,"I Am Sam (2001)Take the cutest little girl you can imagine, and a father who loves her to pieces, and then have the world connive and convince itself that the best thing for the girl is to take her away from dad.That's the best worst part of this story. And Sean Penn, as Sam, makes a completely lovable and convincing dad. It's so heartwrenching and heartwarming, it's a joy. And it adds one extra element, a central one--Sam is mentally retarded. And Penn plays Sam, to my sense of it, brilliantly. Dakota Fanning is the archetypal sweet kid, too, so there we go.I wish that was the whole story. The movie is troubled by how it's made. It pushes comic moments too hard and sentimental ones with too much calculation. And any number of elements can be ticked off that are more than just distractions. For one, there is a steady stream of improbable events--just slightly improbable, but it's hard to keep looking the other way at how, say, the foster care system really would work, and so on. Michelle Pfeiffer, for her part, is offkey as a snotty rich lawyer forced to come to Sam's aid. There's the fact Sam is far too alone with his troubles, without family, without any social support at all (not counting his tight group of friends, more on that later). There is also an odd tone throughout, partly glib and partly probing, and partly very weepy sentimental. It's an odd mix. The tale also too long by half an hour at least.But when it works, if you can get past the manipulations, it works great. I found myself crying, I'm not sure why, maybe with empathy, or just sadness at the state of an individual's world. I even came to see the obvious charms of Sam's disabled friends were also metaphors for the range of problems we all face. The neighbor Dianne Wiest has a brief but affecting role. Likewise, Mary Steenburgen as brief witness. And then there is the metaphor (again) of the Beatles, all in cover versions, known in detail by Sam. The group, the real Beatles, really do become a lens on this father/daughter dilemma, and the meaning of life. I love this movie for what it does right. It's beyond merely flawed, but it has something very beautiful bubbling between all the flaws.",I Am Sam
19,UniqueParticle,Sean Penn should've won the Oscar that year!,10,24 September 2019,"Watching on HBO and we still have on VHS in a box which is epic! I resonate so well with this due to having ASD and I truly believe Sean has a disability seeing this. Also Doug Hutinson is a side actor in this that I love in many roles. This is the closet thing to full blown Asperger's and it gives me tears during so much of it. It's a true shame Sean Penn didn't win for I am Sam, he did such a riveting performance - so heartwarming and the perfect tearjerker!!",I Am Sam
20,Anonymous_Maxine,Genuinely heartwarming but truly unrealistic...,8,10 March 2008,"The overarching tendency that I noticed in I Am Sam is that it is so good at making the audience root for Sam and his daughter Lucy to be able to stay together, but the better it is at that, the further it gets from reality. Very little is revealed about Lucy's conception beyond the fact that she was born from a homeless woman who ""only wanted a place to sleep."" Granted, we don't need graphic details, but it's pretty hard to imagine Sam being involved in sexual or even romantic situation, much less being in a position to offer someone a place to sleep. The guy literally can't make a cup of coffee. Nevertheless, Lucy comes into the world and, despite having the ""mental capacity of a 7- year-old,"" his love for Lucy is real and he desperately doesn't want to lose her. Where the movie really gains sympathy and is heartwarming is in Sam's struggle to understand why she's being taken away. He just wants to spend time with her and play with her and read to her and simply can't grasp what's so bad about that.I Am Sam is an actor's film. It's all about Dakota Fanning's performance as Lucy and Sean Penn's performance as Sam, both of which are astonishing. What is the deal with Dakota Fanning, by the way? I can't understand that girl at all. She is one of the only actors I've ever seen who so consistently turns in nearly flawless performances, even in the otherwise disappointing Man On Fire, in which the managed to steal the show even from the great Denzel Washington. The girl was born in the mid-90s, for crying out loud! The main problem with the film is that, while it's tremendously effective as a heartwarming tear-jerker, the bad guys are right. The lawyers fighting to have Lucy taken away and put into a foster home are portrayed almost as movie-villains, when in fact what they are fighting for is, in fact, in Lucy's best interest. It's not a genuine flaw, as I'll explain later, but I can understand the criticisms.It's not the best thing in the eyes of an 8-year-old girl or in the eyes of a movie audience, but in the real world, it's true that a man who struggle to read anything more complex than Dr. Seuss will have significant difficulties raising a daughter more than literally a matter of months after the age we see her in the movie. When Lucy wants to learn to drive or has boyfriend trouble, she will likely be much less interested in, as Ebert pointed out, helping her father with her own homework.But what the movie definitely does right is that, even though it's based on a massive fallacious myth (""Love is all you need"" is not at all true in any kind of relationship, parental, romantic, or otherwise), it does show the importance of people coming together to help each other. It's a thin line, but the movie is not about love, it's about caring. It's about everyone doing what is best for everyone else, not everyone doing what is best for Lucy, because that can be the worst thing for other people and, in turn, a terrible thing for Lucy. Laura Dern's character, Randy Carpenter, is introduced as a foster mother for which Lucy has not the slightest hint of affection (""My dad's coming. Why don't you just go do something...""), and presents a stern front when Sam arrives. She sees him as a bit of a threat to her, in that he doesn't understand her emotions and needs, but as she begins to understand the relationship between Lucy and her father her tone changes by the end. Sam can't raise Lucy alone, and many people have criticized the movie for this, but it should be noted that the movie also understands this. It ends in the only way that it should (and the only way that it could, as it were), and even though, like As Good As It Gets, it ends with the feeling that more difficulties are just around the corner, we get what we want. It's flawed but it's a huge achievement as well. And it's a great date movie!",I Am Sam
21,meeza,I am touched but I am bored!,7,3 October 2002,"Aaaaaaa! Wham Bam Thank You Sam! Or should i say Sean for delivering a very sweet performance as Sam the mentally challenged parent fighting for custody of his daughter in `I Am Sam'. Sean Penn, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, is able to once again portray his acting diversity. Too bad those screenplay writers and the director were disabled to provide us a constructive story-line. Michele Pfeiffer, who portrays the `so-called' pro-bono lawyer who defends Sam, proves again why `she is Michele'. Also, Dakota Channing delivers a very effective debut performance as Sam's daughter , which everyone in the north or the south should see Dakota's performance. I am glad I saw Sam for the acting but I am not glad I saw Sam for the filmmaking. *** Average",I Am Sam
22,davispittman,Some of the best acting I've ever seen....,8,30 August 2017,"I Am Sam is a 2001 film starring A list actors: Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Dakota Fanning. The films cast and their abilities is a very big part of why this movie works well. Sean Penn delivers one of the best performances of his entire career. He plays the mentally handicapped father role so well. And Michelle Pfeiffer plays the hardened going 24/7 lawyer who gets softened by Sam. And she does it beautifully. There are some scenes where Pfeiffer and Penn just absolutely steal the show with their performance and you are completely memorized by them, that's what makes this film so good. And Dakota Fanning is very impressive for her age here, she handles dramatic heavy scenes very well and that's probably why she has gone on to continue a successful Hollywood career. The writing is good overall, I will say that the script isn't the strongest thing in the world but it is good. I think the screenplay and the execution of the plot takes a little bit of a backseat to the magnificent performances given. But that doesn't mean that the screenplay is weak, because it's not. Overall, I definitely suggest I Am Sam to any and everyone! It's a touching well done film about love and connection. 8/10.",I Am Sam
23,Spleen,"If you only loathe one film this year, loathe this one",1,18 September 2002,"Sam is insufferable. He's stupid (to the extent that these things can be measured, his mental age is that of a seven-year-old), he's intrusive, he's loud, he never shuts up, he BROADCASTS his every trivial thought in a monotonous braying voice, he throws tantrums the instant he fails to get what he wants. True, he's not this way by choice. He's mentally retarded and cannot help it, but that doesn't make him any more endearing, or capable of raising a child. Yet we're asked to believe that nobody could have been or could be a better guardian of his daughter than he, and we're also asked to endure his constant, grating presence for two hours. And when I say ""constant"", I mean it. There's not a single scene that Sam is absent from until two hours in, and even then, it's only a brief respite. Before that I doubt he's absent from the SCREEN for more than five consecutive seconds. I can't be sure; the movie was so unbearable that I had to walk out three times to gather the strength to sit through the rest - I HAD to, I had no choice. How many bad movies are quite THAT bad? It's true, I walked out entirely on ""Showgirls"" and ""Thumbelina"", but that was years ago; my stamina has improved since then, and I would not walk out on such movies today.The product placement is about as blatant as it gets (if it seems otherwise, this is only because the constant manipulation, the contrived plotting, and the cardboard-cutout nature of Michelle Pfieffer's character are, somehow, even more blatant). What did the studio get, in return for placing Starbucks in every other frame? My guess: unlimited coffee for the cameraman and the editor. They mangle the footage as though they're ashamed of it, which they have every right to be, and when there's an ESPECIALLY weak scene, the camera goes positively berserk.",I Am Sam
24,Movie-ManDan,I Feel Bad.,3,7 January 2015,"I Am Sam is one of those overly-sappy, over-the-top dramas. It is one of those very sad movies that are out there for the sole purpose of making you cry. Not only did I not cry (I didn't laugh by any means), but I was confused as there are many instances that just simply come out of the blue and are not fully explained. The acting is fantastic, but the plot is low and weak.In one of the best roles in his illustrious career, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam Dawson. He makes his living working at Starbucks and has an entourage of four other men at his intellect. There is one scene where Sam is buying shoes for his daughter, Lucy (Fanning) and is a little bit short on bread, so his friends each pitch in some money to help Sam pay. I love that scene, as it is cute and funny, yet cheesy in a good way. I wish that more scenes were like that.Sam lives in a nice apartment with his daughter whom he loves more than anything. It never fully states how Sam had Lucy because he is a single father with a very low IQ. It briefly mentions that he knocked up a homeless girl and he does have run-ins with the law about solicitation, so I figured that he knocked up a hooker. It just never made sense to me that that would happen. Sam is too innocent to just be fooling around with just anybody. I guess it is possible, I just highly doubt it.We do see Sam and Lucy having good times together as well as Sam and his buddies having fun. Only, those bits are very brief. Most of the early scenes show Sam embarrassing himself and Lucy, and having run-ins with the law. I know that Sam is mentally challenged, but he embarrasses Lucy and himself is some bits that are unpleasant. Like there's one scene where he has a tantrum at a restaurant because they don't have his favourite breakfast. I really felt embarrassed for Lucy. Then there is the scene where the movie takes off and the plot fully begins. Sam is arrested a Lucy's birthday party and is sent to live in foster care as Sam loses custody. I always hated that scene because the cops show up just out of the blue to arrest Sam on past things that have been dropped like solicitation. Would they really just arrest a mentally challenged man like that even if they had a warrant? That scene never clicked for me. Sam decides to fight for custody as he hires an expert family lawyer (Pfieffer) who actually is laughable. She is the stereotypical and over-the-top, paranoid, workaholic mother. She does do a fine job of acting, but her character is often funny. The ending is confusing to some, but its all how you interpret it.I have always been on the fence about the general premise. Sam has the mental capacity of a 7- year-old and Lucy is holding back as she herself is 7. I know that Sam is loving and caring and patient, but he can't take care of himself. He can't teach Lucy the facts of life or guide her. Lucy would be the one taking care of Sam when she's like 10. No child should be a parent at such a young age. Her foster family has regular parents and a mother figure the Lucy needs. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the whole movie itself has always made me question things.I have experience with mentally challenged people, I found this movie to be a little bit of a mockery. The regular people are painted as even worse off than Sam in terms of intellect. Sean Penn does a dynamite portrayal and the acting in general is good, but the movie is too sad, unrealistic, unclear, and sometimes insulting.1.5/4",I Am Sam
25,eric262003,Has Moral Messages One Could Learn From,9,9 June 2014,"After watching ""I Am Sam"", I cannot say that I did not leave the theater with tears in my eyes while having a more better view of the life that we live in whether good or bad.Under the careful direction by Jessie Nelson (""Corrina, Corrina"") shows an accurate portrayal which has its fair share of excruciating cringing moments. I will not elucidate too much on the plot points, but the realism in this film is about as good as it gets. I understand that there are a sporadic few mentally challenged people who are able to conceive, let alone have to go through the complicated initiative to raising a child single-handedly. But then again, there are many non-handicapped people who are not adept to raising offspring. But in this day and age of unpredictability, the situation depicted where the dominating factor gets the call to determine what's best for the welfare of the child who is unfortunately caught in the middle.Sean Penn who has played a cornucopia of performances over the the last 30 plus years plays the role of the titular character Sam Dawson, a loving caring, father and Beatles aficionado, is raising his seven year old daughter Lucy Diamond (Dakota Fanning). Penn played his role splendidly, almost up there with other mentally challenged characters like Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman), Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) and Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson). Many performers though have attempted to play mentally disabled individuals, but often times failed. Pen succeeds in keeping our interest through and he shows that even the most underfed minds are still humans and that nurturing a child is not rocket science all you need is loving heart and the will to step up deserves some kind of credibility (think of all those deadbeat dads who abandon their kids and tell me who's incapable of rearing kids).Lovely Rita Harrison Williams (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a big-shot Civil Dispute Lawyer is not up to par with the roles she's played in the past, but still succeeds to make this movie all the more special. She's very important in providing the message that not all the money in the world, all the riches of our universe and all the fame that comes with it can never usurp the love of a child. The message is pretty obvious and it is something we can all take into deep thought.If there is one thing that really irks me about this movie was the very grim portrayal of the Social Service Department as an unmerciful group of corporate shrills who care nothing more then to take advantage to the easily vulnerable and to deprive him of the one person in this world he truly cares about and maybe the only person who cares about him. I get frustrated every time I see their smug faces, but I guess every story needs an antagonist/s. I guess we've all had those snooping neighbours who calling Social Services for reasons justified or unjustified. And yes Social Services will always be scorned for getting involved in affairs that is not of their concern. And have built a solid reputation of breaking up families either for better or for worst, either way it is 90% of the time negative.This is truly a very excellent and deserves special attention one must reconsider. The theme of ""I Am Sam"" will have you in laughter and tears, but will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through. With legions of fan support of Sam's other mentally blocked friends and an agoraphobic neighbour played by Dianne West, it illustrates that it's better to be loved by simple-mind rather than not being loved at all.",I Am Sam

It was kinda disappointing, if you think about it. This film is not very good but it's good without getting bad but this is a great film all about loving people.The acting by Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer were exceptionally great, while others like Dakota Fanning and Loretta Devine were okay.The cinematography was good.

First of all, Sean Penn's performance is awesome! He really look a mentally challenged person in all his acts and ways to move and talk! Michelle Pfeiffer also has a great performance and is very beautiful in this movie as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison.Sam Dawson is a mentally retarded man, who has the same capacity of a 7 year-old child..He works at a Starbucks, loves the Beatles( his favorite band) and one day has a normal daughter with a homeless woman, who abandons him and her daughter when she has the chance. Sam takes care of his daughter, who he gives the name Lucy Diamond, with the help of his friends, specially Annie.( a piano teacher who is his neighbour) But time is passing, and when Lucy reaches 7 years old she understands her father is not *normal* and intentionally tries not to be smarter than him,what makes her have problems in school. The Social service takes her away to another family, and Sam needs the help of a lawyer to win the case.

28,wisewebwoman,A good cast wasted,5,2 September 2002,"And, I wonder, why on earth they would choose to be in this movie.The premise starts out well in the first third but in the next two thirds, my disbelief meter went through the roof.How on earth could the caring prosecutor who had the child's best interests at heart be made the BAD GUY?Sean's performance I found deeply offensive, slackmouthed, ceiling staring, loping. A guy who can't handle a blender in Starbucks manages to lease an apartment, keep it clean and presumably cook and do laundry for his daughter.I found all of the characters to be drawn in that black and white mode so beloved of Hollywood. Michelle, a frantic lying workaholic parent, becomes a better mother, an agoraphobic leaves her apartment for the first time in decades, life, as in Forrest Gump, is not here "" a box of chocolates"", but "" An all you need is love"" and the Beatles.I was anxious to see what should have been a key scene, where Sam is awarded custody of his daughter, but this is mysteriously omitted. I am not surprised. No judge in his right mind would award a child to this man without a responsible adult being an integral part of his life.5 out of 10 for the performance of the actress who portrays Lucy (Dakota Fanning) so beautifully.",I Am Sam
29,MR_Heraclius,One of my favourite movie,9,24 February 2020,"This film goes to show you that often critics lose their humanity and writhe in puddles of their own egotistical nonsense. This is a great film with a brilliant performance by Sean Penn (who broke the rules and went full retard). I wouldn't put it up there with Rain Man, but this is still a great film. Michelle Pfeiffer wishes every film she was in was like this, and Dakota Fanning is cute enough to get away with playing the same role she played in every film she did as a child: the little girl who's too smart for her own good.",I Am Sam
30,KUAlum26,"Manipulative,thy name is I Am Sam",7,3 September 2006,"Sam Dawson(Sean Penn,attacking the role like a hungry dog to meat)is a basically gentle soul who loves the Beatles and works in a Starbucks in a large city(San Francisco?Seattle?New York?the filmmakers weren't very clear). He raises and adores his beautiful and very smart daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning,wise WELL beyond her eight years here)and lives with his best buddies,a foursome of similar guys who help him out of situations large and small. This would sound pretty ordinary,save one less-than-minor fact:Sam is retarded(they say he's Autistic,but I've been around Autism before. In fact,my brother is Autistic,Sam is HARDLY Autistic),albeit high-functioning. He had his daughter with a homeless loser of a woman(in details made quite fuzzy,besides the obvious),and even though he is a responsible and can-do sort,his retardation begins to come to a head with the fact that his daughter,who's barely in grade school,is reaching an intelligence that exceeds his. Naturally,authorities are notified and the state steps in and aims to take away Lucy and place her in foster care. Not willing to let the child he's bonded with(and has bonded with him)get away,he pursues,wears down and wins over the help and advocacy of a high-priced attorney(Michelle Pfeiffer),who sets out win his case as sort of the pro Bono case that she's not known for handling.Director and co-writer Jessie Nelson puts into motion this sweet and basically moving movie,but the direction and writing of this film is so heavy-handed in making you root for Sam,Lucy and his friends and conversely boo and hiss the Social services(Social workers are about as often portrayed as heavies or villains in films as much as lawyers or bankers,it seems)and the attorney working with the state that it makes someone like me feel as if I am being forcibly drawn into this film. As a younger lad,I might've not minded those tactics so much,but as an older lad who's seen his fair share of movies,this doesn't sit too well with me at all. Rain Man was FAR better at portraying the mentally-disabled-trying to-adjust-in-the-outside -world-film than this one does.I've said it before on other films,and I'll say it here:the acting is really what makes it interesting and thus watchable. Penn,who,whether you love or hate the guy,his politics,etc.,is maybe over-the-top here,but he still is able to make this role his for the entirety,and he does his best when he's with Fanning,who is a prodigy here. His friends,played by character actors Doug Hutchinson,Stanley DeSantis,Joseph Rosenberg and Brad Silverman,nearly steal their scenes as the also mentally handicapped support base that lends support to Sam in any way they can. Pfeiffer,however good she generally is(and I believe she is),however,seems like she's acting in another movie here,and her transformation from cold,calculating lawyer to soft-hearted crusader to the underdog seems to be ill-transitioned.Natch for Laura Dern's at once jealous and hard-headed,then repentant,foster parent. To me,this show is most at fault by the direction and writing,where it doesn't seem to trust that you,the audience,will get the point about who to root for and who to root against,making sure the Social worker(Loretta Divine)and the state attorney(Richard Schiff)in particular are such cold,arbitrary and heart-less professionals that one would have to be pretty cruel and insensitive to not be taken aback by their methods of trying to discredit the hero.A sweet-natured film with interesting imagery,this film IS worth a look,but you should be ready to have this film try to squeeze the emotions out of you with extreme prejudice.",I Am Sam
31,BrandtSponseller,Wow!,10,15 June 2005,"I know that title isn't very descriptive, but all I could say for awhile after watching I Am Sam was, ""Wow!"" Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture. I believe I was served some kind of raw beef, and I have an exorbitant dry cleaning bill from the tomatoes and rotten eggs.But I won't bill director/co-writer Jessie Nelson, because it's not her fault that her film is so powerful and so stunningly constructed that it made me monosyllabic. I can only blame myself for putting off watching her work for so long.I Am Sam begins with Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) at his job. He lives in Santa Monica and works at Starbucks. We can see that he's mentally retarded. He appears slightly autistic. Because of this, he's given only menial tasks to do. Suddenly, his boss tells him that he has to go. We see Sam running through the streets, catching buses and so on to end up at a hospital. A woman is in labor and it turns out that he's the father, but she wants nothing to do with him afterward--apparently, it was something like a one night stand. She abandons him with the baby. Aided by a quartet of developmentally disabled friends and his agoraphobic neighbor, Annie Cassell (Dianne Wiest), we see Sam doing his best to raise the girl, Lucy Diamond Dawson (eventually played by Dakota Fanning)--so named because Sam is a big Beatles fan. At least until he is ""accidentally arrested"". Government officials question his ability to raise his daughter, and I Am Sam becomes the tale of Sam's legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by high profile lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer).I Am Sam will likely make you say, ""Wow!"" afterward because it is a masterpiece on every artistic and technical level.All of the major cast members give one of the best performances of their careers, and many of these actors have had a number of artistic triumphs on their résumés. Sean Penn is completely natural and believable as a developmentally disabled man. Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled, having been found at L.A. Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her co-writer, Kristine Johnson, spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research, as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7. Wiest, Richard Schiff, Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep, multifaceted histories, despite their relatively little screen time.Nelson approaches the film with a number of unusual artistic and technical angles that all work wonderfully. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work. Unlike similar attempts in films such as Lars Von Trier's Dogville (2003), the hand-held work never feels affected or intrusive here--it's completely ""organic"". The most common purpose of the unusual cinematography is to give the viewer almost a subjective sense of what it's like to be Sam, to experience the world in the way he does. Cinematographer Elliot Davis moves his camera in a way closely mirrored with Sean Penn's movements. There's an additional emotional symbolism. When Sam is feeling agitated, the camera-work is agitated. Likewise when Sam is confused, pensive, and so on. Davis shoots from a lot of unusual angles. All of them work.Nelson also has the editing, lighting and production design match the aesthetic of the cinematography. The editing is sometimes very choppy, but always feels ""natural"", just right for conveying Sam's experience. Sometimes there are odd incongruencies between sound and image, or between temporal sequences. The lighting, camera angles and production design often make some elements appropriately fantastical. The production design and costuming match not only Sam's world, but other characters' worlds, as well. Not one aspect of the film seems to have gone by without close examination and artistic justification.The music, which largely consists of Beatles tunes performed by other artists, fits the film perfectly. Sam and his friends are all a bit obsessed with the Beatles (and apparently, so were many L.A. Goal members when Nelson visited). The Beatles tunes exquisitely match the various moods of the film, and the lyrics often complement emotions and actions.But even above all of that, I Am Sam tells a heart-wrenching story that's something of an exciting, emotional roller-coaster. There are many humorous scenes, often centered on Sam and his buddies going about the world with a kind of Winnie the Pooh-like wisdom that seems more honest and admirable than most of the film's ""normal"" folks. Of course, there are also many scenes that will require tissues for tears. And there's just about every emotion in between the two.Finally, the film has a great message. Does parenting, or general personal worth, really hinge on intellectual ability and amassed knowledge? I don't think so. Parents who are very smart can have more than their share of flaws, as we see with Pfeiffer's character early on. Plenty of us had parents who were smart enough but couldn't help us with our geometry homework. Love may not be all you need, but it's definitely one of the major prerequisites.",I Am Sam
32,film-critic,Do we get balloons?,9,17 September 2006,"I did cry during this film. There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was. I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily. I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it. I am here to say that I was wrong. For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film. Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing. I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a cliché Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest. Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully. Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career. Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented. I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.On the apparent level, I Am Sam works because of Sean Penn. As I watch more and more of this actor's body of work, I cannot help but be continually impressed. Penn brings more to the screen than any other actor could imagine. His presence, in my eyes, dwarfs Hanks and Cruise phenomenon. Penn is constantly surprising us with challenging roles that fluctuate between light and dark. He is not focused on one genre, but always impressing with his ability to move between films. One will never quite know what he has in his back pocket until we see him on screen. He is that impressive. I believe that it was also the aid of Dakota Fanning which gave Penn the strength to be the character that he was. For her first feature film, Fanning came out with the prose and professionalism that has nearly gone missing in Hollywood. She stood up, worked with Penn like they had been companions for a lifetime, and succeeded in giving us the emotion this film desperately deserved. She was an element of I Am Sam that was needed to bring a human element to Sam, and she did it with the greatest of ease. I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern. They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film. Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer. I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the cliché walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast. There was a level of annoyance with her as well. The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me. I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better. She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work. Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar. I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them. The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film. The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film. This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning. This is much different than your typical courtroom film. I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film. Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for. I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema. Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.Overall, I thought this was a surprising film. I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie. I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play. I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel. The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film. I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing. I think you will be just as surprised/shocked as I was!! Grade: ***** out of *****",I Am Sam
33,mattymatt4ever,VERY POWERFUL FILM!!!,9,3 July 2002,"""I Am Sam"" has its flaws.  This is not a perfect film.  This is not a masterpiece.  Then why am I ranking it so highly?  Because of the way it made me feel.  It took me on an emotional rollercoaster and allowed me to ponder a lot of questions I've taken for granted in the past.  This movie proves the saying, ""People will always forget what you say, but they'll never forget the way you make them feel.""  This movie has its flaws and I'll get to them later, but I can only name them because the movie is still fresh in my mind.  I'll probably forget them later.  But what I will never forget is the way this movie made me feel.  I'm not a law expert, so I wouldn't know if a mentally challenged man like Sam Dawson would legally be able to take custody of his daughter.  But the law is not the issue.  The issue is, Does Sam DESERVE to take custody of Lucy?  And I watched those touching scenes between Sam and Lucy, I couldn't help but feel, ""Yes!""  In the courtroom scene where Sam cries out the line, ""Why isn't Lucy coming home with me?"" I couldn't provoke myself from bursting into tears. 
Sean Penn is an incredible actor, with great standards.  I look forward to any movie where he's the star.  Penn's the kind of actor who actually waits for a good script to come along, and will turn down a bad script even if the director offered him 20 million dollars.  The thing that intrigues me about Sean Penn is that he's not an opportunist actor.  When he's in a scene with another actor, he doesn't wait until his line comes up to deliver true emotion.  He's a character actor in the truest sense, and he immerses into this character, not missing a single beat.  If Russell Crowe didn't amaze me with his performance, I would've said that Penn deserved the Oscar.  All I have to say is both of those actors deserved the Oscar over Denzel Washington.  One great approach that Jessie Nelson (the director) took was hiring actors who actually have mental illness.  It seemed to have improved the dynamic between Sam and his friends.  And the actors, despite being handicapped, are naturals.  They're reminiscent of Chris Burke in ""Life Goes On.""  Now, onto the flaws.  First of all, that scene where Sam almost goes to jail because he accidentally made conversation with a hooker (who turned out to be a cop posing as a hooker) was pretty far-fetched.  Come on, the guy's obviously mentally ill, so why would the cop want to try and bust him?  And even if he weren't mentally ill, how can you bust someone just for talking to a hooker, who doesn't even give him a clue that she's a hooker.  This was just a cheap plot device to have him get into some trouble with the law, which will eventually result in the inevitable court battle.  Another cheap plot device was Michelle Pfieffer taking Sam's case just because her fellow attorney's at a party were a little tipsy and stated that she would never take a pro-bono case (being that everyone thinks she's greedy and egotistical, and she pretty much is).  Lucy's dialogue seems a little too witty for a child of her age.  There are some people my age who don't even talk like her character.  But I do have to give Dakota Fanning tons of credit for natural delivery of her lines and making her character quite convincing.  As I said before, usually when child actors deliver smart, witty lines it looks incredibly forced, like they're reading off cue cards. But Dakota's a natural and I predict she'll grow up to become a fine actress.  The movie goes on pretty long at 2 hours and 10 minutes, but not overlong. I don't believe any director should delete scenes that build character just to make the film snappy and perhaps make the audience feel better.  There are lot of great character-building scenes that involve the relationships between Sam and his daughter, Sam and his new lawyer friend and Sam and his three loyal best friends.  And because we get to know these characters so intimately that we develop a deep sympathy for them.  Go ahead and complain about ""I Am Sam"" being a sentimental tearjerker.  It's a sentimental tearjerker with a great heart.  And even the most macho of guys will probably have tears rolling down their cheeks while watching this movie.  I've seen quite a few well-made films with great performances that have nothing else to show for themselves other than...they're well-made!  I can't find any flaws in their structures, but I got nothing out of these films.  One example is ""Wonder Boys""--very well-made film; had virtually no impact on me.  ""I Am Sam"" has  imperfections in its structure, but it had a huge impact on me and it's a film I will never forget!  So like the character of Sam Dawson proves in the film--being perfect isn't everything. 
My score:  9 (out of 10)",I Am Sam
34,MuviFan73,Nice emotional take of love between retarded father and daughter.,8,30 April 2017,"I am sam is rated 7.6 at IMDb and considerably low at metacritic.com.Over the time since I first watched the movie. I believed if the conclusion was not in the favour of Sam but visiting rights were in his favour would have been excellent ending.The end however is more or less similar as Sam wants someone to be lucy's mother. It means it still fall in favour of critic's. Metacritic still has low rating, which leaves one wondering why! I recommend this movie. Nice emotional take.",I Am Sam
35,KnightsofNi11,Gives Hollywood creative potential a bad name,3,10 February 2011,"I try to be as non cynical as possible when writing my movie reviews. I hate people who review movies with such a negative and trashy attitude towards them, honing in solely on the negative. I avoid this as much as possible, always looking for the positive in a movie, but some movies just have no positive side to them, despite their acclaimed status. Every once in a while you just have no choice but to write a really cynical and really negative review. That said, I Am Sam is about Sam Dawson, a mentally retarded man who is fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter, Lucy, who has been taken away from him by what the movie shows us is the evil, cold-hearted, and oppressive Child Protective Services. Sam gets help from a lawyer named Rita, who learns the true meaning of family value from Sam in the most Hollywood formula way possible. This movie attempts to emotionally move you in the most obvious and intrusive ways possible. It is a truly horrible cramming of ideals down our throats.I Am Sam is a film that can go one of two ways. It can be a very human story brimming with emotional prowess, that moves its audience to the brink of tears with its sincerity and heart. Or it can end up being a pathetically formula film with motives so blatantly obvious it's not even funny. I Am Sam is a poster child for the latter and it had me frustrated and put off within thirty minutes. This movie makes it ridiculously easy to be on Sam's side of the court case for his child and it removes all realism the story could have had and replaces it with unrealistic archetypal heroes and villains. There's nothing human about this film and the majority of the characters don't feel like actual characters and are present to just serve one story development purpose. For example, the people who are against Sam are made out to be heartless evil people who have no contempt for love or positive emotion. They also seem to constantly forget the fact that Sam is mentally disabled, showing no empathy or compassion towards the situation he is in. Sam's relationship with everyone in this film feels either heavily exaggerated to force a point, or formulaic and predictable.That brings me to another point surrounding the character of Sam. Robert Downey Jr. put it perfectly in Tropic Thunder. You never go full retard. Sean Penn went full retard and came home empty handed, losing out to a much more deserving Denzel Washington for Training Day. I know the ""full retard"" thing is a joke, but it actually has a lot of truth to it. Penn plays the character of Sam to such an extent that he is completely detached from reality. He is unable to understand 95 percent of what is happening around him making him really seem like someone who can't properly function in society. I found myself actually questioning whether it was a good idea for Sam to keep his daughter with a higher mental capacity than him at the age of seven. I almost wanted to side with CPS, but the movie's over exaggerated idealistic ways made that impossible to do so without feeling as evil and anti-retard as the CPS are made out to be.Who knew that a potentially heart warming and moving film could produce results that not only don't meet expectations, but are the makings of a truly awful film. This movie had me emotionally invested for maybe twenty to thirty minutes. After I realized what a force fed bout of lies this film was, my interest deteriorated quickly. This is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of creative ability. Do not let these two hours go down the drain watching this movie.",I Am Sam

It works, every time.",6,14 July 2004,"Sam is mentally deficient, and has to cope with being left with a child he has to an anonymous homeless woman or prostitute, who disappears from him after she delivers the child. Its a touching experience watching Sam attempt to raise her. A natural, beautiful film which grew out of research with people like Sam (which you can hear about on the DVD), accompanied by a soundtrack of covers of great Beatles songs. One of my favourite movie soundtracks.I Am Sam is one of my favourite movies, but i recognise it is probably only an 8/10 in objective quality - mainly due to Michelle Pfeiffer. I always feel she lets it down. She's just not that good an actress. Plus, its plot is a little too familiar custody battle - we've seen this on screen before, most fully and effectively in Kramer vs Kramer, which this film fondly references.I believe Sean Penn's performances is one of the finest ever, and i don't say that lightly. He really embodies the mentally-challenged Sam, in the best onscreen representation of this deficiency we've seen.Its also a very touching film - the relation between Sam and Lucy (in a remarkable child-star performance from Dakota Fanning, who knew how to relate to Sam from having a relation like him in real life) is one of those special things in moviedom, for me at least.Highlights: When Lucy says ""All you need is love.""8/10. But i still think its an essential film to see. Despite Pfeiffer, its still one of my favourite films, a beautiful film i love to put on every now and then and spend a little time with Sam and Lucy.",I Am Sam
39,grahamsj3,Powerful film!,9,10 October 2002,"I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since that time, nearly all his films have left me flat. In fact, I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it. What a loss it would have been if I'd missed it! I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a cliché'd one and has been done before, though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway - it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her, I hope! This film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. The film has a sort of a sappy (and somewhat surprising) outcome, but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. This movie blew me away and I gave it a 9.",I Am Sam
40,esteban1747,A father with difficulties,7,1 October 2003,"The story of this film is really true. A mentally abnormal man having sex with a young light-minded lady and the result is an innocent child abandoned by her mother. The lady is obviously a person unable to take care of her child and fulfil her duties as mother, so she left the child to Sam, the abnormal man, a typical autistic, who, however, did all his efforts to raise her lovely daughter. Due to his difficulties to raise her, the law came to take her away for better education and living in another family. Sam loves her and moved to another house close to the one of the family where her daughter lives, and this may possible to her to visit so often her father and to even sleep from time with time with him. In conclusions, both love each other. I would not argue about the law, i.e. whether it was right or not when the Sam's daughter was taken away from him, I'd rather talk about the extraordinary acting of Sean Penn supported by Michelle Pfeiffer, he was simply the best. The film is very sentimental, but it makes me think whether the developed societies are doing enough to educate young women and men in their responsibilities as future parents.",I Am Sam
41,Isaac5855,It's manipulative but it hits an emotional bullseye...,8,15 October 2007,"Sean Penn's riveting, Oscar-nominated performance is the centerpiece of I AM SAM, a manipulative but nevertheless deeply affecting drama about a mentally retarded man trying to secure official custody of his daughter (Dakota Fanning)with the help of savvy attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is a single parent herself. This film is a complete manipulation in terms of story and writing and characters, but the manipulation works. Penn is remarkable and Pfeiffer offers one of her strongest performances as the lawyer who learns as much from Sam as he does from her. Fanning makes a strong impression as Sam's daughter, one of her first major roles. Mention should also be made of supporting turns from Richard Schiff as the cold-blooded prosecutor in Sam's Case and Laura Dern as the woman who wants to legally adopt Fanning. It's nothing groundbreaking or original, but it definitely tugs at the heartstrings.",I Am Sam

43,policy134,This is the actors' movie,7,23 August 2012,"Although, the main storyline is quite familiar to every man, woman and child, it is definitely the actors who save this from being just another tear-jerking story about justice, or injustice (depends on which side you're on) to a man, who is denied fatherhood.Michelle Pfeiffer and Sean Penn really gives two powerhouse performances and it should be no surprise that Sean Penn was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy. What is a little surprising is that Michelle Pfeiffer was overlooked. This is by far the best performance, save for her turn as Catwoman, that I have seen her in.Otherwise, I can't really say that I saw something out of the ordinary and I was a little disappointed by the slightly punctured narrative. Not that it's confusing, but I just thought that I would see both sides to the argument more clearly. The other side, is hardly represented. It's all from the point of view of Pfeiffer and Penn. The other side is generally understanding and even helpful and there isn't that underlying threat of unpredictability (where will it all end?) that this kind of film needs.One little side-note. Remember Robert Downey Jr.'s comment on Sean Penn's performance in Tropic Thunder: ""Go full retard and lose the Oscar"". Sam is a much too clever character here to be fully retarded.",I Am Sam
44,braddugg,Good intentions need not necessarily get good feedback.,4,19 September 2014,"Good intentions need not necessarily get good feedback.Acted supremely and so terrifyingly by Sean Penn as Sam this is too accurate depiction of an autistic and developmental disability and is really worth many an award for such portrayal of Sam.The plot is now that Sam is a father the state too his daughter assuming the fact that Sam cannot take care of Lucy, his daughter and Sam has a case to win her back. Now sympathy cannot be evoked just by showing disability and he wins the heart of a reluctant lawyer Rita and now he fights to win her daughter backthere in is a flaw in convincing or trying to convince people too easily from a neighbor to a judge to his manager, Sam does pull off things so easily that are tough for a normal man to achieve. So his own disability becomes his aide and made me question are there so many good men and then realised oh its just a movie. This is where it has lost the moment it deprived me of a possibility and convinced me that its just a movie, it went down by a few points.Yet Sean Penn is outstanding and this movie becomes a watch only for him. now all others seem to be acting for the fabrication of scenes written by writer director Jessie Nelson.Cinematography is not so great but art direction is setting up Sams room is editing too is a bit lethargic and the affectionate scene between Sam and Rita is not so needed. Other departments just fared well and is acting too is good.It's over sentimentality has made this just an average flick which could have otherwise been a must watch for the way Sam was portrayed by Sean Penn. its 2/5 for an average story and sublime acting.",I Am Sam
45,shark-43,Sentimental Mess,4,13 February 2002,"SPOILERS*******SPOILERS*******Look, I've read through most of the comments already and I see that I am in the minority here. Fine. Im glad you all were touched and LOVED the movie, but I felt it was Hollywood manipulative clap-trap at it's worst. I found it VERY condescending to the mentally disabled. Oh, Rita the high-paid lawyer with her cel phone and Porsche needs to be taught what's important by the mentally handicapped guy. Wow! The symbolism of the ""paper"" wall being torn down so she can TELL HIM (and the audience) everything that has just happened for the past two hours. It's like the filmmakers didn't trust the I.Q. of the audience either so they always nudged you and pointedthings out to you, just in case you were ""slow"" and weren't getting the message. Not sure what to feel here, well, we have some bad Beatles covers all cued up with a lyric here that will TELL you how to feel right now. Sheesh!!! Oh, the cynical, hard-working career woman needs a mentally retarded guy to TEACH her to be a better parent! There wasnt a subtle bone in this film's body - and then they have the NERVE to mention Kramer v.s. Kramer a few times and then they have a cop-out ending just like that film. (At least in Kramer - they let Hoffman lose in court and THEN Streep's character totally sells  herself out and hands the kid back over just so they could have a weepy, tacked-on happy ending.) But in this, they dont even have the judge make a decision - god forbid real life and real law interfere with this fairy tale, let's just have the Laura Dern character hand the kid back to Sean Penn - here ya go, take her, that way we dont have to have any more conflict or show the reality of the court system dealing with such a case. Time for the movie to end, time for a happy ending, cue up the Beatles music and cry. And I am huge fan of Penn's work in the past (Bad Boys, Fast Times, Taps,Racing With the Moon and of course, Dead Man Walking)but he was so inconsistent here - there were times when he had such intelligence in his eyes and then other scenes where he had ""found"" the look - the look that Leonardo was so brilliantly able to create during ALL of Gilbert Grape. Look, it's a hard thing to play for an actor. Mentally retarded, blindness - more actors fail than succeed. Plus, the voice Penn decided to use was so Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"". Now - the little girl, Dakota Fanning was stunning. Not a false move. She steals the movie. And yes, of course, there are touching scenes - you CANT do a film about a parent losing a child in a custody battle without hitting on some real emotional moments - but the film is more interested in fake tears and easy endings than reality. The actual REALITY of a retarded man trying to raise a child. Does he love her? Of course he does. That's not the point. The point was, as the court said, what is best for the kid. But the film seemed more interested in dealing with black and white, Penn- good, Courtroom people - bad!!! Please.",I Am Sam
46,Spanner-2,Good but flawed,7,11 March 2002,"This film, which garnered Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar nomination was also better than i had expected, not being a fan of this sort of film... Penn plays a somewhat retarded father attempting to keep custody of his daughter (Dakota Fanning, the real find of the film). Michelle Pfeiffer plays the lawyer who winds up taking his case. While the film, especially Fanning's performance, are certainly watchable..

Sometimes it seems that there isn't an actor at all, it's just a person being filmed, not a person acting. This is the case with Sean Penn in I Am Sam.I Am Sam follows a mentally handicapped man named Sam Dawson (Penn) who tries to keep custody of his child Lucy Diamond(Dakota Fanning), named after one of Sam's favorite Beatles' songs. Sam has been a good single father to Lucy since she was born. They do everything together like reading one of Sam's favorite books Green Eggs and Ham. With the help of those around him like Annie Cassell (Diane Wiest), Sam raises Lucy in a very loving environment. When Lucy turns seven and starts to realize what is wrong with her daddy, she becomes a little concerned that she will get too smart for him. Sam doesn't know what is going on due to his handicap until it is too late. At her birthday party, she is taken away from social services and the two are split apart.Sam needs the help of a good lawyer and finds one in the yellow pages thanks to one of his buddies. He goes to see Rita Harrison (Michelle Phiffer), a lawyer who never loses who ends up taking the case pro bono so the office doesn't think she does this all for money. The two of them seem to be on two separate pages when it comes to life. Sam feels like everyone is against him, including Rita. All Rita wants is to win the case and win her family back. They both learn a lot about each other and about life in general as the case goes on.Penn is outstanding in this role, which got him an Oscar nomination. This movie really hits home giving the viewer a lot to enjoy. Penn is a character that you like and feel bad for all at the same time (much like Forrest Gump). Penn, an Oscar-winning actor, gives another one of his great performances showing how a dedicated actor can really make or break a movie. Young Dakota Fanning is also one to be reckoned with. This little actress has been appearing in movies left and right as of late and she means business. Only seven years old in I Am Sam and she gives a performance that is better than some actresses can give in a life time. Phiffer also does a fantastic job as the never give up lawyer. Her transformation in this movie really shows a lot of character.I Am Sam is a real tearjerker. Penn makes you believe that there is still some good left in this world. For those looking for a feel good movie, this is the one for you. I Am Sam will find its way into your heart because just like the Beatles' song says, ""All you need is love..."", and that's just what Sam shows us.",I Am Sam

Feeling like a failure, an undeserving guardian, and a maniac who constantly yells is so common. This movie sheds the light on the subject of how we interact with disabled people, and the way to do it is not by having pity or isolating the character with special focus; Sam lives in us, among us, and with us. 'It takes a while village to raise a child', and the film is special because Sam is the hub for interaction with people, getting help for Lucy and helping others as well.I also love the camera work. The camera does not hold steady ad still like typical movies. It subtly moves, spins, or closes up suddenly, representing confused and turbulent mindset of Sam. When a character presents genuine feelings deep inside the heart, it closes up the face so the audience can enjoy the actors' ability to bring emotions on the screen. The color subtly changes to express atmosphere. When Sam is desperate and hopeless plus the court scene, the color is blue, cold color. However, when Sam is with Lucy, Rita, or friends, it is yellowish or orange-ish or gold-ish, very warm like their realtionship.",I Am Sam

Some of the best in the industry Have played retards Like(Hanks) in Forrest Gump. This performance could have easily got him a golden globe. Does not matter he will leave you with your heart folded in his hands.

Michelle Pfeiffer plays his reluctant ""pro bono"" elite lawyer, who eventually puts 110% into this case.The love between Sam and his 7 year old daughter is evident in many sweet scenes (got Kleenex?), best described by a reclusive neighbor (wonderfully played by Dianne Wiest), who overcomes her hermit-like condition long enough to testify in Sam's behalf. Even the social workers who insisted on doing everything to ""help the child"" appear to be fighting emotions over this unusual case. The ""support system"", which includes several equally challenged ""buddies"", a very supportive employer, and many other people in the community gives evidence of our changing society, fostering inclusion and tolerance. Eventually even the prospective adoptive parents of Sam's daughter can't go on fighting against this exemplary father.The girl playing Sam's daughter appears to be ""gifted"", at age 7 reading middle school material. Perhaps the ""difference"" between father & daughter's intelligence did not have to be in such an obvious extreme. The implication of a romantic involvement between Sam and his lawyer could have been avoided as well. The former is stretching it, but the latter is going too far. One can suspend her/his disbelief only so much! Since there are no ""perfect"" movies, I still consider this one pretty darn close! Highly recommended.",I Am Sam

When he is wrongly arrested, family services start assessing his relationship with his daughter; whether he is able to raise her.This is a heart wrenching movie that will bring you to the edge of crying your eyes out. This doesn't make big statements, this is more of a quiet, charming view on parenthood. The message i feel this movie is presenting is that all parents are 'mentally handicapped' when it comes to raising children, every parent isn't perfect and sometimes just fall apart from the stress and strain, but can endure it all when all they do is love their child.This is the performance of a life time for Sean Penn. this should have been his Oscar win. His performance saw so flawless, always keeping his character's idiosyncratics simple yet very powerful; where overacting which would have ruined the illusion.Michelle Pfeiffer was splendid. she was able to bring the naivety to Rita; where she kept thinking she always had it tough, and learned that she had to stop filling her life and start slowing down, as life was running by her and she was missing it.The stand out was Dakota Fanning. She is one of the best actresses for her age. She is in my words better than a lot of actresses who have been around for years.

54,Okonh0wp,"If you can get past the premise, it works",7,15 November 2021,"The film presents the heroic tale of a mentally-disabled father, Sam (Sean Penn), with the IQ of a 7-year-old as he tries to retain control of a daughter in the wake of legal challenges to his fitness as a parent.Joining him in his quest is the support of his mentally disabled social circle and his daughter (Dakota Fanning in her breakout role) who firmly wants to be reunited with her father. Most essential to the film is hot shot lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) who develops a relationship with Sam that manages to reach an emotional resonance akin to ""Rain Man"" despite the constraints of the film.As for those constraints, there's the icky manner by which Sam became a parent in the first place. Fortunately, the film doesn't delve too much into how he became a parent in the first place as someone who likely had little idea how babies are made.The film also doesn't give too much detail about how he manages to raise the daughter all the way to her seventh birthday outside of the help of his reclusive neighbor (Dianne Wiest). According to the logic of the movie, though, he somehow manages to get the job done as a single planet with the salary of a Starbucks employee and severe mental deficiencies.According to a basic knowledge of parenting, it would be a huge impediment to raise a child in this environment, and it doesn't help that the foster family (with Laura Dern as the mother) is miles above the stock portrayal of neglectfully abusive opportunists doing it for the paycheck.Although there's some wiggle room in how much empathy the film wants us to have for the dastardly social services employees, the film appears to want the audience to be on Team Sam when Team Social Services seems a lot more tempting.Still, the film's moral leaning towards one side doesn't negate that the thought-provoking nature of this kinetic courtroom drama.",I Am Sam

That wasn't why I watched this movie at all, it was just by chance.However, that may be part of the reason why I Am Sam moved me in a way most movies can't. Having a disabled sister, and being on the autism spectrum myself, I could relate to Sam in a way most people would not be able to.Sam is played by Sean Penn, who as mentioned before, is mentally challenged. He has the IQ equal to a 7 year old, and a daughter named Lucy(Dakota Fanning) who just turned 7. She is the product of a one night stand with a hooker, who ran away from Sam when Lucy was born.Since Lucy's age is equivalent to her father's brain, Social Services fear that a man can't raise his child if the kid is more intelligent than the father. So they take her away to a foster home and Sam has to hire a lawyer(Michelle Pfeiffer) to get her back.I also read the reviews of Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli before seeing this movie. They both gave it 2/4 stars for the same reason. This can be best explained by quoting Ebert himself:""The lesson ""I Am Sam"" wants to teach us is, ""All you need is love."" This is not quite strictly true. Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience.""This seems to ignore the fact that Sam has had Starbucks employees and a woman named Annie help raise Lucy as well! Sam is not alone in caring for his daughter, so it DOES make sense that Sam would be able to care for Lucy.To steer from that subject, the performances is this movie are fantastic. Sean Penn gives a very believable portrayal of a mentally handicapped man. Had he never worked in another movie, you could buy that he was disabled. His acting never comes off as offensive or trying too hard, it's just the right balance to believe Sean Penn is actually Sam.Dakota Fanning playing Lucy is just amazing as well. At just 7 years old, she shows how amazing she is as an actress in this film and in others to come. In fact, she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for this role, and that made her the youngest person to do so!Michelle Pfeiffer also does a fine job as the lawyer, with only The Age Of Innocence and The Prince of Egypt being superior works of hers by my knowledge.I Am Sam also should get acknowledged as one of the few movies to make me cry quite a few times, because it takes a lot for a movie to make me cry. At times the movie can seem a bit saccharine due to this, but that didn't bother me much. If you need a good cry, I Am Sam is a great movie to put on!I could say more about I Am Sam, but it should be clear that this is well worth seeing. It's moving and inspirational, no matter who you are. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen, and you owe it to yourself to be moved by it as well!Note: I apologize for not writing in over a month, I got busy and struggled with knowing what review to write next. I intend to write more reviews soon!",I Am Sam
57,Cedric_Catsuits,Absurd,6,17 July 2011,"There are so many things wrong with this film, I can't help thinking it's just another one of those self-serving showpieces that egotistical actors like to add to their resume. How many times have we seen actors cooing over portrayals of ""disadvantaged"" people? Lets face it, for many actors, playing a retarded person does not require much effort.The biggest and immediately obvious gaping hole in this story is that Sam is fighting for custody of his 7-year old daughter. Why now? Why was he left to bring her up alone for 7 years? She seems pretty much the perfect child so he can't have been a bad parent for 7 years. But how does a single man with severe learning difficulties get to bring up a baby and apparently not register on any welfare radar for 7 years? It is truly absurd.Then of course there's the question of Penn's performance. Personally I think it demonstrates very little understanding of the issues, and occasionally borders on mocking. It is not a realistic portrayal, but one moulded to suit the script, which also severely lacks credibility.Fanning and Pfeiffer however are on a different level. Fanning was a natural child performer who never looked like she was acting (until she was about 12 anyway) and there are few more gifted. Pfeiffer gets to grips with her role and just about errs on the side of non-hamming, but she certainly steals almost every scene she's in.The film ends too suddenly at a point where even this cynical viewer was getting drawn in, thus leaving another gaping hole. So we have a hole, a middle and a hole. And the middle is mushy.",I Am Sam
58,dimplet,"I like I am Sam, from a Dakota Fanning fan",8,12 May 2011,"Fine acting, all around. I have become a great fan of Dakota Fanning since watching Steven Spielberg's Taken. Who was that voice narrating the 10 episodes? To my astonishment, it was a little girl who turned out to be the star of the series, delivering a performance that any adult would consider the role of a lifetime. So here, in I am Sam, we see Dakota a year earlier, showing she could nail a challenging role. My only objection to the movie is that she wasn't listed more prominently in the credits.Sean Penn delivers a strong performance, but what makes it so interesting is seeing him and Dakota on the screen at the same time interacting, not just cuts back and forth between them. Great performances!Being a big fan of Quantum Leap, I was also delighted to see Brad Silverman again, who played Jimmy LaMotta so wonderfully in four key episodes. I hope he returns to the screen!This is a message film, and the message viewers take away may differ. It's difficult being a parent, and its difficult being a child if you don't have loving parents. I think a loving parent, regardless of IQ, trumps a cold or cruel parent, even if a rich genius. But there's more to the movie than that.For some IMDb reviewers, the movie didn't work; some said it wasn't realistic. Have people forgotten how to watch movies? When you sit down to watch a movie there is a contract between the viewer and the director. You agree to suspend belief, at least for the first 10 minutes or so, and in return the director promises to envelop and entertain you in an alternative universe. If you are not willing to enter this realm of imagination, why are you watching movies?I am Sam succeeds in enveloping you in its universe, and making you care about all of its key characters, including Sam's friends. There's no purely good or bad guys. We can't help but disliking the child welfare cadre, or at least their tactics, but we also realize they have a point. And in the center of the storm, anchoring all the performances, is little Dakota Fanning. But the best thing about I am Sam is its originality. Not all movies that try something different succeed. I am Sam does.",I Am Sam
59,Jerique,Heart Warming Tale About a Loving Father,9,24 July 2010,"In an eye opening performance, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam. It was the 2001 Academy Awards when I began to doubt the Oscars because Sean Penn was robbed of the Best Actor category. I really believed at the time, that Sean Penn was mentally challenged. He was way more deserving of the award than Denzel.This is one film that can tug your heart strings and have your eyes flooded with tears. It's powered by the performances of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning. Dakota has an innate ability to use her big beautiful eyes to induce crying. Michelle can steal a moment from Sean in any scene with her beautifully delivered words.The story of fighting for custody of his daughter is one for all ages and it's a tragic story to be told but can captivate any audience and especially all mothers and fathers out there. When you finish watching, you'll have red eyes from wiping away those tears. You'll also be in a mood to start watching more movies containing Sean Penn.If you've never seen a Sean Penn film before this, you'll believe that he is truly handicapped. Sean Penn's commitment to this role is accounted for six months of research on mentally challenged people. I'm not knocking Denzel Washington as an actor, as he's supremely talented. But Sean Penn has an uncanny ability to make you believe he is not playing a character of Sam, but is the character of Sam.The character of Sam, is not inspiring because he is handicapped. It's due to how loving he is and how much fighting he does to get his daughter back and make her happy that makes Sam inspiring. Kids can watch this movie, and parents will enjoy it most of all. It's not a movie that should be missed by anyone. There's no reason to dislike, I Am Sam.",I Am Sam

It's diabetic schmaltz, but very well done.  Sean Penn's nomination was well-deserved and Dakota Fleming is fantastic as Sam's daughter.  Some magnificent supporting turns by Laura Dern, Diane Wiest, Stanley DeSantis, and two actually mentally retarded actors, help carry the somewhat airy script through some of its less credible moments.  The love that the entire cast and crew put into the project radiates from the scene and generates enough goodwill to forgive the sometimes languid pacing.  If you're a crumudgeon by nature, skip this one. All others should have a good time.",I Am Sam
61,CineCritic2517,"A well acted, well produced yet manipulative dross only Hollywood could sire..",1,28 September 2010,"--This review contains no significant spoilers. For the safety of not getting blacklisted, the 'contains spoiler' option is highlighted.--It really is true, Penn, the never aging Michelle Pfeiffer and even child-women Dakota Fanning and all of the support cast perform adequately in a cinematography-wise well polished yet story-wise highly emotionally manipulative skunk of a movie.And you know it's going to be manipulative from the get go when you understand the premise. Penn plays Sam, a retarded man with the mental capacity of a 7 year old, who somehow manages to impregnate a homeless women who in turn gives birth to Lucy, played by Fanning. He raises her for 7 years until she mentally outgrows him at which point social services steps in.This, if one didn't get it yet, is a completely fictional scenario which could not have been happening in the real world. Unfortunately, the movie is not a fairy tale, it deals with the premise so seriously as to cover a complete legal trial taking place over several weeks if not months, trying to establish something which shouldn't have to be established in the first place. Sam cannot take proper care for his daughter by himself and it doesn't even take the mental capacity of a 7 year old to understand this.When you watch the first 5 minutes of this film, you know exactly where it is going given this premise and there will be little surprises on the path ahead, it is done completely and utterly by the numbers. It's almost like it wasn't even written by a human being but by story writing software copying the successful gimmicks of the past.This really is a shame given the movie's strengths in a large number of areas including a decent screenplay (considering the story arc) written by Kristine Johnson and Jessie Nelson.But ultimately, most movies will be judged on their weakest link(s) if those weaknesses don't warrant some kind of leniency due to things like budget constraints. The weakest link is in the story itself and the manipulative way it is shamelessly presented.This movie scores a 7.4 on this website which means I'm in minority opinion. But if you are a person who hates being emotionally manipulated watching a film, and let me assure you that you will be every 5 minutes or so, I can't imagine you'll disagree with this review all that much.4/10",I Am Sam

The story is quite simple and starts off strong but it loses some power as it continues on.
The runtime is overly long. This is the films biggest downfall. If the film was about ten to fifteen minutes shorter, it would be a lot better.
The ending, without spoiling anything, is satisfying but it could have been better if it had more of an emotional impact.Pros: Great acting, simple yet satisfying story, does have some emotional impactCons: Overly long runtime, story gets weak at the end, the ending is good but could have been betterOverall Rating: 7.0/10",I Am Sam

I have been around many handicapped people and can honestly say that deciding whether they can be guardians or parents is quite dubious. However, the acting is very good and the storyline is quite believable enough to hold your attention. But I was very uncomfortable watching this. Is Penn at fault for his portrayal. Certainly not, he's a great actor and looks and behaves the role quite naturally.My problem is that this movie was far too long and just seemed never-ending. Do you think the director or writer were huge Beatles fanatics. I thought the references to the Beatles was far too abundant. There must have been at least ten songs that were re-badged by current artists and maybe a dozen references to the Beatles in the script. A couple of times would have been enough.",I Am Sam

67,FeverDog,Why let reality intrude?,3,14 October 2003,"I AM SAM is one of the most unfairly manipulative movies I've seen, which is all the more frustrating because a moment or two of real greatness would become clear between the times I was questioning how wrongheaded, false and/or blind it is to reality.Let's start with the most obvious complaint - a plothole the movie chooses to completely ignore. If Sam is unfit to raise his child because his IQ is that of a seven year old's, how, I wonder, did he raise her in her early years? The story starts around Lucy's seventh birthday, but little is shown how good a father Sam was up until then; all we see is him shopping for diapers and playing with her on the swings. How were his parenting skills during these formative years? Wasn't Social Services concerned for her well-being even once before?The lack of backstory isn't the biggest reason for my dislike of the film. What frustrated me the most is that it raises valid questions about what makes a good parent only to negate them by forcing a compromised resolution before an upbeat ending. Every point the opposing attorney raised is true (in the real world, anyway). A man of Sam's intelligence is not capable of providing for his child, but the movie bends over backwards trying to disprove this fact. The movie's tagline summarizes this lie: ""Love is all you need."" Sorry, but love is NOT all it takes to raise a child, and anyone who thinks otherwise is naive and unfit for parenthood.Now that I've got my major gripes out of the way, let's move on to the minor ones. First, Sam makes only $8.00 an hour after working at least seven years at the same place? Since he was unable to cover the cost of his daughter's new shoes, I wonder where he got the money for that inflated air trampoline for her birthday party. And I wonder how he fit it into his apartment. And while I'm thinking about Sam's sources of income, I'm still confused about his other job - dog walking. Walking dogs for extra money I get; what I don't understand why he takes these dogs home with him. Whose dogs are these? Did Sam just forget to return them to their owners, or is he sitting while they're out of town?And Sam's places of business weren't just a coffee shop and pizza place. They were Starbucks and Pizza Hut. Sam and Lucy went shoe shopping not at a mom-and-pop place, but at Payless. They don't eat at diners, but at IHOP and Bob's Big Boy. I Am Sam has the most intrusive, blatant and unnecessary product placement I've seen recently outside a pro sports stadium, and they fit uneasily with the all the covered Beatles songs. Why were the Beatles so upset when Michael Jackson licensed their ""Revolution"" to Nike while this movie sometimes looks like one long commercial? Speaking of the sneaker conglomerate, there was even a huge Nike shoe on the side of a bus in the movie for absolutely no reason. I'm surprised there was no mention of Blockbuster with all the talk of movies here. (Maybe because the average Blockbuster doesn't stock KRAMER VS. KRAMER and GONE WITH THE WIND?) I AM SAM has the homogenized feel of a cold corporate environment, and the lighting and camera work exacerbate this lack of warmth.Why were so many scenes lit with a blue filter? Disparate locales - a supermarket, elementary school, lawyer's home and Department of Social Services all had the same sickly azure tint. Was this for artistic reasons? To show how unfriendly these places were? If so, how and why are they unfriendly? Looking at cinematographer Elliot Davis' credits reveals he's a competent veteran (and he lit the also-bad-but-in-a-different-way FORCES OF NATURE similarly), so I guess I'm just missing the point.I'm willing to give director Jessie Nelson a pass for all the unsteady handheld camerawork here. This technique has a purpose and is effective when used correctly, but I AM SAM is only Nelson's second feature, so maybe one day she'll learn why it's a distraction in a quiet domestic drama.I AM SAM is not completely terrible. All the actors do their best with what they're given. I especially liked Doug Hutchison as one of Sam's circle of differently-abled friends, and little Dakota Fanning is a naturally gifted child actor. Dianne Wiest, as the homebody neighbor, is her usual excellent self despite her aforementioned sketchy role. And, as the leads, Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer need no confirmation of their talents.How convenient, by the way, that Sam's neighbor is a recluse who can hear a baby crying in the next building over. What was her story, anyway? The whole movie I kept waiting for this character to be fleshed out, but her testimony at the hearing added little to her character. A 2+ hour drama should make the effort to develop its supporting characters more.What about those moments of greatness, you ask. One scene springs to mind. Actually, make that half a scene, in which the Pfeiffer character peers through the paper wall Sam erected following the custody loss. Wonderfully shot, written and acted, it was the only moment I can now recall that had real dramatic and artistic strength. Unfortunately, this scene devolved into soap opera emoting and uncomfortably close to an ensuing love scene that thankfully never happened. Whew. I was dreading any sort of romantic connection between these two characters, which would have been wrong in so many ways.So, as a whole, I AM SAM is maddingly unsatisfying up to and including the end. About 90 minutes in I thought to myself there's no way it can have a happy ending without either ignoring everything that came before or totally copping out with some kind of half-assed compromise. Sure enough, the final scenes left me dumbfounded. There's not much to say without spoiling it, so allow me just to detest it. Like LOSING ISAIAH (another child custody drama), it ends with of those exasperating solutions that really wouldn't solve the problem in the real world, but lets both sides of a movie court battle come off as winners. And after this insufficient denouement, the movie ends with Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer match. When did Sam become qualified to do this? And wouldn't the ref being a player's father make him unfairly biased? I don't think an officiator should be cheering for a player to score, nor do I think the kids on the other team would be too happy, either. But why let logic get in the way of a happy ending?3/10",I Am Sam
68,mweston,3.5 stars,8,5 April 2002,"Sam Dawson, played by Sean Penn, is mentally retarded. As the film opens we see him working very diligently and effectively at Starbuck's, organizing the sweeteners, busing the tables, and delivering the coffees. He complements everyone on having made ""an excellent choice."" Then he is reminded that today is the big day and that he needs to go to the hospital, where his daughter is born. When the mother runs away, he is left with the baby, who he names Lucy. While he is overwhelmed with the task of raising a daughter (which we see by the camera swirling around him to show his confusion), he gets some help from a neighbor (played very well by Dianne Wiest in a small role) and manages to raise her. The film goes through these early years quite quickly to get to the heart of the story, which is when Lucy begins to surpass her father's intelligence. The authorities decide that perhaps Sam is not such a good father after all, and he is forced to fight to keep her. He doesn't really understand what's going on, but manages through luck and determination to get a lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. This part of the film, which needed to be edited a little more aggressively, becomes a bit too manipulative and ""movie of the week"" for what would normally be my taste, but it is done so well that it worked for me, and I didn't mind.Penn's acting is amazing, with only one brief moment when I saw his intelligence flash out from behind his character. You really can't appreciate what he does here from watching the clips or the movie trailer. Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, is also quite good most of the time, especially considering her age (7 in 2001). Pfeiffer is acceptable most of the time, but is obviously acting (or attempting to) in her biggest scene. I'll also mention that Brent Spiner has a very short part in one early scene (so small I expected him to be uncredited, but he is listed), and Laura Dern does good work when she appears later in the film.And lastly, I should say that the soundtrack is made up of remakes of Beatles songs, which also fits into the story because Sam falls back on the lyrics of Beatles songs when he doesn't know what else to to (like when he names his daughter after the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""). Surprisingly, I do not believe that ""All You Need is Love"" is used, because that would perhaps summarize the message of the movie.",I Am Sam

His girlfriend gives birth to his child, then leave him with their little daughter. The main character is put in bad position. As it can be predicted, problems arose.The film shows how strong is the attachment of the parent to the child and vise versa, despite all the difficulties that appear constantly. The film shows that when you know what you want and you want it from the bottom of your soul you will achieve it.

70,jvframe,Convincing,7,26 March 2002,"I found Sean Penn's performance to be convincing throughout and all the supporting actors were wonderful.I know a man who's a bit more intellectually advanced than Sam, who holds down a regular job and who also obsesses about particular '70's music groups. He knows he's loud and a bit of a strain at times in company. More importantly he knows he's different, that it's not his fault and that there's nothing he can do about it. Sam shows the extraordinary bravery and honesty required for all like him to insist on living a full life as part of society. He has respect from his co-workers and unquestioning acceptance from his personal support network, but he is forced by circumstance to test the limit of his life skills.I agree that it's not a perfect plot.

Like Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man"", she goes through all the changes while the main character (Sean Penn here in another awesome display) has to remain relatively static throughout the proceedings. And like Tom Cruise, the Oscar voters, in their wisdom, decided to overlook an outstanding performance. Which. if history is any lesson, they will make up for in the future by handing her the award for an inferior movie. (see Paul Newman-""The Color Of Money"", Al Pacino-""Scent of A Woman"", et al.) Anyway..bottom line is they OWE her one now. Sean Penn nails it, as does the rest of the supporting cast in ""I Am Sam"", particularly Dakota Fanning as Penn's precocious daughter in a performance that's sure to put her on the Jodie Foster track in a big hurry. ""Sam"" is a 5-hankie tear-jerker, but for all the right reasons. And the use of the Beatles' music as a sound track is on target.

75,Chrissie,Worthwhile tear-jerker,9,5 August 2002,"The critics seem to hate I Am Sam, probably because they don't actually know any folks with developmental disabilities. Although it has its mawkish sentimental moments, I Am Sam is watchable and charming. Even the ""bad guys"" aren't bad; they're just prejudiced (like Roger Ebert, whose review took a strong, ""How hard can it be to play a retard?"" flavor). The experiences of Sam and his friends are true to life -- struggling to cope in a world that expects you to think quickly, but not necessarily thoroughly. Sam has ""heart smarts."" I particularly enjoyed watching the smartass lawyer come to see Sam as a person, and as a peer.There were a few plot holes (such as the way Sam got arrested for soliciting when no money, or even promise of money, was exchanged), but the film's biggest flaw was its unrealistically happy ending.

76,Willie-12,Love is not all you need,7,19 November 2002,"*possible spoilers* I have a few complaints about this film, and yet I actually somewhat enjoyed it. The acting was very good, especially Sean Penn's performance as a mentally challenged man fighting to keep custody of his daughter. First of all, for the past five years I have worked closely with mentally disabled individuals, and although some of them are very kind, and have a loving nature, I've yet to come across one that would be capable of taking on the responsibility of raising a child. I can also assure you that in real life, the attempt to take the child out of the home by social services would have occurred long before the child ever reached her fifth birthday. So while I think the outcome of the movie was what I consider to be not realistic, I still liked the ending, the way I have enjoyed many endings to films that I consider to be fiction. I also thought the film had some problems from a technical standpoint. Why this filming style was adopted for this type of movie is beyond me. Normal camera angles, with a nice dramatic symphony score would have been much more pleasing to the eyes and ears. The music that was ultimately chosen for this movie was so out of place at times (and I usually love The Beatles) that it became very annoying. Even with all of these problems, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the movie because of a pretty decent script, and some very good acting. But as always, that's just my opinion.",I Am Sam

However, as a dark comedy that the whole family can enjoy, it is spectacular. Sean Penn is so earnest, forthright, and full of wisdom in this film, that we were in hysterics because he really does look and sound like a low IQ, totally handicapped person. But he is deep, perceptive and spews the lines equaling about 110 or 120 IQ.

Let me tell you something: Not like this it hasn't.This is a film about parenting in a world challenging parents to balance priorities.  It's about much more than an autistic's desire to parent.  It is centered around juggling love and life - setting priorities ... ""All you need is love,"" right John, Paul, George and Ringo?  An oversimplification for sure...  which is why it's a fairy tale with a moral.  Love your kids. Balance your life.

The woman disappears and it is for Sam to try to raise the child on his own. Thankfully he gets a wealth of help from one of his neighbours and without that I don't think he would have succeeded.On his daughter Lucy's seventh birthday the social services take her away from Sam with a view to putting her into care and eventually adoption.Sam eventually enlists the help of Rita on a Pro Bono basis. Rita is coerced into taking the case free of charge by her colleagues.She initially considers that Sam has no chance of winning his case but as she gets to know him and Lucy she realises that they are perfect together and the love each has for the other has no bounds.Rita has been having problems with her own son but with the help of Sam she learns to appreciate her son and learns how to be a good mother.SPOILER ENDS Sean Penn played Sam Dawson the Autistic father of Lucy Diamond. A young Dakota Fanning acted this role.Michelle Pfeiffer played Rita Harrison Williams, Sam and Lucy's lawyer.Penn was nominated for an Oscar for his acting in 'I am Sam' but it was won by Russel Crowe for Gladiaor.As good as Crowe's acting was in Gladiator I feel that Sean Penn was robbed of the Oscar as I feel he was much more deserving. If he had won he would have had a hat trick of Best Actor Oscars.Dakota Fanning was her usual immaculate self as a child star and played her part to perfection.So to did Michelle Pfeiffer who showed how great an actor she is.All in all this movie is well deserving of a 10 rating and in my opinion deserved the Oscar for Best Movie also.",I Am Sam
82,Andres24,Love above all,8,29 March 2002,"Sam Dawson is a man who has an incapacity.  He's thoughts are of a 7 year old kid.  He has a daughter whose mother dissapeared after she was born. The question here is if Sam is capable to take after his daughter after her inteligence becomes better than him... He hires a lawyer only interested in money.  At the beginning of the relationship she only wants money but that will change.  It will happen to all of them.  He has friends, some of them with are handicapped too. I think this movie is very good because of the plot, screenplay and music. But Sean Penn is wonderful, he should have won the award at the Oscar's. His Sam doesn't look as a handicapped, he lookes as a very devoted father/ man who loves his child, who is a man with no problems.  M. P. looks good too and Lucy, Dakota Fanning, is for me a project for the future in the category of actress.  It is impossible not to cry unless your heart is a rock.  You'll laugh too.

83,alicespiral,Real Love,10,18 February 2007,"This kind of thing in the UK is all too real.In fact Social Services have removed many kids from their parents-in most cases not single ones but BOTH-and the same Social Services are directly responsible for kids being murdered because if a child has been placed on the AT RISK register SSs have never monitored them properly.Its happened twice this year and its only February! So this movie is not as much fiction its a comment on Society as well. Its very well done and only an oddball would criticise it.It was over too soon really and seems wide open for a sequel to take the story further after the implications at the end,that the chosen foster mother whose husband left her could very well develop a relationship after Sam told her every child needs a mother. The circumstances of his daughter's birth told the viewer earlier that she wasn't planned that she was an accident but the woman who gave birth to her didn't want her hence she was taken by Sam. Soon the SS comes snooping and she's taken away-yet she's not at risk. Sam is seen as not being fit to raise a child so get legal aid to fight it and this is the main of the story. Sam is supposed to be retarded yet his knowledge of the Beatles is good enough for him to have been employed as a Beatles Tour Guide if such a thing had been available in his town. Right from the beginning you are on his side and definitely not the prosecutors in the court room who are just throwing the book around all the time-a job they do because they're paid to do it. One of them reminds Sam his daughter will be 6 years in front of him IQ wise by the time she's 13 but that's a dumb thing to say-today kids are teaching their parents things like using computersIn fact Sam talks a lot of sense while the prosecutor is only thinking of her monthly salary The use of Beatles songs was a great idea as so many of the songs act as comments on the situation. So imagine a scenario for a sequel-it begins in the Court Room where Sam has to say whether his circumstances have changed and Sam is able to say he and the foster mother have decided to get married.The story could then turn into Sam becoming a successful tour guide for the town's new Beatles museum",I Am Sam
84,funky_cherry86,An Emotional Film,10,27 August 2006,"This is the third Sean Penn film that I've seen since Fast Times At Ridgemont High and Mystic River and it was a wonderfully, moving story to watch. He is a great actor who gave a stunning performance worthy of an Oscar award, never has a movie touched at my heart like I Am Sam has. The rest of the cast did a phenomenal job, newcomer Dakota Fanning was adorable and sweet as Lucy a 7 year old girl who is wiser beyond her years.Sam Dawson, (Penn) is a mentally challenged man who works at a Starbucks coffeehouse and is a huge fan of the Beatles, he just had a baby girl with Rebecca (Keenan) a homeless woman. She abandons them outside the hospital and he is left to look after his daughter whom he names Lucy Diamond on his own. Sam has help raising his daughter from a group of wonderful friends Ifty (Hutchison), Robert (DeSantis) , Annie Cassell (Wiest & Joe (Rosenberg). But as Lucy (Fanning) reaches the age of 7 Sam's limitations begins to be a problem, she holds back to avoid being smarter than he is.When social services takes her away Sam hires big time lawyer Rita Harrison (Pfeiffer ) to take the case as pro bono, he hopes that this woman can help him get his daughter back. As time passes by Sam teaches Rita about love and family and whether it's all you really need. The scene I like the best is when he's looking at his daughter in awe after she arrives.",I Am Sam

86,segacs,"Yes, I admit I cried",8,5 February 2005,"I'm a girl, so I'm allowed to admit I cried during this one. Machismo or not, I bet I would have seen some misty male eyes in the theatre had I bothered to look. I Am Sam is a rare movie that's touching, funny, and heartwarming.Sean Penn is Sam Dawson, a mentally challenged single father. The reason I say ""is"" and not ""plays"" is that Penn does such a brilliant job in this role, it is as though he actually becomes Sam, in much the same way that Tom Hanks became Forrest Gump. I don't like Sean Penn personally. I find his politics obnoxious, and his soapbox ways of preaching them nearly intolerable. But there's no doubt the man can act. For the entire length of the movie, he never slipped from his character for a second. He was so convincing and believable, I half expected him to sound like Sam when he interviewed on Oprah Winfrey.Despite its ingenuity, Penn's performance is not the only standout one in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer is inspired in her role as a driven, frazzled, neurotic ultra-successful lawyer with a suffering home life. Several of the supporting roles are played by actors with mental disabilities, which only adds to the richness of the cast. And Dakota Fanning is captivating as Lucy, the seven-year-old who knows her daddy is ""different"" but loves him anyway and wants to fight not to be separated from him.The main problem with this movie is that it requires a significant amount of suspension of disbelief. Are we really to believe that a man with Sam's mental capacity was able to raise and take care of his daughter singlehandedly for seven years, without major catastrophe? His job would hardly be able to cover his rent, let alone child care expenses, and he lacked many basic skills necessary to raise any child, let alone such a well-adjusted one as the girl in the movie.And it does raise some questions about who to root for. Sam is the ""good guy"" and presumably, the audience is on his side. But is it really in the best interest of the child for him to win custody? I mean, in real life, she might have been placed in an indifferent or even abusive foster care situation, but this movie comes up with Laura Dern as a picture-perfect mom-substitute. Wouldn't Lucy be better off with her? Even Sam concedes this at the end, so why don't we? However, if you can turn this off for a couple of hours, there aren't too many viewing experiences that are more enjoyable.",I Am Sam
87,Juan_from_Bogota,"Superb Combination of Acting, Music and Script.!",9,20 April 2007,"This amazing movie shows a very well obtained combination of excellent acting (specially Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning), a powerful and deep script and the excellent choice of a music to make you feel totally the beauty of this film, a piece of art. It's also well fitted how the camera shots move constantly, making you feel more like being next to the characters and almost feel inside the story. Besides the characters of Sam and Lucy, my heart got touched by Brad, what a performance!, he deserves a prize for this!. Thumbs up for Jessie Nelson!.About the Movie: This touching story is about Sam (Sean Penn) a man mentally retarded who works at Starbucks, has some particular friends (also with mental problems), but very close and is a fan of the Beatles, and who has a daughter with a homeless woman who abandoned him and his daughter too. He named her daughter Lucy Diamonds (Dakota Fanning) (after Lucy and the Sky with Diamonds Beatles song). He makes his best effort to raise her and they develop a relation based on pure love. When Lucy gets to 7 years old, she start to became smarter than his father (who according to studies has a 7 year old boy I.Q.), Because of that, the authorities take her away from him in order to search for adoption by a standard family. Sam starts a quest to recover back his daughter; and he finds help on Rita Harrison (Michele Pfeiffer), a high price lawyer who takes his case as Pro Bono. The story evolves emotionally, visually an musically almost perfect, reaching the point of a piece of art.9/10! Two Thumbs Up, Excellent!",I Am Sam

Michelle Pfieffer was great in her role as well. I thought this was like Forrest Gump in a way. A mentally challenged man who is trying to prove he is capable of doing important things dispite his condition. I think this is one of the most astonishing story in literature. Only great actors can achieve this kind of role like Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", and Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam."" You really have to know how a person in this condition really thinks to be able to act in this kind of part. This movie was great and I recommend it to all viewers who like to be touched by excellent acting.",I Am Sam
89,bellhollow,An authentic mentally handicapped movie.,9,6 April 2004,"After having lived with a mentally handicapped brother since I was born, I have seen many films that were not good at presenting the mannerisms of the mentally handicapped.  This movie showed the main character, Sean Penn, being overwhelmed.  The best scene for me involved the shopping for diapers. Penn is trying to decide what to buy and their are too many choices. The camera is showing the shelves and Penn swirling round and round.  What made this show work for me was the show had this mentally handicapped man being stuck with his daughter and the interference from people who had no clue as to what mentally handicapped people might be capable.  So many people have no clue that the mentally handicapped people have or want sexual relations and some do bear children.  And believe it or not, parents and siblings actually love their mentally handicapped child or sibling.  What I would say about my brother is that he is 100% forgiving for the horrible things that have happened in his life and has a unique perspective.  He also gets upset over what may seem stupid such as ""I want potatoes for supper tonight."" Sam gets highly upset at the new restaurant wanting the familiarity of the old menu.  He wants to do the same things over and over again.  This was a believable story with a great ending.  I wasn't setting there thinking, ""Who was the stupid director/writer who wrote another story about the mentally handicapped with too many inaccuracies.""  This was a really good movie and I'm glad I finally watched it.",I Am Sam
90,lawrence_elliott,Tender! Moving! Genuinely Heart-Warming! Sean Penn Works Magic!,8,18 March 2008,"This is really a good movie. After seeing it once I had this strong urge to watch it again the next day. This story is loaded with Beatles music and many references to their personal lives which is interesting and effective. This film pulls at the heartstrings constantly and is emotionally draining in a positive way. A lovely and tender rendition of what ""Love"" is all about. Dakota Fanning as the little 7 year old is endearing and Sean Penn as the retarded father who has only the mental capacity of a 7 year old is brilliant in his portrayal. My hat goes off to Sean Penn not only for his fine performance but also for his willingness to do such a role. This is a film for big hearts and for Daddys who love their daughters. The injection of all those dogs in the latter part of the film is a fine bit of emotional manoeuvering that is cleverly timed. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a good performance as Sean Penn's lawyer. Her emotional breakdown puts us all on a level with ""Sam"" Dawson so that we can, as a collective whole, identify with and understand his plight in life. There are several references to ""Kramer vs Kramer"" which are appropriate. The state interferes in their lives by ""stealing"" away Sam's daughter for her ""best interests"" because he cannot take care of her the way the state sees fit. The harshness of the state (government) interfering in and controlling our lives is bluntly put on screen. We are all worn down by life but ""Love"" is the sustaining power that saves us all from depression and ultimate extinction. This is a story about the triumph of ""love against all odds"" that will linger on in your memory long after this film is over. As the little girl says (echoing a Beatles song) in response to the harassing lawyer's questions - ""Love is all you need."" See it. Own it. This is truly a fine film.",I Am Sam
91,johanleupen,Forget I Am Sam and just go rent Kramer vs. Kramer instead.,5,26 April 2002,"I Am Sam centers on the dramas of mentally challenged Sam losing custody of his 7-year old daughter when authorities start to question his ability to raise her by himself. Penn has received a lot of criticism for his 'oscar fishing'-performance. It is remarkable how well roles portraying mentally challenged people seem to fair with the academy (think of Rain Man, Forrest Gump, Shine and more recently, A Beautiful Mind). Penn emphasises Sam's disability in each and every scene, creating a charicature, a cartoon character that never feels real. When Sam is having trouble adjusting to his new job at Starbucks, he doesn't just mix up orders, he uses the blender without the lid, he starts screaming and yelling and he drinks coffee meant for customers. He reminded me more of Tom Greene than of anything else. Penn has proven in the past he is an excellent actor but frankly i find it ridiculous the academy even considered his performance for the oscar (let alone nominated him). The tendency of director Jessie Nelson to rely on cliches and charicatures is even more obvious in her casting of child actress Dakota Fanning, portraying Sam's daughter. Dakota has 'cute' written all over her, innocently staring into the camera with eyes the size of saucers, in scenes that were written to extract tears from the audience. Furthermore, unlike her father, little Lucy seems possess the mental capabilities of an adult as she miraculously comprehends exactly what is going on around her, all the while shooting off one-liners and kodak moments. And then there is Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of the caffeine-drinking, cartier-wearing hard-as-nails-litigator deciding to take Sam's case pro bono in order to prove to her colleagues she isn't the ice queen after all. Of course during the procedings she rediscovers her own humanity as Sam's unconditional love makes her see her own failure as a mother. Because yes, with all his shortcomings Sam makes for a better parent then she does, having all sorts of troubles with her own son. This part of the plot is particularly poorly developed, showing her hysterically screaming at her son for no apparent reason, also she explains she sometimes tells her son to 'get into the f***ing car' without really knowing why.Nelson is the first to realize that large parts of her film remind us of Kramer vs. Kramer, the quintessential movie dealing with divorce and child custody. Therefore she refers to it constantly, probably wanting to avoid criticism of going down familiar roads (passing it off as an hommage no doubt). Pherhaps the subject matter is similar, but I Am Sam never bears any resemblance to the brilliance of the aforementioned film. Forget I Am Sam and rent Kramer vs. Kramer instead.",I Am Sam
92,cadfile,Powerful without being predictable,10,27 January 2009,"I finally got to see I Am Sam all the way through recently on the late night movie. I'm sorry I missed this when it was fresh in the theaters because it destroyed my bias that it would be one of the obvious tear jerkers and predictable.Thanks to the writing and directing it was far from predictable nor was it obvious.Sean Penn is one of America's classic actors in that he can play just about any role and kill it. Having had a sister who was mentally challenged, he got that part so dead on I was thinking all his character needed to do was hate doctors and it would be my sister up on the screen.The film takes on two powerful topics - mainstreaming mentally challenged adults and child well-being.In the not too distant history people like Sam would have lived their entire lives in an institution. They would live with insane and other people with different mental disorders. ""Normal"" people use to not want them around and would warehouse them out of sight out of mind. Adults that live in the community now are functional but don't comprehend or understand complex ideas that we all take for granted. They don't hide or moderate their feelings.Today the government takes a more active role in protecting children. Some say they get too aggressive but in my view I would rather they make a mistake in a effort to help a child than the other way. Dealing with a mentally challenged parent has to be one of the most difficult things to handle when it comes to child protection.This film does a good job of meshing the two topics without giving either short shrift.Through a series of unfortunate events Sam loses custody of his daughter Lucy. He gets a high power lawyer Rita (played by the excellent Michelle Pfeiffer) to take his case pro-bono, mainly because her co-workers think she would never do pro-bono work. While preparing the case Rita learns first to care about Sam and his case and put her heart into it while also learning about why she was having issues with her own life and her relationship with her son Willy.I said the film was unpredictable and the best example was a scene during a court hearing when Sam is being questioned on the stand. Mr. Turner (played by Richard Schiff) asks Sam what does it take to make a good parent. Sam thinks really hard and starts to give a long speech that seems so lucid and intelligent compared to his previous answers. The people in the room are stunned because the answer is so perfect then we find out he quoted a scene from the movie ""Kramer vs Kramer"". Then the look on the faces in the court room said ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" The ending of the film, while plosive, is left open to interpretation which I also liked.The only quibble I had with the film was that Sam, being mentally challenged and obviously not understanding what was happening to him, was never given any help or an advocate. One example was when he had to see a state appointed psychologist and she explains to him at the start that since she was appointed by the court that he was waving his patient doctor privilege rights. She asks him more than once if he understood and he said he did but there is no way he knew what he was doing. There should have been an advocate there since Rita wasn't there to look out for his rights. Of course that could've been the point - that Sam was being held to the same standards as a intellectually adult person even if it didn't seem fair to Sam.Still this is a great movie and I'm glad I watched it.",I Am Sam
93,Surecure,A film both full and empty at the same time,5,28 June 2005,"I Am Sam is one of those films that you will love for so many reasons and find infuriating at the same time. It is by far one of the best examples of acting talent across the board and evokes such levels of emotion that one is drawn deeply into the story. But, it makes a statement so one-sided and irresponsible that you cannot help but feel like you have just eaten a huge meal of empty calories by the time it is done.The basic premise behind the film is that love is all that one needs in order to raise a child. It does so by showing Sean Penn's character -- a mentally handicapped man -- trying to raise his daughter on his own and having various officials coming down on him to ""take his daughter away from him"". It is a sad reality that is faced by some mentally handicapped parents, and one can't help but feel sorry for the situation.Personally, I have a hard time accepting a film that ignores the reality of severely mentally handicapped caregivers. While they are indeed fully capable of giving as much love as anyone else, it is an unfortunate truth that some lack the mental facilities to properly raise children. I personally knew a mentally disabled person whose mental age was beyond that demonstrated by the character of Sam, and she had a difficult time raising a cat without injuring it regularly. Though she was repeatedly told by her veterinarian what she needed to do, she simply could not keep up to the ever changing demands of raising a living creature.To put it in perspective, imagine Sean Penn replaced by Haley Joel Osment (at his age in the Sixth Sense) and having him take care of Dakota Fanning's character. In fact, that is still an over-exaggeration because Haley's mental age would still have been more than that of the character of Sam. Because we see Sean Penn physically as an adult, we don't question his abilities and we are more likely to feel sorry for him. But one has to look at the mental facilities and give it a likely comparison. We would never leave a 6 year old girl in the care of an 8 year old boy. In the same way, we can't automatically give the care of a 6 year old girl to a physically mature man with the mental facilities of a 8 year old.While there cannot be a perfect parallel between all situations, certainly there must be some semblance of logic applied instead of just presenting heart-tugging sentiment such as what this film prefers to present. I find it irresponsible of the filmmakers to simply ignore the reality of the situation in order for it to hit home emotionally alone.The film could have been equally effective had they simply acknowledged the fact that Sam really did not have the ability to take care of his daughter on his own and explored the emotional consequences of the situation he finds himself. It is tragic, but it is a fact that must be dealt with. And for the creators of this film to suggest the only gauge to deal with this situation is to ask how sorry you feel for the main character is condescending at best.Beneath the emotional surface and the performances, this film is intellectually empty. A movie for the heart, not for the mind.",I Am Sam
94,IOBdennis,Watch-able flick (in a way),4,19 August 2002,"Why do actors think that adults with the mentality of a 7 year old have to act like Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man""?  The story is watch-able, but not the film.  It is a movie with a story that is interesting.  The camera work, however, is infuriatingly irritating.  I wanted to tell the camera operator to put the camera down or put it on a tripod or SOMETHING, just stop weaving around so much.  And whenever someone toward the end of the movie had a line, the camera suddenly jerked in a turn or two for a slightly closer shot.  What was that all about?  Was this to wake the audience up?  The camera work was intrusive.  The director should have fired the cinematographer, or the producer should have fired both the director and the cinematographer.If you want to watch the film, I therefore suggest you keep a bottle of aspirin handy.  The filmwork gave me a headache.",I Am Sam
95,Mattias,Penn's overacting,6,5 September 2004,"A lot of people think that that this is a terrific movie, to a large extent because of Sean Penn playing a mentally disabled Starbucks clerk. His portrayal of this single father with a seven year old daughter was apparently so convincing that he received an Academy Award nomination. If you are one of those who think Penn was stunning in this movie, let me ask you: do you remember Sam's friends, the four gentlemen Mr. Grumpy, Mr. Wise, Mr. Goggles and Mr. Smiley, also mentally disabled? In the scenes with Sam and his friends it is obvious that Penn is only acting. Maybe they are, maybe they are not disabled in real life but my point here is that Penn is trying so hard, yes, overacting, it's almost as if he's gonna split his pants or something. If the friends are actors too, their acting disabled flows smoothly and natural unlike Penn's.As far as playing a mentally disabled person, Penn don't hold a candle compared to Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man (1988) or Leonardo diCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993).This is also a movie about a custody battle. Kramer vs Kramer (father fighting for custody) is still the ultimate custody battle movie followed by Hollow Reed (gay father fighting for custody). Oddly enough, when the movie ended I still wasn't convinced that Sam having custody of his daughter was the best solution...",I Am Sam

It was a very touching movie with great performances by all concerned especially Sean Penn.I have seen some of the reviews to this movie by supposed professional movie critics and I can not help to think that some of these critics are either getting paid to give good reviews or have some other personal biasness towards a movie.  In the case of this movie I get the impression that the critics gave this movie bad reviews because of a personal experience with Sean Penn.Sean Penn was nominated as best actor for this movie and that should tell you something.

98,akon5,Good film with great acting...,9,15 June 2002,"It was rather weird, because I had been to many other touching emotional movies, but this was the first time I noticed a woman was crying next to me, behind me and in front of me. I guess they haven't seen Dancer in the Dark yet.This movie is pretty good. The direction was well paced, alittle slow at times but overall, you won't get bored. A few good ideas were also included for good measures. I love the scene when the guys were trying to record a message in the answering machine, that cracked me up laughing.  But this is a typical hollywood type film, so you won't expect a sad ending or anything bad will happen to the main characters. When I saw Sean in U-Turn, I misjudged him as a one dimensional pretty face actor who can only do one role. Apprently, I am wrong about that. Sean did a very good job in this film, I must say his acting was as good as Danzel in Training Day and Russell in Beautiful Mind. Whoever won in the Oscar night as best actor probably won by a very small fraction since they all did a very good job in their respective roles.8/10",I Am Sam
99,akon5,Rain Man...,9,17 June 2002,"So many reviews had talked about the similarities of this movie to Rain Man. So I took the trouble of going to the video store and actually watch Rain Man. Dustin did a great job in that film, but seriously, I don't know why everyone keep talking about Sean copying him since I can't see any similarities at all. Dustin's character Ray obviously had alot more trouble talking and can't even hold a simple conversation. And whats more, he is a genius on numbers. Even the acting (the way the character is presented) is different, definitely, definitely different. And from my humble opinion, Sean can compare his performance-wise to the great Dustin.
 So there are three possible reasons why there is such a mix up of films. 1), the reviewers actually didn't see the movie. 2), there is a cascade of monkey see and monkey do effect 3) maybe it is a different Rain Man we are talking about.. Oh-oo, Oh-oo., definitely, definitely not good.",I Am Sam
100,stiva,A movie that will touch you deeply.,9,6 June 2009,"I recently saw this movie and I want to write a review immediately.This movie is... how shall I put it... It's kinda hard to put it... okay, it's not a movie. It's a story. It's more like a journey. It talks about a father, Ssm Dawson, who was mentally disabled and whether he is capable of taking care of his 7-year daughter, Lucy Daawson. So the child service takes his daughter away from him and tries to get a foster parents to care for the child. Along the way we see a lot of emotional clashes, like a father who wants to reunite with his daughter, a daughter who wants nothing more than her father's love which only Sam Dawson could give, Sam's attorney Rita who has a husband who is cheating on her and son who feels their parents are not paying close attention towards him, and then the foster family who wants to take custody of Lucy Dawson, seeing her as their own daughter but didn't know how to end the love and affection Lucy and Sam have for each other.It's just difficult to mix systems and rules and conscience, sometimes. I mean, we make a system and follow the rules, do we have to follow the rules all the time ? Or do we have follow our consciences ? Where to follow the System and when do we look into our conscience ? Is it possible to look at them together always ? How does it affect us ? From this movie, do we have to look into the child's affairs in what ways ? Through the rules or through the heart ? Is it right to separate a kid from his/her parents just because they are not intelligent than their kids ? I mean, what parents wouldn't want their kids to be smarter than them ?Sean Penn as Sam gives an Oscar worthy performance. Dakota Fanning as Lucy shines in her role and proves that she's beyond exceptional. Michele Pfeiffer as Rita does justice to her role as well. A very well written movie. At some places I felt the emotion building up in my heart. I wanted to cry in the middle and smile at the end. I have never seen such a powerful movie in my life. It had that much of an impact on me. I am 24 now, I never had a girlfriend and am single, but after seeing this movie, I just want to be a Dad, like right now. It had that much of an impact on me. Awesome performance. Amazing cast. Excellent directing. Nice Script. Nice story. Very well written. Very good editing. Beautiful cinematography. Wonderful musical score. And honestly, I can't see why people are not choosing heavy subjects like this. Nowadays they just want to movies with special effects and stuffs.Just, watch this movie. You'll know what I mean.

Though this film didn't offer that much of surprising plot twists, deep subtle messages or extraordinary attractive scenes, I'd say this film was very good - for its emotional content - the mighty and powerful love between the parent and his child.",I Am Sam

We had ""...Gilbert Grape...the Other Sister...,"" which was a twofer...etc. etc. etc and they have all been done pretty well, but I just think its a touchy subject that has to be approached delicately.I rolled my eyes when I heard of Sean Penn's endeavor and have to admit I was wrong.  Sure this movie wasn't all encompassing and left questions to be answered, but so do they all unless you're carrying around some rotten melon above your shoulders.  No spoilers to be found here.  It had its requisite ""movie moments,"" but went beyond this and was heartfelt and endearing in many areas.I'm sure the cynics will abound and critique this one with a sledge hammer, but if you can lay your hammer down and feel it for just a few moments, you'll know you still have not lost your touch with humanity.  Well worth the time for this viewer.  I hated characters.  I loved them.  They made me sick and made me feel warm again.  Evoking anything is a plus.  Making one feel good is a bonus.

This film is so predictable, artificial and sugary-sweet, you start becoming embarrassed that you're sitting through the entire thing. Every moment of this movie is calculated.  Nothing is genuine.  Even the Beatles' songs (all remakes) are cued up at the exact right time with a lyric appropriately fitting the sappy situation at hand.  And the product placements.  This thing doesn't even try to be subtle with the way the products are placed.  Half the conversations center around Starbucks or Pizza Hut or Payless Shoes, or take place in one of those, or many other assorted corporate facilities.  Now that I've slammed this film sufficiently enough, I'll admit that the acting is okay (although I couldn't decide if Sean Penn was playing a retarded man or playing Dustin Hoffman playing an Autistic Savant), and there are a few funny parts.  It's not worth seeing at the theater, or even worth renting, but if it's on TV some night, well, it still really isn't that worth it.

As a child my family were briefly involved in the ""child-custody legal proceedings"". I think this movie does a good job showing how child service lawyers (scum of the earth) have the ability to prove that love is not a factor in determining whats best in raising a child in our society. If you have ever been through this you know that these legal proceedings can damage a child long term far more that the problems that are going on in the home. I think the foster mother at the end really showed how bad this idea of removing children from one home to give them to someone else (usually do to inability to have their own) is a quiet epidemic running through the courts right now. The lawyers and child services lady were just sickening! Something tells me they would have had this beautiful and intelligent child aborted given the chance. Almost seemed to be masking as Eugenics believers. I usually don't like when other artists cover the Beatles but this soundtrack was awesome! I guess what really surprised me about this movie was the cast. Uber-liberals fighting against government institutions that they support in the real world, go figure.

""I Am Sam"" is my people filter -- if you don't like this movie, I won't like you.Sean Penn is a brilliant unconventional actor, perhaps a bit like Paul Newman (who quickly abandoned Hollywood) in that sense. I recall how the critics and IMDb commenters didn't much care for this movie when it came out (check out 2 of the first 5 comments). Astounding, frankly.I think I enjoy the Beatles covers in this movie more than my ""1"" CD. My first awareness of Sarah McLaughlin was her cover of ""Blackbird"" in this movie and my wife today is a big SMc fan.The story, always the most important part of a movie, is immediately familiar and relatively common. So once again we have to appreciate what a superb job of direction, production, acting, editing and general creativity went into this gem to cause it to rise so high above the average.On the downside, of Hollywood not this movie, what frosted my socks the most was that Sean didn't win best actor for this, then won a token Oscar the following year for Mystic River -- a horrendous movie that never appears on TV and is fit only for torturing an Arpaio prison population. OK, I'll let that go, I promise.Test this movie on yourself.

But the movie completely blew me away. This is one of those very few movies(I can count them on the fingers of my hand) that actually brought a tear to my eye. And that was not even because of Sean Penn. But because of Michelle Pfeiffer.Sam is an autistic and retarded person, who has a child out of a stand with a female he gave shelter to one night. The female leaves him to care for the girl on his own. Father and daughter love each other deeply, but soon, the courts come to take her away as they feel Sam isn't capable of taking care of her. The rest of the movie shows how Sam, with the help of a lawyer(Michelle Pfeiffer) tries to get her back.The acting is superb. I cannot understand those critics who dismissed Sean Penn's performance, saying that it was just a desperate attempt to win an Oscar. So what? The man has acted beautifully. Ditto Michelle Pfeiffer. The scene where she breaks down in front of Sam was beautifully enacted. These are two wonderful artists. And Dakota Fanning. Now she is famous, but when i saw her at the time, i was absolutely blown away by her. She had to be the best child artist i had seen in a long time. The supporting cast is all great.If you want to watch a movie which shows how deep human bonds can go, and which will help reassure you that, yes, love does break across all barriers, watch this.

A seven-year old herself, she is just beginning to pass Sam's point of development when Child and Family Services intervenes. Realistically, though, it's preposterous for Lucy to have already reached the age of seven without the authorities taking an interest, without some sort of major mishap, and with only a few wise words from reclusive neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest) to guide Sam.The acting by Sean Penn is amazing. Penn plays a kind, naive, earnest and sincere, busboy in a Los Angeles Starbucks, carefully arranging sweetener packets just so. He also adores ritualized dates with friends. Sean Penn amazingly lost the ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" award to Denzel Washington (Training Day) on that year.The authority and emotion of the climax is absolutely incredible. It's difficult to watch, but is so very worth it, if for nothing else than to watch Penn, a master of his craft at work. Sean Penn is truly at the top of his form here, creating a role that will stick in your heart for quite some time after the cinema lights come up. You find yourself rooting for Sam, in a role of the same standards as classic performances such as Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or Daniel Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot"".A very moving and wise movie. 8/10",I Am Sam

This is mostly because I just did not enjoy the film. Not because it's necessarily a bad film, but just because I found the film to be quite disengaging. The one thing that brings a little zest to the film is Penn's excellent performance as Sam, a mentally disabled man fighting for custody over his child.

He works as a server at Starbucks, is obsessed with The Beatles, and loves IHOP. After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him, and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together, Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears, laughs, and the overwhelming power of human spirit.This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film. Sean Penn is top of his game and gives an amazingly realistic performance as a disabled man without a single flaw. To this day it makes me furious he didn't win the Oscar. Dakota Fanning's premiere role is by far her greatest ever, and at only six years old opened the eyes of actresses who've been in the business for years and basically screamed into their faces ""This is how acting is done."" And Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a phenomenal, incredibly realistic performance that will absolutely take your breath away.As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.And after watching, you won't want to ever give the DVD back to Blockbuster.

Still I despise it with every fiber of my being.Until ""i am sam"" my least favorite movie was ""North."" I was very young when I saw it, and I'd never before seen a movie I didn't like.  I hated it and I didn't know why.  This took over that position, but I know why.The story is about a retarded man....daughter...custody...yeah yeah blah. you can read one of the other reviews for a synopsis.Sean Penn is of course my favorite male actor along with Benicio Del Toro, and his performance is naturally brilliant.  not everything has to be flawed for me to hate this movie as much as I do.  The story makes itself out to be touching but ends up being so sickeningly sweet I wanted to throw up every couple of seconds.  Take his daughter for example, the doppelganger for the Welches grape juice girl.  Of course you can justify a man wanting custody of his daughter when she has the psychological identity of a thirty-year-old.  she delivers each line so precociously that I have this adverse visceral reaction and I feel the urge to strangle puppies.Sam has a fan club of other dunces, some played be real exploited disabled men and some played by Percy from ""The Green Mile.""  The fake one's didn't convince me at all.  They sounded like they were making fun of the real ones.Every scene in this movie (I assume since I had to leave the room because I felt prone to fits of rage.) was shot from across the room zoomed in, hand-held, with a blue filter on the camera.  which is a good effect in ""Traffic.""  In ""i am sam"" the style just makes me want to punch my own grandmother.The worst part about this movie is the sound of dozens of 17 year-old girls going ""awwwWWWWWWW!"" every eight seconds, while all the while my hands are digging into the arm rests of my chair like talons.There is a scene in ""Fight Club"" where the narrator feels so resentful toward the world that he beats the most attractive man he knows until his face is destroyed all the while thinking ""I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.

The acting was generally good, with good acting from Sean Penn portraying the mentally challenged father ""Sam"" who have struggled to get the custody of her daughter Luci. Dakota Fanning's acting was generally good but at times it felt she was a bit too ""mature"" for her age, eg. when she was talking and comforting her father of been different in the restaurant and offering a hand, and also when she was yelling at the 1 way mirror glass. I think it might have been accurate, as children of mentally disabled parents tends to grow up faster. Michelle Phiffer's character portray of the work mother / lawyer also seems a bit forced at times, (when she broked down and cried in Sam's shoulder, it feels poorly act at that particular moment) but gets better in much later part of the film. The ending itself seems a bit rushed, and I have to agree with other reviewer that having a mentally challenged person who certainly have difficulty taking care of himself to win the child custody battle is absurd, but as the tagline of the movie said ""All you need is Love"" and I guess it will be alright ;) we all have to believe in it.

125,mikestollov,Three Reel Weepie That Covers No New Ground,1,3 September 2002,"Well you could dismiss this film as a ""Three Reel Weepie"" except that it goes on for over 2 hours!For a start the plot is yawnful, it's all be done before. Retarded father loses daughter to heartless authorities. He's shown as the idiot who's unimpeded by social restrictions, has no cynicism about unconditional love of his daughter & eventually he wins her back through his unending love for her....... blah blah blah. OK, if you like this stuff, but this is hardly original.It's also pretty much by-the-numbers, with the expected relationship between Sean Pen's ""Sam"" & his hard bitten lawyer, Pfieffer's ""Harrison"", popping up (oh what a surprise, eh?). She even gives him a suit for his court appearance, but can't you just tell he's going to get it all dirty at the last minute? (oh what a surprise.... again....etc etc etc, YAWN!). This goes on & on throughout the whole 2 hours, something I do not expect to have to pay good money to see.To be fair there are some impressive performances. Sean Pen as Sam is a wonderful performance, seldom does he lose the character's multitude of ticks, quirks & other autism habits. Pfieffer is a real pro' & can seemingly take on any role with ease & keep your eye on her when on screen without looking as though she's actually working hard (which she most likely is, but that's the skill, isn't it?). The supporting cast are also competent, with Laura Dearn as the foster mother, Lucy Diamond Dawson as ""Sam""'s daughter & even Brent Spiner as a shoe salesman (the cameo has REALLY had a come back it seems). As for Sam's film obsessed friends, you couldn't really tell if they were also autistic or not. Were they actors or were they autistic actors? Either way they were the foil for some slight comedy & character insights.The camera work & direction is also polished, Jessie Nelson plays with colours quite a lot (notice the bright, almost primary colours of Sam's world & the drab colours of the real world.... also the child protection agent appears in almost monochrome at times, except her earings which are bright gold.... etc etc). This reminded me of the wonderful ""Three Kings"" where colour & hue played an important part of the atmosphere when following the various plot threads.Some of the ""Sam plays with daughter"" flash backs were so twee they almost seemed like washing powder ads, but it was always well done.The underlying weakness of the film is the plot. It's so limp wristed & wishy washy that you wonder how it's going to hold together without completely falling into old cliches. In fact the end creeps up on you in such a hopelessly weak manner I had to wonder if I'd missed something.

126,mikestollov,"Utter, Relentless, Mind Numbing Tripe",1,15 October 2003,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. With relentless emotional manipulation piled on top of wooden acting & a dreadful script. See how bad the world treats Sam. See how good this simpleton is to his daughter. How pure his love, how corrupt & selfish the ""normal"" people are. Blah blah blah. Pass me that empty popcorn bag, I'm gonna hurl.It isn't that the story hasn't got a point, but that it is horrificaly overplayed, the message being delivered in industrial amounts. It's like expecting a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee & getting 2lbs of sacharrine dumped in it instead.The clumsy manipulation isn't limited to the script, with wooden, cliched characterization & oh so obvious directorial & cinemagraphic tricks. Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter, but have a cold, blue, almost monochrome color during the court scenes. Sublety seemsnot to be this film's strong point & wherever there is a chance to drive a point home with a sledgehammer the opportunity is taken to do so with obvious enthusiasm.Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable, but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look. She does her best with the part, but ultimately the clunking story & dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck. God only knows why she agreed to add this turkey to her resume. Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time. Maybe it simply paid well & the rent on her mansion was due.Sean Penn is simply diabolically bad, unconvincing & puke inducing as Sam. Laura Dearn ambles through looking like she's smelt something bad. The rest of the cast simply wallow around, subsumed by the crushing sentimentality.This whole film stinks. The one area where there is some very limited relief is the soundtrack, where Beatles tunes are played. Even here this is spoiled, for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands & even then we only get snatches.When you consider how many great film ideas never get anywhere you have to wonder just how this pile of poop ever got onto the screen.

So eventually, a lawyer named Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfieffer) takes his case.I was told Sean Penn used to beat up photographers, but I'm not hesitant to say he did a good job in ""I Am Sam."" Maybe it's because this is the first movie starring him that I've seen, but I believed he was the mentally retarded but lovable Sam. And Michelle Pfieffer did a great job. Her character, Rita, is basically heartless. But Sam changes her and gets her to spend more time with her family.But the real standout performance was Dakota Fanning, who played Lucy. She was excellent for a child actor, and same here, I believed her.Like others say, this WAS filmed at weird camera angles, but I think it fits the theme. It's in the eyes of Sam, who sees everything in a different way.

Sam's life consists of his daughter, his job as a waiter in Starbucks, his friends, who are mentally disabled like him, and the Beatles. His love for his daughter, named Lucy Diamond after a Beatles' song, is honest, true and unconditional. He might be retarded, be he knows and understands love much better than many other people, including his lawyer, Rita, a rich but unhappy woman who constantly lies to other people and cannot even find the time to spend with her only son. Perhaps Sam's love for his daughter is expressed through a line in the Beatles' song ""Michelle"", which Sam repeats in court: ""I love you, I love you, I love you"". Rita is to help Sam keep the custody of his daughter, but it is through Sam that she learns to find happiness in her cold and hectic life.Although the film sometimes goes towards clichés, the brilliant performances of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning make it a memorable film.

131,monabassil,Yes you *are* Sam!,5,20 March 2002,"""I am Sam"" is about a mentally disabled father, Sam (Sean Penn) who fights for the custody of his 7-year-old daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning), with the help of lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) and neighbour Annie (Diane Wiest).It has a good humanitarian side to it; it is a reminder that mentally challenged people deserve to be treated kindly, and that sometimes they are more capable of giving love than people with better I.Q.s.
Sam adores his daughter, who loves him just as much but she is smart enough to notice that her mental capacities are superior to his. They share such a wonderful complicity that I find it hard to believe that a father-daughter relationship can be that solid. The premise is incredible. No one ever raises any questions about Sam's ability to raise his daughter until she is seven! Sam is the father every child wishes to have: he is caring, patient, loving, giving and selfless. He cares too much for her and not enough for himself; I'm no psychiatrist but it is commonly believed that autistic people are much more self-centered than that! Another unrealistic part: with all due respect to mentally challenged persons, I doubt that a restaurant as popular as Pizza Hutt and a coffee shop as famous as Starbucks would actually hire someone like Sam, regardless of his position. Moreover, everyone in this movie seems to be afflicted with some sort of a mental or emotional problem. Lucy suffers from anxiety, Sam and his close friends are all mentally handicapped, Rita has problem communicating with her son and her marriage is falling apart, Annie has not left her room in years, and even one particular doctor who testifies against Sam in court has developed a guilt pattern because her son died of an overdose.All of these elements combined make the viewers feel they are being manipulated in a somewhat obvious manner. Finally, let's be objective here: the whole movie focuses on reuniting Sam and Lucy, regardless of Sam's handicap and how the latter would lessen the girl's mental and educational growth. Undoubtedly, Lucy would never find a more loving father, but she also needs 'regular' people's guidance and besides, he needs assistance himself! The filmmakers were obviously not sure how to end the movie in a believable manner, therefore the ending was ambiguous. Lucy most probably ends up being ""shared"" by Sam and her foster family, Rita seems to have regained her son's trust, and Sam's mentally challenged friends will have the same habits for the rest of their lives, like video night every Friday.So I guess that is a (sappy) happy ending. Again, not very believable and too many questions are left unanswered. Overall, the movie is good; it is very moving and at times, it does put a smile on your cynical face. :) Everyone gives an excellent performance, even Fanning, though I find her character a bit too smart and perceptive for her age. The soudtrack rules! But then again, I'm a Beatles addict, so it's hard for me to be objective. I enjoyed the scenes of Sam and Lucy together and how certain Beatles cover songs fitted the mood and situation. Sam is a Beatles freak himself; he named his daughter Lucy Diamond after ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and throughout the movie, he uses analogies related to the band's life and songs to express his feelings and point of view; those portions of the script are clever and make his character interesting and rather 'creative' compared to, say, Rainman. Fortunately, the movie did not stay in the courtroom and ended on a football playground. ""I am Sam"" has garnered Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and he truly deserves to win that award.",I Am Sam
132,Matchstick,WTF is up with the camera work?!?,7,18 June 2002,"The only reason I saw this movie was because of Sean Penn, who IMHO, is among the top five American actors around today. I knew what I was getting myself into when I rented this. I mean, a retarded man getting his daughter taken away, this has cry-fest written all over it. There were some moments where I got a little misty eyed, but the emotional scenes started to get too frequent and a little over-gratuitous. I liked the story, that is, WHEN I WASN'T DISTRACTED BY THE CAMERA MOVEMENTS!!! OMG, what was the cinematographer thinking? It had the amature feel of a couple of junior high A/V geeks trying to shoot a homemade Megadeath video; a lot of handheld in the movie, boyo. Quick pans and quick inappropriate zooms. The editing was equally distracting, chop, chop, cha-chop, ch-ch-chop chop, I thought I was going to have a fu*king seizure. That being said, I thought the story was touching enough albeit unrealistic. Who in their right mind would agree to have this guy be the legal guardian of himself, let alone a child? There I go again, hey, this is a movie that you just have to roll with it a little and you'll enjoy it perhaps. Sean Penn carries this movie like Atlas, man, that dude can act. Oh, BTW, I'm sick of some of these reviewers saying his performance didn't seem realistic, like they are some kind of an authority on the mentally retarded. Give me a break. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent. Everyone else does a decent job too. Oh, and that Dakota Fanning kid, what a little sweetheart and fine actress. They could have really sunk this movie quickly if they had cast some untalented hack kid actor (does anyone remember the kid who played Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace?), but she pulls it off. Too bad the only thing holding this movie back is the story, over-indulgent sap and mind-blowing inappropriate camera/editing work. [6/10]",I Am Sam
133,btzarevski,Brilliant Sean Penn!,8,4 April 2010,"I'm sorry, but have some of the people here actually seen I Am Sam to give it 1/10? Anything below 7/10 does not do this movie justice.You can read the summary for yourselves, I'm going to briefly tell you about the ACTUAL acting. Sean Penn is utterly, unmistakably brilliant. His portrayal is touching and brought me near tears on numerous occasions. How he did not win the Oscar for this baffles me.Michelle Pfeiffer also throws in a very good performance and her character development throughout the movie is impressive; she does very well to depict a person who needs a reality check(in this case Sam) to really examine her life.At 6 or 7 years old, Dakota Fanning does extremely well to fit into her role with great maturity yet still maintain innocence and deep love for her father.I cannot stress enough how well Penn is and I am amongst the many who believe he is underrated; especially in this movie. A must see for anybody; forget about the technicalities of what is realistic and what isn't. This is not based on a true story, it is fictitious accounts. Enjoy the movie for what it is; a heart-warming tale of a father's undeniable love.",I Am Sam
134,jcsuperjake,An emotional roller coaster,10,27 December 2011,"The roller coaster is still going too! What a ride. An amazing movie. I Am Sam is about a middle aged man named Sam who is Mentally retarded, who has a daughter of his own. The woman who gave birth to her runs off. Eight years later, he has to fight custody with his own daughter. I never get choked up, nor emotional when I watch a movie. This was something different, however. Sean Penn is astonishing as Sam. I can not think of anyone else who could have played the role better than him. I do not know how he could have pulled it off, but he did. Then comes Dakota Fanning. How old was she when she did this role? I do not know, but my oh my, she was *bleeping* fantastic. For such a young age, she was able to pull this off. I do not know how she did it, as well as Sean Penn, but they day. I want to compare her with Shirley Temple. For both of them, at such a young age, they are able to play some really difficult parts, and they play them real well! A spectacular cast for an exceptional movie. I have never thought of a movie this much different than critics.",I Am Sam

This story is not easy to watch since I kept thinking about the real life differently abled parents who have to fight for their children without the help of lawyers like Michelle Pfeiffers character.  Thankfully this film has an optimistic happy ending, which was a nice change--I thought that maybe it wouldnt since Sean Penn's character is walking a thin line between getting his daughter back and losing her.

136,paul-kristensen,I am Sam,8,18 November 2010,"I am Sam is a sad and depressing movie. It talks about child birth defects and autism. Also how a man named Sam is born with autism, and has a child named Lucy and tries to raise her.The movie I am Sam is about a man named Sam who is on a seventh grade level. He was born with autism. Sam works at a coffee shop, but is only allowed to deliver the coffee. He meets a lady who is homeless and lets her live with him. She gets pregnant and they have a little girl named Lucy. The mother runs away when she is born and leaves Sam to raise her. Sam lives next door to a lady named Annie who becomes Lucy's God mother. Annie helps Sam out with Lucy and answers any questions Sam has. San and Lucy are fine until she turns seven. A conflict happens at her seventh birthday party, while a lady from DHS is there watching Sam take care of Lucy. They start to worry about Sam taking care of Lucy, so they go to court.The characters in this movie are Sam (Sean Denn), Lucy (Dakota Fanning), Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Annie (Dianne West). Sam is a strong character. He fights for Lucy with the help of Rita, his lawyer. Rita doesn't know how to control her anger. Sam helps and teaches her how to love and care a person. Lucy is also strong; she's just like her dad minus the autism. Annie tries and helps Sam out in court by testifying. The protagonist is Rita and Sam. Antagonist is the people in the court who are against Sam getting Lucy back and being able to raise her.In conclusion, this is a very sad movie to watch and see Sam try to fight for Lucy. It's hard for him to explain how he is a good father and won't worry about her future. It's exciting to find out if Sam gets her back or not. The movie keeps you hooked through out it.",I Am Sam

The best thing about this moviie though is you can cry at times and you can laugh at times. And you need that in a movie. Well when the story starts Sam is at work and looks at his watch and goes to the hospital where his baby girl is being born. Well after the baby is born and home the mother runs off and says she didn't want a baby with him she just needed a place to stay. And when the baby turns seven she is taken away from her mentally retarded father. But then hee hires a lawyer (Michele Pfiffer) Rita. To find out what happens next RENT THE MOVIE!,I Am Sam

The scenes between Penn and Fanning are very well done and definitely bring tears in your eyes.

We laughed, cried and went through a box of tissues. Frank Capra(Its a Wonderful Life) would have been proud.  Yet, it was not a sugar coated Disney-type film.  The premise and plot were very believable, and the performances were on-the-money.  I only found flaw with one scene where I wasn't really convinced by Michelle Pfeiffer's crying.  Most incredible, was that I never once saw the 'bad-boy' Sean Penn image peak through in his portrayal of the mentally diminished Sam.  I was afraid that I was going to see another Dustin Hoffman 'Rain Man', but Penn's protrayal was completely different, and actually more intriguing.  I Am Sam is a wonderful alternative to the gritty, depressing, ultra-reality style of many films of recent release.

He studied and portrayed the most dynamic disabled person I have ever seen on screen. Having grown up with twin brothers who were mentally disabled, I felt in a superior position to make judgment over the treatment of the characters, the development of the story and the eventual direction of the plot. All were superb.If I had one pick or pan, I didn't think Michelle Pfeiffer was the best choice.

You will notice when she puts her leg out the window it quickly shows no pants. I enjoyed the movie numerous times.

No lawyer is that frenetic, harried, or bumbling like Pfeiffer's is in this messy movie. I did not appreciate Sean Penn's performance either, he just wasn't right for the part. I guess I've just seen him in too many other movies where he is powerful, vengeful, tough, militant, everything that he is NOT in this movie, so in that respect his character simply wasn't believable to me. Also, why is it that movie directors feel they need to put the mentally challenged person in pants that are always too short? It's ridiculous.Michelle Pfeiffer's character is unrealistic. I realize she was merely taking direction, but they made her character a complete idiot.The two best performances in this movie were Dakota Fanning and Richard Schiff, who played the attorney for the state.

147,bdeyes81,A Pleasant Surprise: Schmaltz With Heart,10,29 January 2002,"I can understand why people would love ""I Am Sam"", and I can just as easily understand why people would hate it. It's easy to call the film manipulative and cheesy and predictable...it most certainly is. However, I loved this film, and I can assure you that I did NOT expect to. I'm not sure what exactly I did expect, but I went into this movie fearing the worst; after the wildly mixed reviews, and having nearly overdosed on Cinema Cheese in the terribly disappointing 'The Majestic', I was a bit leery of this film. Much to my surprise, I came out of the theater feeling supremely satisfied.
The film poses its audience a rather difficult question: should a mentally retarded man be allowed to raise a young child, even if he is the biological father? It's bound to leave its audience sharply divided, and this is part of the reason that it could likely spark a love-hate reaction in viewers. I won't bother discussing my views on this subject, I'll leave that up to you. But I will say that the movie made me think, and it made me reassess the values I cherish in life and love. IT goes without saying that any discussion of this film begins and ends with Sean Penn's knockout performance. While I do agree with some fellow IMDB users and a certain film critic that playing mentally retarded individuals is usually just a ploy for Oscar consideration, there's no getting around the fact that ""I Am Sam"" underlines the rationale that Sean Penn is, indeed, the greatest acting talent of his generation. His character may be seemingly ""simple minded"", but his trademark raw emotion is conveyed so beautifully that he adds a whole other dimension to the character that could not possibly have been on paper. And as for Michelle Pfeiffer...she's simply wonderful, as always. She's always boasted the sort of fascinating screen presence that recalls the ladies of Hollywood's Golden Age, but in recent years she's become more comfortable than ever onscreen. She exudes so much charisma and finesse that she makes acting look like the easiest job in the world, all the while bringing about her own personal touch to the character. Many critics have called this one of her best roles, and I would have to agree. However, this is also the biggest fault in the film. Her screen time is surprisingly a LOT less than one would expect going in, and her character is never as fully developed as she should be. I also wish the movie would have focused more on her relationship to Sam. At one point in the film there seems to be a very clear hint of romance in this interaction, but it never amounts to anything. Perhaps it was intended to be conveyed ever so subtly, or perhaps the studio was too afraid of how audiences would react to a possible romance between a hot shot lawyer and a retarded man. Either way, I think that this sort of edginess would have heightended the emotional impact of the film.
""I Am Sam"" is not a perfect film by any stretch, but it's so incredibly good hearted and truly riveting that I don't see the need to pick apart its shortcomings. It's a worthy film to view, and regardless of whether your reaction to the film is negative or positive, it will surely be a potent response. And in this age of instantly forgettable films, that is a worthy accomplishment in itself. My Grade: B+NOTE: It's interesting to point out that this film, released in 2001, is often rather similar to a certain film released in 2000....The Next Best Thing, which starred Penn's ex-wife, Madonna. Both films consciously reference the classic Kramer vs. Kramer in depicting a father's struggle to defy societal prejudice in an attempt to gain custody of his child. It's not a particularly relevant detail, but in a year that began with films directed by Penn and Guy Ritchie (Madonna's husband) being released in America the very same weekend, I'd say it's worth pointing out.",I Am Sam

149,Combat-Carl,A brilliant film which doesn't take the Micky,9,29 October 2009,I Am Sam is brilliant. I thought this was going to be a comedy but it ended up being one of the best tear jerker's I have ever seen. It has a beautiful concept of a struggling father. Sam (Sean Penn) has a daughter called Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning) and they like to read and go to the park together and they both love IHOP. Sounds nice right? The problem with this is that Sam has learning difficulties (I think it's autism) and when his daughter reaches the age of 7 she will have a higher mental age than her dad. The government believe it's best to take Lucy away from Sam (I know!) and Sam doesn't know what's happening. He hires a lawyer called Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is very cold-hearted. Sam shows her what kindness is (I'm not going to spoil how) and she helps him.Even with his disabilities he still fights for her which is very respectful. The way the camera pan around in this film makes it look like a documentary and adds to the tension. All of the characters are really believable. Sean Penn is brilliant because he portrays a disabled well but doesn't take the Micky. Dakota Fanning is amazing even though it is only her second film and she was only 6 yet she steals the show. Michelle Pfeiffer was very good but wasn't too believable in the courtroom. Lucy's foster mother wasn't believable (I know because i'm fostered) but I enjoyed it.Overall the film is unmissable and I'd recommend anyone who doesn't like to point and laugh at other people's misfortunes. If you are going to watch this movie for cheap laughs at disabled people watch it and it will change your mind about them in a heartbeat.,I Am Sam
150,SaarahN,I'd recommend for Father's Day,10,18 August 2016,"I think there are points in everyone's life when we begin to question our parent's love for us, or how we'd have turned out had we been born into a different family. The grass being greener on the other side concept. Then there comes a point when we stop questioning and we start to accept the love for what it is. We settle for 'enough', not willing to believe that perhaps we deserve more than what we have now.This film provokes intense appreciation for all we have been blessed with: we may have faults, deficiencies, we may be victims of disorders, but we are what we make of ourselves: we are more than what we are born with, more than the families we've been born into. No family's perfect: too often we think those who have been born into a rich lifestyle are so happy...But money doesn't solve all of our problems. Money can't buy you love: at least not the real kind of love.This film portrays the powerful love a father has for his child, how he wants the best for her- even if it means separation from him. A man willing to fight and determined to achieve custody of his little girl. I'm unafraid to admit that this film made me cry, sob uncontrollably and made me forget whatever suffering I've ever gone through. Yep-the type of film that shifts your life's problems into perspective. There's nothing greater and more powerful than the love between a child and their caregivers. And there's nothing that serves as a greater blessing than having a love akin to that.I recommend this film because it encompasses a beautiful and true message and because there's real feeling in the characters. I have nothing more to say, just that there aren't enough films out there that have you feeling so broken, only to lift your spirits over.",I Am Sam
151,mashby,Better have a box of Kleenex for this one.,9,21 April 2003,"Just from reading the plot, I think it's fair to say that that there is a high chance that this movie could be a simple sob story that goes for the cliche in order to get you to cry. That NEVER happens in this film. Every emotion, although sometimes gut wrenching, is elicited genuinely from the actors and the story. I should also mention that I grew up next door to a mentally challenged neighbor, so I have had experience with the subject. Although Sam is clearly at the upper end of the spectrum in terms of mental deficiency, Penn nails the role and I think it's one of the best performances of his life. Playing the role of a retarded person is not easy. It's not just a matter of talking funny, or acting stupid - Penn clearly illustrates that fact. Not to mention that he's able to hold the screen acting opposite a child and 5 dogs!In conjunction with Penn's performance, the writing is truly incredible. It's realistic and doesn't portray any of the characters as caricatures of themselves. Richard Schiff, for example, could have been portrayed as simply ""the bad guy"" in his role as Turner, State's Attorney. It would have been an easy choice for the writer's to make and unfortunately, it's a choice that many movies tend to make. Instead, Turner is portrayed as someone doing his job and looking out for the best interests of the child. Although it's one of the more minor roles of the film, the fact that none of characters were ""throw away"" just goes to how how well the script was written.One other element that is often overlooked is the cinematography. Elliot Davis really gives this movie a unique style and feel in his photography and actually plays a role in telling the story. As the color pallets change for the perspective it makes it easier to tell where the perspective has changed as well. One of my favorite scenes involves the Sam in the courtroom and Davis' use of 4 cameras to capture the scene coupled with Richard Chew's editing makes that scene so compelling.Lastly, I have to mention the performances given by the lead women in the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison, gives one of her best performances in her career. The arc that she is able to take her character is not easy. She goes from being someone who has very little in the way of redeeming qualities to someone you can deeply care for. She really stretched herself in this role and took some chances that pay off in spades. And last, but not least, Dakota Fanning plays Sam's daughter Lucy. I haven't seen Dakota in any other films yet, but now I want to. Although playing a child, when you're a child isn't much of a stretch, having to play a child that understands the mentally challenged is. The script gives her everything she needs for the scene, but Dakota has to deliver it and she does. Her talent is well beyond her years and the emotion she is able to convey through her eyes and in her reactions to other characters is truly impressive. Her role could have been the weak link that brought the movie to a much lower level, but she proved to be one of it's anchors.Make no mistake about it, this is a tear jerker, but in the best sense of the word. It's an honest look at a unique situation that shows us many facets and pulls no punches.",I Am Sam

I did find the disability a little inconsistent, the child's father Sam could look after himself and Lucy for 6 years, but can't buy shoes? The film really does make you consider if love is all you need or not. Parts that were extremely emotional for me was when he was reading to Lucy and telling her off for not reading herself. The topic of disability is dealt with sensitively. However, I didn't enjoy all of Dakota's performance. She is an amazing actress and the crying/emotional scenes were amazing, but she acted like an adult at times rather than an average child. I am not sure if she is supposed to be a extremely clever child or not, but the scene where she shouts 'are you writing this down' seems too mature.The ending was quite open vague and up for interpretation. Personally, I believe that Lucy was adopted but it can be read either way.",I Am Sam

However, that wasn't the case. Maybe the movie seems worse to me than it really was because I walked in with very high expectations. But they could have done better, with or without my expectations. The acting was wonderful. Sam and his daughter did a wonderful job playing the part of their character. That wasn't what made it bad. All of the actors did wonderful jobs, and were really well casted, but they were the only part of the movie that made it good. The script was horrible. There were times when it just got too long, and then there were times when it seems rushed. Especially in the end, it seemed like the producers ran out of time, and that they cut out many important scenes. In the end of the movie you kind of don't know what's going on, because either the scenes were cut out, or the script writers left out a lot of information that they needed to keep in.

I felt the acting was fine and had the best individuals for this film.  But, I felt certain parts could have been changed, for example, the ending.

Sean Penn and Dakota fanning chemistry is magic, and it's very believable.So what seems to be the problem? Well let's start off with Michelle Pfeiffer: She did a horrible job. When she cried about her family situation, I was cracking up; because it was one of the most fakest cries I have ever heard. Come on Michelle, we know that you are a talented actress (Scarface), you can do a better job than that.The story wasn't realistic, and you can see that in many of the scenes in this movie. here's an example: Why does Sean Penn character referee a soccer match, he has a mind set of a seven year old, now tell me what seven year old, or mentally retarded referees a soccer match?Why does the camera move all over the place? What kind of effect does that give? All I know that, in the end of the movie I got sick.The music was ok, but at times it felt like the same songs are playing over and over again.What's up with all of the advertisement? It was seriously obvious, and it made the movie like one big corny commercial for starbucks, pizza hut, 7-11, Nike, and etc.If you only want to see great acting with bad co stars, story, and cinematography, I should watch this movie. If you something heart warming, just go and rent Forrest Gump.",I Am Sam

158,krebstar,retarded father and his abnormally `mature` child,4,18 July 2002,"I think that the film was o.k. but because the film's plot was like a mixture of Kramer vs. Kramer and Rain Man, I did not see anything new to make me excited. The acting of Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeifer was very well fitting but the child's role and her acting was what disturbed me most. She is said to be 7 years old and Sam's mental age is also said to be 7 but how come the little girl can act like a 30 year-old grown up? She is so much grown up that it feels she can even look after his father but it was so unrealistic to portray a 7 year-old as an extremely mature girl.Also the film was far too long. It could have made its statement in 2 hours as well. There was too much subthemes like the problematic lawyer (yes i know it was important for the well-being of the plot but from time to time it made me lose the main theme), the never-going-out neighbour. But these are also not very much elaborated either. It was as if all of those plots were loosely fitted to the main plot to underline the statement of `all you need is love to raise a child`. 5/10 and that's for the good performances of Sean,Michelle and Dianne Wiest.",I Am Sam

Whose child had the better existence? Sam's daughter? Or his lawyer Rita's son?I think I'd rather be with a retarded father than parents who were never home and didn't give a sh^#t.This movie made me take a hard look at how I act and live and how maybe if we just have a little more love for ourselves and others that perhaps things will be better.....Great film , score, soundtrack, actors, words, script.I don't care what the critics say or this bs about it being so easy to play a retarded man with ""limited emotions""Since when do mentally handicapped people have limited EMOTIONS?I can't believe a leading critic said that.Whatever.He's the one with the limited emotions.I am Sam slightly changed my life and I will never see things quite the same again ;))I give this film a 10 ...something I don't do too often.",I Am Sam

First and foremost, this movie is a tearjerker and in case you don't snivel or cry, there is something wrong with you.The story is about an autistic father (Sean Penn) who has a 7 year old daugther (Dakota Fanning). Everything changes when the courts rule that the father is not capable to bring up his own daughter due to his mental in-capacities. Enter the lawyer, Michelle Pfeiffer who is materialistic and has no human values. As she fights the case her character changes for the better. The film shows what love can bring. The relationship between the father and the daughter is portrayed beautifully. This movie has shown the range to which a 7 year old kid, Dakota Fanning can act. She is beautiful, so adorable and she has in her to become a great actress.And what do i say for Sean Penn? He has scored a home run and i wonder why he missed out on the 2001 Oscars. Well, he was pitted against Denzil Washington ( Training Day), but having seen both the performances i feel Sean Penn was streets ahead of Denzil that year. Please watch this movie.",I Am Sam

I'm not saying that you have to have kids to understand the true meaning behind this movie, but I must say it certainly helps.  I told my wife on the way back home from the movie that she was sooo stuck with me.  She knew what I was referring to; our 6 month old little girl and our 5 year old little girl.  I guess I'm just a good ole fashion softy.  I came home and gave my 5 year old the biggest hug of her life and the tears just started flowing.  I felt I had been impatient with her lately and just needed to let her know how much her daddy loves her.I know this isn't a true rating of a movie.

Even the blackest of hearts would be moved by this film. Sean Penn's performance as a mentally disabled dad fighting for custody of his daughter is simply awesome & hypnotic which must go down as one of the great performances in cinema history, in what is a very difficult role to play, you forget its Sean Penn and you just become part of Sam's world. Michelle Pfieffer is outstanding as well as an overbearing lawyer who then finds herself as a result of Sam, becoming part of her life.

I love Sam's love for his daughter; it made me wish I had a father like Sam! Love really is what's most important. I believe that was the main point of this movie, and I totally agree. Sam's friends are hilarious, and Lucy is such an intriguing, precocious character. Some really good life lessons in this film. Very touching.

Both Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning were fantastic in their roles, and I have never been as impressed with Mr. Penn as i was in I am Sam.His acting ability in this film was amazing.

It is difficult, deliberately wonderful and repulsive, heart-rending and -warming. So many components, so many good choices!I only wish the actual Beatles recordings I grew up with were made available for this effort -- one of two flaws to one of the finest pictures I've ever seen. The other flaw is the confusion/implausibility of the opening premise by which Sam finds himself holding the baby.Nevertheless, once you get past that, the narrative and everything contributing to that narrative blossoms into a hugely compelling story.Imagine that. All those superlatives I've used for a movie without car chases, explosions, combatants running thru bamboo tops, nudity, gunplay or swordplay. The protagonist is not rich and powerful, doesn't ride off into the sunset with a woman's arms wrapped around his waist...you get the picture.

173,i_am_here,Excellent,10,22 January 2003,"I'll clear my misted eyes...I can think of no other film where ALL participants acted so brilliantly. Even the background extras performed well.  'I am Sam' has been frequently criticised for being emotionally manipulative.  I wouldn't disagree, but consider this can only be the result of the viewer becoming so powerfully drawn to all the characters that they really care what happens to them.Sean Penn is excellent and totally convincing in the role of Sam which is so different to his norm and demonstrates again his great skill. Michelle Pfeiffer played the change in Rita's character throughout the film very well too and she continues to look fantastic.But the star of this film has to be the amazingly talented and beautiful Dakota Fanning as Lucy.  Her acting is so natural, with body language and facial expressions true for every emotion and situation.  She was there to be loved and carried it off superbly.  Not once did she look lost amongst this celebrated company, incredible considering they were all producing near career best performances themselves.*** Possible spoilers ***Sure, there were unbelievable elements to the story, the most serious of which was the reason for Sam's arrest.  And, after Lucy had her first night time 'escape' to visit her father, endangering herself by crossing roads and climbing ladders, are we really to believe she was allowed to repeat the exercise many more times!  However, many of the events causing criticism I consider to have been misunderstood by the critics.  The film is often ambiguous about certain situations or simply lacking in information.  How was Sam able to cope with Lucy during her first seven years?  The film makes no statement that he did it on his own so why should the viewer believe this to be the case.  Many critics appear to believe that the final uplifting scene of the film is also unrealistic.  There would be no way in reality that Sam would regain full custody of Lucy, however much we would wish it to happen.  But where in that scene does it suggest that he has?  Around the football field we see all the major players of a wonderful support network for Sam and Lucy.  Any one of them might have day to day care of Lucy, perhaps allowing Sam unlimited access.  We don't know, and I think it is to the film's credit that it allows the viewer to imagine their own ending.*** End of spoilers ***The superb music is very appropriate with individual songs chosen carefully to complement the screen action. There are two soundtrack albums available, one with all the Beatles cover songs and the other with John Powell's incidental music.  Both are very worthwhile and recommended.In conclusion, a remarkable film, worth watching even if only to see and admire the true art of acting.  It contains no sex or violence and the two hour plus running time passes very quickly.This would be my current choice for a Desert Island DVD, which incidentally is also excellent with many high quality extras adding to the appreciation of 'I am Sam'.  10+/10.",I Am Sam

175,quickiesonthedinnertable,"be prepared to cry, and smile and laugh",8,1 June 2011,"I don't know why I didn't watch this movie sooner. It's been on my list for a while, and I finally caught it on cable today and my eyes are brimming and my nose is running - I'd just like to say that I DO NOT CRY AT MOVIES.Watching this has convinced me that Sean Penn may truly be the most talented actor of my generation. I got sucked right in by his performance and had to keep reminding myself that Penn is not only perfectly normal but probably highly intelligent as well. Dakota Fanning is charming, precocious and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer is always a treat and does not disappoint here. Her transformation from cold, calculating and cynical lawyer with a 'perfect' life to someone warmer, vulnerable and with a less than perfect life, is almost as important a sub-plot as the main story of Sam's struggle to keep his beloved daughter.The premise of the movie is nothing new, but I don't think I've ever seen such delicate and inspired handling of a situation that could so easily have descended into a maudlin melodrama, given its potential for pain and heartache. Plenty of humour and the energetic pacing keep things from being weighed down.The ending is not unexpected, but I really couldn't have seen it going any other way. Definitely recommended for the all around strong performances. Dianne Wiest deserves special mention for her delightful and memorable supporting role.I have a small confession; I gave the movie an extra star because I am a HUGE Beatles fan ;) Enjoy!!",I Am Sam
176,dixonbainbridgeisaledge,One of the best acting performances of all time,9,23 February 2005,"A thoroughly entertaining film that is very touching and moving. It is well directed, produced and flows smoothly at a good pace throughout. The amazing thing, however, is the performance by Sean Penn. It is the best acting performance I have ever seen, and I'd love for someone to show me a better one.By the time I'd got to the end of the film I had absolutely forgotten that Sean Penn was an able-bodied man. It was truly remarkably. Michelle Pfeiffer played her part as a hard-nosed, money-oriented lawyer also very well, and Dakota Fanning, playing Sam's daughter, shows remarkable ability for an actress of her age. A wonderful performance. She may well be winning Oscars for herself in the future, judged on this.It was a fairly unfashionable film in Hollywood and it didn't have quite the glamour or the budget of other films, and certainly didn't have as much publicity as many others. As a result of this, it didn't get the recognition it deserved as a film. However, Sean Penn was nominated for an Oscar for it, but he was beaten by Denzel Washington for his part in Training Day which I find, frankly, incredible.This is why I was so pleased to see Sean Penn win the Oscar in 2004 for his role in Mystic River, even though I believe his role as Sam in this film was much more challenging and therefore so much more of a triumph. Anyway, you must watch it and you will be mesmerised and astonished by the genius that is Sean Penn.",I Am Sam

Who is to say how and who is to raise our children?!?! Has love and compassion become a federal and or state affair?!?!? I think not! And this flik exposes and challenges just that. Love for our children has become an editorial for the masses in this movie. And Penn's character (Sam) albeit that he is retarded shows us that we are quite simply able of caring for ourselves without any intervention from the aforementioned state. We are loving beings (retarded or not) is the message I get from the flik. Show your love no matter what challenges you undertake, and then take it a step further to challenge anyone who may intervene upon your convictions.

179,foolishewe,"Emotional Movie, good for Parents (Good Acting and Story)",9,15 September 2002,"Many reviews here focus on whether you can suspend disbelief on Sean Penn's performance as a retarded/autistic man.  Before going into that, I'll go out on a limb here and say that the mental defects were incidental to the plot, the real issue was how much love Sam (Penn's characte) has for his daughter, Lucy (played by Dakota Fanning). These performances are masterful, Penn really departs from his trouble maker persona in so many of his earlier movies and shows depth that I really didn't expect from him.  This is a breakthrough movie for him, and shows a range far exceeding my expectations Dakota Fanning gives a remarkable performance (I want to see her in other roles).  I'm not very  familiar with the behaviors of mildly autistic/retarded people, but I did find the Sam character believable.  I think part of the issue is the same phenomena as Forrest Gump, that is the genius of the actor comes through, so you have a ""brilliant idiot""  As the father of a young daughter, I could relate.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character was O.K. but not really central to the plot (her acting was O.K. I guess, but not great).  My wife found the intrusive nature of the way the social workers were portrayed compelling. Other review have compared this movie to Rain Man and Kramer vs. Kramer.  I thought this movie was more powerful than Rain Man (which was also good) but I have not seek Kramer vs. Kramer so I cannot make that comparison.I gave the story a 9/10, but if your not a parent or don't like emotional movies you might give it a lower rating.",I Am Sam

I think this film proved its point to him. I absolutely loved it. And so did he.The story, itself, is amazing. But the ACTING is so effective and so powerful. It is like a roller coaster in ways. It is so incredibly funny, then so incredibly sad. It leaves you feeling good, but upset at the same time. You get so connected to Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning's characters in the end that it is very difficult to abstain from emotion. VERY difficult.Scenes that really got me: The scene where Sam and Lucy go to a different restaurant and Sam can't handle the change in routine...The answering machine scene!!The scene where Lucy sneaks out to go be with her dad.Those are just a few that brought tears of sadness and joy to my eyes.

181,loraine2,Unrealistic & frustrating: go watch Rain Man,1,20 January 2002,"Well, that was not the greatest movie to spend six-fifty on. In the beginning, I bit my lip with frustration. Toward the middle, I was groaning inwardly. By the end, I sat in my seat filled with shock, ranting to my friends and anyone else who would listen.Obviously, not enough research went into this film. Sam (Sean Penn) was an unrealistic character. The characters explained that he had autistic tendencies and was retarded. No. I have dealt intimately with autism (living with someone who has it, working at a daycare for children with it, going to preschool in a class with well over half people with disabilities) for over sixteen years, and I can tell you that Sam is well off his marker. He is far too high functioning for some of his low functioning traits. In other words, he becomes incredibly capable when the plotline requires it, then appears to be quite low functioning at other times.He knows the Beatles like the back of his hand. Okay. I can go for that. But how does he apply the songs and life stories to and draw complex connections from the Beatles to his own life? How can he come up with these life lessons for his daughter and profound statements for just the right time (""Always set your dreams high, Lucy."" ""You need to leave your husband."" ""You don't know what it's like when you try and you try and you try, and you never get there!"")? So he is high functioning enough to do all that, but he can't make a drink at Starbucks after many years there? He can't understand concepts simpler than the profound exclamations he makes?Some of the other disabled people in the movie were well done. However, the man who the filmmakers apparently wanted to appear to have autism (the one who kept rattling off movies and their release dates) was a cheap Rain Man rip off but plausible. The largest problem with him however, the thing that made me not believe in him, was that he seemed capable of analyzing the characters in the movies of which he spoke. While this only happened once or twice, it was enough to cause me frustration.Also, there was very little to no background given. How did Sam have a baby? How did he hook up with a woman, hooker or not? How did he raise a child alone (except for the help of a woman who never leaves home) for seven years? How did he know what diapers to buy? How, how, how? How did all of these plot holes sneak by? This only served to confuse viewers and give an unstable view of Sam's abilities. More ""hows"" were generated than answers.The best thing to come out of this movie was Dakota Fanning (Lucy, Sam's daughter). She was the most believable character, and seemed to innately know how to act and react. Laura Dern (Randy, foster mother) was also fantastic. She obviously just wanted the best for little Lucy. Sean Penn did the best he knew how for Sam, but it just wasn't up to par. With a script that had adequate research, a well-defined character with a well-defined disability, and some more research on his part, he would have fared much better.Many think this is ""just a movie"" and doesn't deserve harsh criticism, but face it, this is what the general public sees of disabilities. This is what the average person thinks about people with autism. They'll get their education about disabilities from movies like this one. And what they're seeing is a false image. I'm so sick of seeing autism misrepresented in cinema.If you want to see a good drama that deals with disabilities, Rain Man is the best. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of autistic savant Raymond is dead on-I believed that he was autistic. The next best is What's Eating Gilbert Grape?. Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job with his autistic character Arnie, a completely unrecognizable change from the DiCaprio in Titanic or Romeo and Juliet. If you do want to watch I Am Sam, knock yourself out. Just don't waste any of your time believing it.",I Am Sam

No offense but it was just hilarious to see Sam and his friends talking nonsense. But also it was inspirational because of how much Sam loves Lucy. However if I can rate this 9.5, I would. The reason why is because of the confusing ending. I think they could of done a better job on the ending since it kinda ruined it. But every other part except for the ending was AWESOME! This movie might not be as good as Shawshank's redemption but it has more laughable parts. I would say that this movie is suited for people who like comedy and definitely people who like serious movies. WATCH IT!",I Am Sam
183,realdealholifield,love is all you need (but a good lawyer always helps),9,19 December 2006,"I've heard two big complaints about this movie. The first has been in regards to Sean Penns performance as a mentally retarded man. It's not as good as Rainman, or What's eating Gilbert Grape say reviewers. They're right. It's better. The complaints sound similar to those who frequently complain about movies taken from popular books. It's different then how they saw it the first time, or how they imagined it should be so it's bad.The second common complaint is that it's a ""sappy"" film. It's classified as a drama, so you should come to expect a little sappiness. Otherwise, maybe you should check out a different genre.The chemistry between Sean Penn and Lucy is good. Both their characters are likable, esp Lucy's. Michelle as a cold-hearted lawyer, is far less likable, but I believe that was intended.If you're looking to see a film about ordinary people fighting a flawed system check this one out.

Sure, there were some parts that evoked some emotions, but overall the the movie did not rely on that.The problem that I had with this movie is that if he did have a mental age of 7, where were his supports?  I work with the developmentally disabled and there are all kinds of supports that they have.  Maybe they are not as good in California as they are here, but I cannot believe that they would not be there.  And, if he had fallen through the cracks after school or whenever, why would not the social workers after his daughter see that and set him up with services.  Some of my clients are parents, and they can do it because they have these supports.  Overall, the movie was well acted and well written.

I had heard some good things about it from a friend and decided it may be worth watching.  It was. Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer (and Dakota Fanning, to a lesser extent) gave career-defining performances in this heart-warming picture.  Penn of course plays Sam Dawson, the mentally-challenged father, and excels.  I don't think there's another actor around that could have played this role so effectively. He was supported brilliantly by Pfeiffer as Rita, the lawyer.  The chemistry between the two was truly remarkable.   The movie may have been somewhat unrealistic at times, but it is easy to work around and continue to enjoy.  I also found the performances by real-life mentally-challenged actors Joe and Brad compelling.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.  It makes for a great family film.

The movie is a very heart-warming and relevant story of an intellectually challenged man (Sean Penn) who is father to a 7-year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning). Because of his mental disability, his qualification of being a father is questioned. With help from the hard-working lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, he fights for his custody. I believe this is among the best films I have ever seen. The humour in the film is warm and funny but not hysterically. The acting is stunning; I don't think I have seen a better child performance before (or at least in long while) than the one Dakota Fanning did in this movie, and Sean Penn's performance was unforgettable and beautiful. Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as well and even though she doesn't have the most important role, she adds a nice touch to it. I felt entertained throughout the movie and wasn't bored any time.",I Am Sam

190,arilazar,What a great movie!!,10,11 December 2001,"I knew very little about this movie before I saw it, and it was the best surprise I've had in a long time. About ten minutes in, the first tear popped out of my eye, and by the end I was a wreck. Sometimes I will cry a little at the end of the movie, but never the whole way through like I did with this film. At the same time, it's not a schmaltzy film - it walks a very fine line in that regard, and there were perhaps one or two moments in the whole movie where I felt it was too OTT - given the subject matter, that's a great achievement, as it could have been really sappy - instead it has a beautiful calm touch to it, which is rarely heavyhanded. There are very funny moments in the film as well, which make it extra-great. Sean Penn is the star of the show - he is just fantastic in the role, and deserves the Oscar hands down. There are moments when you think he is going to get angry, and he doesn't, he's just gentle instead the whole way through- and in that way he's so different in this movie from all the others he's been in. What a great achievement he made here! The music is terrific- both the score, and the stunning revamps of old Beatles tunes. The little girl delivers just a fantastic performance - I think I'd have to say it's her and Sean Penn's chemistry along with the music which really makes this movie as good as it is. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a satisfactory performance, but it somehow doesn't hit the same high notes as everything else in this show - I knew what her character arc was going to be straight away, and never connected emotionally to her in a big way - although she still looks so stunning. The cinematography in this movie is also quite interesting - it's quite free form, with a lot of moving around, and hand held, and zooming in and out. On one level that's being so done, and it thought it would obstruct the film - but somehow it gels in the most perfect and organic way. It is a great screenplay, and the ending is very satisfying and quite unpredictable in many ways - it says so much about the integrity and heart of this writer/director. I would highly recommend this show to anybody.",I Am Sam
191,chanw,Wonderful and touching,8,27 April 2003,"First, I love this movie. I love the acting by all the lead actors and the plot. Anyone who is and has been a loving parent will find this movie extra touching.For whatever it's worth, I Am Sam is the first movie that I felt it's worth the time to examine the entire DVD with all the extra material. That included rewatching the entire show with the commentary on. I found that very insightful.That said, although I can't put my finger on anything that stood out, I do find the movie being in short of being totally real and believable.The only nits that I can think of and recall are that 1. how does Sam come up with the expenses for Lucy's party; 2. the ending was unexplained and 3. the relationship between Sam and Rita (other than two who bonded at the end) was unclear.",I Am Sam
192,ray.orourke,Great Movie!,9,27 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is truly a great movie, and has definitely changed my opinion about Sean Penn's acting ability (I had never thought very highly of him before, ever since all those reports of physical violence against the media).  I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend, who happens to be a professional, working with children of this type (autistic, mentally challenged, etc.).  She left the theater in tears, and absolutely loved the movie.  Her opinion of Sean Penn's character was that he was very true to form.  The love you see between him and his daughter, is incredible.What follows might contain some spoiler info, so don't read on if you don't want to know anything about it before going to see this film, which in my own humble opinion, I highly recommend that you do.Every film you see requires that you be willing to partake in something called ""suspension of disbelief,"" which many other posters flaming this film do not appear to understand much about.  They present us with a story, not always the entire life story of the character, but about a specific instance in their lives.  They never said anything about how Sean Penn was raised, not until very deeply into the film, and not much about it.  The agoraphobic neighbor never really says anything about why she can't come over to Sam's apartment to help with the baby, not until much later in the film do you find this out.  I like a little mystery, I like trying to figure things out before they spill the beans, they really don't need to go in to a dispose' of all the why's and wherefore's, just put it into the context of the story and play it well, which I think they have done a superb job of doing. Take it for a simple fact, Sam has a baby with a hooker.  (How?  You must've missed that line in the film, she was ""sleeping"" over at his place, perhaps she felt guilty about taking advantage of the poor guy when he took her in off of the street.)  I don't know how much you know about young children, but most of the ones I've seen have extremely short attention spans - which would explain Sam's loss of reality/lucidity at times.  I've also seen a lot of very intelligent children, children who are much smarter than their age group would indicate, so Sam's daughter's intelligence isn't so surprising after all.  The lawyer came around, though it took some major time for her to do so - the hectic pace of her life and how she had been living it would explain that quite well.  Even the evil witch foster mother comes around at the end, though I would have loved to see that other lawyer get what he deserved for all the pain he put Sam through.So, in my own humble opinion, ignore these flamers and go enjoy this film. It has wonderful characters, great music, and truly manages to touch the heart.  My rating?  A 9, extremely close to 10.",I Am Sam
193,noise64,A best choice movie.,9,30 January 2002,"I saw the film last night and I loved it. Sean Penn, Diane Wiest, Michelle Phiefer and Dakota Fanning gave very good  performances. I have seen films where Super Hollywood Stars play as (*Excuse me, But I don't like to use this word in situations like these*) a retarded adult. Sean Penn is a very dedicated actor, he was convincing as a retarded adult. What attracted me to see the movie at first, was the cinematography, it was raw and vibrant, I knew I saw it somewhere, so I looked I Sam up on imdb! And I found out the cinematographer also did Out of Sight which was also a great film. I also heard that the acting was great (True) so me and my sister went to watch it, my sister cried throughout the film starting from the scene where Lucy asks Sam why he is different and Sam answers with an apology (That's damn touching, Damn my sensitive feelings!) I started crying too, but not much, it got to me when the middle of the movie came by, I forgot which part. If you want to see a movie that moves you or at least in some way entertain you this is it. The Comedy is cute and very funny, the Emotions are so beautiful and lovely, and the Performances from the Director to the Actors to the Photagraphy is brilliant.",I Am Sam

195,SatineandChristian,"Great film, some of the best acting I've seen......",9,3 February 2002,"I Am Sam is a wonderful movie. Although some may view parts as overly emotional, the acting is SO good, and the story is well done, that a few overdone lines in the script do not bring down the level of quality. Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, is the best child performer I have seen in a movie in years. Sean Penn also does probably the best acting of his career, and Michelle Pfeiffer gives an additional strong performance. I think despite the movie's convenient ending, it doesn't always take the happy path. Some scenes are not that easy to watch as Sam DOES make bad decisions in places, and at times, you do wonder if he can take care of Lucy, despite his love and best intentions. The story raises questions and emotions, characters are developed very well. The one thing I wish the movie had done was shown a bit more of Lucy's perspective during the middle of the film, but overall, I still have to give this movie praise.",I Am Sam
196,wolfcariusm,Too real for most to grasp,9,9 May 2002,"It's not in my top 20 but it will probably be top three this year and certainly Sean Penn did a better job than this year's hysterical Oscarette. I am very sad to read some of the earlier comments, it seems to me like some are living too much in the world of movies and are forgetting what life is like. There is no formula for a movie but there are reasons to go and see them. Anyone suggesting it's not worth seeing is probably trying to escape from real life. A friend who watched with me used to work with retarded people and is not a Sean Penn (neither am I) fan but had to admit he mastered this role perfectly. It is also a long time since I sat in such a quiet full cinema. Movies are about more than just movies.",I Am Sam
197,eltonpharoah,A Masterpiece For All Time!!!,10,23 April 2008,"I can only say that, 'I loved this movie'. And if I had any complaint whatsoever. It would be that, I thought it was too short. I loved every moment of this film.The story isn't very complex. And there are no real surprises along the way. But the beauty is in watching these personalities manifest themselves. It is in understanding these characters that makes this movie interesting.People tend to forget that movies are not reality. The director is there to tell a story. And I think she hits it on the bullseye on this one!!!Bottom line: If you lack empathy, or think movies should be real, or action packed, ,or contain explosions... then do not watch this movie. But if you want an emotional film about humanity, I could not recommend a better film!!!",I Am Sam

199,marigoldgirl77,Amazing movie,10,30 December 2004,"This movie is positively amazing. Sean Penn is incredibly fabulous as Sam. I didn't originally see this movie for Sean Penn or Michelle Pfiffer but for Dakota Fanning. As it was her first breakout movie, I don't know what I expected, but she is the most talented little girl I've ever laid eyes on. I follow her career now and see her movies. She is a truly amazing little actress and she's only ten years old (as of Dec. 04.) I would highly recommend this movie if you're not afraid of a little crying or emotional feelings because it is truly inspiring and amazing. If you won't see it for any other reason, see it for Dakota Fanning. She will blow you away.",I Am Sam
200,wiestie328,A Wonderful Movie,8,19 April 2004,"A drama about love and family, ""I Am Sam"" is a wonderful movie that everyone should see.  Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a retarded man whose wife walked out when his daughter, Lucy (Dakota Fanning), was born.  With the help of his friend Annie (Dianne Wiest) and other retarded men he had befriended, Lucy grows up to be a cute, sweet, loveable 7-year-old.  However, Lucy's school grows concerned about her living with a father whose mental capacity is the same as hers, and the court rules that Sam is not fit to take care of his daughter.  Sam seeks a lawyer, and, under pressure from her friends, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) agrees to help him with his case for free.  As Rita continues to help Sam, she learns a valuble lesson about love and family.As I said, this was a wonderful movie with a brilliant cast.  Sean Penn was incredible and Michelle was great, as was Dakota.  As always, Dianne Wiest played her small but important role wonderfully.  The only thing I would change is that I would clarify something about Annie's past that wasn't explained.  I strongly urge you to see this movie if you haven't already!!!",I Am Sam
201,heathiq,Uncertainly Sam,7,24 November 2018,"I have heard many people praise Sean Penn's performance as Sam without having critical opinions to support them. An adult with autism, raising a young girl through childhood is not easily convincing. While the acting itself seems raw and believable, I couldn't help feel swept away. For some that may have been its allure but for me the filmmakers exploited the realism of his acting and the warranted tears seemed slightly manipulative. Most people know how hard that would be without being shown exaggerated tears, even though Dakaota Fanning plays the mature daughter of Sam. The lack of editorial timing and using the audiences sensitivity towards the subject wasn't enough to be a masterpiece. That did not prevent me from wanting to see the characters relationship as father and daughter. Their efforts make this movie relevant and very watchable.",I Am Sam
202,cty98625,one of the best movies i have ever seen,10,2 August 2005,"the first time i watched this movie, i had to leave the room to go to the restroom to cry. It made me cry for many reasons rather than just one. The main reason i was bawling my eyes out was because Sean Penn played such a good part, and he did do very well. Another reason, why would anyone want to take a child away from a parent who loves them more than the entire world itself, just because of a mental handicap. I think it is truly sad anyone would want to do that to another human being. The movie was well worth watching and it also had a few of its funny moments as well. the one quote out of the movie that made me break down more than anything was when ""Sam"" said ""You don't know how it feels when you try and you try and you never get anywhere"" or at least that how i think the quote went. i am really very good at holding my emotions during a sad movie, in fact there were only three movie that i ever really broke down on and they were ""I AM SAM"", ""RADIO"", and ""THE PASSION OF THE Christ"".",I Am Sam

Those topics can't be ignored anymore. I highly recommend this movie!",I Am Sam
204,stephenbooth,"Well worth watching, far better than 'Rainman'",9,20 July 2002,"I haven't really like Sean Penn in the past and usually find films based around people with mental problems (eg 'Rainman' (which some elements of the film resemble) or 'Little Man Tate') annoying or even offensive.  ""I am Sam"" is a joy to watch and Sean Penn demonstrates that he's capable of turning in an excellent performance as a character other than a thug or racist (the roles I've mainly seen him in, in the past.Michelle Pfieffer is excellent, as usual, putting an end to her recent run of poor movies.Dakota Fanning is someone who will be well worth watching in the future. To turn in such a great performance at such a young age points to either an excellent career or early burnout (unfortunately this is in the hands of her parents).  She reminds me very much of a young Sarah Michelle Gellar or Drew Barrymore.",I Am Sam
205,rlopez-3,A movie that will make you laugh and cry at the same time,10,17 June 2002,"After seeing I am Sam all I can say is BRAVO! to everyone involved. This is one movie that I didn't mind spending the $10.50 on. The movie itself is just a marvelous pice of work with absolutely everything fitting in perfectly to bring you an absolute masterpiece.The actors were all worthy of mention. Sean Penn was absolutely amazing and I would be absolutely surprised if he didn't win an award for his remarkable performance. Dakota Fanning is an 8 year old sweetheart. She really played her role well and is also up for an award (wouldn't it be great to see a youngster get an award?). Michelle Pfeiffer also played her particular role as the lawyer really well. The co-cast including the likes of Laura Dern and Dianne Wiest also played magnificent roles. Whilst the movie's story may seem quite sad and depressing, let me assure you its not. The story is about a retarted father whose daughter absolutely adores him.The social service feel that Sam in incapable of taking care of Lucy now that she is older and becoming smarter than Sam himself. Yes I do agree that this seems quite depressing but give him a hot shot lawyer like Pfeiffer and great friends such as Dianne Wiest and his retarted friends (who might I add were also amazing) and trust me, you will have a movie that will stick with you for the rest of your life.Overall an amazing film. The actors were great the stroy a charm and the cinematography perfect. I recommend this film to absolutely everyone.
Overall a solid 9/10",I Am Sam
206,r.gates,"Authentic, compelling, can't get it out of my mind",10,25 March 2002,"The only reason Sean Penn did not get the Oscar statuette is because they don't make them big enough.  His ""Sam"" goes beyond acting - he is transcendant, he ""is"" Sam.  I have worked with the developmentally delayed population and Sean Penn transforms himself into that world.  If you haven't seen this movie yet and plan to, take a lot of tissues with you.  Even the 9 year-old boy I took with me cried.  This is a film of the heart and from the heart.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it. Everyone in this film deserves long rounds of applause and everyone involved in its creation gets my undying gratitude for letting us be part of Sam's life if even for a short while.  One of the best films I have ever seen or ever will see.  The developmentally delayed citizens of our country offer us gifts we can receive if we learn to open our hearts the way they do.  As Michelle Pfeiffer's character says in the film, ""I'm afraid I've gotten much more out of this relationship than you have"".",I Am Sam

Though I appreciate the frenetic and panicked quality to the various angles and colours, it is over used and left me reaching for the Pepto Bismol.  Which is a shame, too, because I'm certain I would've appreciated it a lot more had I not been trying to settle my stomach the whole time. However, I definitely recommend seeing it.  Just be sure to skip the popcorn.",I Am Sam
208,SalamancaChica,Excellent Film,9,14 August 2006,"This movie was very emotionally involving and rife with the talent of all actors included. Sean Penn did a remarkable job portraying Sam and a very young Dakota Fanning also gave an outstanding performance as his daughter Lucy. Michelle Pfeiffer was also wonderful as Sam's lawyer Rita. Diane Wiest also contributed to the wealth of talent. Her character added a lot to the story. The plot was very well thought out and certainly unique. I loved it. While there were certainly moments of sadness, the times of profound joy at other points in this movie certainly counteracted them, making it a fabulous film that I would highly recommend to other viewers. There is no film quite like this.",I Am Sam
209,donitava,One of my favorites this year,9,28 November 2001,"I had the privilege of viewing this film at the UCLA Sneak Preview extension class this week.   Sean Penn is fantastic in his role as Sam, a retarded adult parent, and Dakota Fanning as his 7 year old daughter is a performance not to miss.  The film is true to the subject matter (the writer and Penn spent 90 days in a facility for retarded adults, including time on a production line).  It is skillfully done, with all of the tragedies and comedies that life delivers.Don't miss it.",I Am Sam
210,mib456,"A very touching movie that is less about reality, & more about the power of love",9,3 February 2002,"I have seen and heard the comments for reviewers and others that say that this movie is not realistic and that Sam could not possibly raise Lucy on his own. Well that IS true, but this movie is not about right or wrong, real or artistic license.  It is about the love of a child and her father, for each other.  What they are willing to do, to be together and just love one another. I cried, and I cried again.  This movie works hard at tugging at the heart strings, and it succeeds.  It did drag at points, and it did make me want to make it stop.  But there are moments in this film, that go from touching to uplifting to down right flat out funny, all within the span of 2 minutes.  Truly amazing and inspiring.  If you do not get touched by this film, then you have a hard heart, and do not believe in the miracle of love. Sean Penn's performance was amazing, better than I expected, and Michelle Pfeiffer must have learned some good skills from her used to be husband David E. Kelly.  She was as cut throat as any lawyer I have ever seen on screen.  I also want to applaud the sweet cameos and small parts played by big name actors that helped to make this movie a winner.",I Am Sam
211,shesabear,Impressive Performances all around,9,28 July 2003,"I had avoided this movie for a couple of years for a few reasons.  First and foremost I am not a Sean Penn fan.  I thought that he was excellent in Dead Man Walking but beyond that I was totally unimpressed. Secondly, I was concerned that the subject of mentally challenged parents might be given a gloss over.  The subject is difficult with few easy answers.  I thought that there was no way that a movie would explore more than one side of the issue.I stand corrected!  Sean Penn's performance was the most true performace I have ever seen of a mentally challenged person(Including those given by the mentally challenged).  There were so many layers to his performance, nuances that just pulled you right in.The subject was explored in a way I didn't think possible in a movie that also entertained.  It was not just a romanticized look at the challenges of parenting.  This movie got it's hands dirty.  All the better for us.In conclusion, if you avoided this movie on purpose or just didn't get around to it it is worth the time.  Be warned it was a three hankie movie for me",I Am Sam
212,tohin_ttt,True definition of Love,10,11 August 2013,I've waited too long to watch this film and I realize that the predictability of stupidity can never be underestimated. As we all know Sean Penn is a great actor but this must be his BEST performance. His acting makes the movie very original and extremely emotional. The film puts out the value of Love to ones family and its strength very nicely. The movie gives a joy ride of humor and thrill and does with great excellence. This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and not feel bored. Apart from great acting from the great cast and crew the movie has a great storyline which will keep you attached to it the whole time. Its very artistic and genuine and to me personally it feels underrated.A great family movie and recommended to every one out there. You just cannot dislike this masterpiece.,I Am Sam
213,trendy (nz),One superb dramatic picture - hold the cheese,10,17 September 2002,"I loved this film, it absolutely spoke to me in a way that few films I've seen do.My biggest fear throughout was that at any moment the next scene would see Sam (sean Penn) and Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) deciding that the best solution to their problems would be if the both united in a marriage / pseudo-marriage, so they could lay happy families and all live happily ever after, blah balh blah ad nauseum. Thank God Nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi-soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece. Such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me. Obviously, Nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap-opera style conclusion.Penn's performance is highly commendable - more Rainman than Forest Gump. Indeed, it represents what must surely be a turning point in his career direction. Full credit also to young Dakota Fanning (Lucy) who carried off a superb portrayal of her character and simply stole the movie!I'll keep this short but suffice to say if you haven't seen this film you're missing something big. Not everyone will go to see this film but those who do will know that they have seen a truely magnificent piece of cinema.",I Am Sam

Despite a few plot flaws, and the liberal slant (so I'm conservative...part of that ""right-winged"" conspiracy), this movie is a great watch. I am on the verge of being a parent and the movie allows insight to the struggle we take for granted when it comes to parenthood. Seeing it thru the life of Sam made it all the more challenging. I loved this movie and watch it often (own it on DVD), referring it to others who ask me if I have watched a good movie lately. Granted, it is not for everyone, one does have to think about the issues and there is some deciphering of the story.

221,cj-mckay,Classic Sunday afternoon weepie - Great performance from Sean Penn.,8,10 September 2005,"This film is nowhere near as bad as other people have made it out to be. I saw it for the first time today and was particularly impressed with Penn's performance. His nouveaux-Method style does suit the portrayal of this intellectually challenged character.Sam's John Lennon fixation is gently emphasised by the excellent soundtrack of late Beatles songs performed by contemporary artists and this lends authenticity to the experience.A fairly straightforward tale of a man who has little more than the intellect of a seven-year-old child struggling to raise his little girl alone in a society which is naturally prejudiced against him. A solid performance from Michelle Pfieffer, too, as Sam's lawyer.There are some very touching scenes which make this more than just a formula weepie flick. If you are looking for guns, killings and excitement then this film is not for you. I think it is sweet.",I Am Sam

Actually, I'm not an emotional person at all, at least I didn't thought that I was, but this movie made me so sad, because I realised a couple of things from it. One of them and also a first one is that, it doesn't really matter how smart are you, or what you have in life, how reach you are....the only thing that really matters is how much love can you give to someone... That's the only think that matters. Thank you Sam for showing me that! Watch this movie, he will change you...change your views...and at the end, make you a better person.

226,F. Mt. Pleasant,And I Am Horrified,1,4 January 2002,"This movie is so insulting in its depiction of mentally handicapped people it makes ""The Other Sister"" look like a lovingly crafted documentary about Down's syndrome.  Aren't retarded people cute?  Aren't they earnest?  Why... they're almost like us real people!
Sean Penn plays a sweet autistic/retarded man who has somehow fathered a child (when and how and with whom? never really explained) and Michelle Pfeiffer plays the cliched overworked, no-time-for-her-family, badly-needs-to-learn-what's-important-in-life-from-a-retarded-person career woman lawyer who is shamed into defending Penn's character in court when he is threatened with having his daughter taken away from him.  It goes on forever, for no reason. Top it all off with one of those child actors who speaks as if she's forty-five years old playing the daughter, and you're all set to run at the screen with a machete.  Penn and Pfeiffer surely must have thought they were earning their places in Heaven when they signed on to overact in this condescending, absurd, overwrought trash.  Or maybe they did it to win prizes.  If there is a God, they will be denied anything shiny for their collective hubris.
I don't want to overstate how offensive this thing is, but seeing this movie is tantamount to saying, ""I hate retarded people"".",I Am Sam

My favorite character in the movie, Rita, played by Michelle Pfeiffer is also great. I love her temper and the ways she lies. Lucy, played by Dakota Fanning, is very nice to watch. She gives an amazing child performance.The music in the movie is all from the Beatles, which I though was pretty cool. I loved every song in the film, but my favorite was Strawberry Fields Forever. It really fit into the movie.The scene is when Rita pushes over Sam's origami wall and cries out to him. I loved that scene.

Sean Penn does an extraordinary job portraying a mentally disabled man, and his role is 100% believable. Other great actors are in this movie as well, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning (whose roles I usually do not like. However, no one could have played Lucy better). This movie is designed for all audiences (as long as you can deal with a lot of f-bombs), and it will definitely take you on an emotional roller-coaster.Great story, great acting.In fact, I like the movie as much as Rain Man.

As always she delivers an outstanding performance and reminds us of just how excellent and beautiful an actress she is.Sean Penn is so believable that you forget that he doesn't actually have anything wrong with him...he captures every emotion perfectly and instills all of that emotion in the audience. Penn is highly under rated in the world that is movies, as he shows with this Oscar potential performance.The young actress who plays his daughter is amazingly mature in her acting, whilst always managing to capture the innocence of her youthfullness. On top of all that she is gorgeous.

232,rougepissmire@juno.com,Dry Heave Inducing,1,8 August 2002,"This happens to be the first movie I walked out on in almost ten years. Anyone that could have been possibly touched or even gave it an ounce of credit must have been retarded themsleves. The least it could have done was give an objective, double sided view of the mentally challenged parent issue. BUT NOOOOOOOO! The whole movie consists of a Sam loudly moaning and feeling sorry for himself, and his wide eyed daughter giggling beside him. This reminds me of a homeless man I see in New York who puts a miniature poodle literally on a pedestal as he shakes his beggar bowl, hoping the rich civilians will give him change out of sheer pity and manipulated sympathy. The producers of this film have used the same approach on a much larger scale. If that weren't enough, the film trys to make you feel sorry for everybody else, and the film almost becomes a kindergarten class, where the young pupils whine and cry, whine and cry, until they get what they want. Sean Penn gives by far the worst performance of his career. Not  only is he not a convincing retarded man, his performance is like a bad archetype for an over the top ""retard"" impression that I would expect out of an actor from MAD TV. And I think most will agree that while they are excrutiatingly unfunny and annoying, they are just as unsettling and unwatchable.",I Am Sam
233,kinseyp,Very good performances but some script weaknesses,10,11 January 2002,"Having read a number of critics reviews I was prepared for the worst but was pleasantly surprised by the films accurate portrayal of the mentally challenged. Sean Penn's performance is very accurate and shows a fine understanding of this group of people. I have worked for a number of years running a drop-in center and I have had many interactions with people just like Sam.  I have two criticisms of the movie - firstly, the premise is somewhat flawed. It is extremely unlikely that someone with Sam's mental capacity would have been able to raise a child to the age of 6 without a strong support team that was nowhere evident in the movie. Without giving away the movies ending I have to say I was disappointed that the movie lacked the courage to face the most likely real-world outcome. Still, fine performances by Penn and Pfeiffer make this a very worthwhile experience. I think the movie raises important questions in a thoughtful way.",I Am Sam

Sam was totally qualified to get his daughter because no one could give the love to her that her own father could. I gave this movie a 7 and I liked it a lot!",I Am Sam
235,jgsmeall,Could be better,3,30 June 2002,"Initially, that is to say in the first half-hour or so of this film, the issues and themes that ""I Am Sam"" deals with, coupled with the ""Bambi""-esque cuteness of Lucy and Sam, conspired to nearly reduce me to tears. But as the film wore on, the audience was burdened with trite, spill-your-guts cliched scenes in which little Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is spirited away from her heartbroken father by the big mean scary social workers, and conspired against by the perversities of the modern justice system. We are asked to believe the idealistic, but entirely unfounded notion that sincere intentions and the heart of a saint will suffice for the upbringing of a precocious child, never mind the father's narrow scope of mental capabilites. Notwithstanding, the soundtrack shines with copious alternative pop renditions of Beatles favorites, but the cinematography, with its merciless and unyielding cuts and jerks, is enough in itself to significantly cripple the coherent inner ear, not to mention the movie's rating.In short, ""I Am Sam"" may jerk tears more than once in 130 minutes, but it ultimately tries too hard to secure an emotional reaction. 3/10",I Am Sam
236,Knappegger,"Sensitive, Touching, Insightful.",9,22 March 2002,"While the first half of the movie is largely concerned with showing us (almost tediously) how happy father (Sam) and daughter (Lucy) are together, the second half brings the expected low to the preceding high. Lucy is taken away from her dad, on account of his being mentally challenged - the mental capacity of a seven year old - the exact age of Lucy. He fights for her, but to no avail - we are shown large portions of courthouse scenes, yet Lucy's and Sam's relationship wains in this part of the movie. Only towards the end do the two get to have those touching scenes together again that really make this movie shine.Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning do a great job, as does Michelle Pfeiffer -it is the three of them that carry the movie along. The Direction is great, yet some scenes do seem a tad too long or repetitive - like the movie is trying to make a point thats been made - over and over again... But don't let that bore you, there's enough character acting and atmosphere to drive the most important point home: this is one solid piece of cinema drama.If you're prepared to forget for two hours that Sam probably wouldn't be able to cope with Lucy (especially facing her intelligence juxtaposed to his), then go watch this and be amazed.

239,myrto1,"A sweet and ""innocent"" movie but nothing exceptional",7,13 July 2002,"This is a drama about the struggle of a mentally disabled man to maintain the right to raise his daughter.Director Jessie Nelson tells a deeply moving story of paternity and unselfish love of a non-traditional,unusual family.No matter how sincere the director's purposes are, the script is rather poor and conventional where it should be dynamic and ""fresh"".It also gets too melodramatic in times.However,the principal characters of the film:Sam,the mentally disabled father (Sean Penn),his daughter and his cold,strictly professional lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) are highly interesting and created in detail.The performances are just excellent.Sean Penn reminds us of Hoffman in ""Rainman"" but his performance is equally strong.His relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer's character also draws parallels to Hoffman and Cruise's relationship in the same movie.On the other side,drawbacks of the film include -apart from the script- the ending which is too naive and unrealistic.Not to mention that in many parts of the film ,the camera is shaking in an attempt to give a documentary style,but it rather gets annoying.To conclude,the bond between father and daughter is sincerely moving as well as the development of Pfeiffer's character throughout the film.Sam's obsession with the Beatles,songs of which form the film's score is another clever element of the film.This is undoubtedly a sweet and ""innocent"" movie just like its main character although you will not remember it for long.I reward it a 7 out of 10.",I Am Sam

Sean Penn is completely natural and believable as a developmentally disabled man. Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled, having been found at L.A. Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her co-writer, Kristine Johnson, spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research, as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7.

245,helen-rees,17 tissue movie (highest ever!) but worth every snivel,10,27 February 2005,"Most movies spend, oh, minutes, introducing you to the characters before they start hugging at your heart-strings. I'd dumped my first Kleenex before the credits were over, and after that, I don't think I spent 5 minutes with my face dry.And yet - this is not a predictable film. Question - you have Michelle Pfeiffer in your movie, and you want it to be a success. Do you wait 45 minutes before showing her (45 minutes filled with geeks that wouldn't even make in into the X-files), and then make her a solid-platinum, probably bulimic, bitch? Because that's kind of like having Julia Roberts in your movie, and then not letting her smile.Or getting Audrey Hepburn (these days it would have to be Cameron Diaz) to play Lyra's Mum in 'His Dark Materials'...Answer - only if the art matters more to you than the box office, or the actor's future career.Watch this, and then spend about 4 hours hugging your nearest and dearest - or nearest and estranged, because that works too.Incidentally, by the end of the film, it's become Pavlovian.

When she is taken away from him, he seeks legal representation from a successful lawyer played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who also has personal problems in raising her own son. Both performances are touching and out of the ordinary. But don't expect the movie to be carried only by these two exceptional actors, the whole cast is a delightful surprise. The performance of the young actress Dakota Fanning who plays Sam's little daughter is equally outstanding.

257,taylorcommunications,An ambitious premise that failed to follow through.,3,12 January 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** `I Am Sam' is about growth and acceptance, and how people aren't always what they seem to be at first glance. But it loses track trying to please everyone and what it sets out to do becomes compromised in the delivery of a happy ending.Penn plays the title character, Sam, who suffers from autism. Sam survives, as is shown in the opening credits, by living through routine and order. He has an order to everything and is able to function in `normal' society only by keeping all elements of his day constant. That's why, when Sam impregnates a homeless woman and is left with the kid; his life is affected drastically.Initially, Sam has absolutely no clue how to be a father. He relies on his reclusive neighbor Annie to look over Lucy, his daughter, while he works. His job is at a local Starbucks delivering drinks to tables. He aspires to be behind the counter someday. When he comes home from work Sam faces a new and strange responsibility of taking care of a child. He does so the way he does so many other things: by setting up constants to rely on. Sam eventually develops a routine that includes Lucy, and slowly becomes able to function as he was before the birth.Lucy grows rapidly and her intelligence quickly surpasses that of Sam's. She helps Sam out with reading stories, and grows tired of playing games well before he does. In school she has to deal with taunts about her father and wonders why her dad isn't like the others. Sam, of course, can't explain. Regardless of their awkward relationship, they develop a strong bond. This bond, however, is broken when the Children's and Families' Center takes Lucy away because they think Sam isn't capable of taking care of a child.
Sam's routine is again dramatically changed. He turns to a high profile lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), to help him out with his custody case. She is a vain and self-centered workaholic who cares more about her self-image than anything else. And when she's presented with Sam's case, she immediately turns it down because of his lack of funds. She changes her mind, however, and signs him on as a pro bono case when her colleagues call her greedy and selfish.`I Am Sam' sets out to make people aware of an issue that normally would go unnoticed. And it doesn't quite make its point. This movie, through a series of courtroom scenes, has to come up with a definite decision as to who gets custody of Lucy: Sam or a foster family. Yet, in an effort to make everything come together in a Hollywood sort-of-way, a definite decision is never made. I guess audiences wouldn't like it if Sam never got Lucy back, and any point of making people aware of autism would be lost. But this film doesn't work the way it is.After the first trial the movie seems set to end. But then, in an effort to give Sam a second chance at custody, the movie heads for another trial. What's wrong with that is the film's need to make everything turn out right in the mind of the audience. This film would be fair if the first trial resulted in Sam gaining custody of Lucy, but it chooses to stretch itself out and make a contrived ending difficult to arrive at.
Deciding, Who will get Lucy? isn't what this film is about. It's about how people like Sam are easily looked over in the world and how people suffering from mental illnesses still can be contributing members to society. And once this film strays from that point to a conventional and, ultimately, unsatisfying plotline, any message of awareness is lost.",I Am Sam

265,Dakotaen,Fit to make a grown man cry,9,9 June 2008,"I remember when I was about ten years old and watched Rainman for the first time. For weeks afterwards, I was convinced that Dustin Hoffman was mentally retarded, and I was amazed when I found out that he was just acting.Now, as well as Sean Penn plays his role in this movie, and he does it very well I might add, he doesn't quite give me the same feeling as Hoffman did, way back when. But considering the entire movie, I really don't care. I'm left with a great feeling, the kind that you only have after having spent a certain amount of time being sad or angry. This movie made me feel both those feelings, sadness and anger.I Am Sam is a movie I won't soon forget. The acting is great, the story, as much as we've all seen similar ones done before, draws you in just as it should, and it almost made me shed a tear or two, which is a very rare thing for me.Watch it, that's all I can say. If you need action, thigh clapping laughter, or major surprises in a movie, you may find this a bit dull to begin with, but I'm sure that over the course of the movie, you'll find your emotions well entertained, and forced to react to what you see.",I Am Sam

I haven't seen him in much, and think of him as a 'tough guy', Madonna's ex, etc.  He did such an incredible job as Sam, I still can't believe it.  He is so believable as Sam, he is an amazing actor. Dakota Fanning was so good as Lucy, what a great actress she is @ such a young age.  It was a great surprise to see Diann Wiest, she is such a great actress, I love to see her in anything.  The scene where she tells Sam when to feed Lucy by following the schedule of shows on Nickelodian had me laughing so hard. I thought this movie was funny and touching, and it made me cry.

The story is so heart-warming, and when I watched it I felt every emotion possible.  Sean Penn, I cant even describe in words how awesome he was. Michelle...the character we hated to the character we loved. Dakota omg! you're so cute... Comparing this movie to The Rainman is completely unrealistic. Sean and Dustin both had difficult roles to play in different stories. The story is different. They both were amazing in the movies that they did, theres NO comparing of who was better. After watching this movie I realized that I would never trade my parents for anyone else. I love them just the way they are.  I think they are both amazing people. 10/10!!

I do believe every situation should be examined as need be.  But I don't believe families should be ripped apart because of bias.  My daughter is a typical little girl who goes to an extrodinary school that is based on everyone deserves a equal education.  She has the wonderful oportunity to have best friends with special needs I think she has alot to learn from these children who have a big heart and much to teach us all. Thank you.",I Am Sam
272,TrentBurns,Great performances save very flawed movie,7,26 May 2005,"I am Sam isn't a wonderfully written movie, it's story is simple and flawed. It is about Sam(Sean Penn) who has the mental ability of a 7 year old, who is trying to raise his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning). Sam is a loving and caring parent, he wants nothing better then to see Lucy, who is holding back in school so she won't appear smarter then her father, to do her best and become the smartest in her class. Sam has a misunderstanding with the law that alerts Child Protective Services to his situation. A social worker pays a visit to Sam and Lucy's house while he is waiting for her to come home to her surprise birthday party. Their is a misunderstanding that reveals that Lucy told her friend she was adopted, so she runs away upset. the social worker removes Lucy from Sam's custody. Sam retains the services of a high priced layer (Michelle Pfeiffer), who takes the case pro bono because everyone thinks she is to money hungry to ever take a pro bono case. Thus Sam fights the system to try and get his daughter back.The main problem with the story is that the ""bad guys"" in the movie are right, Sam should not have custody of his daughter, she is quickly becoming to much for him, and she is quickly becoming the head of the household. Although as much a Sam and Lucy love each other, Sam should be in her life as much as possible.What saves this movie is Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer is good to, but it is Sean Penn's movie, although he let Dakota Fanning take the movie away from him. Penn is great as the retarded Sam, and plays it very convincingly. He is a man child, with the light and pure love that only a child has. The real star of the movie though is Fanning, who plays Lucy to pure emotional perfection, she is irritated at having a father who acts more like her friends do, then a father. She is embarrassed by him, although what kid has never been embarrassed by a parent, when he act to much like a kid in front of her friends, she is a caring guardian when she masterminds her ""kidnapping"" for child services. She is purely upset when she thinks he has forgotten about her, and is purely in love with her father when she is trying to convince child services to let her go back to her dad.This movie is worth seeing for Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning, and if you cry easily bring a box of tissues, Dakota will make you cry.",I Am Sam
273,minii31,I love this movie.,10,27 December 2012,"This movie made me cry so many times I lost count. It is beautiful and so very sad. I cannot explain much more. I like to keep my reviews short and not give away much of the movie, but must forcefully write ten lines apparently. It was very emotional for me and the two lead roles could not have been more perfect. There was a moment which comes halfway through eh movie which I will not speak of, but you will see. Though the end had no twist or unpredictable ending, it is surely one which anyone with a heart will find tearjerker. In my humble opinion, it is very much worth the watch and a truly enjoyable movie when watched with an open mind.",I Am Sam

Michelle Piffer is so good at acting the part Rita. Dakota Fanning is so cute!!!!. THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD!!!!. I think the director chose really good people for the cast of this movie. The movie can make people cry it made me cry so badly. Sean Penn is a really good actor and it is really good to have him as the main part of this movie. My rating of this movie would be a 100 it is so good. I love this movie and i felt like my heart was going to break when the took Lucy away from her father and how the mother ran away and he had to raise the kid alone. That was probably really hard.

I obviously loved this movie as I watched it again yesterday.I think i've watched it 4-5 times in bits and pieces,however I watched it all yesterday. It is a beautiful movie,very sentimental,makes one come in touch with his/her feelings and question the stupidity and the morale of both the 'common'people and the system. As for its flaws,yes there are some but that is beautiful,the movie is 15 years old and some of the...questions raised by the users' are irrelevant.Realism is not such an X factor here,personally I didn't care whether Sam was autistic or mentally handicapped.What I cared for was his unconditional love for everyone,his passion and his drive for life.What a fine example for everyone,great life lessons from a beautiful movie.Just watch it with open hearts and souls.",I Am Sam

Even the social workers who insisted on doing everything to ""help the child"" appear to be fighting emotions over this unusual case. The ""support system"", which includes several equally challenged ""buddies"", a very supportive employer, and many other people in the community gives evidence of our changing society, fostering inclusion and tolerance.

In fact, I would have given her the Oscar nomination over Jennifer Connally (Beautiful Mind) who will probably end up winning it. I also loved the soundtrack. It is rare to find other artists who can do justice to a Beatle song but these selections were perfect for the film. The little girl was also very good (Dakota Fanning). I think we will see lots of her over the coming years. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed with Sean Penn's performance. There were too many inconsistencies in his behaviors and capabilities to function in day to day activities. One minute he is an insightful, wise man and the next he's acting like Rainman. Overall, the movie is worth watching but I question the reviews that say this is the best Sean Penn has ever done.",I Am Sam

284,daustin97222,Tough guys are softies too,10,30 May 2006,"In my years, there has not been a time where I felt compelled to watch a movie TWICE right away. Until this one. It isn't easy for a grizzled leathers and chains biker and rock 'n' roll guitarist to melt into a puddle of superlatives over a movie. This movie is in the same league (imho) as my previously set in stone top ten:1. The Man who shot Liberty Valance 2. Out of Africa 3. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly 4. Pirates of the Caribbean 5. The Empire strikes back 6. It's a Wonderful Life 7. Terminator 8. Raiders of Lost Ark 9. Pathfinder 10. The Boat (Das Boot) 11. The Bridge over the River Kwai 12. AlienThere are twelve, so you can see that my personal top-ten is a bit crowded. Now, one of them has to go to make room.In #10, the grit and the oil keep it permanently in place as a top-ten movie of all time. Tuco rules, so #2 is permanent. No one will ever top Geoffrey Rush's Cap'n Barbossa, so that's permanent. Han re-defined the role of ""leading"" man, and his tongue-in-cheek perfection spilled over into #8. Ridley Scott is one of the finest director/producers ever, so that's out. Alec Guinness is one of the Big Five and fascinating as well, so that's out (both times). Pathfinder: watch it and you will agree. And what ""top ten"" does not include J-J-J-Jimmy Stewart's roust with Clarence?So I'm left with Clint, John, and Ms. Streep. All will stay forever.I'm clearly pathetic and hopelessly self-absorbed, so my ""top ten"" now becomes 13, with a new addition: I Am Sam.I Am Sam is a movie that challenges you. My step-daughter has two autistic children, both of them beautiful in their own way. Sean Penn has made this so real and strikingly so.

Just saw the awards consideration DVD, and I don't think I would even nominate Penn, to be honest.  This movie was best told in its preview...the script seemed shoddy at absolute best, and the directing foibles did little to cover that fact up.  Long story short, Sam had no drive, no real moments...it was a film about a custody battle, and I never really wanted our protaganist to WIN!!!!!!!!  That's unacceptable.  I'll grant the fact that a retarded man and a hooker had the most brilliant child of all time...I'll accept that Laura Derns character seemed to be added in as a favor!  I'll even buy the sheer lack of ending...if all else fails, make him a referee.  Guys, don't see this movie!

The dialogs between Sam and his lawyer are full of fine humor, that keep you smiling. The only weak part of the film is the end. There is no direct connection by the kind of happiness Jessy Nelson have chosen for the last scene. A more subtle end would be more credible.

This movie' s vest parts start from here. Sam and his daughter Lucy spend enjoy life with his friend' s and a grandma help. His friend' s are very kind and interesting. Lucy' s smile show how it is great. But .. this is not continued. Someday, they are separated because of his illness. They spend many days without each other.

293,avagoldsmith-62626,Sad but powerful,8,27 January 2021,"The movie I am Sam directed by Jessie Nelson follows the journey of a mentally disabled man named Sam Dawson in a fight for custody of his daughter. He was abandoned with his newborn daughter Lucy after impregnating a homeless woman who ditched them as soon as the couple left the hospital. This drama piece made in 2001 stars actors such as Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffler, and Dakota Fanning. Sam raises Lucy all alone with the help from his kind old neighbor and his friends, all of which happen to have their own disability as well, showing unique traits and characteristics. As Lucy continues to grow, she begins to pass Sam's intellectual level and other adults in her life begin to question Sam as a father. Sam then must prove his ability to be a father with the assistance of a workaholic lawyer who helps in pleading his case for custody of Lucy. In my opinion, the movie does a good job of empowering the main character Sam because he doesn't have to eliminate his disability in order to help him win his daughter back. Instead, his unique perspective on life helps others grow by teaching the lesson that love conquers all. In the end of the movie, Sam doesn't overcome his disability, he learns to accept himself as he is and use his love for Lucy to help him be the best father he can be. It isn't Sam's disability that holds him back, it is instead the negative ideas that much of society has of disabled people.",I Am Sam

295,greggdeselms,I was truly unprepared for the impact of this motion picture.,10,28 January 2002,"This film is more of an experience than a spectacle.  The direction was magnificent.  The slightly eclectic camera work was evocative and played its own, important role in the storytelling.  The handheld camera technique that so irritated us when we first saw it on television in such tele-dramas as the old Hill Street Blues or the more recent NYPD Blue was essential in this film.  A great deal of thought obviously went into the music selection and performances (this is a soundtrack I wish to own).  The only real script weakness, in my opinion, was the lack of early character and motivational development of the attorney, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer).  But perhaps by the time we reach her moving monologue in Sam's (Sean Penn) apartment we felt all caught-up.  The performance of the child actress who played Lucy (Dakota Fanning) was stunning.  And I was happy to see how well the camera caught the familiar kindness in Laura Dern's (who played Randy Carpenter) eyes. But most surprising of all was the performance of Sean Penn.  In my life I never would have imagined that he was capable of such a performance, and were I casting the film he might not have even been on my list.  I was astonished, moved, and happy to have demonstrated to me what a lousy casting director I would have made.  If this were the only film that its creators ever made, I would think it would be enough.",I Am Sam

Of course there were a few good scenes (esp. those that parodied the Beatles), but after the begin of the trial the film was boring, predictable and - as I mentioned - political extremely correct!Another point to mention is the penetrant ad for Starbucks - the first thing you can see in the film is a giant neon sign of Starbucks. And it seems, that one of the most important message, that is transported in the movie is, that Starbucks is such a human company giving handicapped persons a real chance. Well, I understand that product-placement is important to finance a movie, but it shouldn't be so obvious and penetrant.Finally, I want to apologize for my bad English - I'm Austrian and English isn't my mother tongue.",I Am Sam

The more commercials i saw for it,  the more i wanted to watch it.  Well i finally broke down and saw it and i can honestly say that it is ten times better than my expectations led me to believe. It's kind of embarrasing to say,  but bring tissues.  You'll need them.  I haven't cried in years but this movie broke that streak.  Sean Penn's performance is amazing, and the girl that plays his daughter couldn't have been any better herself.  The soundtrack for this movie is the best i've ever heard,  but then again your reading this from a Beatles buff.  Every song in the film is a Beatles song performed by other artists, but i don't think any other song could replace them.All in all, if you can't decide which film to see when going to the movies, you can't fail with this one.

Penn's performance is utterly seamless and natural.Be prepared to love and hate, sympathize and loath, cry and laugh all in the space of a little over two too short hours. You'll hate Michelle Pfeiffer until you learn to love her, Laura Dern gives an Oscar winning performance in one short scene alone, and the country is going to fall in love with Dakota Fanning. The entire cast is wonderful, I only wish there was space to mention them all.Sam likes giving hugs.

You want to help them all along the way.  The end will make you cry with happiness.  This movie is great, sincere, sensitive, sad and very believable.

Sean Penn went beyond caricature, and drifted into actual offensiveness.And no, I don't dislike the ""feel-good"" movie genre.  But if I did, it wouldn't be relevant, because this isn't one.  The good guys didn't win here - they lost!  There is _no way_ Sam should have been allowed to raise a child.  Visit yes, raise no - it would have been endangerment from the beginning.Just to make things worse, the movie has 60 minutes of plot spread out over 2 and a half hours.

Sean Penn had really made this movie to what it is. Without him and a hit cast they really could not have pulled this off. I loved this movie. It touched my heart in more ways than one. The way the father to daughter ""chemistry"" went from Sean Penn to Dakota Fanning was remarkable. Michelle's performance was also excellent how she represented every hard working mother.After watching the movie, I was surprised to see that she was not also nominated for an Oscar.From the movie you learn, it doesn't matter if you are parent who is ""perfect"" or a parent who is ""disabled"". We really all go through the same motion when raising our children.",I Am Sam
307,heidaay,Simply stated - SEE THE FILM!,10,17 January 2002,"This poignant film is a journey of Love and Understanding (with the foibles of everyday life), which emphasizes that parenting is not something that a department (Department of Children and Family Services) can mandate.
It also illustrates the danger of allowing the Department of Children and Family Services, supremacy over the rights of the parents. I saw this film and was overwhelmed with the strength of emotion that flooded me.",I Am Sam

This movie shows the deeper side of humanity, with all out faults, all our pain, all our love, and all our life... it shows that truly in the words of the beatles, All you need is love.  The undertone of the beatles music through out the movie puts you in a spell of rose colored glasses.This truly is a must see movie!",I Am Sam

If there was an academy award for best child actor then Ms. Fanning would certainly get my vote.  As always Ms. Pfeiffer has proven to me why she at least in my opinion is one of the best actresses in filmmaking today. And a special set of kudos to Mr. Penn because it was his portrayal of a loving father who lived life according to the words of the beatles, that made me both sad and happy.  This is definetly and movie that will be in my library.",I Am Sam
311,waterspritemd,Wonderful movie with wonderful acting,10,19 February 2002,"As a teacher of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, I am often frustrated and angry at the portrayal of people with disabilities.  They are either the comic relief or they are treated as though there is something fundamentally wrong with them.  I Am Sam was the first movie that focused on what a person with a severe disability could do rather than couldn't.  I thought the acting, especially by Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning was superb. The writing was amazing, and really captured the essense of people dealing with Autistic tendencies.  I was especially moved by the scene toward the end between Laura Dern and Sean Penn.  I left the theater feeling emotionally exhausted, but pleased.  If there was one thing lacking in the film, it was the lack of explanation of Diane Wiest's character's situation. I wish they had gone into a bit more detail of her issues.  Overall a fabulous film, incredible acting, fantastic writing, and a credit to people with disabilities everywhere.  I'm crossing my fingers for an Academy Award for Sean Penn.",I Am Sam

The movie got me hooked the instant it started - and didn't let me go untill the moment the subtitles appeared!.It was really moving and did made me get the 'I got something in my eye stuff' several times..I truly recommand this movie to everyone who likes to see movies that are not only about action and violence - but more about real people with real problems.Also my compliments to Jessie Nelson for the shots and camera work that added that little extra to the movie (the little zoom in shots etc).Go and rent it !,I Am Sam
313,Riddler402-,"Compelling movie, some flaws, but worth watching",10,9 April 2002,"I thought this movie was really well done.  The little girl's performance was so well done it was almost scary.  Sean Penn's ""Sam"" too, was well acted. He gave the character depth and emotion that could have been lost had he just tried to play a character with a ""handicap"".It was refreshing to see a different take on the situation of having a family with a person who has a disability.  Too often enough it is the parent trying to deal with the child's issues; this movie flipped that around.Despite it's flaws, and at times believability, this was an excellent movie. It definitely triggered many emotional responses, but all in a good way and it didn't feel forced.  If you're on the fence about going to see it, or need something to watch on a Friday night, I'd recommend it.",I Am Sam
314,overlord001,Fantastic,8,27 May 2008,"This film is so much more than a ""David versus Goliath"" story. In my opinion it represents entirely what a film such as this should represent.Yes it is a David versus Goliath story that has people gasping in awe from the side-stand, but to me this film opened up to become a fantastical display of directing, acting and script that drew me in and had me rooting for Sam (played to perfection by Penn) from the very start until it came to the, albeit rather expected, dramatic ending.Some people may think that from the sound of the description the film will be just like rain man and well you are, my dear friends, epically wrong. Although Penn somehow managed to have a certain Hoffman-esquire quality about him in this film, it's only similarity is the fact that the protagonist has a learning disability. That is all.The remarkable acting by all the cast in this spectacular film just shows how it should be done, it isn't wooden, it is robust, Penn, Fanning and Pfieffer showed great on screen chemistry that gave me the feeling of actual life, Pfieffer's character showing empathy, Fanning as the loving daughter and Penn as the adoring father that attempts the impossible to make his daughter, and himself, happy.The camera work was (and again my opinion) totally key to the feel of this film, the constant shifting and changing as though you were yourself in the mind of Sam; confused and at some points distracted. Flitting from side view to front view, from Sam to whomsoever Sam was talking to. Just showing the thought process that Sam would have been going through; his frustration at trying to find the words, or the confusion of people bombarding him with words he cannot understand, is conveyed quite miraculously through this alone.I highly recommend this film to anybody and everybody that has, at some point in their lives, been confused or frustrated. Just to give them a little perspective as to how hard it can be. Or if you haven't or aren't either of the above . . .I recommend it anyway.",I Am Sam

A new low for Penn and Pfeiffer. I threw away the DVD after watching about 1/2 of it. The camera work was kinda MTVish, and seeing Penn whine gets old after about the 2nd or 3rd time he does it. Believing that he can take care of himself much less a baby is impossible. Please save your money and time.",I Am Sam

317,smiller8,Overrated,6,6 February 2004,"Very unrealistic movie that is obvious and contrived. Sean Penn carries the entire film in an excellent performance. Michelle Pheiffer is still beautiful, but not very convincing in her role as Penn's pro-bono attorney. Penn's little girl is also unrealistic as she has more wisdom and common sense than all the adults around her including judges, attorneys, psychologists, and foster parents.

I think it was the vision of seeing how we really underestimate how much love can take care of a lot of things.

322,dadatsil,tearjerker,10,12 March 2008,I love movies that move me to tears and I can't remember watching a movie that moved me like this one. I loved it! The movie explores how the depth of love between a parent and child goes far beyond the intellect - and what society deems as the most important qualities of a good parent don't always jive with what the child knows in his/her heart. I thought Sean Penn did a great job - I felt like Sam at times could see things from both perspectives - that of a loving parent - and that of a little child. And certain of his lines showed that his childlike understanding allowed him to see into the heart of his little girl like no other adult could.,I Am Sam
323,starrpntr,Unexpected brilliance all around,9,12 March 2008,"I must have been under a rock when this movie was released because I had not heard of it nor knew that Sean Penn had been nominated for an Academy Award for it. Shame on me! I just finished watching it and I am exhausted from the emotion it caused me to display! I can only say that I am glad I watched it alone as I was moved to tears numerous times and found myself sobbing and rooting for the mentally-challenged character played by Sean Penn. I don't think of Sean Penn when I think of box office blockbusters, but from this point forward, I will.Additionally, Dakota Fanning is a treasure in this film. She was very young at the time but displays such warmth and understanding of her character that it is hard to believe that she is only 7 years old. She acts from the heart and it is hard not to follow her lead and respond from the heart in kind.Michelle Pfieffer is her usual glamorous self, and while she gives a good performance, it seems a more normal acting performance rather than a stand-out one. I reserve the stand-out status for Sean and Dakota.Over the years I have enjoyed a lot of movies but I have a special place reserved for my very favorites. To tell you my taste, I will say that my all time favorite (based on emotional response) is The Color Purple. Number two is ET. This evening I discovered a close runner up for number three: I Am Sam.And now I need to go lie down and recover from the emotional experience...If you haven't seen this movie, rent it and keep a box of Kleenex at the ready.",I Am Sam
324,suck_it_up_sweetheart,Wonderful and funny in so many ways,10,26 March 2008,"I loved this film. The portrayals of the characters involved in the story were played outstandingly. Sean Penn was perfect for Sam Dawson. Dakota Fanning was wonderful as Lucy and kudos to Michelle Pheiffer. This movie, although it has a happy ending, still made me want to bawl and sob... even after I finished watching it. If you're looking for a fun getaway weekend type movie, do NOT rent this movie. It will make you cry (or at least want to cry). There was a lot I liked about this film and I think Michielle Phieffer did deserve an Oscar nomination as best supporting actress (or just best actress). The acting was strong and so were the actors and actresses. I thought the script was well written and everything else was played out in a realistic sequence. It can depict real life emotions and pains of the world in a different more unique way through the eyes of a man with M.R. But it also manages to prove a point- love has no limitations or requirements of perfection.",I Am Sam

I'm exhausted, but felt so compelled by this movie to join this website and share my review of this movie.This movie is exceptional. It reminds you that simplistic, unconditional love is core to any relationship...especially parent-to-child. Even if your child advances further than you intellectually...it doesn't mean you are incapable of being a good parent. Love is a necessary component and at the core. Without it and without expressing it...a relationship cannot endure. Money can't buy it and one's sincerest gestures can't win it. I believe this film was overlooked. Sean Penn is brilliant! Dakota Fanning played the role of ""Lucy"" SO well. It was just a superb movie with lots of heart. This is a Tissue-Box movie.",I Am Sam

I would recommend this film a dusky autumn night, when you need to relax from the everyday stress.This film is over 2 hours and I think it could have been a bit shorter, it doesn't really keep your attention the whole time.

328,sammcgrane,How I am Sam touched my mind and Soul,10,28 February 2009,Sean Penn recently won the Oscar for playing Harvey Milk and as inspiring he portrayed a struggling Gay Politician his role as Sam was more deserving of any Oscar in the History of the Acedamy. His acting ability makes me wonder were the line between fictional and reality Ly. My words and how the movie made me feel probably wont change the world or how it portrays the mentally challenged but how it has opened my heart and eyes in seeing beyond the challenges they face and see the real person behind there difficulty. Changing the world does only have to start with one person. Sam x,I Am Sam
329,merlekins,i have some questions,6,3 January 2003,"As another reviewer mentioned, why did the homeless chick (mother of Lucy) have sex with Sam in the first place? [part of me wonders if the kid was really his? was the chick already pregnant when she met Sam? was she disabled too?] And if they did have sex, wouldn't that encounter have a major impact on Sam? I'm assuming he probably did not have a ton of experience with women, especially sexually. Did the chick live with him for nine months?and yeah, Laura Dern's character just all of a sudden gave up the fight...but then Sam admits that he can't raise Lucy alone...duh? isn't that the question they are all trying to answer? what about the ""guardianship"" situation that Rita mentions? And if Sam expects the foster parents to stay involved, well what happens when they get their next foster kid and want to adopt that one? how would they have time to raise the new kid AND coddle Sam through raising Lucy?The DVD production notes talk a lot about LA Goal, a social service in LA that helps disabled adults. The film-makers spoke to real disabled fathers to make the film realistic. Then hey, why not showcase LA Goal in the movie and have Sam turn to them for help? I sort of thought that's where his friends came from, but they never mentioned it.Also, if that recluse Annie lady never left her room, how did she eat? or afford her place? I'm surprised Lucy turned out so outgoing with such a strange upbringing. Sam surely had a larger support system than that.Any way, I avoided this film for a long time. When I saw a teaser piece about it on Bravo, I seriously thought Penn and Pfeifer were just goofing off and making fun of disabled people. Ouch! or doing some little improv thing. But no, it was a feature. Now that I've seen the film, I appreciated it's heart but am extremely frustrated by the reality behind the story. Zwick is often guilty of this. ""La la, here's a lovely story based on fantasy which will look like reality"". Hello 30something! Maybe it would have been better as a short film, not giving the viewer any time to question these things. OR maybe a documentary about LA Goal would have been even more uplifting!And were Penn and the movie-trivia guy TOTALLY channeling our old pal Raymond? is there any fresh characterization going on in Hollywood?  ""Hi, I'm Sean Penn. For this movie, I'm going to put on my Dustin Hoffman Autistic mask. Look at me!""Otherwise, it was pretty cool to see Brent Spiner selling shoes.",I Am Sam

I have heard about it, good things, but just never made it to the rental counter with it. Finally, my wife checked it out of the public library on DVD.What can I say? Most movies I see, I forget them totally, as far as any impact on me, as soon as I leave the theater. This one, days later, (and I keep watching it over and over), haunts me. Everyone raves about Sean Penn, and rightfully so. His performance is seamless. You forget that an actor is portraying Sam, and start to believe differently. The world disappears (your world), and you immerse yourself in Sam's.Michelle Pfeifer blows me away as Rita. I have never had the urge to write an actor/actress and applaud their work, but I do now. She draws you in. You care about her, her marriage, her relationship (lack of) with her son. She lays on his bed and kisses his head while he is asleep, and you believe it is because Sam has encouraged her to try again. She is a winner in the courtroom, but a loser with people. Her secretary, her husband, her son. She would have lost with Sam, but he is a man on a mission.Sam knows how to be a friend, in his simple way, and he unconsciously ""teaches"" Rita the things she didn't learn in Law School.Sam is still a child, but he has a grasp of what it means to love unconditionally. He impacts everyone he meets because of it. ""That's a fine choice"" he tells patrons he meets on his job. He hugs a witness during the court session. He affirms Rita. ""You're my attorney that never loses."" Her line that sums it up? ""I worry that I've gotten more from this relationship than you."" To be honest, they become friends, and help each other as best they know how. And it's a win/win.",I Am Sam

I thought that it was great though for Dakota Fanning to have gotten the recognition that she received with her being as young as she was back then, and I hope that she and Sean will play in another movie together really soon!

Even though I know what is going to happen, how it is going to turn out, etc. From the first time I saw this movie to my most recent viewing (today), it still hits me very, very hard. Sean Penn plays his role so well, so believable, that I have to remind myself he was only acting. Michelle Phieffer plays her role to a tee and is a reminder of what can happen to a family life when a career gets in the way. That said, and without giving anything away let me just say, if you have not ever seen this movie make it a point to see it as soon as possible. Also be prepared to cry and walk away thinking, and thinking, and thinking.

This movie was worse than watching the freakiest horror show you could imagine. I'm sorry, there is no way in hell I can imagine a positive outcome from an extremely retarded single father raising a child. This show freaked me out and I could not finish watching it.

Sean Penn gives the performance of his life as the improbable Dad who has to raise a child in spite of his limitations.  He is perfect.  Dakota Fanning is stupendous as his daughter.  She acts with her eyes and her face.  Pfeiffer is good though she overacts a bit, but her character develops as you will see.  Of special mention are the two mentally challenged actors who play Sam's friends and who are both phenomenal.  The supporting actors are all excellent. The film looks beautiful with many unique camera effects, and the Beatle songs (cover versions), which provide the soundtrack, serve to comment on the story. Rent the DVD for the superb commentary and deleted scenes.  Penn was nominated for an Oscar for this role and he deserved to win.READ NO FURTHER until you've seen the movie:The only scene that rings false, is when Sam is arrested.

I am Sam is a sensational dramatic piece that will leave you with tears to wipe. In the film, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged single father who's left by, as what it seems, a one night stand homeless woman to raise his daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning). Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Diamond Sky"". As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song ""Lovely Rita"" by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of ""I Am Sam"" into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It's a closer look to the mentally handicapped people's world, that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own ""special"" way.Lastly, should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We've all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects, had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message, that when it comes to parenting, love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parent-child relationship.",I Am Sam

The outstanding performances of the whole cast are what makes this picture adorable.Dakota Fanning succeeds in playing a role at the age of seven more touching and authentic as other actresses in a whole career. The cast as a whole couldn't have been selected better. Sean Penn competes with Hoffman in his role as a retarded man fighting for his daughter.

In other words, despite a suite of tics and speech impediments performed by the talented Sean Penn, the Hollywood treatment transforms a person who would not be able to support himself in the real world into a middle class parent. The neighbor is even a Juilliard graduate who gives free piano lessons.The lack of realism here is stunning: does a job sweeping floors at Starbucks really pay for a decent apartment in any major city? Of course it doesn't. People with the mental age of grade school children don't make competent housekeepers either: they end up with dwellings full of vermin, they stack newspapers next to oily rags because they don't know any better, they mix the wrong household chemicals with toxic results. In the real world a child whose parent has a mental disability is more likely to get singled out by pedophiles or schoolyard buddies than by a kindly agoraphobic pianist. Reality can be ugly; this is why child protection agencies exist.The plot of this fiction then challenges whether such a person should keep custody of his child. With the dice weighted like this, how much of a mystery could the outcome be?In one scene in particular Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer in his defense against Child Protective Services, loses her temper for a moment at her own children and then wonders whether she is so different from Sam? Yes of course she is different because a normal parent is capable of learning from his or her mistakes but a mentally impaired parent lacks that learning curve.There is no doubting the skill of the cast in their profession and Dakota Fanning is a darling. The writing goes as far as it can toward making this premise plausible, which in a different sort of film could be harmless. We all know, for example, that zombies can't really exist. Yet it can be thrilling for two hours to pretend that they do. This film is far more toxic because it attempts to depict a real world problem, and then it encourages all the rationalizations that leave helpless children in unsafe situations. The film's emotional arc shifts to how much Sam wants to be a parent--rather than whether he is competent at it. That is exactly where the focus in child safety cases should never be.",I Am Sam
342,a-s-bhogal,"A poorly choreographed, terribly directed and unnecessarily drawn-out mess of a film",1,8 June 2014,"Firstly, I am surprised at the polarized differences in ratings between the users and the critics with this film. After reading through the user reviews, I can safely say the critics are speaking the same language as I. How the users seem to be more impressed and taken aback by the lead performances to completely oversee the glaring faults staring them right in the face is beyond me.Those who have praised this film do so by crediting Sean Penn's performance as the autistic father, Sam, of a young child, Lucy. (Just for note, I won't bother outlining the synopsis, it's on the title page.) Yes, it goes without saying that his acting is brilliant throughout the film and yes he conveys a vast myriad of emotions in a way many of us with or without disabilities can connect to. But it does not outweigh, in any way, shape or form, the awkward direction and choreography that's so shamefully profound I am astounded it's never fully come to light in other user's reviews, or, more disturbingly, is actually loved by them.Half the time, I found myself watching a documentary trying to emulate the warmheartedness of everyday people and their selfless actions, which then hap-hazardly shifts towards the actual drama between Sam and his daughter Lucy relevant to the actual storyline, and this laughable disequilibrium unfortunately carries on throughout the film; running in parallel to what is otherwise a class act by Sean Penn. The camera angles are inconsistent and unorthodox in many scenes, the filters used made me feel like I was on an acid trip and the cinematography does not enforce the scenes, nor do they aid in forming a coherent dramatic piece. So essentially, what is left as the final product is, well, just a shamefully abhorrent mess.Backing performances are weak, and though Michelle Pfeiffer's character begins pretty solid (as they do in these types of films), her development throughout the film poorly progresses to the end goal of self-realization (aided by Penn's Sam Dawson.) Some scenes were pointlessly dumped in throughout the running time (which I won't mention here, I'm sure you can figure it out once you watch the film, if you haven't already done so,) and I'm intrigued as to what scenes the editors decided to scrap altogether.And it doesn't stop there. The full length of the film, clocking in at 2 hours, feels more like 4 hours of painful drear; having in fact the very juxtaposition of the feel-good and uplifting factor this film was aiming to achieve. Too many unnecessary scenes weighed the drama down to the point where it became a mere effort to continue watching, and any spark within quickly snubbed out by meager (if any) efforts by the editing crew to keep this drama short and sweet, which is what it should have been. Every time a scene ended, another one follows which otherwise should have been replaced with rolling end credits.Drama's like these are a cliché amongst many, and have been recycled and reused many times before in cinema history. Obviously, and for the most part, audiences prefer watching such films to connect with others going through struggles of their own and seeing them endure hardships to the ultimate positive eventuality. But there's no lasting optimism to be found at all in this film, when you take all I have outlined above into consideration. Unless of course you're one of the many other users who credited this ""uplifting, poignant and brilliant"" and all the rest of it. Those who also credited the director for his ""artistic attempts"" ought to also invest their time in watching much better directed films of the same category that would make Nelson's 'artistry' look like an amateurish high school project.One out of 10 may appear too harsh and cold to many of you reading this, but there are seldom any good points I can make about this mentally exhausting and emotionally torturous movie that has the exact opposite effect on me as that of which it was intending to create, and Sean Penn's leading role is not enough to uphold and take lift to a diabolical drama anchored down by a mass array of film making faults.",I Am Sam
343,aleonard-5,An absolute must see,9,23 May 2005,"It doesn't get much better than this. If you want to see a movie about what's important in life, don't miss 'i am sam'. Touching, funny, brilliant, angering, sad, rapturous. Sean Penn is brilliant as Sam Dawson, an adult father with the mental capacity of a seven year old. No one doubts he loves his daughter Lucy (played wonderfully by Dakota Fanning). But with Sam's limitations, family services intervene to take Lucy away from Sam while everyone questions whether love is enough. Everyone except Sam and Lucy. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic in her portrayal of Sam's driven, obsessive, manic (and lying!) lawyer, Rita Harrison, ""who never loses"". She's all that's tragic and wonderful about the corporate legal world. The juxtaposition of her high-powered, successful lawyer against Penn's childlike simplicity brings into sharp relief that life isn't about talent or intellectual, financial or corporate success. Sam and Lucy show, and Rita (et al) learn, that it's about love, honesty, consistency and slowing down enough and opening up to let people in, to care for one another, and to enjoy the things of life together. The movie keeps you guessing right to the end. The camera work is 'out of the box' and the Beatles covers are poignant and relevant. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because the ending didn't quite work for me. Other than that, sheer enjoyable brilliance.",I Am Sam
344,icacer22,A Good Movie,9,26 January 2006,"I really enjoyed this film. While some might've thought a lot of it was corny, I thought it was really moving. Sean Penn gives a powerful performance. I think you really see what a versatile actor he is when you think of how he started his career hilariously as Spicoli in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" then moved on to such films as ""Dead Man Walking"" and finally to turn in a performance like this in ""I Am Sam"". I also really like Michelle Pfeiffer. I'm not sure if I'd ever seen any of her other movies or not, but either way I was very impressed.The one thing about the movie I didn't like was the way the trial was conducted. It's an over-dramatization and is nothing like real life. However, I'd say about ninety percent of films with trials in them are guilty of the same thing.This is a touching movie for anyone and I'd recommend you buy it/steal it/rent it/check it out from your public library, today.",I Am Sam
345,mutongt,Good enough to watch again and again (with a box of tissue!),10,8 June 2005,"Sean Penn, Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer really manage to break my heart and sew it up again in this movie. It is a brilliant movie which reminded me that I am human and succeeded in making me cry. If you haven't seen it and you feel you need to find your heart again, then this is the movie for you. All the supporting actors, especially Dianne West and Penn's friends in the movie are spectacular actors and they manage to draw us into the movie and into their lives.A must see! Thankyou to all those who had to do with the production of the movie and to those who didn't like it, well, there's always something else on the circuit or in the video club to rock your boat.",I Am Sam
346,caitlinbohl,#Tearjerker,8,7 April 2015,"This enchanting tale of a fathers love for his daughter was simply sensational. The meaningful relationships which are carried through this cinematic experience are revolutionary, from Sam's love for Lucy, to the tremendous amount of love and care he receives from his friends, to lastly touching the life of Rita. The role of Annie I felt fell flat at times however, extremely crucial to the storyline. This film was quite difficult to watch at times as I could not imagine myself in these circumstances. It was devastating to watch as Lucy gets taken from Sam as it affects so many of the people in his life. Thankfully his friend suggests a lawyer from the phone book and he manages to get an appointment with her (Rita). In the beginning when first meeting Rita you quickly find that she is not everyone's cup of tea, however as the story unfolds you warm up to her. Throughout the storyline you find Rita begins to have a soft spot towards Sam as she has a 7 year old as well and could not imagine losing him. Slowly as you find Rita begins to warm up to Sam she opens up to him about her issues with her personal life and husband in which he responds that she should leave him. Near the end of the trial Rita comes over to Sam's house to prepare and gives him a suit casually slipping in that her husband left it when he moved out. This lead to my favourite line when Rita says, ""I worry that I've gotten more out of this relationship than you."" I bet she never thought her life would change so much by one person. Remarkable. The ending scene is Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer game and the two of them are having a blast. This was a wondrous way to end the film as you are hopeful that Sam still gets to be an important part of Lucy's life. I found this film to be captivating from beginning to end. There was just the right amount of comedic aspects to bring your spirits up as the tragedies were unfolding. A true classic for this girl. Solid 8 out of 10.",I Am Sam

349,jrsharp,A fantastic movie with a lot to say,9,2 August 2005,"This film has a lot to say, and Sean Penn is stellar delivering the message as Sam. It is an emotional film, but in contrast to other reviewers, I don't think the emotion is wasted and over-the-top, but is instead used to great purpose. The movie addresses the fact that Sam is in reality not equipped to be the sole provider for his daughter. The problems Lucy faces as a result of her father's disability are not glossed over or ignored. Instead, the movie artfully demonstrates that Sam and Lucy need and deeply love each other, but that they also need a good support system (as do we all). The juxtaposition of Sam's loving and supportive relationship with his daughter and his ""normal"" lawyer's troubled relationship with her son is brilliant and very telling. As the daughter of a father who is blind, I understand Sam's struggle to help people see beyond the disability to the man. My favorite scene in the movie says it all. Rita is struggling to define Sam's disability without sounding insensitive. She finally says, ""I don't know what to call you."" He replies, ""Call me Sam.""",I Am Sam
350,matus-serdula,beautiful,10,8 August 2005,"Very nice story, it's about feelings and about things which are important in our life, it's about relationships and love between parents and children. Actors are great too - Penn, Pfeiffer and Fanning are really brilliant. Sean Penn plays a mentally retarded man which is very hard but does it perfectly. Fanning plays his daughter who is smarter than her father. This movie is very sentimental, there are many scenes which will make you drop a tear. I think that all the parents should watch this movie. If you want to see what is really important in life watch it, if you want to be a better parent watch it, and if you want to see a great movie watch it too.",I Am Sam
351,cdkreth,excellent movie,9,9 August 2005,"Sean Penn & Dakota Fanning are wonderful in this movie! her talents are impressive, esp. for a 7 yr old! Penn is very convincing as a mentally challenged adult. I love the way he uses the Beatles music & influence on pop culture to help him analyze the things he does! it helps him in everyday life to associate things with how & why the Beatles wrote what they did. I found this fascinating! Dakota is equally impressive in her role as his daughter. she understands, as she is growing up, that her father is not like most other dads. nonetheless, she loves him, probably because he acts in ways that show a tender & innocent side that many fathers don't display. I found this movie very touching & loved it!",I Am Sam

353,sydneyoshinsky-01945,An emotional roller-coaster ride that is totally worth watching,10,29 November 2016,"I Am Sam follows and explores the life of Sam (Sean Penn), an individual with an intellectual disability, as he fights for custody of his daughter Lucy. Lucy proves to be a bright, young girl who has above average reading skills, but when faculty members at her school begin to notice that she is falling behind in school, they suspect that she is doing so to spare her father's feelings. With this discovery, child protective services intervenes and takes Lucy away from her father, prompting the start of Sam's fight to gain custody of his daughter. In Sam's attempt to find the best lawyer possible, he not only gains a lawyer, but a friend, who he eventually teaches a thing or two about what it really means to love. Despite the adversity he faces, Sam holds down a job and refuses to give up, all with the help of his devoted support team. Sean Penn, Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer deliver an authentic and emotional account of the love a father and daughter share and the trouble that a father will go through to prove that love.This film accurately portrays the idea that an individual's intellectual capacity has no correlation or bearing on their ability to be a parent and to love their child. Regardless of the fact that Sam has the intellectual capacity of a seven-year old, his love for his daughter is unmatched. The bond and love Sam and Lucy share is evident throughout the film and eventually proves to those who doubt his ability to provide her with what she needs, that he is more than capable of loving his daughter. This film also conveys the general message that individuals with disabilities are still humans and deserve to be treated as so. These individuals are wrongfully marginalized in society; they deserve to be treated with respect, kindness and love just as anyone else would like to be treated. Sam proves that he is a capable individual by overcoming adversity and working to prove his dedication to Lucy. Kids often do not realize the impact of their words or actions, hence the saying ""kids will be kids,"" which was clearly demonstrated in this film. When Connor, Lucy's friend joins Sam and Lucy for dinner, Connor asks why Sam is acting like that and uses the ""r-word"" to describe him. He then proceeds to ask Lucy if she is the same as Sam because she is his daughter. Sticking with the negative reactions of children, at the Halloween party when Sam is dancing around in costume, the kids all stop what they are doing to just watch and laugh at him. Sadly, children are not the only ones who negatively perceive Sam. Rita often questions Sam's ability to do certain tasks, like order food or pay a check because he does so a little slower than others. These perceptions all demonstrate the idea of putting an individual's disability for the individual. Luckily, Sam has a support system that invariably sticks by his side as well as a lawyer with an eventual change of heart and a neighbor who loves both Lucy and Sam. Rita explains to those in the courtroom that one's intellectual capacity has nothing to do with one's ability to love and Rita tells those in court that she never questions Sam's ability as a father, and the only thing she does worry about is that if they take Lucy away from Sam, that she will be missing a piece of her she will spend the rest of her life trying to fill. The support that Sam receives from his boss at Starbucks also demonstrates positive advocacy in that they have a close relationship and he trusts him to work there.To anyone who is looking for an emotional roller-coaster ride that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, want to go and hug all of your family members, and everything in between, this is the perfect movie for you. I Am Sam is one of the most accurately portrayed films I have seen in terms of illustrating an image of individuals with disabilities. This film draws you in, makes you feel a connection to each character involved and does so all while conveying an important message that is worth understanding. You will not regret watching this film.",I Am Sam

Acting across the board was superb.Dakota Fanning delivers a wonderfully controlled performance and shows what a raw talent she is.The movie tackles the issue head on and never came across as if it was being overly dramatic for the sake of it. In some scenes it is really heart rendering and i was fighting back the tears frequently.Many people knock Sean Penn because of his personal life (myself included) but his performance of the mentally challenged man was inspiring and never came across as corny!

Sean Penn, in my opinion was robbed when he didn't win EVERY possible award in existence for his portrayal of Sam.

The overall film was fantastic with a choice of cast to match. However, the plot outline says 'retarded' which is completely unnecessary; why not rephrase it to make it more PC?I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hope everyone else did. I honestly don't see how some people could vote less than a '5'. I've put 9 because of all the influences and ideas behind the film and didn't give it 10 because no film is perfect. If you're going to vote low there's no point voting '1'; just leave it if so...don't vote less than '3' without sufficient backup.
