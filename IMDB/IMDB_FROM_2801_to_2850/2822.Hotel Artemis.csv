0,Leofwine_draca,Strange little film,4,20 January 2020,"HOTEL ARTEMIS is a strange little film seemingly unsure of quite what it wants to be. For the most part it plays out like an arthouse drama with a sci-fi backdrop, similar a little to the likes of DELICATESSEN. It turns out that the premise is essentially stolen from JOHN WICK and its system of hotel etiquette, except the lower budget means that the whole film is set in the hotel and its environs. What keeps you watching is a surprisingly good cast, from Jodie Foster (rarely seen on the screens these days) to the ever-winsome Jeff Goldblum and the reliably tough Dave Bautista. Sadly, the sluggish pacing lets it down, although things do build to a solid climax; it's a shame that kind of energy didn't exist earlier on.",Hotel Artemis
1,SnoopyStyle,good potential,6,10 October 2018,"It's 2028 L.A. Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) leads a robbery gang during a city-wide revolt against privatized water. His brother is shot during the escape and he seeks refuge at Hotel Artemis. It is a secured private hospital for criminal members run by a hard-nosed nurse (Jodie Foster). Everest (Dave Bautista) is her giant muscle. She risks everything by saving policewoman Morgan (Jenny Slate). Other patients include loud-mouth arrogant Acapulco (Charlie Day) and assassin Nice (Sofia Boutella) on a secret mission. Waikiki discovers that his brother had stolen jewels from crime boss Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum) who shows up looking for treatment.I really like the concept but there are issues with the execution. It's a movie of outrageous potential. With a few questionable logistics, my biggest problem is that I don't feel connected with Sterling K. Brown's character. Jodie Foster is doing her hardest. Despite some fun ideas, it doesn't really rise to its possibilities. It's not crazy enough. It's not compelling enough. It is good enough to be watchable.",Hotel Artemis
2,Prismark10,"We are all just prisoners here, of our own device",6,2 September 2018,"It has been five years since Jodie Foster's last film, Elysium. In Hotel Artemis she looks visibly aged. A shock for someone who remembers her as a child actress.Hotel Artemis is an absurd base under siege thriller. It borrows elements from John Wick, the club inhibited by criminals and managed by Ian McShane's character as well as films like Assault on Precinct 13, The Purge and The Raid.Foster plays the nurse in the hotel which is an underground treatment facility for injured criminals as long as they pay their subscriptions. The nurse has been running the place for over 20 years and it is bankrolled by the LA gangster, The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum.) The Nurse is an alcoholic suffering from agoraphobia who was struck off when her son died. She is assisted by man mountain Everest (Dave Bautista) a registered healthcare professional. The hotel has rigid rules such as no weapons and not to kill other patients being treated.Set 10 years in the future in a dystopian Los Angeles. There are rioters on the street over corporate shenanigans over water. What looks like a busy night, they have two brothers admitted over a failed bank robbery, an assassin, an arms dealer. Against the rules the Nurse admits a cop injured by rioters. The cop was a neighbour and a friend of her son. The Nurse gets news that The Wolf King is on his way seeking treatment and his hot headed son who wants to prove to his dad that he is the real deal.It turns out that this is the night several guests are intent on breaking the hotel's strict rules. One of them has crossed the path of The Wolf King and needs to be out of his way. The Nurse meanwhile learns the truth about her son's actual fate.The film is an outrageous futuristic grungy noir thriller with plenty of dark humour. Most of it comes from Bautista. It is clear that the presence of two time Oscar winner Foster has meant that everyone has raised their acting game, everyone apart from Charlie Day. When a WWE wrestler can out-act you then you really need to take a hard look in the mirror.Goldblum provides some fun with his late presence as the hippy who traded in beads for bullets to become the LA Kingpin but this gangster has a sting in his tail.",Hotel Artemis
3,nogodnomasters,I am health care professional,7,28 August 2018,"The film takes place 6/21/2028 in Los Angeles. There is a clean water riot going on. In the middle of all of this is the Hotel Artemis, owned by the Wolfking (Jeff Goldblum ) who runs the crime syndicate. It is run by Nurse Thomas (Jodi Foster) who enforces the rules of a criminal safe house and hospital reminiscent of ""The Continental"" in ""John Wick."" The hotel has a cast of characters which include Everest (Dave Bautista ) the bouncer; Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown ), a thief, Nice (Sofia Boutella) a paid Assassin....target unknown; and Acapulco (Charlie Day), an arms dealer. People become injured as our nurse repairs them with modern laser equipment and a 3-D printer. The hotel encompasses the ultra-modern and the classic old. Interesting futuristic crime tale.

4,kosmasp,Vacancy,7,18 October 2018,"Well if you ever need a room at the Hotel Artemis ... you are definitely not well. Pun very much intended. But watching the inhabitants of that establishment, is kind of fun. I might have thought there would be more to the film, it's a bit understating and it is also very low maintenance. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing at all.Bautista may have a better and bigger role in Guardians (or maybe it's had, the future will show what will happen there), so it may also feel underwhelming what he is allowed to play with here. Even on Blade Runner 2049, where he had less screen time he seems to have had more impact. But different movies, different roles and all that. This is an ensemle thriller and it achieves what it sets out to do. Cool characters and good action/stunt sequences",Hotel Artemis
5,lee_eisenberg,California nightmarin',7,1 September 2019,"In the last few years, Jodie Foster has been choosy about her roles. Far from accepting anything for a buck, she carefully picks the high-quality roles, while occasionally directing movies. An example of her high-quality roles is Drew Pearce's ""Hotel Artemis"".The movie depicts LA in 2028. A private company limits the city's water supply, and people are rioting everywhere. Following a robbery, a group of criminals hides out in a hospital run by an unassuming but sharp-witted nurse (Foster) who treats only criminals. However, there are several other hoodlums in this building, and not all these folks have the same goals, meaning that things are bound to come to a head.The movie isn't any sort of masterpiece, but the snappy, in-your-face dialogue drives the whole thing. It keeps tensing up every step of the way. As it was, the movie seemed a bit like a cross between those of Guillermo del Toro and Wes Anderson. It won't be for everyone, but I liked every bit of it. I recommend it.",Hotel Artemis
6,CinemaSerf,Hotel Amnesia...,6,6 August 2020,"On the face of it, this had something of an interesting plot going for it. In a riot-torn Los Angeles, a gang of criminals try to rob a bank, but when they discover the vault too tough for them, they rob the customers instead - including one of a strange looking pen. On leaving their heist, three of them are shot, one killed, by waiting police officers so they seek refuge in the eponymous hotel, run by ""The Nurse"" (Jodie Foster) who only provides her clinical services to those of the criminal fraternity who are paid up members. The arrival in the facility of the badly injured ""Wolf King"" only adds to her woes as her new patients cause a world of new pain, the mysterious pen turns out to be something rather unexpected and the police are closing in. Sadly, the narrative is all over the place, too many sub-plots; grudges and far too little by way of focus from Drew Pearce lets this ramble about all over the shop. Zach Quinto; Jeff Goldblum - who overacts as usual, and a really pretty poor performance from Sofia Boutella as ""Nice"" don't really help much either as we bumble along to a really predicable ending that arrived not a moment too soon!",Hotel Artemis
7,oscaralbert,"""John Buzzard's"" Big Crush reveals her vision of the Tru . . .",6,12 June 2018,". . . Pocalypse during HOTEL ARTEMIS, and it's not a pretty sight. Taking place in 2028, when Mr. T. has followed in mentor Putin's footsteps by declaring himself ""President for Life,' dissolving the Duma or Congress or whatever the ineffectual Capitol Hill Gang was called, and imposing Martial Law in a vain attempt to forestall the rampant looting and rioting taking place in all major U.S. Urban Centers (including Los Angeles, where HOTEL ARTEMIS is set), police shoot-to-kill first, and the only question after is whether to chow down on donuts or Ding Dongs. The make-up department for HOTEL ARTEMIS has done a bang-up job of dolling up the entire cast to look like they have one (or even two!) feet in the grave, to match the natural appearance of Nurse Rancid. However, since you cannot make a silk purse from a trump ear, there's really no character in this flick for which you'd give a tenth of a DEADPOOL. Even the JURASSIC PARK guy looks like he's been digested by a HUMAN FLY. While the chick who straddles him for a happy ending seems halfway presentable, and because the plot says that she's being paid Big Bucks to perform her tricks on video as Kleenex material, perhaps HOTEL ARTEMIS could have salvaged a rating of ""Seven"" IF she'd been appropriately undressed for this potentially moving scene. But no such luck.",Hotel Artemis
8,neil-476,A bit of an odd one,7,27 July 2018,"In the near future, while riots are ravaging Los Angeles, the Nurse runs Hotel Artemis, a hotel/hospital for subscribers to lay low and be treated after suffering injuries in the commission of crimes. Her current clientele includes an odious loudmouths, a pair of brothers, a mysterious female French assassin, with a couple of problematic cases coming in, one of whom is the crime boss who funded the hotel. Also, the Nurse has some hang-ups, one of which is agoraphobia - she hasn't left the place in years.This is a most peculiar film. It's a suspense thriller - there are several suspense threads running through it. It's an action movie in places - Sofia Boutella as the French assassin has a terrific (and balletic) sequence in the latter stages. It's also a character piece - Jodie Foster, interestingly old-looking - has some fun with the Nurse's issues. It's sometimes amusing - Dave Bautista as the Nurse's go-to general factotum makes sure that it isn't just a case of type-casting. And the slightly futuristic setting is interesting.But, while I was engaged throughout, there was something about all these elements which didn't really hang together for me. We've seen a similar scenario in John Wick, but it was background there. Here, it is the whle movie. And despite the multitude of bits, I'm not sure they fitted together particularly well.",Hotel Artemis
9,ferguson-6,"more Jodie, please",6,8 June 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. The feature film directorial debut of Drew Pearce is original and clever, while teasing with hope for a bit more than it delivers. Mr. Pearce is best known for writing the screenplay for IRON MAN 3, and now as a first time director, he shows enough promise to leave us interested in what comes next. The film is set in dystopian Los Angeles a mere 10 years in the future. The streets are flooded with desperate rioters after a mega-corporation shuts off the clean water supply. The company is the film's real villain, and the only one that The Nurse (Jodie Foster) can't treat. See, she runs Hotel Artemis, an underground hospital for top tier criminals - the element that can't just pop into the local community clinic for treatment on the latest bullet hole or knife wound. These patients follow a subscription plan and must stay current on their dues to gain admission. The Nurse forgoes any attempt at personal vanity and is instead an agoraphobic, booze-chugging, (mostly) stick-to-the-rules type, who pops in anti-anxiety tapes and ear buds whenever her pulse quickens. She has run the place since it opened 22 years prior and is assisted by a mountain of man named Everest (get it?) played well by Dave Bautista. He's a combination bodyguard, bouncer, handyman and assistant healthcare professional (check his badge).The set design by Ramsey Avery deserves special mention as the Hotel Artemis is quietly housed in the shell of a former grand art deco hotel, now a victim to the city's carnage - though the neon sign remains illuminated. Its vacation spot-themed rooms are a sight to behold, despite the frustratingly low lighting. Occupants are incognito and use their room names as identifiers. Sterling K Brown is Waikiki, a philosophical bank robber who dragged his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry) here for treatment after a heist went wrong. Acapulco (the always energetic Charlie Day) is a crass, motor-mouthed arms dealer, while Nice (Sofia Boutella, THE MUMMY) is a freakishly skilled assassin.The stress level picks up when the biggest crime lord of Los Angeles shows up seriously wounded. Known as The Wolf King, an admittedly bad choice for a nickname, Jeff Goldblum brings some smooth-talking toughness, humor and twisted class to the proceedings. More than a few tentacles are attached to The Wolf King and other folks we've previously met, not the least of which is a very special ink pen stolen by Honolulu. Mix in an injured cop (Jenny Slate) with a personal link to The Nurse and her constantly alluded to tragic backstory, and the movie puts off a Graphic novel vibe ... missing only the off-the-cuff insanity. It's just a bit too grounded for its own good.The high tech/low rent feel forces us to recall BLADE RUNNER AND ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, but of course, this film isn't at the level of either, as it lacks top tier suspense. It is a terrific reminder of what a talented actress two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster is, and what a shame that we haven't seen her in such a substantial screen role since 2013's ELYSIUM. She really sinks her teeth into this odd character, and more than the action scenes, she keeps us interested the entire run time. The score is a bit too heavy on the droning electronic bass line, and while the Florida joke and nod to John Phillips (The Wolf King, ""California Dreamin'"") earns some bonus points, it's really the performance of Ms. Foster and the set design that saves a too-safe script.",Hotel Artemis
10,FlashCallahan,'I'm a 20 ounce sirloin'......,7,20 July 2018,"After a botched, three disgruntled thieves make their way to Hotel Artemis, a 13-story, members-only hospital for criminals. It's operated by the Nurse, a heavy drinking, high-tech healer who already has her hands full with a French assassin, an arms dealer and her own demons. As the violence of the night continues, the Nurse must decide whether to break her own rules and confront what she's worked so hard to avoid.......Imagine a film based wholly on The Continental Hotel from 'John Wick', mixed with The Purge, and a little BladeRunner, and what you get is this little gem of a film.It's great to see Foster lead a film after so long, and she's as good as ever as The Nurse, an agoraphobic, anxiety suffering person who only has criminals and her porter, Everest (Bautista) for company.She's followed the rules of the place for 22 years, and now, in the middle of a riot, the hotel faces it's busiest night ever.To begin with, you could imagine that writer/director Pearce has seen a lot of Tarantino, as what you are led to believe is this film is going to be about these six people in the hotel for the night, waiting for the riot to blow over.But no, during the opening scene, they steal a pen from someone, and this is the main plot point of the film. So we have Charlie Day who is there for other reason than to be horrible to every single person he encounters (an awesome, but pointless role), Sofia Boutella, the femme fatale of the film, whom has a very noir-ish feel to her character, Brown and Henry, who are there to let the audience into the titular place.And then enter, Jeff Goldblum, and the films main plot arc revolves around him. His presence in the hotel shakes the whole night out, because aside from Day, he has an effect on every single person in the place.Foster bends the rules by helping a member of the police who she sees outside, but is conveniently from her past, and this adds a little urgency to the film, but as i've said before, it's just too convenient for it's own good.It's a short film, and this causes the film to feel too rushed, there is no real backstory to any of the characters, apart from Foster and her sub-plot involving her late son, but add another 30 minutes to the film, and these characters could have been fleshed out a little more, so you'd care for the them just a little more.But it's a worthy oddity for sure, Foster and Bautista have a great chemistry between them, and there is an extended cameo from Zachary Quinto, but again, this becomes nothing more than an anti-climax.Speaking of ant-climax, the writer must have forgot about Boutella, because in the final act, she has a wonderful 'Oldboy' style set piece, braces herself to start another fight, and we never hear from her again.I'm hoping there is an extended cut somewhere, because it feels like these characters had to be fleshed out at one point, which is a shame, because even though it's a lot of fun, a lot of the characters feel a little flat...",Hotel Artemis
11,siderite,A cast driven gangster film,8,19 October 2020,"Somewhere in the near future, the inequality in the US has reached the tipping point and poor people in LA are being curfewed, isolated and their water paywalled. In the middle of city wide riots, a bunch of professional criminals meet in a hotel where a nurse is healing their wounds. I liked the acting, most of all, and I think it was intentional, because the story itself is kind of stupid. Style and acting over an actual story. In that way, it's almost a John Wick spinoff.Bottom line: entertaining, but not something spectacular. And it has less action than what it promises to bring.",Hotel Artemis

The criminals only getaway happens to be a hotel that being the Artemis one which is ran by a nurse who has a long history of treating criminals.Along the way the movie has plenty of power struggle and betrayal it's like loyalty doesn't matter and the picture has an all pro cast of Jodie Foster, Sterling K.

13,Hellmant,"Nice to see Foster in a lead role again, but I was kind of bored during a lot of it.",6,15 June 2018,"'HOTEL ARTEMIS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi dystopian thriller written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Drew Pearce. It stars Jodie Foster (in her first film in 5-years) as a nurse that runs a hospital for dangerous criminals in future L.A.. The movie costars Sterling K. Brown, Sofia Boutella, Dave Bautista, Charlie Day, Zachary Quinto, Brian Tyree Henry, Jenny Slate and Jeff Goldblum. The film has received mostly decent reviews from critics, but it bombed at the Box Office. I found it to be OK..The story is set in a dystopian Los Angeles, at a hospital which helps wounded criminals called Hotel Artemis. It's ran by a veteran nurse named Jean Thomas (Foster). Waikiki (Brown) and Honolulu (Henry) just pulled off a robbery where they were nearly killed by police. They go to Artemis looking for help, and later more trouble follows them. The movie has a great setup and I love the cast. It's especially nice to see Foster in a lead role again, and she's once again outstanding in it. The movie itself just isn't involving though, and I was actually kind of bored during a lot of it. Parts of it are fun though, especially Bautista and Boutella's roles. Overall though, I was pretty disappointed with the film.",Hotel Artemis
14,thesar-2,Not a Happy Hump Day,9,24 May 2020,"When I saw the trailers, I thought: What a John Wick Rip-off! When I saw the movie just now, that comparison is like saying Ghost ripped off Ghostbusters because, you know, they both have ghosts.Because of my invalid prejudgment, I avoided seeing this for the longest time. Still, I wanted to see it, especially if it was another Continental.Speaking of which, it's a mere 10 years (yeah, right with this tech, but still) into the future and Los Angeles is overrun by never-ending riots. Nurse Foster practically runs her own makeshift hospital to help injured criminals in the criminally overrun city outside. What we see is the Nurse going from one subplot to another and making us all the more wanting more.I absolutely loved this. I loved Jodie Foster the most - her best acting in decades. Plus, I loved the dialogue, setup, acting, characters and the complex yet thoroughly interesting plots. Further, I loved how this was just a 94-minute movie and yet felt like a season of a TV series.And finally, I wouldn't mind watching Hotel Artemis as a series. I would love to see what Thursday looks like.***Final thoughts: While this was more suspense than action, stay tuned for the fantastic third act where it does, finally, resemble John Wick.And I was just saying to myself before seeing Hotel Artemis, there's not enough Asians in movies.

17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A keen focus on character keeps things engaging.,7,22 July 2018,"'Hotel Artemis (2018)' always keeps a keen focus on character, perhaps even at the expense of some of the expected action extravaganza. It's this unexpected but consistently clear and well-written development that provides the heart of the picture, a surprisingly strong emotional core that comes from an iron-clad attachment to most of its central characters (at least, those designed to be sympathetic), while also keeping it on track even when it threatens to derail itself. The film introduces and then follows multiple plot-threads in its second act, before dropping many of them seemingly just as fast while also forgetting to utilise others altogether. There's always a general sense of stability, though, because the piece is clearly put together by someone who knows what they are doing, someone who's confident and competent at doing the specific thing they set out to do. There's never really a dull moment, even when the flick slows down somewhat, because we always care about the characters and can't always predict which way they're going to go. This leads to an entertaining and energetic experience that isn't all about the action - in fact, it isn't really about it at all - but has a heck of a bark to go along with its bite. 7/10",Hotel Artemis
18,dromasca,L.A. in flames,5,13 August 2020,"There are quite a few reasons why 'Hotel Artemis', the 2018 film by first time director Drew Pearce, would be worth seeing. First of all, the cast, in which Jodie Foster appears for the first time after a five-year break (her previous film was also a sci-fi action dystopia - Hotel Artemis) but also Jeff Goldblum, Sofia Boutella, and others. The design and cinematography as we can guess from the posters and 'trailers' are interesting and it is obvious that money and talent have been invested in them. The idea is quite original and many of the characters that appear on the screen bring with them interesting stories. And yet, the film disappoints. I believe that the main problem is in the script. The concept is underdeveloped and many of the heroes disappear before we have time to care about them. Most of the films that come out of American studios nowasays suffer from excessive length, because the addition of many minutes, sometimes tens of minutes, which unnecessarily prolong viewing times. 'Hotel Artemis' suffers from being too short. With less than 90 minutes of actual screening time, the film fails to say all that needs to be said, and the ratio between content and action is excessively unbalanced in favor of the action, which itself is violent but not spectacular or original enough to compensate.Los Angeles, the City of Angels of 2028 is in flames, with demonstrations and violent confrontations opposing the police and the army on one side, and the population rebelled against corporations and the economic and ecological crisis on the other side. Criminals control the streets. There is no running water, the power outages hotpermanently and a night curfew is imposed. The 'Nurse', a rather old woman (Jodie Foster wearing a sperical make-up designed to make her look older) takes care of the Artemis Hotel, furnished in the 'Art Deco' style which is actually a hospital that takes care of injured criminals. Fate brings simultaneously in the hotel that night two gangster brotherst who just committed a burglary, a paid assassin, the injured local mob boss who is also the owner of the hotel and a seriously injured policewoman who is also linked to the nurse's biography and tragic events decades ago. Confrontations are inevitable and the fate of the institution, which was a kind of cease-fire oasis in which weapons and conflicts are left at the entrance, is called into question.The cinematic qualities and the remarkable stylish sets of the film are not enough to compensate for the lack of consistency of the story. Not even the main character, the Nurse, manages to convince, although she benefits from most of the time on screen and from Jodie Foster's acting performance.'Hotel Artemis' looks more like a sketch of a dystopian action film than the film itself. I think that it's just the spectators interested only in the scenes of violent action who will come out, maybe, satisfied from watching. This does not require so much talent invested in acting or creating sets. The others, that is us, we will wait for the full movie.",Hotel Artemis
19,ThomasDrufke,It's Fine.,5,21 June 2018,"Typically crime movies are my niche of choice. There's just something about them that always appeals to me, and it usually doesn't matter which side the film chooses to tell the story from. Hotel Artemis picks the side of the criminals as it deals with a hotel strictly for the use of criminals who are in need of medical attention or just need a place to stay for the night. With a great cast and a story poised for summer popcorn fun, the film only half landed with me. Focusing on 'The Nurse' who runs the secret hotel, played by Jodie Foster, Hotel Artemis tries to pull heart, humor, and thrills in a brisk 90 minute runtime. Disappointingly you never get enough of any one particular character's backstory to care about the overall arc. 'The Nurse' finds an emotional beat here or there because of her son who passed away, or the officer she chooses to help with a connected past, but I felt like I need more of a backstory to her and her relationship to these individual people to find the interconnectivity for all of it. I found that to be the case with all the characters though, I liked bits and pieces of who they were (like Boutella's incredible action scenes, or Bautista's quiet charisma) but there was nothing particularly locking me in to the entire film. If you're like me and have a moviepass (and are able to see everything in theaters), it may be worth it. Otherwise, I would pass.5.9/10",Hotel Artemis

23,cruise01,"Weird, slightly a boring story, and a gritty short climax does make this film entertaining.",7,12 June 2018,"Hotel Artemis (3.5 out of 5 stars).Hotel Artemis is a dystopian crime film were it mashes concepts from other movies like John Wick and puts a spin on it. A hotel were criminals can go to get medical attention. A robber, an assassin, or a mobster can not go to a public hospital were there injuries would be questioned. But in Hotel Artemis, which is led by Jean/The Nurse (Jodie Foster), which she has the place run by rules to everyone in it. The plot follows Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) after a robbery gone badly and his brother was able to escape with a pen that has diamonds in it. They both run into Hotel Artemis to treat there gun shot wounds. There, other guests are Nice (Sofia Boutella) an assassin for hire, Acapulco (Charlie Day) an arms dealer, and you have the hotel bouncer Everest (Dave Bautista). When the one night were a riot breaks out in Los Angeles. A cop Morgan (Jenny Slate) needs help which Jean cannot refuse since they both had history. The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum) will pay the place a visit when he needs to seek medical attention. But what Waikiki does not know about the diamonds, is the wolf king owns them. And will leave countless bodies to get them back. The film is entertaining, cheesy, and has its share of violent fight sequences. The concept may have holes in the logic. Where criminals can pay for a membership to the hotel for their safe haven. And they have to follow the rules or else their membership is revoked. But what happens when you get a group that cannot stand each other? Or they all have a connection which may lead to mayhem? Just like how this film will play without giving away spoilers. Waikiki seems to be the decent criminal that knows what is right and wrong. Is trying to find a life out of stealing. When chaos does break loose in the hotel in the mid second act of the movie. Where the wolf king's man are after Waikiki and Jean. And Everest and Nice are fighting them off. It can be violent. It is not as gory or bloody compared to Quentin Tarantino's movies. It could have been worse. But the film does have an exciting entertaining hallway fight sequence with Sofia Boutella taking on several bad guys. She is ruthless, fierce, and beautiful. I am hoping she does more action films than her lackluster The Mummy movie or her breakthrough role with Kingsman. The film does have some stupid fun humor. Especially, Dave Bautista playing Everest. A big, intimidating bouncer, and kind of a soft personality. Almost feels like he is playing a human version of Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy. Jeff Goldblum seemed to be enjoying playing the villain. While Zachary Quinto playing an overacting bad guy. Jodie Foster was great playing a character that has a tragic past and has her own personal reason she runs the hotel. While there are supporting characters that felt left undeveloped like Charlie Day, Jenny Slate, and even Sterling K. Brown. Overall, Hotel Artemis is a pretty fair dystopian crime film. Director Drew Pearce captured a neo-noir tone of a futuristic Los Angeles and its gritty violence. The cast ensemble was good. The concept was cheesy and entertaining. It did have some characters that were left undeveloped. It did have a fair share of action in the climax with a gritty hallway fight scene.",Hotel Artemis
24,eddie_baggins,A huge missed opportunity,4,6 March 2019,"It wasn't exactly one of 2018's highest profile releases but with a loaded cast and an central idea that screams potential and crowd-pleaser, Hotel Artemis ends up being one of last year's big disappointments.The first feature film from Iron Man 3 and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation writer Drew Pearce, Artemis so easily could've been a film with abundant smarts and sass, delivered through hip filmmaking and a charismatic cast but Pearce's film feels rushed, hollow and rather plodding when it should've been anything but.Set in the near future of Los Angles in 2028 where riots are common place and lawlessness abounds, Pearce introduces us to a hotel/hospital for criminals known as the Hotel Artemis that's run by Jodie Foster's The Nurse who alongside Dave Bautista as her lackey Everest runs a tight ship in a space filled with criminal types and shady dealers.It's a fantastic concept but one that Pearce only briefly ever gets something out of as the hotel finds itself under siege after Sterling K. Brown's robber and guest attracts the unwanted attention of crime lord The Wolf King after unwillingly taking one of his prized possessions.The brief moments that work such as a hallway fight with Sofia Boutella's assassin Nice are energetic and full of life but when the film is largely built around characters we know very little about or scenarios that only ever feel half explored, its hard for us to get excited about this futuristic action thriller that doesn't have enough of either of its genre's to be worth a recommendation.Films such as Dread or The Raid proved well and truly that action thrillers could be thrilling in a single location setting but Artemis features none of the pizazz or skills that were evident in those films, instead feeling like a by the numbers thriller without an ounce of real originality.It's even more of a shame when you consider that Pearce not only squandered the idea of his high-concept narrative but his cast who outside of Foster and Brown barely get anything of note to work with.Supports such as Charlie Day, Jeff Goldblum, Zachary Quinto and Jenny Slate get scarily little to do with their roles showcasing the films glaring problem with making the most of the tools at its disposal.Final Say -A squandered opportunity to create magic with a talented cast and a highly entertaining concept, Hotel Artemis is a dull and mostly lifeless experience that should've been something so much more.2 fire axes out of 5",Hotel Artemis
25,TheMovieDiorama,Hotel Artemis may lack hospitality but has enough punch to ensure you enjoy your stay.,7,25 July 2018,"Wait, hold up! This isn't a sequel to anything? An original crime mystery with vibes of futurism and possibly one of my favourite casting lists this year? Sign me up! Take my bags, show me to my room and let me enjoy this. A huge riot breaks out in a near-future Los Angeles where we follow a nurse who runs a secret criminal hospital. Think of this as 'John Wick' meets 'House', except less action and no witty Laurie. Instead, we have an outstanding Foster, whom I'm extremely happy to see back, to set the hospital straight. A nurse who always abides by the rules, doesn't mind a drink or two and loves to dish out some profanity to her patients. Not to worry, she certainly gets some backchat from her patients. The self-absorbed Day, enigmatic beautiful Boutella, stern professional Brown and even her sarcastic assistant Bautista. Screenwriter Pearce packs an overflowing amount of expletives, that it surprisingly sets the gritty tone rather perceptively. This also being his feature length directorial debut, he turns his attention to the characters rather than the environment itself. Backstory is provided throughout and the interactions between the patients are both jagged and heartfelt. A forced underdeveloped sub-plot regarding the nurse's son still did bring some much needed emotion to the dystopian backdrop. Pearce craftily builds up mystery and intrigue for each character, slowly revealing true motives. All building up to a climatic siege that showcases some brutal action sequences, most notably by Boutella and Bautista, that rounds off the film succinctly and pleasingly. Martinez' score is fittingly electric to exhume the dystopian aesthetic. However the film's conclusion does feel rushed, and concentrates on setting up a sequel. Also occasionally the sense of unoriginality does slowly creep in, but it's refreshing enough to differentiate itself from other sci-fi flicks. Lightning pace, proficiently witty and an underlying sense of dark humour brings life to this hospital.",Hotel Artemis

Hotel Artemis is just like the Continental, it's a complete safe heaven for the criminal element of the city. The concept is different as it takes place in a very near future in which society has broken down in LA and there is rioting in the streets, and the Hotel is a Hi-tech hospital (by 2018 standards anyway) for any criminals with the right health insurance.Honestly, the future dystopian plot does not do much to help the story or making the film that much more interesting (in comparison if it took place in the present). I feel like they did a weak job trying to bring originality to a story I've seen before.At first I thought that the film was going to be an anthology with many different stories, but everything was intertwine and connected together including the all-star cast that was kinda wasted on this film. All except Dave Bautista who was amazing in this film. He does not do much action in a movie that could have used him hitting things hard as much as possible, but honestly his abilities as an actor are impressive for a wrestler, so much that he's still worth seeing without the wrestling moves. Someone tried to make Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, but was so focus on trying to come up with something original that they forgot the basic core.

29,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,23 December 2018,"It was made in the wrong decade. It's very much a toned down esthetic heavy middle 90s science-fiction romp with an Oliver Stone ensemble cast. It's very retro-distopian-science-fiction with a low budget that relies on the look to make the film.That being said, it's not bad. In all honesty, it's actually pretty entertaining if you walk into it expecting only what it promises to be, a quasi-indie film that's made to entertain and nothing more.The premise is fun. There is talent in the cast (and more notable celebrities than there should be). It looks cool. The action is a ride. The dialogue is hip. And the characters are developed only just enough to advance you through the film.And, in the end, you walk away satisfied and entertained, so, really, it delivers exactly what it promises to.",Hotel Artemis

How about one that is actually not that long, but feels much longer than it is?Such is the case with ""Hotel Artemis"". The movie is all over the place, supposedly set in a location important enough to be titular but never giving any sense of place or character.I have no idea what the plot was about.The movie has a great case which is largely squandered.

Brown-This Is Us_tv, Black Panther; Sofia-Boutella-The Mummy_2017, Kingsman:The Secret Service; Dave Bautista-Avengers:Infinity War, Spectre and Jeff Goldblum-The Jurassic movies, Earth Girls Are Easy.
This is a unique and original fun little movie, set in the not too distant future of 2028. Riots are the norm in Los Angeles-this particular one is for clean water-with Jodie reminding us on several occasions, 'Just another Wednesday!' Jodie runs a members only emergency room for criminals, aka, The Hotel Artemis. She has rules-besides having to be a member-such as no guns, no cops and no killing the other patients. She also uses code names, both for her and her orderly Dave-hers is Nurse & his is Everest-and even for her patients and she uses high tech devices in her efforts to help her patients get back on the streets. Sterling is a robber that finds himself needing Jodie's services and ends up at the hotel. Sofia is already there, recovering from a gun shot wound. Jeff shows up needing some of Jodie's health care, plus he has some connection to her establishment. There are people that want to break Jodie's rules and consequences have to be paid.

Brown and Henry get injured in a failed robbery but as member of Hotel Artemis, a fortress hospital for criminals, they can get fixed up by nurse Foster and her assistant Bautista. However, they pick the wrong night to turn up.This cries out for cult status - the hotel is a wonderful dark and bizarre place, all the characters are tough and ambiguous and the plot progresses from many directions and at a thousand miles an hour. This in many ways is the flaw with what could have otherwise been a great film in that it had too much going on in just 94 minutes and crucially you don't get time to really understand the fabulous characters.Definitely worth catching if you like something a bit different, but in many ways, a missed opportunity.

Dave Bautista plays his character, Everest, pretty perfectly, while Charlie Day's character is more interesting than what I've previously seen from him. I felt Sofia Boutella's Nice was underused for the majority, though she got some cool moments late on.What holds this back is the way it's all glued together. I never felt attached to any of the aforementioned people or to the premise itself, I was basically just a spectator admiring as opposed to becoming invested.

I went to a matinée showing of it and had the entire theater to myself as I watched this movie, and I'm really glad I chose to go see this in the theater versus renting it. The reason I'm glad is because the style of this movie is definitely one to be seen on the big screen. Style is what initially attracted me to this movie, well that and Jodie Foster. I've always been a big Jodie Foster fan, she is a fantastic actress and has such range with her talent. She does not disappoint here in her in first onscreen appearance since Elysium, 5 years ago. Her performance carries a good portion of the movie, and she is one of the main things we focus on. Sterling's character is also one we focus on, and gosh did I love him here, he was really great in his role. Everyone really did a good job and I really liked the characters, I thought the script gave them the depth they needed. The plot is pretty easy to follow, it's nothing too abstract but its enjoyable and holds the audiences attention all the way through. I'd never seem a movie quite like this one and I love that feeling because a lot of times we see recycled versions of other movies, but this one was pretty original and I like that.

The Hotel is a mixture of old style furnishings with futuristic autodoc medical systems. Sofia Boutella is an injured assassin who has a secret agenda (doesn't everyone in this film?) while Jeff Goldblum is the boss of LA. This is one of those few films which would have benefited from a longer running time to enable more character development and societal background but a lot is packed into it's 94 minutes.

37,aidanratesmovies,"An entertaining crime flick, although not without its flaws",8,23 April 2020,"Entertaining, with some great performances throughout- Hotel Artemis may be a bit cliched to watch at times, but its dark nature and fun sense of energy makes for one hell of a time. The film is a bit crowded at times with its cast of characters, but is full of enough good performances and interesting character traits to make for one entertaining ride. Jodie Foster largely carries the film and gives the best performance out of anyone involved. Her character as the nurse is both original, and incredibly detailed, and I loved every second of her time on screen. The film also is sprinkled with other good character performances, most notably from Sterling K. Brown and Sofia Boutella, but at times their roles do seem a little overdramatic. The film can be a bit cliched in nature at times, with some tropes being used that you may see coming. Nevertheless, the film makes up for it, with its sense of style, atmosphere, and pure enjoyment factor. The film is also cleverly shot, as well as some great music throughout that both made it feel a bit nostalgic, and oh so cool at the same time. In the end, Hotel Artemis is a purely entertaining action flick, that may not be the smartest criminal centered film on the market, but is certainly worth a watch, and certainly enjoyable to watch through and through.

38,truemythmedia,Some Cool Ideas,7,23 May 2019,"This film reminded me a lot of another film I'd seen recently: ""Upgrade"". While ""Upgrade"" is being praised as exhilarating and shocking, this film is flying under the radar. It's too bad. This, while it is far from a masterpiece, is far more original than ""Upgrade"". It has better acting, a unique premise, and a cool world that, if it had been handled correctly, could've spawned another cinematic universe. Sadly, there were too many characters (some of them, utterly superfluous), some stupid choices, too many unexplained coincidences, and, honestly, a somewhat flat finale. I've seen a few whiners online saying this is a rip-off of ""John Wick"" (2014), but other than the fact that both films have secret criminal societies, there are hardly any other similarities.
I saw this film yesterday, and I struggled with whether or not to give this film a 3.5 or a 3... if you read my Upgrade review, you'll remember that I ended up going with a 3 because the film felt like a blender of a ton of better films. This film I went with a 3.5 because this film has more original concepts and interesting characters. There are some cool things in this film, and if it were executed a different way, it could've been awesome. If you've followed my reviews for this website at all, you'll know that I have a soft spot for fantasy films and some sci-fi stuff, so by and large, I enjoyed my hour and a half at ""Hotel Artemis"". It was almost enough fun for me to add it to my guilty pleasure list, but not quite.

And that's where I start to tip my hat, because unlike many previous apocalypse movies out there, this apocalypse runs alongside our characters throughout (rather than as some sort of establishing intro scenario). And the apocalypse, of course, runs amok with the power, allowing the director to play with lighting and tension, which I thought was done with a deft hand. There is tension throughout. Then there is the tech, which amid the developing tendencies and fears of the characters, is also rolled out with skill (throughout). The plot is just crazy and complicated enough to impress without anyone getting lost, and skirts one's expectations deliciously. Performances were consummate. I don't think I've ever seen Jodie Foster in a bad movie, and she certainly carries the day with this one. Her character is something we haven't seen before, and her sidekick is equally impressive.

Welcome to another Robbie's movie review and today we review: Movie: Hotel ArtemisDirector:
 Drew Pearce
Writer:
 Drew Pearce
Stars:
 Jodie Foster, Sofia Boutella, Dave Bautista LIKES:  Acting
 Character Dynamics
 Sofia Boutella and Sterling Brown's Characters
 Realistic Setting
Action Scene Summary: Hotel Artemis is a movie largely dependent on its characters, which fortunately are brought to life by the fantastic talents of the various cast members recruited for the project. Leading roles by Foster, Boutella and Sterling K. Brown are by far the most in depth and worthy of billing, but even the supporting characters like Bautista and Charlie Day who bring their usual styles to the mix to alleviate some of the more somber moments. 
As the actors bring it to life, the character dynamics start to awaken, establishing the realm of crime in the near-future LA and just how fickle trust can be in the underworld. Those dynamics by far are the driving force of the movie, trying to help figure out how each of the pawns are connected and what will drive them in this high stakes hospital. Perhaps it's the setting itself that forces this evolution of characters, as the dingy oasis from the riot outsides places numerous pressure on the group. As the outside world grows wilder (documented by occasional news blurbs), the characters are forced to interact and face their own dilemmas. It's a well-done drama that doesn't pull any punches in the 2 hour run time so that it may establish so much. 
I mentioned in pre-reviews that this movie looked to have some action to further spur the story on and for the most part... that is not the case. Yet, there is one action scene in particular led by the sexy assassin herself, that is just epic, tense, and a great fit into the story that feels pertinent to the tale as a whole. I wished there was more of these moments, but that wasn't the direction they wanted to go. DiSLIKES:
 Slow at times
 Charlie Day/Quinto Rants
 Underutilization of characters/actors
 More Action
 Darker Violence
 Background flopsLike some of the more popular dramas on television, Hotel Artemis' drama is all about try to build tension through the characters and have politics, emotional fervor, and affairs be the selling point. This takes time to adequately develop, and given all the convoluted ties in this movie, it means a pace that isn't quite adrenaline fueled. Hotel Artemis has its slow points, that easily could have been tightened to reduce the run time or potentially add some more tension/urgency to the mix. Had there been more action to speed it up, the pace may not have been as much of a low point for me, but I fought sleep a couple of times. 
 In addition, a few of the directions that the characters were taken were not my favorite renditions I wanted to see. Primarily in Quinto and Day's characters, these players in Artemis' game are more annoying than engaging, leaving me disappointed with the little contribution they played. Day just rants and curses like someone hopped on coffee, Red Bull, and methamphetamine, while Quinto is just a big baby. Not quite as fitting given the other portrayals of the crime gang. Even worse, a few of the characters are super left out, reduced to a few, unmemorable lines or weak character ploys to get to the climax faster. Jeff Goldblum's character was one of these guys, and my fears of too many characters came true. 
Which brings me to perhaps my biggest dislike of the film, the rushed background stories and flops. The Nurse's story is one of the heavy hitters, mysterious and emotionally charged, you expect it to be the epicenter of the movie. And while it was a key connector, much of the backstory was not that impressive, alliterated, and lacking any major surprise/mind blowing component. When the big revelation comes... you almost miss the clues and by this point I was done with all the planning, I needed the climactic finish. Fortunately Nice and Waikiki's tale had a little more to it, but even then it was only a superficial scratch to what lied below. All the potential was kind of flown over, therefore this was the disappointment factor for me. 
The VERDICT:  Hotel Artemis is weird and dark, no doubt about it, and truth be told it is a crime/drama with characters that are the central pillar to the story. Despite a fantastic cast acting their brains out and a character centric plot, Artemis's main flaws come from not having enough time to fully utilize everyone they wanted, and it resulted in plot teasers that could be expanded on in the future (perhaps in a sequel no doubt). Such complications were only exacerbated by the slower pace, that begs for more suspense, tension, and action to bring it to life. Truth be told, this could have been better done as a television series than a solo movie, given them hours to further map out the conspiracy web. Overall, not worth the trip to the theater to be honest, but worth the rent if you are into the alternative Sci-Fi/crime scene. My scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.0

Brown, Sofia Boutella, Charlie Day, Jenny Slate, Brian Tyree Henry, Dave Bautista, Zachary Quinto, Jeff Goldblum, Kenneth Choi. (R)In the riot-plagued Los Angeles of the not-too-distant future, the Hotel Artemis serves as a hospital/hideout for criminals with a membership, run by the weary, no-nonsense Foster (in a typically strong performance). It's pretty much all surface here, as any attempts to plumb character profiles or the intricacies of the strange but intriguing setting results in cliches or absurdities; the premise is ripe with possibilities but the messy results meander predictably and/or forgettably. Stylish but hollow, and driven by at least one too many far-too-convenient plot development, everything unrelated to the flashy style, the occasional amusing line, and Foster's performance evaporates not long after each scene ends. Even a late appearance by Goldblum can't save the picture, though he (like the rest of the supporting cast) does what he can with the underwritten role. Pearce, in his feature debut as director, shows promise, but hopefully he'll have more substance and organization in his next outing.52/100",Hotel Artemis

47,blott2319-1,"Aimless meandering, but with some fun moments.",5,29 April 2020,"I think my wife said it best when we finished watching Hotel Artemis when she said, ""What was the point of that?"" This film suffers from a frustrating lack of purpose. One of the big reasons for that is it features a cavalcade of crooks, so there's not a sympathetic person in the entire movie, except a wounded cop who pops in for about 5 minutes or less. The entire concept of a hospital/hotel for criminals is kind of stupid anyways. The film also lacks any focus because there is not a distinct protagonist or main character, there are 4 or 5 of them. All of them have their own story going on, plus there's an overarching story about some kind of riot in the city, and therefore none of the plots get enough screen-time to be interesting. Jodie Foster is the closest we get to a sympathetic main character, but I never once found her all that compelling. She's always been a bit of a flat actress in my opinion, and her abbreviated backstory in this film did little to move me. This movie seems to live on the idea that a bunch of aggressive violence and insane action is all that is necessary to make a competent film. There were certainly moments of exciting action that I enjoyed, particularly when Sofia Boutella started kicking butt. However, it didn't provide enough story to make me care about why those intense scenes were taking place. The biggest flaw in Hotel Artemis is the script. Drew Pearce was granted a star-studded cast, and certainly knows how to film action, but he should probably leave the writing to other people.",Hotel Artemis

The hotel Artemis is a haven where wealthy people of a dubious nature can get themselves patched up.The idea sounds great and the star of the show should be the hotel.
I expected the hotel to be some kind of interesting ecosystem where the privileged and the scum of the underworld are forced to rub shoulders.This happens to a small extent but the film concentrates more on the characters, which would be OK if the characters weren't so lame.After twenty seconds of dialogue you know exactly what each character is about and you can predict if, when and how each one will die.
**What you mean the sexy fem fatal isn't a helpless bimbo but is in fact a one woman army in stilettos! Well blow me down!**Jodie Foster is (predictably) awesome and has the only character of any merit.
Everyone else talks poo for a while, killing time until the inevitable fight at the end.This is not a bad movie, it just sounded like it would be something different but is actually a hash of a cheesy, generic 80/90's Sci-fi flick that could easily have stared Van Damme.The production is pretty good and there is some fun to be had here it is is just painfully predictable and feels tired.",Hotel Artemis

54,RforFilm,"Hotel Artemis may have an awesome, Tech-Noir style and setting, but lacks a focused story interesting characters",5,11 June 2018,"Stories that explore a deep state get extra points in my book. I don't mean a deep state within the government, but rather a deep state within a criminal world. It's clear that criminals will get their supplies out of the public eye, in places like black markets and the mafia; places where they feel like they can trust. Or let me rephrase...as much trust as one can be offered. While one could acquire an assault riffle or a bomb, there's no guarantee that the one offering them one can be a hundred percent trusted. So for that, criminals have to deal with whatever consequence comes to them. This therefore makes them the most responsible personally. That's not to say what they do is justified, but they simply cannot walk into a hospital without likely being discovered. I like the idea that criminals would need to go to some sort of a secret hospital. Today's movie has not only accomplished that vision, but has given the place it's own atmosphere that makes it something that feels like it could exist, even if the movie does take place in the future. Let's see how Hotel Artemis can play with that notion with a story.In 2028, Los Angeles is full of rioters and a police state. A bank is robbed by a set of brothers, but both are injured during the ordeal. They make it to a secret hotel/hospital called the ""Hotel Artemis"". This place is run by a doctor only known as ""The Nurse"" (played by Jodie Foster) along with assistance/security Everest (played by Dave Bautista). Both brothers are assigned their rooms, which are also their assigned names, Waikiki (played by Sterling K. Brown) and Honolulu (played by Brian Tyree Henry). They are also given the spiel on the rules which include no fighting and no real namesWhile there, it's discovered that in addition to taking personal items, Honolulu had also taken a fancy pen that's filled with diamonds worth millions. It's also discovered that the diamonds belonged to ""The Wolf King"" (Played by Jeff Goldblum) who also happens to own the Hotel Artemis. The race is on for ""The Nurse"" to ensure that her guests don't engage in illegal transactions and standing her ground as the rioters get closer. Other guests include an arms dealer Acapulco (played by Charlie Day) and a deadly assassin Nice (played by Sofia Boutella).I have to give Hotel Artemis a lot of credit for creating not just a fascinating hospital/hotel, but a world as well. This is the kind of creativity that I wish major studios were more willing to undertake rather then sticking to all too safe superheroes and nostalgic reboots. Not to mention that with a criminal hospital, this has a lot of potential to tell many stories within the people that come in and out. In fact, Jodie Foster makes for a convincing doctor. I'll also note that they did well with her makeup to make her look a lot older (which they didn't need to do, but her personality makes this work).This is when I have to break down the main problem; the other characters. Some of them like Charlie Day and Jenny Slate as an officer do well with the material given to them. I just found everyone else to be playing caricatures of roles they've played before. Sterling K. Brown is your typical criminal with a conscience, Sofia Boutella is the same assassin we saw her in Kingsmen, and Jeff Goldblum is just himself. Much of that would be fine if they did something new with their personalities, but it's just stuff their phoning through. As far as the story is concerned, the movie attempts to do two things; to have more of a character driven visit to the hospital and a standoff at the hospital that doesn't start until close to the third act. I'd rather they would have gone with the first one, as this was where we got to know everyone. Once the villains show up, it felt forced and as an excuse to have a bigger action piece. I can't say I was board, but I did feel like I had seen these kinds of stories before. I'll give this five high tech medical devices out of ten. It's a shame that for an idea this good, it ends up lost in a muddled story that can't decide what kind it wants to be; an action story, a criminal redemption, a social justice, a government commentary, or even exploitation. It'll probably do a lot better on home video, like on Netflix or Saturday afternoon television. Hotel Artemis has a nice look, but lacks to substance to keep itself within pace.",Hotel Artemis
55,bankofmarquis,Not as interesting as it wanted to be,6,10 February 2019,"On my airplane ride from Mpls to San Diego I was able to catch up with gritty, action-noir thriller BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE and was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. So, I was excited to see that another gritty,, action-noir film, HOTEL ARTEMIS was showing on the flight back.Well...HOTEL ARTEMIS is no EL ROYALE and maybe that's not fair to Artemis, for I was constantly comparing the two films, so let me see if I can separate the 2 and hold HOTEL ARTEMIS up to it's own scrutiny.Telling the tale of a JOHN WICK-type world where - instead of a safehouse Hotel for crooks, the HOTEL ARTEMIS is a safehouse HOSPITAL for crooks where the rules are that the crooks cannot hurt each other on the premises. When a riot breaks out in downtown Los Angeles, the rules go out the window and mayhem - and violence - ensue.Well...this film is no JOHN WICK either. Oh shoot, I've done it again. I've compared this film to another film.And that's the problem with HOTEL ARTEMIS, it treads ground that has been trod better - and with more style - before. So this film, no matter how well intention-ed, falls short in originality, style and substance. I was still entertained, but not as entertained as I was by JOHN WICK or EL ROYALE.Jodie Foster (in her first acting role since 2013's ELYSIUM) stars as the person who runs the Artemis. She has a mysterious background (of course) and runs the Artemis with an emotional-less efficiency. Her performance is quirky and interesting and almost holds the film together - almost. She is joined by Sterling K. Brown, Charlie Day, Brian Tyree Henry and Sofia Boutella as patients in the Hotel - none of which were interesting or unusual. They all were playing variants of the characters they usually play, almost as if Director/Writer Drew Pearce said ""Get my a Charlie Day-type and a Sterling K. Brown-type"", and the Casting Director thought they ""scored"" by getting the original person - each of whom looks like they are coasting through this film at about 70% output.Only Dave Bautista shines as the ""Health Care Professional"" who works with Foster. He brings an interesting charisma to his character and was almost the high point in the film.Almost. All of the performances pale in comparison to the Mob Boss who shows up about 2/3 of the way through the film. This character is talked about in reverential and scary terms throughout the film. The build-up was huge for this character and I was prepared for the inevitable let down when the mob boss finally shows up, but when the elevator door opens up and I saw that is was Jeff Goldblum in ""full Goldblum"" mode, I was thrilled and he did not disappoint. He commanded the screen at a time that the film was getting tiresome and he wound up the characters, the energy of the film and the action to help it ride to its inevitable, bloody conclusion.Ultimately, Pearce delivered a solid B- film, one that has moments of quirk and interest, but set against a backdrop - and supporting actors - that are subdued and not memorable. This is a cardinal sin for this kind of film, instead of subduing those parts, Pearce needed to enhance those and he just plainly did not.If you want to see a good, stylized, gritty action film, with interesting locales and supporting players, check out JOHN WICK or BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE. If you've seen these, HOTEL ARTEMIS is fine, but the other two do it better.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Hotel Artemis
56,joebloggscity,Jodie Foster reminds us just why she is such a special actress...,6,14 April 2019,"Away from the constant fair of comic book movies, we have this major diversion. A sci-fi dystopian LA, in the not so distant future to come, we have Jodie Foster playing an aging Nurse who is wokring in a 'dark room' which caters to treating & serving wealthy crooks who are injured.This 'Hotel' has a number of rules, and as you can guess, one day they just all get broken and all goes out the window. Killings, thefts and revenge etc to come.This film runs on two items: strong actors and some great cinematography. The settings are wonderful, grim and claustrophobic, but it's Jodie Foster with the always surprisingly good Dave Bautista who are the real heart of the film playing very well as you follow their story. Great emotion and pacing by them.The rest of the roster are very good, although seem to play it by numbers with for example Jeff Goldblum in particular playing, well, Jeff Goldblum again. The story is intriguing but maybe needed further fleshed out, filling in by adding action in which is fine but I wanted more.This film given more time and more attention could have created something greater, but it's still very good, better than some of the responses I've seen to it so far. Given time by viewers you will appreciate it, and it is worth it for the wonderful Jodie Foster alone.",Hotel Artemis

The fact that Jodie Foster was on the cast list meant I was happy to give it a shot.The film is set in Los Angeles in the near future. Although it's the near future there must have been a lot happening between now and then as it's not that familiar. The city is overrun by riots and Hotel Artemis is a safe haven hospital for criminals with no questions asked.Jodie Foster plays the Nurse who runs the hotel. The real downfall of this movie is that you really don't care about and have any empathy with any of the characters. It is devoid of emotion from start to finish. As a result the various events that unfold before you have no tension whatsoever. Jodie Foster looks as bemused about the role as I was. It is a completely soulless movie.

The main plot and sub plots had potential, but literally none of them paid off. The characters were underdeveloped and I never really cared what happened to them this movie felt like being dropped into the middle of a story. The story is not very well written and was not that fun. The cast is GREAT but its overly ambitious and a scatterbrained mess overall. Unfortunately, it sorta flies with broken wings in the end. So many plot holes they built it up so much then towards the end we never know what happens to some of the characters and it doesn't go out with a bang, well to say the least the beginning hype is was better then the end. Cool idea but bad execution to me. The reveal of Jodie Foster's backstory was so blah. The dialogue is too on the nose at times and lacks subtlety.

The décor is from the 1930's, though the medical technology is very futuristic.
 
The main plot revolves around a drought in California which causes serious rioting. Several sub-plots (including a foiled bank robbery) converge on the hotel. The nurse provides frantic treatment, but I'm afraid her backstory, told through frequent flash-backs wasn't very interesting. The scarce fight scenes are well choreographed, especially a fight scene towards the end involving the female Italian assassin character, resembled 'Atomic Blonde', the majority of the themes are a 'John Wick' rip-off.In summary, this film resembled several other films but not consistently delivered as well.",Hotel Artemis

I just felt the the movie went nowhere at the second half and some of the characters that were established so well just went nowhere.
The acting was good. Jodie Foster really shines on her screen come back as the Nurse who organizes the hotel /hospital. A quirky performance far away from all the glam. Sterling K. Brown also delivers a well performance and I always like to see charismatic Sofia Boutella and David Buastina. Jeff Goldblum is always a plus and he had a great wit in his perofmrnace here as well.. unfortunately the role was a little bit underused and wasted.

Jeff Goldblum though didn't measure up to the character he was portraying so that was a big miscast. Dave Bautista was basically a standin for The Rock who was probably filming another action movie. I'm spending so much effort discussing the cast because that's what you focus on with this film since the plot drags and then gets predictable. It was decent but could've been so much better. It gets a tepid ""5"".",Hotel Artemis
67,CANpatbuck3664,"Great Concept, Compelling Characters, Solid Screenwriting and Mixed Execution",8,9 June 2018,"The biggest star of Hotel Artemis is the central premise. The Nurse (Jodie Foster) and her orderly Everest (Dave Bautista) run an exclusive hospital for criminals. This leads to an interesting clientele including a bank robber named Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) and his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry), an assassin named Nice (Sofia Boutella) and an angry/arrogant arms dealer named Acapulco (Charlie Day). Taking place in the near future during large riots over water prices, the place is a fortress under the guise of being a hotel. I loved this idea even if its similar to the Continental in the John Wick franchise. These extreme and dangerous characters bouncing off each other was what made the movie fun. They're almost trapped together and each is used to being the alpha male/female so there's lots of tension. Each character is unique and has their own motivation and with the arrival of the Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum) imminent, this leads them into making dangerous decisions to escape what should be their sanctuary. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with all of these people even if I wouldn't want to be in the same room with them in real life. Hotel Artemis reminded me a lot of a 2016 movie named Free Fire, most of the characters are awful people trying to escape an unbelievable situation (Hotel Artemis is in the noir genre where Free Fire was more action oriented).I was surprised that Hotel Artemis wasn't set in modern day. The movie doesn't fit into the science fiction genre but there effectively use some fragments of it. The characters are stuck in the Artemis because of riots over water shortages, that's not impossible in the future if you've been following the news about the drought in California. They also automate a lot of the medical procedures and are using 3D printers to produce organs, this may not be available now but again, its not as far away as you think. There's a lot of creativity when it comes to finding out how this hospital would work and I appreciated the thought that went into it. Add in that the production design was great and you have an appropriately grimy movie with imagination and solid cinematography.If you love movies, I think you're going to see the names in this cast and be a little intrigued. You've got some TV stars in Sterling K. Brown, Charlie Day and Brian Tyree Henry and some memorable character actors from summer blockbusters in Dave Bautista, Jeff Goldblum, and Sofia Boutella. At the centre is Jodie Foster as Nurse and I was really impressed with the work she did here. I thought she vanished into the character and performed well in a very atypical role for her. I thought Sterling K. Brown was great, his performance was so good I was wondering how he hasn't become a leading man in film yet. Sofia Boutella is playing a role suited to her as Nice but she does it well. She also gets a decent action scene toward the end. Charlie Day is also good at playing a scumbag and while his character's arrogance was irritating and I got tired of him shouting all his lines, that was the intended effect. Dave Bautista continues to grow as an actor and he actually had a lot of chemistry with Jodie Foster. Jeff Goldblum was pretty solid in an all too brief appearance and Jenny Slate was fine despite her character being lacklustre.Getting to what I didn't like about Hotel Artemis, there are times I think the script for this really shines but there are points of more mixed execution. There are some really funny jokes but there are just as many times where the jokes or the dialogue falls flat. Hotel Artemis also has some characters that feel tacked on. I liked Jenny Slate's performance and I appreciated Zachary Quinto trying something different but their characters both could have been cut out of the plot. They also hype up the arrival of the Wolf King but his screen time is short and considering all the buildup, his arc fizzles instead of working like other parts of the Hotel Artemis plot.Hotel Artemis features a great premise, some interesting characters and committed performances. It falters at points, the trailers sold a bunch of action that is barely present and I didn't think Hotel Artemis fully delivered on the potential it had. But I still enjoyed Hotel Artemis way more than I didn't, I think it stands out from similar titles (namely John Wick) and the focus on the characters pays off. It's a fun noir romp with some sci-fi touches thrown in. If you think the trailers are interesting or looking for something more low-key to take a break from blockbuster season, I would definitely recommend this.",Hotel Artemis
68,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,20 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...This is one of the most original ideas I've seen for a film in a long time. It is a near-dystopian future in a Los Angeles overrun with rioters. The law is of very little help, forcing people to find safe havens. We are introduced to Hotel Artemis, run by The Nurse (Jodie Foster) who provides a secure place for criminals to receive medical attention for all levels of injury. In this story, we find several such criminals finding their way to the tightly run, rules enforced Hotel on the same night, some by accident, others by design. Even so, it's ""just another Wednesday"" for The Nurse - until her past comes back to haunt her - her very reason for being there.I know some reviewers didn't care for this movie, but I loved it. The pacing was excellent, keeping things moving nicely. There is never a dull moment as you follow through these different story lines until they begin to merge together in the end. I loved the camera work, the dark overtones, the variety of characters, but especially Jodie Foster, who turns in yet another awesome performance. And, I loved the Hotel itself. It kind of reminded me of the Continental Hotel from John Wick where you could go, but had to abide by the rules, no matter what. The same is true here.I liked the ending too ... without divulging anything, I felt it left it open wide enough for a possible sequel, if the filmmakers and studio feel so inclined. I would be agreeable to seeing one. This is a solid film all the way around. I personally would watch it again and recommend it. We need more originality like this.",Hotel Artemis

70,statuskuo,Gets Buried In Its Own Premise,4,8 June 2018,"Oh boy does this movie start strong. And the premise is brilliant, but it can't sustain itself, and in the end it felt like an anemic crawl to the finish line.The movie is of a hotel run by nurse who is haunted by her past, and drinks to alleviate emotional pain. Jodie Foster plays the unnamed nurse simply named The Nurse. The hotel is a cover for a patch-up place for high-level criminals. Imagine a hi-tech low-rent dump used for the recovery of the scummiest of the scums of the world. EXCEPT...they aren't really all that evil. Or haven't proven it (fail #1). Sterline Brown plays Waikiki, a lifer criminal who finds himself back at the hotel after a botched crime. There he reunites with a past flame Nice (like the French city) played by Sofia Boutella.Without getting into too much of these plot, because there isn't really much there...the script really doesn't do much with their backstory either, the true hero here is Jodie Foster. With her babbling non-descript colloquialisms, we learn she is the true heart of the place. The owner is a big time scary crime boss who just so happens to have been injured one night (fail #2). Also, though it doesn't have many characters, I was a little shocked how much mystery even the closest of relationships become throwaway characters. You leaning forward to get some glimpse of warmth where none is delivered. It's aggravating and frustrating and will turn many people off.Sadly, this story is CRUSHED by its style as well. The relationship of the hotel's security Everest (Dave Bautista) and her are the most touching. And this leaves you wanting more of their banter and closeness. But this movie wants to be tough and resists sentiment. Too bad. We saw this before in ""John Wick"" at their hotel. Whilst there's was closer to a true downtown Los Angeles sophisticate syndicate, the Hotel Artemis is fine being the run down Art Deco grim step-sister.
To me...this movie really needed to be a mini-series. It seemed like borrowed sets with borrowed bits and pieces of previous (better) movies. And in the end, you're left with no reason that it needed to be made.
In this instance...it does not live up to what it sets up. The stakes are set up as high but seem to be easily overcome. It's an odd movie.
If Jeff Goldblum is why you go see this movie, prepare to be disappointed. His presence, is grim and confusing. And he enters too late to fix the problems of a substance-less flick.

71,thekingsdom,Sadly Pretty Bland,5,17 November 2018,"This is one of those films where it could have been very good, but sadly weak dialogue and poor exposition scuppered the film. It looks like the writers took the idea from the hotel in the John Wick film and then tweaked it. They simply replaced the hotel for criminals with a private hospital for criminals. I do find it fascinating how there's such a fine line between a bland, average film and a great, exciting film. I'm no scriptwriter, but it does seem to come down to the dialogue and story exposition. In this film, everything (including the dialogue) just seemed so 'tick boxy'. i.e. character A says this so option B can then do this. And this is a shame. It has a good cast, and it's filmed well. At the end of the day, I guess the storyline is also a little bland too. Overall, it's an ok watch, and 5/10 does it for me.",Hotel Artemis
72,danielmanson,Mediocre,6,1 February 2021,"I think with this film I'm just massively underwhelmed by it all.
There are a lot of decent names in this so I thought I'd give it a whirl and don't get me wrong it's not a bad film. I was just left hugely underwhelmed by it all.So what's bad? Mostly it's the writing of it. The premise of this plot is good, but the writing is just all over the place. So a big concern for me is that the first 20 minutes or so it sets up these storylines and it's just forgotten about or just not needed. For example, they make a massive deal about stealing a pen. The film massively focuses on this and illustrates it to be a big part in the future and no joke, if this pen wasn't in the film there would be 0 difference. And unfortunately this is the case a few times, not just that one example.The ending is massively underwhelming as well. It feels like it ends about 15 minutes before it should. A lot of the characters have unanswered storylines and it leaves a lot of the plot open ended (which I hate). Because the plot itself, in my opinion, lacks substance, when it hits towards the end of the film you're left just a bit underwhelmed.On the whole though I'm content giving this a 6/10. It had enough action to entertain me and although I did mention lack of substance it did keep me somewhat interested. The acting is what it is, there's no performance that's stand out good or horrendous. Characters are likeable enough. But yeah, I feel like this had potential, but unfortunately ruined by the poor writing. It's watchable, but absolutely nothing more than that.",Hotel Artemis
73,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,No Rest for the Boring,2,11 June 2018,"Many have compared HOTEL ARTEMIS to JOHN WICK because of the hotel for criminals, which is just window-dressing here as this dingy palace actually serves as a hospital for injured, high-paying criminal club members, and the plot does sound intriguing but remains a benign foundation for a rushed action-caper just as the hotel itself harbors its crooked clientele...The hardly Noir-ambiguous good-bad people may as well wear endearing, audience-friendly halos, especially Jodie Foster as a boozy do-gooder nurse along with a really cool and mellow black thief who discovers he stole far too much from the wrong people ala CHARLEY VARRICK, combined with a superhuman Kung Fu chick taking down lethal henchman ala KILL BILL, while a broader homage is a complete ""out"" for the suspense: the movie takes place in a familiar dystopic near-future resembling ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK where a riotous mob is tearing up the city because a corporation stole their water i.e. CHINATOWN: All this a contrived attempt to instill a sense of urgency outside since there's little to none inside... For example, the Nurse's various ER rooms (named after idyllic holiday spots), during what are supposed to be edgy and intense surgeries to mend the badly wounded, are replete with miraculous, robotic, push-button machines that Dr. McCoy from STAR TREK would envy: Leaving an extremely old and haggard-looking, cliché-neurotic, overacting Foster to seem useless and alone even during unexpected peril - although she's never actually in real danger thanks to...Dave Bautista, obviously created to ""steal scenes"" as a tough but tender bodyguard named Everest (because he's big... like the mountain) while the bad-bad guys include smack-talking weapons-dealer Charlie Day (sounding like Joe Pesci imitating a knee-jerk's vision of Donald Trump) and Jeff Goldblum as a powerful crime lord needing emergency-emergency service but, whether these people live or die really doesn't matter all that much. The eventual twists, turns and revelations occur within a clunky, patched-together 92-minute run-time: seeming like glimpses of a season-long cable series that'd require time to grow beyond this dull, misguided, stagey mess that repeats itself over and over, again and again, and hardly even attempts to get off (or even on) the ground-floor.",Hotel Artemis

75,PyroSikTh,Fantastic Cast. Fantastic World-Building. Absolutely No Payoff,6,24 July 2018,"Hotel Artemis quite clearly wants to build on the success of John Wick, without being a carbon copy, and for that I commend it, and it was, to a degree, also successful. It's a slow, brooding affair, heaped to the brim with enthralling world building that teases you and has you wanting more. Set ten years in the future, LA is in utter chaos when clean water has been given a price, and the poor and downtrodden resort to riots and violence throughout the city. So bad have the riots become that helicopters are being shot out of the sky, and the efforts of the police forces are entirely in vain. Ultimately this means next to nothing to the actual movie other than keeping the cast of characters all concentrated into one place; Hotel Artemis.Hotel Artemis is a secret emergency room dedicated to serving criminal VIPs. No membership, no service. It's run by The Nurse, who is kept inside by her crippling agoraphobia and anxiety attacks after the untimely death of her son (a plot point that is slowly unveiled in sub-par flashbacks as the movie goes on). To help her is The Orderly, a massive brute of a man who obeys The Nurse unquestioningly, obviously holding a soft spot for her. Waikiki has come in with his brother Honolulu after a bank heist gone wrong leaves them both with bullet holes, and Honolulu needing a new, 3D-printed liver. Already there are Nice; an international assassin who records her kills for her employers personal pleasure via optical implants, and Acapulco; a brash, egotistical arms dealer lacking respect or awareness of those around him. As the movie goes on, we're also introduced to Mo; a cop injured in the riots who The Nurse knows personally, and the Wolf King; LA's criminal kingpin who rules the underworld with an unflinching iron fist, owns the Hotel Artemis, and holds a grand disappointment in his own son who seeks nothing more than his father's approval.The world, the setting, the characters, it's all so tantalising, and immediately draws you in and never lets go. The future setting opens up interesting technology without going full sci-fi, including 3D printing organic matter, various implants, kevlar-lined suits, and explosive jewellery. However, the film's biggest flaw in every regard is its squandered potential. It builds up a huge amount of tension and mystery, and then never really cashes it in. The apocalyptic riots outside are never concluded by the film's end. The pen Honolulu steals is made out to be the end of his fate, but is ultimately thrown away as a bargaining chip. Jenny Slate's character literally just appears to humanise the Nurse's character, and then bounces out, offering no lasting consequences on the movie at all despite allowing a cop inside being catastrophically against the rules. Charlie Day's arms dealer pretty much does nothing at all and frankly could've been excised entirely. Kenneth Choi's bank robber is thrown out early on and a big thing made of it, but he never appears or is mentioned again. Honolulu literally spends the entire movie on life support. The flashbacks to the death of the Nurse's son culminate in a super shocking reveal that surprises no-one, and once again means absolutely nothing to the story in the end anyway.Also be fair-warned, while the trailer depicts a high-octane action thriller in the likes of John Wick, full of realistic fight scenes, this is simply not the case. In fact in the whole movie we only really get one action scene. I mean it's a really good fight scene - Sofia Boutella beating up an endless wave of bad guys, but still taking hits and showing a struggle the longer it goes is something I could watch over and over - but it's literally the only one of any note. We get Dave Bautista's Orderly holding off a horde of antagonist henchmen, but the camera's so zoomed in to his face that you don't actually see any action at all, and the climatic face-off between Zachary Quinto's antagonist and Sterling K. Brown's Waikiki is over in a couple of minutes.Hotel Artemis is a truly mixed bag. It has a fantastic foundation that I would love to see built on in an unlikely sequel, but it squanders every single droplet of potential it has. Characters, settings, and events come and go and ultimately mean absolutely nothing at all to the grander story, there's a lot of fantastic acting work from Jodie Foster, Jeff Goldblum, and Dave Bautista, each of them drawing you into their characters lives, but each of them are underutilised, as are everyone else from the front-and-centre Sterling K. Brown, bed-bound Brian Tyree Henry (Paperboi), pointless Jenny Slate, action scene fodder Sofia Boutella, comedic asshole Charlie Day, and manchild Zachary Quinto. All great, all given a pathetic amount to actually do with it. Hotel Artemis had all the right ingredients, but it mixed them up haphazardly leaving lumps, and then didn't get left in the oven long enough. I give it an entertaining yet slightly disappointing 6/10.",Hotel Artemis

It goes right to the chase: Short intro, good action opening and then to the main location and character.In the near future (2028), Los Angeles is under heavy riots as a private company limits the water supply to the population. Several ""high profile"" criminals are taking shelter in a private hotel/hospital which specialized in this sort of service and is managed for over 20 years by a nurse (Judy Foster in good makeup) who keeps strict rules.The movie starts really well (6.5/10) but loses momentum in the second act (5.5/10) and finishes in an anti-climax (5/10). With the exception of the plot, which doesn't hold this movie very well, all the other elements work great here: Good atmosphere, good pacing, good direction, good cinematography, good score, good acting and interesting characters.This is like the little brother of SMOKIN' ACES (2006). I also got some vibes from THE SHINING (1980) and PANIC ROOM (2002).Pretty good job for first time director Drew Pearce, who also wrote the script.All in all, this is a pretty good movie.

83,Okonh0wp,A sci-fi film that's stayed with me,9,7 August 2020,"For a two-hour sci-fi film, it's a mistake to expect an entirely planned out universe. What I generally expect is a story wrapped in visual and narrative details that gives a taste of a fascinating world if you went further. That world-building is what Hotel Artemis hooked me on. I wanted to watch a spin-off TV series or more movies of this brand of dystopia because all the little details hinted at an interesting story.The story takes place in a Los Angeles that's full of class-based riots in ways that seem to resonate with the time that I'm writing this review in August of 2020 but it could be applicable to many chapters of our recent past and perhaps our recent future. It's no coincidence as the director set the film in a near indefinite future that touches on our class conflicts, our growing scarcity in resources, our amassing of power into the hands of corporations and more.The story involves a series of guests who are all criminals using a high-end hospital one night to heal their wounds. The hospital is members-only and caters exclusively to criminals. Reminiscent of ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Rules of the Game"" there are a number of disparate threads that tie together on this single night: A bank robber (Sterling K Brown) is asked to ponder the life he could have taken if he didn't feel responsible for his wreckless brother, the nurse (Jodie Foster) confronts her agoraphobia and a childhood memory), a jerk of an arms dealer (Charlie Day) gets his moral reckoning, the son of a criminal kingpin (Zachary Quinto) tries to get his father's affection through offering protection for him.The film has an edge that shows it's steeped in film history (some might say it's a little too ripped off from films like John Wick or Reservoir Dogs) and it might be trying too hard to be cool, but it's a rich story.",Hotel Artemis

Bad people with good intentions and just plain bad people.Surprisingly little action but moved along well. The long fight near the end with the female assassin was well done but everything else somewhat conventional.An interesting take by Jodie Foster as the Nurse. But you can't go wrong with her. Kind of vague inconsistency in her character with helping criminals. Not even an attempt to rationalize or explain away. We just have to accept she is a good person.The rest of the cast good actors, even Dave Bautista, but were given relatively little to work with.The direction was conventional and uninspiring. Very basic and acceptable staging. Good elements in the writing but nothing not seen before in other forms. Conceivably it could have been expanded to tell us more about the characters but would dramatically slow down the pace.The peril of the one night was exacerbated with too many coincidences and arrivals.

Brown, Sofia Boutella, Charlie Day, Zachary Quinto, Jeff Goldblum, Brian Tyree Henry, Jenny Slate et al.The recent months have seen quite a steady flow of movies that could be described being futuristic, high-concept, and action-centric if not terribly action-filled - such as ""Ready Player One"", ""Anon"", ""Terminal"", and now ""Hotel Artemis"".All of the four attract because of how cool and slick they look, and all four turn out to be, above all, exercise in style - which makes them kind of shallow.""Hotel Artemis"" doesn't deviate from this in either good or bad way. There's no point writing about it in length, one just gotta see the intriguing underworld of high-class criminals and the hospital that becomes the clashing ground for many of them, with all the witty dialogue, shadowy but intriguing characters lurking around, and delicious mix of futuristic and something more fitting for 1930's.I am bad at describing the visual style with mere words. The most immediate comparision that came to mind: witnessing the original ""Blade Runner"" from the street level, with some lovely art deco style of the first ""BioShock"" (the videogame).It's a world where most everybody is dangerous, or at least has very useful skills to get around, so there is always some suspense about who gets to live and who dies. Nobody has markedly more screen time than others, so it's also kind of hard to guess too.Special shout-out should go to the person who chose the principal cast. For example, movie fan can't help but be a little warmed about the idea of Jodie Foster returning to big screen after five years (just her second role in seven years).There's also Dave Bautista, everybody's favorite hulk of man, or the new thinking man's action hero who has recently found more intriguing roles than Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson combined. Yes, the roles are often small but still.Also, I very much enjoyed the transformation of Charlie Day to slick-talking backstabbing criminal. It's not often that a star comedian offers something so different from one's usual schtick.So, ""Hotel Artemis"" is cool if shallow. It'd be hard to fault a summer movie based on that, so let's give a recommendation instead.It's breezy and fun, and knows when to end before becoming too repetitive or otherwise tiring.",Hotel Artemis
88,WalkdenEntertainment,"Nice Hotel, but you may want to check out early...",5,16 November 2018,"Set in the future in Los Angeles, the city is now being plagued by riots. No one is safe! Hotel Artemis is a top secret hospital for criminals who pay a high price in advance should they ever need the service as a matter of urgency (getting shot, stabbed etc). This hospital is run by a woman known as The Nurse (Jodie Foster). Over the course of one night, we will be introduced to the dark world of this hotel and a few of the criminals who seek help.Firstly it's so good to Jodie Foster in a new film! I feel like it's been some time since we have seen this actress in a film. This is a very dark and gritty film and I personally enjoyed that Jodie played the role not of a villain, but someone who cares for criminals instead. The film also delivers a unique back story for her character as to how she became the manager of such a bizarre place. But! like a criminal in her hotel... she too has other secrets of her own.The film is also loaded with many actors, some of which include Dave Bautista, Charlie Day, Sofia Boutella and Jeff Goldblum (yes you read it correctly- Jeff Goldblum is in this film). For the sake of spoilers I will not discuss all the characters and their roles in this film...Hotel Artemis is fairly basic in regards to its story structure and plot. If I'm honest, there were many moments where I felt that I was watching a pretty decent looking film and then there were other moments where the appearance and acting make it feel more like a B Grade film instead.Some characters will do some of the most corny, over the top, one liners and enjoy spending time complaining or threatening. Each character thankfully does have a purpose and their own story which keeps us guessing as to how it will end up.Along the way we are given more thrills, thanks to the mystery of our leading lady, The Nurse. The film enjoys putting most of the film's thriller elements into this character and her back story. During the film, there were moments where I felt it just didn't quite pay off though.Overall, this is a gritty and dark film. It's great to see the wonderful Jodie Foster on screen as she take on a very unique role while working with other big actors (such as Jeff Goldblum). The film presents some ideas creatively, but some of the film's thriller elements don't provide the result that I felt we should have got, considering how much time is spent on selected characters. Some characters dialogue can also be a little too much for this film.5.5/10

89,Darkjak007,Hotel Average,6,11 April 2021,"Jodie Foster play a woman simply known as the nurse who runs hotel Artemis an underworld sanctuary that offers medical assistance to criminals. Two brothers contact her after a failed bank heist take up residence in the hotel. Waikiki(sterling K Brown) suffers only minor injury while his brother Honolulu(Brian Tyree Henry) Requires life support. Among the other residents in this establishment is an Arms dealer named Acapulco(Charlie day) and an assassin named Nice(Sofia Boutella). The setting of this film doesn't really offer anything special it takes place in Los Angeles in 2028 however overall that really serves no purpose whatsoever it doesn't look any different it doesn't look futuristic at all. The only thing that looks somewhat futuristic are the cops uniforms and the medical treatments . There's also a series of riots that are happening in the city about water Privatization it's another reason why many of the residents of this hotel remain here.it's barely factored into the movie that you don't really care about it until they mention it. The overall fact they just remain in the hotel the whole movie. Acapulco's just an Jerk not even a likable Jerk he's just an Jerk. And nice she's here to kill somebody you don't know who ,she takes so long to act on it that that she doesn't do anything until then. The film might try to advertise Waikiki as the lead but they're not the real star is The nurse you know more about her than anybody else in the building. You find out that she lost her son and suffers from extreme anxiety to the point that she hasn't left the hotel in three year. She just stays here and make sure everyone obeys the rules until a cop shows up and she breaks the rules for reasons. Outside of the residents are only other person to talk to is her orderly Everest(Dave Batista) he does a good job he's a funny guy and he has quite a few action scenes. Really him and Jody are the highlights of this movie, both of them are what keep you invested. There's also a crime boss known as the wolf king(Jeff Goldblum) it's revealed that Honolulu stole this portable pin vault that has diamonds in it and these diamonds belong to the wolf king. Both the brothers and nurse makes such a big deal about this character. It's too much overhype It take so long for him to actually show up then when he finally does show up you're you don't really know whether you should laugh or what I mean this is still Jeff Goldblum were talking about that exactly an opposing guy but it almost feels like that's intentional. He's on screen He's good he's not great.if you're a fan you're expecting to see him in this movie a lot he will be disappointed. However the idea of a front for criminals to hide is an interesting concept.

As usual, bad writing comes first, then bad directing. Being already too short (cca. 93 minutes), this movie spends last nine or ten minutes on end credits. C'mon, really? Other wrong things: too many scenes start but never end, one part is a direct ripoff from Serenity, characters are not developed as they should be and so on.

Life on the outside is full of chaos and violence with protesters all over and there is no order anywhere. Very dangerous to be outside. That is the main reason The Nurse refuses to go outside. This is NOT recommended mostly because too many scenes are in the dark, we really don't know the characters and there are too many to keep track of as we should (except for the Nurse and Jeff Goldblum as Niagara and he comes in late). Jodi Foster as the Nurse talks so fast it is hard to hear her clearly. It's as if she is on a ultra high caffeine high and never comes down from it. Not good. Also pacing is way too fast. We have no idea where all this is going. Also the code names given are only mentioned maybe once and after that we forgot who was what code. Not good. Well, rules are broken. There is a murder and we know that Nice (Sofia Boutella) is there to kill someone, but we don't know who.

95,Bertaut,"Aesthetically pleasing, but the narrative is predictable and clichéd",5,30 July 2018,"Hotel Artemis is a film which doesn't do a great deal wrong. However, it is also a film which doesn't do a great deal right. It just kind of hangs in mid-air, with clichéd characters acting in clichéd ways and having clichéd conversations. And then it ends. It's not actually about anything. It's also predictable, with precious little substance. It looks pretty though.In 2028, riots are tearing Los Angeles apart. The film takes place primarily in the eponymous Hotel Artemis, a secret hospital for criminals in the heart of the city. The motley crew of characters, many of whom are known only by the name of the room in which they're staying, include Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) and his brother Honolulu (Brian Tyree Henry), bank robbers who have been involved in a shootout with police; Nice (Sofia Boutella), an assassin who ""only kills important people"", and just so happens to be Waikiki's ex-girlfriend; and Acapulco (a spectacularly miscast Charlie Day), a weapons dealer and all round weasel. Also present are The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum), Los Angeles's most feared gangster, who also finances the hospital; his incompetent son, Crosby (an underutilised Zachary Quinto); and Morgan (Jenny Slate), a cop injured in the riots. The hospital is run by ""Nurse"" (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic alcoholic haunted by visions of her past, with porter duties handled by Everest (Dave Bautista). The hospital functions because all guests must adhere to a rigid set of rules (the first of which is ""don't kill the other patients"") and a strict no weapons policy.Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? It's not. The dialogue is awful, the narrative beats can be seen coming a mile away, and the characters are all architypes, with only Nurse really fleshed out to any degree. There's the loud-mouth snivelling weapons dealer, the gorgeous but oh-so-deadly assassin, the criminal kingpin and his screw-up son who just wants to be like dad, the skilled bank robber who spends most of his time trying to get himself out of the trouble caused by his unreliable brother, and the tough-as-old-boots medical professional who just wants to help people when in actual fact, she's beyond help herself. The premise may be reasonably interesting, but, in his debut feature, writer/director Drew Pearce undermines it by populating the milieu with cardboard cut-outs instead of characters. True, most of the actors give it their all (Bautista in particular gives a performance far superior to the material with which he has to work), but there's just no substance here, no depth. There are simply too many clichés at every level to be able to overlook them.Yes, it's an original(ish) idea made with a small(ish) budget, which is exactly what we need more of these days, when every second film is a CGI-infested remake, comic book adaptation, or sequel (or a CGI-infested remake of a sequel to a comic book adaptation). However, an original idea is all very well and good, but it can only take you so far; the execution has to be there as well, and this is where Hotel Artemis falls down. It's simply not an especially well-made film. Pearce does a reasonably good job with the directorial side of things, as aesthetically, the hotel is really intriguing, with a nice use of primary colours and a well-conceived juxtaposition of modern technology and 3D printers with retro décor and secret passages. In terms of plot, however, there's just nothing to latch onto or get your teeth into. None of the characters really do or say anything very interesting, and a half-hour into the film, as it became increasingly apparent that none of them were going to be developed to any great degree, I just stopped caring.",Hotel Artemis

This movie is STUPID. So many actors together and they produced a total garbage.
First of all, it has no plot. Criminals enter a hospital-hotel named Artemis which is for members only. And the only person in that hospital-hotel is an old lady (Jodie Foster) . No one else, no other staff. Just a nurse who can't even go outside that door. OK I forgot about the guy from the guardians of the galaxy
A man comes with his brother who is shot. At the end his brother dies and he does not even feel bad about it. He feels free.Accidentally his brother stole a pen containing diamonds and when a gangster comes to the hotel because he is shot, he things that the gangster comes for him because of the diamonds but no one even cares about the diamonds.
There is also a psychotic sadistic killer played by sofia boutela. I mean enough with her, how does she even get roles? She has no idea about acting plus she plays always the role of psycho femme fatale ( the mummy included).
Anyway , the gangster knows the old lady a long way, he was the one who made her a hotel-hospital manager after he found her grieving for the loss of her son. Afterwards he confesses that he actually killed her son. And that he needed her to be in the hotel artemis because she did not have anything left in her life. WHY??? He is a billionaire gangster. He could hire tons of nurses for his hotel. Why just an old lady?
Anyway after the gangster confesses, jodie foster does not have the chance to kill him because a patient is dying and she leaves. Then the sadistic psycho boutella goes inside and kills him. That's right , not even safety doors. Nothing.
After that, the gangster's gang become suspicious and they want to enter. Then the guardian of the galaxy who is calm all the time, enters beast mode and slaughters people with an axe. And he chooses to stay along with psycho boutella , and they are in danger of getting killed WITHOUT ANY REASON. Jodie foster and the black man who lost his brother leave the hotel very easily and they are out , whilst the other two who chose to stay fight for their lives.

Unfortunately, the water riot would have been the better, more entertaining choice to film, and could have been a statement of some type about how we are all doomed due to overpopulation and human hubris.Instead, we have a short heist leading to a long paean about the importance of protecting your family from the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns.

Emphasis on ""should"". Ever since I saw the first trailer for Hotel Artemis, I've been really looking forward to it. It has a stacked cast, including Sterling K. Brown, Jodie Foster, Dave Bautista, Sofia Boutella, Charlie Day, and Jeff Goldblum. They are all really good actors, and to have them all together sounded great. The film focuses on a hotel for criminals, run by Foster's character. The plot does sound heavily influenced by John Wick, but never for a second did I think it was actually ripping off John Wick; I thought it would be inspired by it, and that writer/director Drew Pearce could offer up a really cool film. Well, I was wrong. I was dead wrong. Hotel Artemis is a snooze-fest. The performances range from merely fine to cringe-worthy. The action (when there is any) is basic and typical. The story is not compelling, and neither are the characters. Hotel Artemis, while the technical side of things are well done, just doesn't have anything interesting about it, and it's a movie you will instantly forget about as soon as you leave the theater...",Hotel Artemis
106,Caleb_Everett,Getting an early check-out,6,14 January 2019,"The Hotel Artemis is an entertaining film and it's real only shortcoming is the fact that is moves through the paces so quickly. The most interesting characters (Sterling Brown & Jeff Goldblum) get overshadowed by Jodie Foster's (Nurse). Jodie Foster does an exceptional job, as is to be expected, but I would have loved to see more about the Wolf King and some of the guests of Hotel Artemis. Overall, it has some great action moments and the story is definitely interesting so I would watch it again.",Hotel Artemis
107,fraser-simons,Breaking The Rules,8,29 November 2018,"In a near future Los Angeles there stands the Hotel Artemis, a sanctuary for criminals with a full-service nurse-for members only, of course. When riots break out during a heist that goes unexpectedly wrong for a group of crooks packing futuristic tech, they make their way to the Artemis. To Sanctuary... or so they think.What follows is a powder keg situation. As the nurse (Jodie Foster) and her fellow company employee of the hotel, Everest (Dave Bautista), a kind of enforcer for the rules of the hotel, take in various people in these misfits in need of help; it becomes clear that everyone has their own agendas to further within the hotel. Some seem pointed at other guests, despite the anonymity provided by the hotel (guests are only called the name of the suite they are staying in).
Waikiki has a brother and partner in the heist gone wrong and needs medical help. But the pair shortly discovers that what they stole puts them in mortal danger at the hotel. Nice (Sofia Boutella) is an assassin who only kills important people, Acapulco (Charlie Day) is an asshole gun runner.At first, it feels like maybe Hotel Artemis is just another action flick set in a futuristic, John Wick hotel of assassins. But as the film progresses it becomes clear that surrounding the action there is a larger narrative taking place and, kind of an obsession, with ""the rules"".It becomes clear that all of the characters have these internalized rules. Whether imposed by the world or their sub-culture; or in the case of the nurse and Everest, the rules are a boot on their respective neck. Originally, the rules seem to be in place to keep them safe. At least, it's a fair assumption based on how each of them recites the Artemis rules like a mantra, especially the nurse. Believing that if a rule is broken the whole place would fall apart. But really, they are the thing they clutch onto in order to maintain their sanity in a world breaking apart; just as the world around them is devolving and splitting apart because of a riot fueled, at least initially, by protestors, so too are the characters being stripped bare.The primary throughline of the movie and, incidentally, why I think it's cyberpunk; is the tearing down of these rules and how important they are to the story. Sometimes it's to do the right things despite immediate and deadly consequences. Other times it's to contribute to the ties that bound them in the first place. Societal structures are being ripped down everywhere you look outside of the Artemis but inside it's a much more human and grounded struggle reflective of the larger one.The most surprising thing about the movie is the nurse's story, which gradually unfolds as visitors arrive and reveal more of her past. While not a movie that is particularly intelligent, it does break from the expected formula and roots it in an emotional place that becomes a lens for the other guests to view their own lives and perspectives, as it becomes clear that lives they know will be radically changed. There comes a moment for all of them to choose to follow the rules or not. And the choices form the most interesting aspects of the story.Hotel Artemis is a gorgeous movie with a great cast, awesome technology, effects, and does more work than a simple action flick it initially appears to be. I ended up enjoying it a lot more than I'd expected. It's strange that this movie flew under the radar and is very hard to get (at least in Canada).",Hotel Artemis
108,mandagrammy,"Okay film, but not as good as expected.",5,9 July 2019,"This sounds like a very interesting plot, but there were a lot of holes that needed filling in. Why in only 9 years is there so much anger and rioting (apparently over water) happening in such a large city like Los Angeles? Is it that way all over America? And what exactly was the purpose of that whole opening scene exactly? The biggest issue I saw was in the Hotel itself. It looked like there were a lot of rooms and yet the entire time we only saw 5 guests although it was made clear that the last guest entering filled up the hotel. Why did not one other guest show up during so much action happening? And how could only one nurse and her assistant take care of everything needed by the hotel and its guests? What I'm saying is that this movie demands you suspend disbelief a bit too much. And yet I did find some of the acting, especially Jodie Foster, to be quite good.

117,Eclectic-Boogaloo,It's okay. It could've been much better,5,13 June 2018,"The long and the short of it: The best part of Hotel Artemis is the concept. It's a decent crime thriller that's too heavy on drama and too light on action, comedy, and intrigue. It also takes way too long to get into the thick of the plot. It's slow. A ninety minute movie that feels like two-hours. And even after the movie gets to ""the good stuff"" it still gets bogged down by numerous character moments that ultimately proved little (or meant little). Writer/Director Drew Pierces' insistence on giving so many characters development undercut what proved to be the main plot-line of the movie. It needed a thoroughly executed main focus. OR just to be really funny. Or have amazing action. Or have lots of twists and turns. This movie was merely okay across all those fronts.On a positive note, i'll say that Sofia Boutella and Dave Batista were both terrific. The characters. The performances.

She did something similar in 2013's ELYSIUM, and I cannot understand why someone of her immense talents, who has been excellent for decades, would need to alter her characters this way.Other reviews can better describe the plot and the things that worked and what didn't, but I got stuck on this aspect of the movie.",Hotel Artemis

Jenny and Charlie really did nothing to drive the story forward and could have been removed all together. The story really rests on Sterling shoulders, but he has no support and his character is poorly written. Jodi isn't believable in her role, wasting again, another talent. Dave is good, but again, he needed more support from Jodi, which he didn't get. I gave this title 5 out of 10, but that is generous. The set design was also poor, most like a result of a low budget. I felt like I was watching a play. Nothing about what I saw felt like a hotel.

Personally, I'd prefer Jodie Foster's Nurse to that *censored* from Billboards.Of course, Hotel Artemis doesn't have anything on John Wick, the elaborate criminal society there has spread beyond the movie. Still, if you are into that kind of thing - the fancy, yet human criminals, the organizations, rules and practices, then Hotel Artemis is still a decent watch.I rate movies based on the cringe and the coherence, so even if there is little budget and action, a movie is not a trailer. And this isn't a trailer, it's a short flavor story. It doesn't get higher than 6, because it... could've had some more story coverage. If they had removed that weapons dealer that brought nothing to the screentime but only served as a reason for the main characters to reminisce, maybe cut down on all the rioting, and instead added more backstory, more Wolf King details, more pressure/importance of the Pen - it would be a more satisfying and coherent movie.But alas, at least it's not cringy. To me. I'd love to see the sequel, we need more evening pastime gems like this, but... looks like it flopped, another victim of insufficient marketing.

The film starts with a pair of brothers robbing a bank and getting injured. They looked doomed until they go to the ""Hotel Artemis"", a strange hotel that heals criminals. Here we meet a nurse (the fantastic Jodie Foster) and a cast of characters. This feels like John Wick meets Murder on the Orient Express. Unfortunately, the hotel and the nurse are not very flushed out, leaving us wanting more. The characters also seem to be holding back - as though this was a sequel to a film no one has ever seen. We don't understand their connections or reactions to each other - as though we missed an important part while we were at the bathroom. When the action happens, it is solid, but not climactic. It leaves us expecting another 10 minutes of movie that never comes. Rarely would I say this, but this film could you a bit more action, and a build to a more satisfying climax.

You wouldn't miss much if you were on a smartphone for a minute or two.The inclusion of big names is failed by a slow, shrug of a shoulder ending. Some of the plotting is weak too. Characters would not react the way they do to certain events that happen (events which to them are life changing). As an example, there is no real sense of loss, rage or grieving shown by the characters to certain things that they find out or happens to them.You wouldn't care if it was fast paced but it isn't.You'ld watch it for the recognisable faces but ultimately it would be more worth your time to watch a more enjoyable recent futuristic B movie outing such as....well....UPGRADE..which is nothing like this btw :-)",Hotel Artemis

Jodie Foster was fantastic. So much so, in fact, that I wondered whether she actually moves like she did in the film, in real life. Sofia Boutella is just gorgeous, and I really liked that her action scenes were fantastically choreographed, without being over the top (say, as the scenes with Theron in Atomic Blonde which were just a little much). Sterling K. Brown brought a depth of character I had not seen before from him, and Jeff Goldblum ... well, is there really any role he's played where he's not a favorite? As for the premise? Why NOT? In most 'futuristic' movies one must stretch to suspend belief in order to be carried into it.

Then Waikiki and Nurse escape by killing Zachary Quinto (who was now the head of a large organisation after his father (Niagra) was killed)I thought it was about to go from a good film to a great film, but instead it ended with Waikiki driving away and Nurse dissapearing into the war zone, I thought to myself ""Is this it?"" as it felt like the film was over before it begun.

Jodie Foster, for me, was the highlight of this movie and the only reason it got 5 stars. She still has it! However, my biggest question is why she agreed to do this movie that had more plot holes than roads these days. It started out with a possible good story - it is 2026 and it is New York City with uncontrolled rioting. We never learn what is causing all of this, but we can surmise that criminals run the city in 2026 (so different from today!). Ms. Foster plays a sad woman with many anxiety disorders who runs an extremely secure hotel/hospital for the worst criminals. Up until there, I was ""getting"" it. But it quickly went off the rails as more characters got involved. There was very little cohesion in the whole plot. What could have been another Blade Runner turns into a chaotic mess. And the longer the movie went on, the messier it got. Foster kept referring to herself as an ""old lady."" I think she is in her mid 50s now, far from an old lady - only one of many plot parts that seemed really off to me. The actors were actually what kept me watching this crazy movie. They were all amazing. But the story had no cohesion, it just didn't flow. I blame the director. I am not sure what his vision was, but I can think of many ways to have made this movie far better and I am not in the movies (I just watch a lot of them).

144,ryanbartlett-870-746486,"An under the radar, high budget thriller that reaped rewards",8,11 June 2018,"Due to the very little marketing that Hotel Artemis has put out, you don't really know what this film was going to be, you just knew that they had some great actors of both old and new. A film that pulled Jodie Foster back into the spotlight and paired her with the recent super success of Sterling K. Brown. They both brought their stuff and embodied these very rule-driven characters.
Hotel Artemis puts together a group of people who by nature are the same because they are criminals, but as people they are all unique with their own agendas and their own guidelines. Each criminal had their own code that they lived by, and Hotel Artemis asked the question of what happens when you put so many different codes into a chaotic situation. Who breaks their code first? And what happens if everyone follows through with their own personal agendas? Lots of questions that brought a unique twist of criminals. 
When everyone is innately a ""criminal"" and not a good character, what makes the difference between the ""good"" people and the ""bad"" people.
The cast also delivered. Each character was perfectly casted for their role, with Dave Bautista being the muscle man we know him to be, Sterling k. Brown the hardship-stricken family man, and Zachary Quinto as an naive ""tough"" guy. The only one who was probably not the best choice was Charlie Day, who just isn't believable as a tough, evil villain. He is too much of a clown to be taken very seriously. The true masterpiece was Jodie Foster who became a nervous wreck, loving nurse who lived by strong values but broke them every once and a while. 
It's a shame that people aren't flocking to see this movie, but it will definitely be a movie to be revisited for not just the sheer magnitude of the cast, but also by the unique perspective and thrilling story line.",Hotel Artemis

The fact that Hollywood have now reached the stage where they are financing this drivel regularly makes me fear for the whole industry and the ""dumbing down"" of humanity.Even the soundtrack, as good as it was, classic black-woman soul which was totally what you expect to give the character (Jodi's nurse) some sort of melancholy, which was the only layer of a very thin onion of her one dimensional character. Other than that every other character was absolutely one dimensional and seen in a thousand films before; you have the good guy at heart bank robber, his not so smart brother that ropes him ""back in"", the old woman that is long in the tooth seen it all before, the giant muscle guy that is loyal but not smart, the whiny rich guy who always gets his own way (obviously deserves to die just for being mouthy), the dumb Oedipus son trying to please his dad who knows hes dumb, the rich (father) megalomaniac who rules the city...OMG the list goes on but ultimately concludes with the Russian femme Nikita assassin...typing this list of characters is giving me nausea! and an endless supply of dumb henchmen who seem to get killed for merely being henchmen, even though the people killing them are meant to be the people you ingratiate with. And, of course their interactions with each other are playing into that personality in every sense of the word. 
You neither like nor hate any of the characters, they all coma and go at a whim, oh, speaking of which there was wedged in some ""cop"" that carried the story nowhere, had no purpose, revealed no bigger story that for some reason despite being a 20+ storey hotel, had to be hidden from the guests (all three of them) by wheeling her between rooms before she wanders off...was she the girlfriend of the writer or something and promised a part? did she will it in a Facebook competition? what, why? never mind, I've wasted too much thought on this film already.This film could not get more predictable, cliche and opiatic for the mindless zombies who will give this anything more. don't waste your time...you will, because, the trailer makes it look great, I couldn't wait... take my work...nothing to see here!",Hotel Artemis

151,TYContact1,"Great cast, could've been cooler with a franchise budget",7,17 June 2018,"This movie's screen play is written by the Iron Man 3 screenwriter, Drew Pearce. I can see flashes of humour sprinkled throughout, and it could've been extended into a franchise with the engaging characters and interesting premise. 
But: the build up to kick-ass action was too long, probably due to a tight budget. Some diaglogues were repetitive, and some scenes changed abruptly; seems like the production and editing was done in a rush. There were a few tender moments for characters to shine, but at 1.5 hours, there wasn't enough time to develop characters + eye popping action. Characters were given too much to talk, and too little to do.It's a vicious cycle: the less they invest in original titles (albeit the dark humour criminal underworld genre is not original), the less unique titles will be offered in the theatres, and audience will be further driven to stay home for original content TV series with high production values...some movies don't need big names or 3D.

A very simple story of criminals feeding off one another in a confined space. Premise is fun and interesting, acting is decent, visually it is an impressive set - that being said, the plot itself was underdeveloped with hints of deeper stories hiding around every corner but never elaborated - this leaves viewers with a lack of closure, hence some of the negative reviews.This is a film that you must read deep between the lines to gather motivations for characters and fill in the blanks where you can; however, if the blanks were filled in incorrectly you may find yourself with different character development and have a completely different experience from the next viewer.The writing is a bit hackneyed, characters doing what you would expect with predictability, normality and cliche.

Fans of 2012's Dredd and the John Wick movies know just what to expect here. Style and flair bleed out of the sci-fi/art deco walls of the Artemis, and each character, with their lines full of charming and witty dialogue, is played to perfectly meet the respective actors' personal strengths: Dave Bautista as the soft-spoken powerhouse, Charlie Day as the loudmouthed oaf, Sofia Boutella as the graceful assassin.

159,GoldenBlunderbuss,A great premise with a lacklustre script - next time they'll nail it,7,25 July 2018,"A nurse runs a secret hospital for criminals in a futuristic Los Angeles, but then some clients show up with something they've stolen from the city's most deadly crime boss.
 Hotel Artemis pictures a near-future dystopian Los Angeles where the water supply has been privatised and is too expensive for many to pay, leading to a city-wide riot and strict curfews. Criminals can pay a premium rate to become members of a secret hospital hidden on the top floor of a downtown hotel where their wounds can be treated in one of a number of refurbished bedroom-come-operating theatres.Two bank robbers find themselves in the Artemis after a botched job results in multiple gunshot wounds but a set of diamonds they stole happen to belong to the city's biggest crime boss, The Wolf King. The existing residents/ patients (including Charlie Day as an overconfident arms dealer and Sofia Boutella as a gymnastic assassin) have differences of their own to settle and anterior motives to enact alongside the frantic attempts of the nurse to keep people alive. It's an amazing set-up that should've given so much more than was delivered by the script, which does build on this intriguing premise but with little besides unsubstantial one-on-one conflicts.The cast is a mish-mash of names that you wouldn't expect to have any chemistry but an aged-up Jodie Foster is truly amazing as a caring stick-to-the-rules medical expert in a world totally devoid of anything she holds dear. Her scenes with her monolithic orderly played by Dave Bautista fizz with snappy dialogue, but its' Jeff Goldblum basically playing Jeff Goldblum that steals the show with barely 30 minutes to go.Everything written above makes it so much more sad that the ending really lets this film down - in fact, there's actually no real ending to talk about. The situation in the titular hotel builds to a climax we never actually see, a handful of characters' stories just end with so many loose ends they form their own tripping hazard (I still can't figure out what happened to Day's dealer), and it steps off for a sequel but in no decisive direction. If this heavily hinted sequel follows Foster's acrophobic, alcohol-chugging, anxiety-crippled nurse then that isn't such a bad thing.",Hotel Artemis

176,ryan-44110,"Ignore the positive reviews, this movie is as boring and poorly done as it's made out to be",4,29 September 2018,"Firstly, there are some spoilers ahead, so I've marked it to indicate such. You read at your own risk. This movie, for all intents and purposes is dull, boring, poorly written, and terribly executed. Directed by Drew Pearce, who brought us such gems as Iron-Man 3, and that Mission Impossible: Rebel Whatever... it's already destined to be a snooze button. So... let's dig in then. From what I gather, Hotel Artemis is a safe haven... or at least the top floor penthouses are, for rich career-criminals which come in all flavors. Mobs, bank robbers, assassins, and arms dealers. This hi-jinks hotel is run by a beaten up, slow paced, Jodi Foster doing her best impression of Michael J. Fox. Literally, she rambles, shakes, shivers, has blanked out flash backs of her dirtbag son, and washes it down with alcohol and pain killers... somehow managing to handle intense situations like triage, and life/death medical care. Her character is bleak, nearly pointless, and you feel no sorrow, or emotional attachment for her and her PTSD which is the product of a poor decision her son made as an angsty teen, I imagine... but we're never sure SINCE THERE'S HARDLY ANY BACKSTORY TO ANYTHING. They never bother to develop the characters. They never bother to shed light on who, how, and why most of anyone actually is. It's like watching SAW 2 without the traps. People are just there for one reason or another getting treated, a few ""rules"" are broken, and then all hell breaks loose when Goldblum's Wolf King shows up for all of 10 mins, dies and his edgy son suddenly wants everyone to die because of it. We get a few farts of action scenes during this portion, but it's done at Mach speed, and dismissed. The entire story occurs during a riot, and the main character and his brother obtain rare yellow canary diamonds sealed in a portable vault the size of a ballpoint pen during their botched bank robbery. This is what they would allude you to believing is the true goal for the Wolf King to visit the hotel... the diamonds... but no, he was mysteriously injured in some sort of situation which is never revealed, which sets him up, coincidentally, for the 1-dimensional assassin lady to kill him... which was her target from the beginning...? Again, we're not given any sort of plot or scheme that details how they managed to get him there, and the wolf king is none the wiser that his diamonds are even missing to begin with. So once we finally get to the climax... the main character and ole' scufflin' Jodi part ways... the issue in this plot though... The main char was discussing his new life and how he can do anything now (I assume with the valuable diamonds he still has) the only problem is the dude left the diamonds in the pen vault in Jodi's nurse bag and she shuffles off into the mist. Of course this isn't conveyed in the ending, so it's not like it's obvious, but during the last action scene which lasts 3mins, the pen is placed into her bag as they hurry out the hotel front door. We never see it exchange hands after that. Boring, pointless, waste of money if you even spent any to see it. It's ok to have on in the background during a drunk gamenight with you and your buds, but I wouldn't drop a cent to see it. I gave it a 4/10 which is generous, and that's based solely on the half-decent fighting, action, and Bautista being an all-around badass.",Hotel Artemis

You can't always put into words why something doesn't work, but you can just tell when it doesn't. A few questions I had after finishing this movie--Did the director want me to attach emotionally with Nurse because of a few 15-second flashbacks? Was her quirkiness supposed to be endearing? It didn't feel authentic at all.Did every line of dialogue have to pass a catch-phrase test so that it could be repeated later on in the movie?Was i supposed to pity Acapulco because he let his own life dreams go by while he attempted to drag his brother along.... in a life of crime? And why didn't the guy they stole the diamonds from just tell them they belonged to the Wolf? What was the point of Nice drawing a line in the hallway? She started kicking there asses before they crossed the line anyway!Why was the news coverage able to predict the movement of the riots so precisely? That must've been the most organized city-engulfing riot in history.If the Wolf was so vicious, why didn't he just hold hostage some real doctors at a hospital instead of risking his life to drive an hour?Why would anyone think Hotel Artemis was a myth?

But the film does not develop anything, neither the plot (inconsistent) nor the characters (not very credible). Jodie Foster has the art but the part is missing; Jeff Goldblum is an old wolf of the trade but in the film, where he plays the most evil, he wouldn't be afraid even of a little lamb; Zachary Quinto is absolutely wasted on a fundamentally new role. The only one who does his duty is Dave Bautista. As in all the films in which he takes part, he never falls into too complicated or profound roles and his honest figure always does it. Some have compared the idea of the hotel for criminals to that of Johnny Weak but there is nothing more different. There is a hotel where to find and do business and a free zone (in theory), here it is a hospital for VIP criminals. The question then is, if a large-caliber criminal were to create such a structure, why should he share it with others? For management costs (private health worse than public health)? And then, while one of the hotel guests tries to get carried away by a helicopter (unsuccessfully), why doesn't the boss do the same thing to reach the hotel at the end of his life and prefer to drive an hour? Script and direction would have deserved someone more armored but there is only one of Carpenter.",Hotel Artemis
180,LansTaylor,Had potential but fell flat on its face,5,22 May 2020,"Hotel Artemis had an interesting premise but was very poorly executed. The characters made the dumbest choice, not used correctly and the script was downright awful; such a disappointment.
The only character backstory we got was of Jodie Foster's character and I wouldn't even call that a backstory given how we only got a few flashbacks and god were they annoying. Just every once and a while a flashback of a kid running or a teenager laying face down on the beach is basically all we got.
The action scenes were okay and there wasn't a lot of it. I think that if you want to really watch a cyber punk/dystopian movie you should check out Upgrade; that is how to make an action cyber punk film.

181,TheSchinppenSchnaff,"For every success, there is a failure",6,1 May 2020,"I never thought I'd be giving a movie with Jodie Foster and Jeff Goldblum a 5. But This movie falls short in so many domains.It's 2 cliche stories set in a unique environment. 1 - Bank robbery goes wrong and the thieves need an impromptu exit strategy & 2 - thieves accidentally steal something from a rich and powerful man and need to evade retribution. This leads to an underground hospital which is the movie's namesake. This is established beautifully. The viewer is the fish out of water in a dystopian Los Angeles, but will little to no expository dialogue we are clearly presented with a picture of how this world works.From here the movies slowly goes down hill. The characters we are introduced to in the Artemis are the perfect cliches. I don't think that is a bad thing. Formulas work for a reason and the right director/screenwriter can make magic out of the conventional. In the case of this movie, however, only Jody Foster's character is sufficiently established for the audience to invest any emotion in following her story arc. And the case of the twist that complicates her story, I felt it was not sufficiently moving for me to invest any further emotion energy.This leaves Jeff Goldblum played his part brilliantly (but I mean, it's Goldblum - everything he does is awesome). I can't remember seeing him play a villain, but during his short screen time, I was impressed with how intimidating, yet cold, yet charismatic he was. He stole the show with barely a few minutes of screen time.I think this is also one of the biggest failures of this movie. When the best actor and character is the bad guy, you no longer care about the conclusion of the story, your disappointed to see the arc resolve the story complication and proceed to an inevitably disappointing conclusion.Overall, unique setting, decent acting, passable dialogue, and Jeff Goldblum with Jody Foster - solid 6 out of 10.",Hotel Artemis

If there were at least any interesting characters to make up for this, but no. It really isn't that hard to make the audience root for or care for flat characters, action movies have done this forever, but somehow Hotel Artemis failed to make me care what happens to any character in this film. Everyone but Jodie Foster's character is a walking clique, the worst of all Sofia Boutella's character (a hot, deadly assassin who seems cold but has feelings for a hot guy she shares a past with - seriously?) and Charlie Day's and Jeff Goldblum's talents are completely wasted.Hotel Artemis wasn't ever going to be a profound film with complex storytelling and characters, but rather a fun piece of entertainment.

The hotel set itself is well resolved with just enough grunge tech mixed with sci-fi high end equipment (I don't want to spoil anything) to keep it fun to look at. It has a Coen brothers Barton Fink fused with Terry Gilliam's Brazil sort of feel. The original fixtures are Art Deco and then, with the decay of 'everything civilized', the building has been maintained only as needed to serve its purpose, its perfect. The beginning is well paced, you are introduced to the chaos of the outside world with just enough of a storyline to get you to the receiving doors of the hotel. Characters all arrive on screen with an orderly almost metronome tempo, each with enough backstory development to keep you entertained. The set is complimented by the wardrobe design which is current and matches the roleplayers they adorn. Characters anonymity is done in a slick way and we quickly understand membership and the rules of the day, (some John Wick echoes here) and just as that is settled the main plot line kicks into gear. Jodie Foster plays her role effortlessly, perhaps too much so, it feels like there is some complex character development left on the editing room floor. She delivers though, and so do the others. Bautista manages to shed typecast expectations. Sofia Boutella has grown as an actor and does a great job having lost her go-to bag of angry eye facial expressions, her action sequences are plausible which is refreshing given some of the incessantly over the top moves seen in other 2018 flicks. Sterling K Brown is perfect, Goldblum too sheds his Jurassic Park trademark vocal style. All in all, the movie has the right ingredients to be fantastic. I recommend seeing it, absolutely, if you're a movie buff, see it on a big screen. Where it under delivers is with the transition of Fosters character being in control to everything going sideways. It happens too quickly. There is a lot more room left to develop disdain for the bad guys. It just sort of shifts from fairly tight to fairly predictable and it sort of methodically roles along winding down from there. It got my 7 of 10 for its finish, feel and editing, without that it would warrant maybe a six. Better than average for the genre.",Hotel Artemis

Its more a character drama, but it's great!The acting is well done and the idea of a John Wick style hospital for criminals is a cool one, though it does seem they coped the hit man hotel idea from John Wick as a hospital for this film.My only issues with the film, and why I'm giving it a lesser rating than full, is all the damn sub plots that are thrown in there that don't really lend to much. It's pretty well done, but in the end it's like. What was the point? And the redemption arch for the Nice towards the end just felt so out of place for her and not earned.

209,brennandube,A solid flick.,7,11 June 2018,"'Hotel Artemis' is the third film ever to be distributed by Global Road Entertainment, it also happens to be Drew Pearce's directorial debut for a feature length film. It stars the likes of Jodie Foster, Sterling K. Brown, Sofia Boutella, Jeff Goldblum, Charlie Day and Dave Bautista. Going into this movie I had no idea really what it was about other than the few tweets I saw on Friday when it opened. I had not seen a trailer nor did I read into this film, but I went into it pretty excited nonetheless. 'Hotel Artemis' is set in 2028 Los Angeles during one of the worst riots in U.S history. It centers around Jodie Foster's character who runs a hotel that is meant to patch up and take care of the most elite criminals. From here we have a movie that offers some quality suspense, good performances all around and a decent plot.  'Artemis' as I previously stated has quite the well-rounded cast. Jodie Foster in this movie is quite good, Sterling K. Brown is also really good in this movie, he plays one of the criminals there to get service from Foster. Sofia Boutella plays probably this movie most exciting character and she really played her role well. At times these performances, especially the ones from the criminals, came off as comical or cartoony. I think after processing this film that Pearce and the other filmmakers who worked on this were actually going for that. Dave Bautista is pretty cool in this movie. He plays the hotels security and works alongside Foster. His and Foster's character have quite good chemistry and it was the most believable of the movie for sure. Foster did a really good job at setting the tone of this hotel and what it's all about. I had a hard time being invested in these characters because of the lack of overall development. The characters are for the most part interesting but without any developed arcs, as well as the subplots that just felt useless, I really did not care much for these characters. Jeff Goldblum is pretty awesome in this movie and his talents were put on display once again...(SPOILERS AHEAD, you have been warned, skip to next paragraph)...for about 2 minutes! Yea! They killed off this movie's most intriguing character after maybe three or four minutes tops screen time. It felt like Goldblum was in town and they put out an alert saying we need someone to come by the studio for half an hour! His character felt so wasted in this and that was a disappointment. (SPOILERS DONE) Pretty much the entirety of this movie is spent in this hotel so it is important that they set a good vibe in there, and thanks to how Foster portrayed the hotel as well as the set design, I was rather pleased and drawn into the world of 'Hotel Artemis.' It was a neat estranged setting and it was quite entertaining to be a part of. The intensity in this movie is build up pretty well but without a sense of payoff. The final parts of this film were somewhat rushed in my opinion and it hurt this movie in terms of emotion and intensity, however, this was still a lot of fun to watch. The main fight sequence was really fun in this movie and it was choreographed very well but because of no connection being developed with the characters in this movie for me, it's essentially just mindless fun. Overall, I was much more interested in this World and hotel not the actual characters and subplots.",Hotel Artemis
210,SkylessWing,California dreaming,7,13 July 2020,"Not bad. Good action, great production design. Action was well choreographed. Everyone put in a good performance.There is a flaw tho.

Non existing story, mediocre acting, illogic and half baked patronising messages, doesn't work as sci-fi nor as a dystopian vision. Bland and boring with needless and mindless plot points. 
Spare two hours of your life and watch something else. 
One word: preposterous",Hotel Artemis
213,acutisnasus,Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,7,29 September 2018,"The story 
Hotel Artemis is a hospital to patch up criminals who can pay for a membership and it's run by 1 Nurse.
The Nurse put up some rules which the criminals are reluctant to follow and there is only 1 person to enforce it and help the Nurse. 
Some criminals go there to get patched up but they are linked somehow to the nurse or each other. 
(Really it does not resemble the hotel in John Wick at all) There are three stories told, 
One of the Nurse. 
One of a Male criminal with his Brother. 
One of a Female criminal. 
The surrounding is a riot in future Earth and the Hotel. The stories of each of above characters are good stories to support the plot but I felt it was rushed through. 
It was like looking at plot where the characters reasons were integral to the story line but there was not enough time to go in depth. (movie is 1 hour and 30 min) I find the whole feel of the movie aesthetically pleasing. 
I also felt it almost had that comic book feeling to it. 
If it was 2 hours, I think the writers could have done more, because the plot and the stories of the characters were interesting. The choice of how to present the characters were actually well done by all actors, it fit the story. But I cannot shake the feeling that it might have worked better if it was done with a tad bit more of overacting (theatrical for screen?). It would definitely make the characters fit more in the story and the whole feeling of the movie. Overall I enjoyed, especially loved seeing Jodie Foster and Dave Bautista doing their stuff on screen.",Hotel Artemis

Like why are all the important cables visible on the walls. And why are the power boxes on the roof with labels on for anyone to see. And how in such a tall building is there so few rooms? It feels a bit thrown together.Jodie Foster is ok, Dave Batista has a couple of one lines, Jeff Goldblum has far too small a part, and apart from that the cast is a bit meh.The plot is thin, the ending is nothing to write home about, and it just felt like another great opportunity missed for Hollywood.",Hotel Artemis
216,revboose-781-838014,Jodie Foster is amazing as always!,7,16 January 2021,"When Jodie Foster goes into an agoraphobic panic attack as nurse Jean Thomas at a point midway through Hotel Artemis, you really feel it, and you really feel for her. Foster continues to amaze by disappearing into roles and bringing an amazing gravitas to what could be an otherwise unwatchable concept movie.Foster is the nurse in charge of the Hotel Artemis, an underground hospital that caters to members of the underworld; it is *literally* members-only, as you have to pay your dues and have a confirmation chip inserted in your arm to be able to get past the gate. She is aided by Dave Bautista as the aptly-named orderly Everest as she tries to heal the wounds of various clients who have shown up on this given night. However, when the founder of the hotel shows up needing service, her straightforward world gets dropped on its ear.Most characters are paper-thin with no dimension whatsoever - they exist completely as they are, and the actors make passable work of their portrayals. But the gem is Foster, who continues to prove that she can become whatever a role demands of her. Nurse Thomas is about as far from the elegant sociopath in charge of Elysium as one can get, yet you accept her in both roles.The movie is neatly done and comes in at a smart 90 minutes. Visual bubble gum, you might ""try the flavour"" again, but Foster makes it worth it.7/10",Hotel Artemis

The (near) perfect cast and messing that up is bad. Really bad. Half way through all the surprises were done and no tension was built up. The ugly: Such a miserably standard development of events. Not a single original idea or twist in the whole script. Character development of a Sesame street level. It simply becomes a pretentious ball of kumbaya and unwarranted self sacrifice. The only thing missing was a twin brother returning from the dead...but that would at least be some twist. Ugly AFHaving said that. Just for the joy of seeing Bautista and Foster act? Yeah go see it.

224,Stars-and-popcorn,You Can Check Out Anytime You Want...,6,8 June 2018,"'Hotel Artemis' has its fair share of cinematic kerfluffles from story structure to pacing. However, it's a lot of fun. This is mostly because it has a cast that is given roles that they excel at. It's such an odd assortment of actors that came together to create a stylish film that seems familiar yet unique at the same time.There are rules at the Hotel Artemis, a secret, high tech hospital for the underworld of Los Angeles. In order to remain a member of this elite criminal's emergency room, you have to respect the staff and the other patients, much in the same way that The Continental from 'John Wick' has rules. It's neutral ground where egos, grudges, and guns have to be checked at the door. The reason for these rules is because it houses an odd assortment of colorful characters from all walks of life. The only thing they all share in common is that they are the worst of the worst when it comes to dirty dealings in a city known for its outlaws.Jodi Foster stars as the nurse that runs the Hotel Artemis. She's a washed-up drunk who has long since lost her medical license, but not her skills when it comes to saving the lives of those who probably shouldn't be saved. Foster's portrayal of Nurse is much richer than the character probably deserves in a sci-fi action film. Tormented by the death of her son, she hasn't set foot outside the hotel for decades due to crippling anxiety. Despite this she is a no-nonsense tough as nails caretaker who won't hesitate to call upon her orderly, Everest, played by David Bautista, to expel unruly guests from the premises. Her character is the very cornerstone of the film and what everything and everyone is built off of.The rest of the cast features the likes of Sophia Boutella as a beautiful and deadly assassin, Sterling K. Brown as a devastatingly handsome bank robber, and Charlie Day as an obnoxiously entitled arms dealer. The three are at odds given that the hotel houses criminals and criminals can't be trusted, and to make matters worse a full-blown riot is taking place on the streets below. Luckily, there is honor among thieves for the most part. That doesn't last long though, because, well, what fun would that be?'Hotel Artemis' is the feature directorial debut of Drew Pearce, who also wrote the film. While he's proven to be an exceptions writer in the past his directing isn't quite up to par with the concepts and characters he's put together. While the actors all do what they do best with the roles they're given, the pacing and cinematography feel flat, which undermines the urgency of the situation. There's such a focus on putting together the leads in the film, that the overall threat that they end up facing by the end of the film doesn't feel like it's truly worthy of them and ends with a disappointing third act.Despite the cinematic issues 'Hotel Artemis' faces, it is fun watching events unfold. Brown is unbelievably charming as a suave and debonair bank robber trying to get out of the underworld once and for all. Most of his scenes are shared with Boutella who has exploded onto the scene since 'Kingsman: The Secret Service.' Since then she's become a name I look for on movie posters and while her films might not always be great, I'm never disappointed in her performances. Then there is Bautista who has become incredibly popular since joining the MCU and is an actor that takes his art very seriously. He's someone who remains humble and works hard for everything he has. While the role of Everest might not be as juicy as say, Sapper in 'Blade Runner 2049,' he manages to use his imposing physicality perfectly in Hotel Artemis.As we like to say here, ""not all great movies are good."" That isn't to say that 'Hotel Artemis' is a great movie, because it definitely isn't. However, it's a fun movie. It's a film that is mindless entertainment with enough interesting concepts (from medical nanites to 3D printing organs) to keep audiences intrigued with what's unfolding. It's just unfortunate that it never seems to achieve what it's aiming for. At its core, it's a film with great characters and an interesting premises, so much so that it almost feels wasted. That being said, it still a movie that I quite enjoyed sitting through. There are certainly better films that came out this week, but I feel like Hotel Artemis really rounds out the choices at the cinema. It's not a movie for everyone, but for those who enjoy trashy movies with reliable and talented actors, it's definitely going to hit the spot.",Hotel Artemis

The hotel is run like a tight ship-it has a range of gadgets and technology to save badly hurt people,3d printing machine-that clones organs😳
The hotel is run by keeping strict rules in place and under no circumstances breaking them.
however when a assassin comes to the hotel under the cover of being shot,to take out the wolf king(he owns all of riot torn L.A) all hell breaks loose when she completed her mission!
Now the hotel is in disarray as wolfkings son and gang go ape tearing it apart!
This isn't the whole story-it's full of twists and turns,imo only part of the movie was flawed(when Jody Forster is remembering her son-it's a bit slow)

The only problem with it is, it's not a hotel or a hospital. From the outside, it was like 30 storey but the scene only take place in a very very very small place in only 1 level with what seems like just 4 or 5 rooms. And the criminals?not that many and you don't really care. You could put Spongebob in it and the movie will do just fine. That's why for a notorious place that shelter criminals, they only need 1 man to guard it and that man is a nurse at the same time.The biggest problem with this movie is that there are a lot of scene and dialogue that doesn't seem to fit together,like out of nowhere the scene/dialogue is there and even if it was taken out, the movie will still be ok. And when i say a lot, i really mean a lot. Heck, even the ending dialogue feels rushed and forced.As for the acting, you cant expect any better. All of the main character delivers. The action scene is well choreographed. The concept is unique but that's it. If you enjoyed Mortal Engine where the concept is unique but the plot is so-so, you'd enjoy this movie.Overall, it's really not bad, it's just average.",Hotel Artemis

Jeff Goldblum though didn't measure up to the character he was portraying so that was a big miscast. Dave Bautista was basically a stand-in for The Rock who was probably filming another action movie.

Every bit of excess fat has been trimmed from this one-and-a-half-hour perfectly-paced baby, which plays out in almost real time - a few hours one evening while a city riot rages outside. All the performances are spot on (Jodie Foster and Dave Bautista deserve special mention), although, personally, I feel the cameo Goldblum character was a little miscast; couldn't we have had a scarier unknown actor playing the part? 
You could think of this movie as a futuristic morality play - everyone gets what they deserve. In that sense, there aren't a lot of surprises; a good twist with a last minute reveal would have pushed up my score for this film. Having said that, it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride, especially if you're one who can appreciate the combination of a bit of action, a touch of pathos and a more cynical brand of humour than what is normally on offer.",Hotel Artemis

I did not have any emotional investment in the characters.... they were only minimally ""developed"", so I did not really care what happened to them. I think that is why we continue to watch a film... we want to know what happens to the characters in the end and see how everything works out.

No explanation given for the state of affairs other than ""it's in the future oooooh!!"". No character development whatsoever combined with a premise that really just lacks any solid foundation. ""i've been here 22 years"" is the mantra that lulls them into a complacent confidence, yet if any such concept was realistic it would not have survived more than a few months - typical consequences of a police state as depicted, yet the idea is allowed to run rampant to support what little background is given. Every conversation was confusing and out-of-place. Charlie Day is not a convincing ""bad-ass"" as is portrayed during that time, in fact he should only be cast in comedies or dramas. Jodie Foster is just terrible, but then again that describes her in all her movies.

There are lots of breadcrumbs for people over 40 (California Dreamin', and ""your ballroom days are over"" from the Doors). Los Angeles was truly born after WWII when the city began importing water.

At the heart of the story is family, found or born in to and how both of these are powerful in their own way.I think the IMDB ratings score is kinda low and it deserves better.

283,liammarklh,"Interesting Premise, Terrible Execution & Wasted Potential",4,6 May 2021,"In an era of remakes, reboots, sequels and classics being remade for the sake of making soulless cash grabs, it's rare to see original films being made that keep my interest for long. Hotel Artemis caught my attention because it looked cool and I wanted to give it a chance since it was on my Amazon Prime recommended sections and I love a good crime thriller or gritty realistic take on metaphorical real life and dystopia. I have to say I like the gritty and noir like presentation of the story, the setting is very fitting for a dystopian hell scape. You can almost see a whimsical yet serious tone kind of like a mix between Guardians of the Galaxy and John Wick, since everyone keeps referencing that film due to this being quite similar.The actors are giving it their best and when you have an star studded cast of well known names like Jodie Foster, Dave Bautista, Sterling K. Brown, Charlie Day and even Jeff Goldblum, I thought this would be a fun crime drama about a possible future for America and what we could do to learn from the folly portrayed in the movie. Sadly the characters these actors portray aren't worth the time and effort in getting to know or invest time into.Technically and actor wise this film is alright, but story wise, pacing wise and character wise, it's all over the place, very frenetic and has no idea of what to do with itself.I know this is supposed to be a crime ridden future, but was I the only one underwhelmed by the lackluster worldbuilding? I mean the riots are happening all over because some big bad group took away their water? Okay this shows a sense of classism with the rich and poor working class people, is that it? Does that somehow justify mass riots, police shootings and rampage in the streets? Maybe I'm uncultured and missed something in the subtext, but I have no idea how the world got to this point, but the sequestered setting of the hospital doesn't really help it overall. The pacing is god awful and plot points are either sped through and never explained, or take too long to get to the twist reveal and it feels very cluttered and all over the place.The characters are just tropes of ones you'd see in any generic crime drama, you have the alcoholic tough as nails nurse who's been through the emotional wringer, her gentle giant porter assistant, two black thieves; one with a golden heart and the other a dumb idiot who gets the former into trouble, a generic cop, a foul mouthed arms dealer, a boring femme fatale, a whiny heir to an infamous crime family and his eccentric godfather like dad who sounds bored half the time.Cliches are called that for a reason, they worked well in other films and media, but these characters are just so generic and flat, some are interesting, but the plot doesn't do them any favors in the long run when they gloss over points of conflict and never resolve or address them in the narrative. One scene shows a thief stealing a pen containing diamonds worth millions and yet the crime boss never once chases after them or even knows they stole from him, so that's a waste.The femme fatale ends up ruining everything just to kill one man who she could have killed without having to mess with the electricity and other patients life support, the arms dealer is annoying and foulmouthed because why not and he comes and goes for forced conflict and chews scenery everywhere he goes, he serves no purpose other than to create artificial tension and is dealt with before he could do anything significant. The crime boss who runs the entire city ends up dying in under thirty minutes or so and he's just there to give the Nurse some resolution to her internal conflict and even then he feels so vastly underutilized compared to his equally annoying son, who talks a big game, but just stands on the sidelines doing nothing much of value, other than to force the Nurse to confront her agoraphobia.These characters come and go so fast that I forgot who was who and why they were so important to the overall plot. They made it a rule to never help cops because it would break the trust they've established in the criminal underworld, but immediately break the golden rule in order to save this one female cop who comes in and out of the film just like that and we never see her again after she's healed up. The giant porter guy is my favorite character out of everyone here, but even he feels wasted in this film and just resorts to being generic bodyguard with a mysterious past that's never delved into.The nurse is probably the most developed out of everyone here and even then, her agoraphobia and anxiety attacks are inconsistent and don't make sense when she's been shown to dislike going outside without help, but at the end she's suddenly ready to go out into the riots and save the day??? Her hospital gets taken apart and she doesn't care that her business is gone idk. The smart thief's brother dies, he doesn't care that he died, if anything he saw him as a pest, so whatever and he just gets to leave with the diamonds and no one questions it or even chases him down to retrieve it back, the same freaking diamonds that the plot said would get him killed but I guess not anymore. He gets an easy out and is now rich, so do with that what you will.If this story was trying to convey a certain theme or be a character study, it could have worked, but when you sacrifice your plot and characters for the sake of some contrived theme or message, then your story won't make sense if characters do things that are inconsistent with their established personalities and the story bends around the theme to cobble together some wacky message about the state of the world. It's lazy, clumsy and doesn't do a good job of delivering said message, it tries to have a plot, but goes nowhere and it's just a hot mess.Overall, this film gets points for being semi-original, even if it's lazily inspired by other pieces of media. It started off with a fun premise, but had a lackluster story, terrible worldbuilding, forgettable characters, decent acting, forced conflict and tension, terrible pacing and finally a disappointingly open ended finale that doesn't make sense in the context of the plot and felt like it was done just to say they finished the script and they want their paycheck.Don't waste your time on this movie, go watch something else that won't bore you to death or make you want to eat your heart out.",Hotel Artemis

The characters aren't written as humans that would behave and react as human beings. Their actions are clearly written as whatever would be easiest to allow the writers to shoehorn in another plot device that dies before it ever becomes anything interesting.There's a reason why when typing this film's title into Google, it immediately suggests the often-searched question ""What was the point of Hotel Artemis"".",Hotel Artemis

Jody Foster and Sterling K. Brown both give performances that I found to be well grounded. I particularly found Jody Foster's emotional journey compelling and relateable. The film offers up some good quips in the dialogue department and a couple of very well choreographed fight scenes. Some of the actors were basically playing their public personas like Jeff Goldblum and Charlie Day but I like those personas so it didn't bother me too much.

No.Hotel Artemis is a tight, cohesive flick that delivers story, style and some substance. This film is elevated by strong performances from actors who were able to flex their chops and a visual style that meshes the cutting edge and old classics together in cinematically compelling and grounded way. So cool! Every minute Jodie Foster's ""Nurse"" is on screen is a delight, especially when shared with Dave Bautista's ""Everest""--who has developed into such a wonderful character actor. Sofia Boutella is effortlessly electric and Sterling K. Brown's charisma is enough to make any heightened scene somehow plausible.

A 6.1? The only way I can explain it is that people went in expecting one thing and ended up getting a different flavor.When I saw this movie advertised, it was under *extremely violent.* Cue the unfavorable comparisons to John Wick in the reviews.Don't get me wrong - John Wick is a masterpiece - but it is much more stylized style of movie than this. As a consequence, the action and pressure in Hotel Artemis build at a slower pace, and the movie (mostly) does a good job of avoiding gratuitous tripe that B-rate action movies can have.The acting is stellar. Bautista, Henry and Foster took the cake for me, and who doesn't love Jeff Goldblum? I thought the dialogue was realistic even when it made me laugh, the setting was believable and the director did a good job of showing over telling. It's a simple story - Guy hides out in safe house while crazy stuff happens all around him - but it's well told.P.S.

It was really interesting to see Jodie Foster and Dave Bautista work so closely and I'm so glad Jodie Foster took up the role she did after being absent from the movie industry for 5 years.

Sequences happen for little or no reason, character interactions seems oddly improvised and boring instead of fun. There's also a number of plot holes and character inconsistencies which just make everything seem like a total mess.I was literally counting the ceiling titles when Jeff Goldblum showed up.. I was hoping he would bring some of his magic to the film but unfortunately his contribution is more or less a brief cameo.Ultimately I found this film to commit the worst of all movie sins -- it's boring. There's really nothing here that's compelling as it fails on almost every front. The premise (while a bit derivative) had a lot of potential but you need a good foundation to make it work.

357,blueycarter,Potential WASTED,5,18 September 2020,"As you will see in most reviews of this movie, there was a lot of potential. Great set, great cinematography, great cast, great premise... but it was really bad.I think there are 4 main reasons:1) Screenplay: Don't get me wrong it's not a bad screenplay, especially for one of the first the director (Drew Pierce) had written. However, the script is generic, and does not understand the importance of silence in building tension, and feels very much to be written for a different cast (except Jodie Foster). That is fairly standard, most films aren't able to cast the exact actors the writer envisioned: but that's where rewrites come in.2) Director: Drew Pierce is not only a fairly inexperienced screenplay writer, but also an inexperienced director, who probably let the praise that the studio head gave his screenplay go to his head. I highly doubt that any rewrites happened or any allowance for improvisation. Which makes the characters all feel forced (except Jodie Foster). This combined with the fact that they were shooting on a tight schedule, and had less takes to work with (and camera angles).3) Editors: When editors are working with mediocre takes and few camera angles, they're already on the backfoot. When both lead editors have had little to no experience editing action movies, the movie is pretty much screwed.4) Music: In movies and TV you only notice music when it is either good or bad. In Hotel Artemis it's really bad, jarringly bad. This might be due in part to poor mixing/editing.This movie is a parable of what happens when you spend an entire movie budget on the cast and the cinematography.Also can we just stop with the increasingly bad homages to Oldboy?",Hotel Artemis

360,ninetyseven-52707,Characters...,7,9 December 2018,"The setting is interesting, no doubt. The whole look of the film is absolutely stunning and beautiful.But motivations fall apart whenever I think of it. Why are the characters doing what they're doing? There are a lot of leftover, unsaid and unplugged holes in the motivations of some of these characters.",Hotel Artemis
361,sjoerdhenderickx,"Was excited before, but dissapointed after",5,22 January 2019,"When I saw the trailer in theater I was really excited to see the movie. I Thought it was a really cool plot and couldn't wait to see it. When I was watching it for the first time I was like 20 minutes in and I wasn't really satisfied. It was all pretty damn cliché. I had a feeling that they could have done alot more to the plot of the movie. I watched it for 40 minutes and the only thing I still was excited about was the roll of Jeff Goldblum. He finally got into the movie and he made a weak entrence. Jeff always has some mysterious grey characters which I like but again they could have done alot more with him.
Conclusion: Trailer better than the movie.",Hotel Artemis
362,ronnieboboff,Mildly entertaining if mind-numbing,4,7 April 2019,"My overriding feeling watching this movie was ""why?"". I could not understand what was going to happen next, at any point, because the film contained no storyline. I found this intriguing at first but only because I was expecting something clever to eventually unfold. It didn't.A bunch of criminal caricatures are slowly brought together into a hotel-cum-hospital that is situated in the midst of an irrelevant subplot about a city riot in LA. It then turns out that all this is for no obvious purpose. The interactions between the characters were mildly entertaining but didn't really take the plot anywhere, to the point where a couple of them could have been dropped altogether and it would have made no difference. That is, but for the film not even achieving 90 minutes running time without their scenes.A contrived situation was created at the end to enable a few tired clichéd action sequences where the outcome didn't matter. They were reasonably well staged but I wasn't really bothered who came out on top so it generated no real excitement.I think overall this was trying to carry its weight as a character piece with a multi-threaded plot in the mould of Guy Ritchie or Tarantino. Therefore it utterly fails, as their bold characters live by a colourful and witty script and plots that cleverly manoeuvre them into a crescendo of conflict by the finale. As others have said, this film just ends and you think ""is that it?"".On the plus side, Foster started well as the quirky stalwart of an unusual clandestine gangster's refuge before eventually succumbing to the material she was given to work with. The cinematography was interesting, with sci-fi elements added to a dark and dystopian future (oddly not far enough into the future to support the technological change being shown. 3D printing a liver in 10 years time? Hmm).If you like your films mindless (which some people must judging by some surprisingly high ratings here) then this is reasonably entertaining and by all means give it a go.",Hotel Artemis
363,melwhitaker,Awful...,1,11 May 2019,"Don't understand how this got 6.1 score, usually anything above a 6 on imdb is pretty decent but this was awful. Boring, dire plot that doesn't really go anywhere. Waste of time watching it. Some good actors & good character's but most of them were only in it for 5 mins - Jeff Goldblum! What let this film down was it's awful plot & storyline... Shame!",Hotel Artemis

365,badboyboyler,Pointless,5,26 July 2018,This movie was poor from start to finish. Plot was lacking. Never felt engaged with the characters. A complete mess of a film. Great cast but poorly executed. Would save your money on this one.,Hotel Artemis
366,sabrym-31090,No drama,3,16 August 2018,No drama and no story it waste ur time no mystery nothing in that film,Hotel Artemis
367,alexismarcoux,"Wasn't expecting much, and it wasn't much.",6,1 May 2019,"I feel like the story-line was really great, the movie completely missed out on the opportunity. The movie failed at making you relate to anything happening. It was obvious that the movie tried to make you feel for the characters, relate to them, but they didn't build any connection in the first place, so you just didn't. They barely introduce you to the characters, let alone create a connection with them.The one thing I want to highlight that I feel they really messed up on is when the Nurse decided to break her own rules to let the lady cop in. The nurse keeps repeating the whole time that it's been 22 years she's running this hotel, implying that this is pretty much her life. Yet she decides to break her own rules, which are supposed to be sacred, to let someone from her past in. Not only do we have no idea who this person is, but they don't even bother to explain why she's so important to her, she was a friend of her son, that's basically all we know.",Hotel Artemis
368,bettyquick,Why so many bad reviews??,10,22 July 2018,This is a fantastic film! As for the low ratings.. are you film critics? Or are you blind? Silly people,Hotel Artemis
369,joonasvaatainen,Excellent!,9,28 September 2018,This one got me surprised. Very good directing and phasing. Excellent acting and setting! I hope this story continues as I loved the world movie set in. Worth watching!,Hotel Artemis
370,mlperry-45607,"Critics miss the entire point; in other news, water is wet",6,9 June 2018,"If I may employ an extended metaphor, this film was a meandering river. It flowed over a few falls, and ultimately crashed into a large pool at the bottom. The critics have missed the point: not every movie has to have a groundbreaking idea that changes the face of action movies for the next generation!!! It has already cleared the high bar by being an original idea executed by brilliant actors. Do not be put off by how it has been described as ""slow-moving"" and ""having no point""; it is a glimpse into another world in the truest sense. This glimpse is not staged at the perfect time to contain the maximum amount of action and drama, and it is not overwrought and filled with the ridiculous conceits so prevalent in Hollywood action flicks. It is simply a chance to sit back and enjoy a foray into the dystopian future Los Angeles that Drew Pearce has created. I give this film a 6/10 because it did not blow me away (10/10), but it was better than average (5/10). I would have given a 7, but the cinematography was a bit lacking. The art of running with a camera was perfected in Full Metal Jacket, so that is the gold standard to which I hold other films. This did not quite measure up. The red lighting in the second half of the movie was lovely and paired well with the absolute sanguinity shown. (Also ignore the review that says there was only one fight scene; I can only assume this person didn't see the same movie I did because there were plenty of fights) I have no complaints about the acting. The cast was stellar. Jodie Foster and Jeff Goldblum performed at Jodie-Jeff levels of proficiency, as is always expected. Charlie Day has made a seamless transition from comedy to dramedy and I am SO here for it. I was particularly enthused with Sterling K. Brown's character; he is gritty, authentic, and evinces his internal conflict perfectly through word and deed.TL;DR: Hotel Artemis is not the film of the year and it probably won't win any Oscars. You should still go see it because it was quite good and was totally worth my $5.",Hotel Artemis
371,tripantuexplore,Tongue in cheek acting choice killed a good idea,3,13 June 2018,"Tongue in cheek acting choice killed a good idea. See how ""The Expanse"" or ""Banshee"" took themselves so seriously that made most scenes a thrilling experience. Instead we got not too funny jokes, not too harsh violence or technically arresting fights, not too hot sex, not a deep wisdom of any kind; but a mediocre experience of all of them. What a waste of cast.",Hotel Artemis
372,JamesHoner,"Its good, but not great",6,13 June 2018,"This was a good movie, but it lacked an attraction to the characters and their situation. You end up only caring about the nurse. Its a great concept and could've been improved with a slightly higher budget and an extra 30 minutes of screen time.",Hotel Artemis
373,Emperor_Fun,Could've been so much better,5,19 August 2018,"There are definitely some things I like about it. The casting and overall performances are very good for the most part. The ideas and world seem really fun and exciting, but the film overall fails to take advantage. The script is not good, and the overall story really sputters and drags on, which is amazing when it's only 90 minutes. I can't really give it a worse score because I don't have enough energy or care quite frankly about this movie to care about giving it anything lower, because everything else is average or fine, except for one shot when the special effects looked surprisingly terrible somewhere around the beginning of the movie.",Hotel Artemis
374,karibuduma,Two stars is a lot,2,25 February 2019,"A really bad plot and dialogue. One of the characters might not even need to be in the story.
""The car is behind the bus."" No, it wasn't. It was far away at a parking lot. If he said that to make her feel better, then she should at least have some dialogue here. Parking at a parking lot also means, when they arrived badly wounded at this hospital, they searched for a parking lot. If your life is in danger, who would search for a parking lot. Or the car was parked there before the robbery. But that does not make sence either. Maybe a nice guy parked it there in case they needed a car some time. Or maybe I wasn't awake during the whole movie.
At the bank robbery they wear masks, probably so they don't get recognized. But when the criminals speak with each other, they lift off their masks.",Hotel Artemis
375,ceglr,Terrible movie. Not worth rental price.,2,20 October 2018,"I never planned to do a movie review in my life. This movie was so terrible I have to. I was expecting something like Smokin Aces from the trailer, what I got was utter garbage wrapped in up in the illusion of an action movie. It was boring. It wasn't funny. It wasn't tense. It had hardly any action. I hope it doesn't get a sequel. It only got two stars for the plot idea which was great. Yet some how Hollywood can take great ideas and utterly destroy them.",Hotel Artemis
376,chrisraywarren-26966,Disregard the bot reviews,7,20 October 2018,"There must be a bunch of bots reviewing this movie or something because I thought it was fantastic. Excellent cinematography, from the scenes(mostly the hotel) to the lighting to the props. This movie really goes to show you how little character development you can get away with because each of them felt very relatable.(likely due to good casting). The story wasn't incredibly complex, but it didn't need to be because what they did have was executed with obvious style and passion.7.5/10",Hotel Artemis
