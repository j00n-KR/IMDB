0,Leofwine_draca,Nauseatingly bad,1,26 July 2016,"The latest lame Hollywood blockbuster is definitely disappointing, and not in the least bit scary. Now, the original 1963 film wasn't scary either, but at least it managed to be creepy, with the aid of subtlety and suggestion. Just the opposite of this film, in fact. Jan De Bont shows that he should stick to making slick action pictures and has no idea how to scare us.In fact, only the basic plot has been taken from the original film. Some scenes are copied, but in this film it's all basically overdrive on behalf of the special effects team. From the first moment on entering the house, ghostly faces are appearing on bed sheets and walls, and these just increase and increase throughout the film in number. The trouble is that only on two or three occasions are the characters put in danger by these effects, and the rest of the time you just know they're going to dissipate and not cause any harm to anyone.The cast is full of familiar faces, such as Bruce Dern in a wild-haired role as a rarely-seen caretaker. Liam Neeson is good but goes through the paces as the stern doctor, he's no match for Richard Johnson in the original, but at least he's something of an actor. The same with Catherine Zeta Jones. Unfortunately, her character is the least subtle of them all, constantly wearing revealing clothes and flaunting her lesbianism. She fits her role like a glove. Lili Taylor, however, I didn't like. She's one of those actresses who think expressing fright is opening their mouths and eyes as wide as possible. It doesn't look like a believable expression, it just looks ridiculous. Taylor is sadly given the most to do and the largest role, but I just didn't warm to her at all. Owen Wilson is also awful in a comic relief role.For the most part, the special effects are bad and totally unrealistic. Big faces coming out of the ground just don't look real at all, it looks like a computer game and nothing else. Therefore these kind of effects quickly become boring, as you expect what's coming, and there's just so much visual bombardment that it becomes tiring to watch. There are a handful of good scenes in the film, like a surprisingly brutal decapitation or Neeson getting attacked by a statue, but the ending is a real letdown with a sugary happy ending with angels and the like. The final apparition of the ghost is just a big guy in a cape, it might as well be Godzilla. Size isn't everything but that's something this film doesn't realise. Frankly, I think upcoming flicks like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake and, of course, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT all look more promising than this silly and unsurprising entry into the genre. Nauseatingly bad.",The Haunting
1,SnoopyStyle,Not scary,5,21 September 2013,"Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) is doing research on sleep disorders. Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson), and Nell (Lili Taylor) are the test subjects. Except they don't know that Dr Marrow is actually trying to scare them for their tests. That's why he bought them to an old garish mansion. The Dudleys (Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes) are the caretakers. Todd Field and Alix Koromzay play the doctor's assistants. Eventually only the four leads remain in the house and the movie really starts.The four leads are capable actors. Although Lili Taylor can be grinding as the poor victim character. The story goes slowly for far too long. The house is not scary as much as it's a Hollywood fun ride. The problem is really the fact that the mansion lack the basic sense of dread. The CG really adds an artificial feel to the whole movie.",The Haunting
2,lee_eisenberg,"some houses are born bad, and some movies are born stupid",3,11 September 2006,"Robert Wise's very creepy movie version of ""The Haunting"" was a very well done movie; watching it, you may feel like your blood is freezing. So how did Jan de Bont do remaking the movie? Ridiculous is the best word to describe it. If anything, the whole movie seems like it's trying to be funny (much of it is actually pretty laughable). Where they could play some neat tricks - or at least play with the audience - they stick in a bunch of special effects, namely the house's eyes.As for the cast, Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson are all dependable people, but they have nothing to work with here. In fact, the first two seem like the only ones suited to a horror flick. Overall, the movie looks more like an advertisement for what Catherine Zeta-Jones is wearing.So, just avoid this hunk of junk. A far better horror movie from 1999 was ""The Blair Witch Project"", and there are far superior movies about haunted houses. This one is laughable. Also starring Bruce Dern, Todd Field and Virginia Madsen (happy birthday!), and they probably don't wish to emphasize this flick when submitting their resumes.If I may add just one more thing, I'd say that it's an affront to all the people killed in the September 11 attacks that I have to review this crappy movie on the fifth anniversary of that fateful day.",The Haunting
3,jboothmillard,The Haunting,4,13 March 2007,"I always wondered which haunted house film was spoofed in Scary Movie 2, and renamed Hell House, now I know, and I can definitely see why it should be spoofed. From the director of Speed, Jan De Bont, it is a remake of the 1963 film, where a bunch of people are placed in the isolated house to study sleep disorders and problems, and obviously it turns out to be to find ghosts. Basically Eleanor 'Nell' Vance (Ransom's Lili Taylor) is called to meet with Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) and three other people at Hill House for a research stay. The people that look after the house, Mr. Dudley (Bruce Dern, Laura Dern's Dad) and Mrs. Dudley (Home Alone 3's Marian Seldes) say that no-one will be around and no-one can hear them, duh! These other three people, Theo (not renamed in SM2, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) and that one that gets her eye slashed, obviously settle better, but as more and more bizarre and spooky things happen in the house, mostly to Nell, she finds out the secrets behind the previous people of the house, including Hugh Crane, his wife and their children they never had. I really liked all the sequences that are memorably spoofed in SM2, e.g. the door knocker, the ghost crawling in the bed, Crane on the stairs, and if you have the SM2 DVD, the deleted scene with more than just eye slashing. Okay!",The Haunting
4,ccthemovieman-1,House & Sound Highlight Otherwise-Horrible Film,5,1 October 2006,"At least up to when this came out in 1999, this was the most awesome-looking inside of a house I've ever seen on film. The sets (the mansion), the powerful and dramatic bass noise and the great special special effects were all a lot of fun to watch and hear.That's the good news. The bad news is that the story is stupid, the picture too reddish at times, and Catherine Zeta-Jones' character saying ""God"" as an explanation over 20 times was very annoying, just to give one example.If I can mute out Jones and ignore some of the other characters, this might be a movie to re-consider purchasing because of that awesome house and room- rocking sound effects.",The Haunting
5,ma-cortes,Suspenseful and frightening terror movie about a haunted mansion,5,24 October 2011,"It's a remake to long deemed one of the masterly crafted stories of horror ever brought to the screen ¨Haunting¨(1963) by Robert Wise , a gripping film which still packs a punch . Hill House is a hundred-year-old haunted mansion , it is the setting for chosen group . The haunted house has an evil history with tragic accidents, suicide, and human misjudgement. It seems which the scary mansion has been the place of several killing deaths . A psychologist scientist (Liam Neeson) is a Pyschic researcher who assembles a group with histories linked to the paranormal. As three people are lured to an eerie mansion deceived for fake pretenses realized by a psychological researcher . Nell (Lili Taylor) was the subject of unexplained poltergeist activities as a child. She also is riddled with pain over her mother's death. Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) is a clairvoyant who befriends Nell at Hill House. Owen Wilson plays a cynical and Bon Vivant sent to make sure that the property is not affected by the researchers. Together the group explore Hill House and their own insecurities and finally face off the evil that inhabits with hair-raising results .Mindless and average film is packed with thrills, intrigue, suspense, horror and lots of interminable screams with no sense. However , this is an inferior version that relies heavily on the impressive special effects courtesy of ILM - Industrial Light Magic- , George Lucas owner . High budget makes for big scary scream-feast and frights . Splendid Lili Taylor as a fragile , lovely youth who results to have unexpected ties to the creepy ghost , she's the only redeeming feature of this uneven movie. Supposedly based on Shirley Jackson's creepy tale titled ¨The haunting of Hill House¨, it has little in common with the novel . Stirring and exciting musical score fitting to terror by the veteran maestro Jerry Goldsmith . Very good and colorful cinematography by Karl Walter Lindellaub . Director Jan De Bont created a taut drama where the real question is who is haunted and who may be unstable.The picture is middling realized in his third-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director (Speed , Twister). The film will appeal to Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones fans. This is a chilling adaptation from Shirley Jackson's novel based on an assortment of ghouls and ghosts and gets a mediocre rating . It turns out to be a chiller with all the FX budget can be created , being lavishly produced ,but also contains several scenes in little sense and no logic.",The Haunting
6,moonspinner55,"Simplification of the original story, with overreaching special effects...",4,28 March 2009,"Handsome, but too-literal reworking of the 1963 thriller drains all the mystery from the haunted house scenario. Story about a group of insomniacs who are invited by a psychologist to a spooky, isolated castle for ""sleep therapy"" required a much tougher intrinsic approach; here, Jan de Bont is mostly interested in a visual showdown. His revision of the original Robert Wise-directed film, from Shirley Jackson's novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"", often borders on outlandish camp. There are so many swooping-crane camera shots of Lili Taylor standing in front of a wind machine, and so much rattling chains nonsense, the narrative about youthful spirits being held captive is rendered rather ridiculous. As a director, de Bont is terrific at making the characters colorful and relatable for a mass audience (something that Robert Wise had trouble with in 1963), yet everyone is a bit too perky--and the dialogue too comically jaded--for the scares to take hold. There are good sequences: Taylor finding peace in a hidden room, a book of eerie photographs that unlock a secret. But de Bont's infatuation with moving statuary becomes a running joke, and puzzling moments like a stairway collapsing or spirits moving about in Lili Taylor's hair are pointless and absurd. The actors do what they can, but with a project so overloaded with full-throttle effects, they're task is mostly in not looking silly; they succeed about half the time. *1/2 from ****",The Haunting
7,paul_haakonsen,A rather good haunted house movie...,6,5 September 2019,"I have seen the 1999 movie ""The Haunting"" a couple of times now over the years since it was initially released. Well, this remake, I mean, not the original movie.Personally, then I do enjoy it, as it is a rather good supernatural haunting genre movie. Sure, there are flaws to it, but in overall, then this movie makes for good entertainment and I will say that director Jan de Bont was good at setting up the scenes and building up suspense and thrills.First of all, the movie boasts a pretty impressive cast list, which includes the likes of Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Lily Taylor, Bruce Dern and Virginia Madsen. So there is an abundance of good acting performers in the movie in various roles.And the movie also have some pretty nice special effects, which were definitely super spectacular in 1999 as the movie was released. But I will say that the special effects actually still hold their own even in 2019, passing as something you could just as easily see in movies made today.And looking at the incredible details they put into the house, that is enough to boggle your mind. Actually the movie is worth sitting down to watch a second time, just to pay attention to the level of incredible detail they put into Hill House. It is spectacular, and there is just so much to see. I keep finding more details every time I sit down to watch it. So thumbs up, way, way, way up for the commitment put into the sets and props.The storyline told in ""The Haunting"" is pretty straight forward, actually to the point where it becomes generic in terms of a haunted house story. But hey, we know what we are in for when we sit down to watch a movie such as this. Regardless, I was - and still am - more than entertained by this movie when I have sat down to watch it over the years. So the movie does have enough contents to it to sustain more than a single viewing.While this is a supernatural haunted house movie in the horror genre, then the movie wasn't really scary to a seasoned horror veteran such as myself. But luckily it is the storyline and the suspense and building up the scenes that keeps the movie fresh and interesting.If you enjoy haunting movies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch the 1999 ""The Haunting"" if you haven't already seen it.",The Haunting
8,Quinoa1984,One of the best examples of how to NOT make a horror film,5,1 December 2000,"Ex-Cinematographer (of Die Hard) and now director Jan De Bont struck gold with Speed and while it wasn't gold, Twister wasn't a suck fest.  This is. I sat in the theater whacting this and thinking too myself, is anyone getting scared by this?  I mean I understand that it could be scary to some, back in 1920.  But now, immune systems have been built up againt horror films, and while they don't have to be gems to be good, they shouldn't have to sucfk like airplane toilets anyway.  The plot (with very little to do with the original and the book) involves a lady who can't sleep, so she goes to a big house hosted by a doctor (Liam Neeson) and with 2 other insomniacs (Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones) to find out why they can't sleep. But the doctor has more secrets that the others know, as the house becomes alive.  Some good visuals can't make up the fact that it is really dumb, with a horrible script, not good performances and stupid scares (the only one that was fair, which makes this film pass, is when Wilson looses his head).  Definately not for sharing.  D-",The Haunting
9,BandSAboutMovies,A poor remake,3,31 October 2018,"This version of The Haunting of Hill House went through several ideations and creative hands, starting with Wes Craven, who ultimately decided to make Scream instead. Steven Spielberg, this film's executive producer, had talked to Stephen King that 1963's The Haunting was a great starting point and that the Winchester Mystery House would be a great setting. However, the two had creative differences, with King ultimately leaving and creating Rose Red, his take on the story.Jan de Bont, who was the cinematographer on the Tippi Hedren project Roar (which we absolutely must get into soon), Cujo and Die Hard, as well as the director of Speed and Twister, is the director of the final product, which was a troubled shoot that had cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (father of Emily and Zooey) leave one week into filming.Exterior shots and the billiard room scenes use Harlaxton Manor -- the house from The Ruling Class -- as Hill House, while the interiors were filmed in a dome-shaped hangar in Long Beach, California that once housed Howard Hughes' gigantic Spruce Goose.Eleanor ""Nell"" Vance (Lili Taylor, The Conjuring) has just lost her home after caring for her invalid mother for more than a decade. She gets a call from Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson), who is conducting a study of insomniacs at Hill House, which will include Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson), Theodora (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and two of Marrow's research assistants.When they arrive at the foreboding house, they meet its caretakers, the Dudleys (Bruce Dern and theater actress Marian Seldes), who lock everyone into the mansion. Unknown to everyone involved, Dr. Marrow's doesn't intend to study insomnia, but instead how the body reacts to fear. He plans on slowly exposing everyone to increasing amounts of terror.That's when Dr. Marrow tells the story of Hill House, a place built by Hugh Crain, who built it for his wife and children, who all died at birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished and the tycoon became a recluse. One of the assistants doesn't believe this story and she's instantly injured, taking Marrow's two helpers out of the equation as they leave for the hospital.Before you know it, statues are coming to life, words are being written in blood and statues are trying to drown people. Turns out that Crain used orphans for child labor and would torture and kill them in his home before burning their bodies. He also had a second wife and Eleanor is a relative of the family who feels that she has to stay in the house to keep the children safe forever.Keep in mind -- this isn't a remake of the Robert Wise film, as the production company didn't get the rights and weren't allowed to replicate any of the shots from the original. Instead, they had to start from scratch.My biggest issue with this film is that has no real idea of what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a Disney style movie like The Haunted Mansion? Or is a gory shocker? Because if you want to see Owen Wilson get beheaded, well, good news. This is the movie for you. This is a CGI dependent affair and what was cutting edge in 1999 looks dated today, unlike the 1963 film which is timeless.",The Haunting
10,michaelRokeefe,A worn out plot with better special effects.,5,21 March 2000,"How many times have we seen a group of people lured into staying the night in the haunted Hill House? Liam Neeson plays a doctor seeking individuals with sleeping disorders. The participants have to deal with terror and the fear of dying. How can you sleep when visions come out of the drapes?
Neeson alone can't save this one. Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely ravishing. Equally impressive is the visual and sound effects. This movie had the room and the chances to be real scary, but it just laid there. I was begging for something to make me jump. Not this time.",The Haunting
11,hitchcockthelegend,Is it the devils spawn so many claim it is?,4,22 January 2009,"Dr. Marrow, for research purposes, assembles at a large Gothic mansion, a small group of people with apparent sleeping disorders. Once the group are all present strange things start to happen, it's as if the house is itself alive, with the focal point of the troubles seemingly being Eleanor Vance. Pretty soon all those involved in the research here at Hill House are literally going to be fighting for their lives, sleep problems are most definitely now the least of their worries.This remake of the popular and infinitely far better Robert Wise film, The Haunting 1963, threatens to at times be an engrossing and scary viewing experience. That it fails to become anything other than an extended MTV video lays at the feet of a director getting carried away with the tools available to him (Jan de Bont), and actors who are either miscast (Owen Wilson), not good enough (Catherine Zeta-Jones) or merely phoning it in (Liam Neeson). As good as the original Haunting was, it wasn't such a bad idea to remake it, the premise is first rate and was ripe for a modern audience, but what made Robert Wise's film so excellently chilling was its ability to unnerve you with what you didn't see, it was by definition a psychological horror, Jan de Bont went the other way and showed us everything in a big blur of CGI overkill.Some moments do have the desired affect, cherubs creep us out at regular intervals and the magnificent location of Belvoir Castle is utilised to great effect, but this only furthers the anger one feels when thinking what might have been. Of the sub standard cast only Lili Taylor comes out with any credit as the central character of Eleanor, but even she struggles as de Bont goes berserk with his toys, one chase sequence down the winding hall is hilariously bad and conjures up memories of Scooby Doo and Shaggy fleeing from some grumpy ghost. The Haunting 1999 is far from being horrendously bad, and it comes out nice on a good home cinema system, but it's well below average and not a film to revisit too often, I would think the makers and actors probably feel the same way too. 4/10",The Haunting
12,Theo Robertson,A Big Tease,3,20 January 2003,"There`s an old saying that you can fool all the people some of the time and THE HAUNTING proves this . You can just imagine the producers walking down to the marketing department and saying "" Remember to publicise the fact that Miss Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual and she`s stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman "" . It`s no coincidence that when this was released that every reviewer made the point that Catherine Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual who`s stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman . In fact there couldn`t be a single red blooded man who stood outside a cinema in the pouring rain waiting to see THE HAUNTING who wasn`t aware Miss Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman . Only problem is that the audience only finds out Miss Zeta - Jones character is bisexual is because she says so in one throwaway line and her sexuality is never followed up . She could be a celibate for all we know but no doubt a film where Catherine Zeta - Jones plays a celibate is a lot more difficult to market than one where she`s bisexual .That`s one good reason not to watch THE HAUNTING . Another good reason is the fact that becomes very obvious is the script was written around the tedious FX . The whole film degenerates into crap CGI and morphing effects which you`ve seen before in a hundred other - better - films.Note to Hollywood producers : Never EVER call bisexual or celibate characters Theo",The Haunting
13,Scarecrow-88,The Haunting,3,30 January 2010,"For the exception of Lily Tyler's admirable performance and some fantastic set decoration/art direction for the Hill House, this stinker of a remake should've forewarned others of attempts to revamp a classic horror film that didn't need such treatment. The rich dialogue and characterizations are gone, and in their place is the absolute dependency on CGI and a laughable developing plot that takes a giant dump on Jackson's classic story and Wise's superior companion film. I think the film just gets worse and worse as the house ""comes alive"", Hugh Crain's monstrous ghoul, in computer generated form(not to mention the awful children ghosts moving through curtains and bed sheets), wanting to stop Tyler from releasing ""his children"" from their eternal prison.Lily Tyler is the center of the movie, her sleuthing and the ghost children who depend on her to save them from the house's purgatory are of crucial focus, while the other cast members are just wasted in roles as characters who respond by considering her delusional, or constantly worried for her mental welfare..until they find that the owner of Hill House, Hugh Crain, still resides, as a benevolent spirit, in the vast mansion and estate, spending the remainder of the movie trying to find a method of escape. When the parts are right, actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Owen Wilson are at always worth watching, but in Jan de Bont's The Haunting they are given little to work with.Zeta Jones' bi-sexual sexpot is eye candy, but pales in comparison to the pitch-perfect performance of Claire Bloom's intellectual lesbian. Jones doesn't tease Tyler's character as Bloom did in the original, knowing how to toy with her easy prey, doing so lovingly, perhaps ill-advised considering the worsening state of Nell(..portrayed in the original by the incomparable Julie Harris).I think Tyler does well in the film, though, showing a woman damaged psychologically by the past, but her Nell(..nor the screenplay) doesn't dwell on the trauma caused by an ill, uncaring mother in the past. This remake focuses distinctly on the loopy plot of the children(..and a second wife murdered by Crain)communicating with Nell, and Crain trying to stop her from saving them, with the other characters running around or questioning how nuts she might be. Neeson's Dr. Marrow may be given star treatment, but he barely factors at all, and certainly his value is inferior to that of Richard Johnson from Wise's film. Marrow essentially is evaluating sleep-deprived insomniacs and their reactions to hysteria and fear, how such emotions derive from a house with a diabolical history. Wilson is the cynic who finds Nell to be whacked out and Marrow a creep, eyeing(reasonably so)the delicious Theo(Jones). The bloated f/x climax leaves much to be desired. A real bottom-of-the-barrel Hollywood bomb.",The Haunting
14,Doylenf,Handsome house of horrors ruled by special effects...,6,23 December 2006,"Whereas in the original B&W version of THE HAUNTING directed by Robert Wise, too much of the material was understated and made it seem as though nothing ever really happened, here we have the opposite--too much is seen and shown and not enough left to the imagination.But the production itself is a handsome one, including a house to die for and some rather startling special effects that become a bit tiresome after awhile. And the cast is an impressive one--LIAM NEESON as the doctor in charge of a dangerous experiment, CATHERINE ZETA-JONES, LILI TAYLOR, BRUCE DERN and MARIAN SELDES.After a slow start introducing the characters, it gradually builds suspense--but the effect is not startling enough even with all the special effects that were missing in the original. Some things are better left to the imagination (as, for example, Val Lewton demonstrated in THE CAT PEOPLE).Horror fans seemed to prefer the original--or perhaps audiences just rejected all the emphasis on special effects rather than leaving things shadowy and undefined, which sometimes increases the horror. At any rate, a disappointing film.",The Haunting
15,poolandrews,"Mildly entertaining big budget horror, nothing special but not too bad either.",5,27 July 2005,"The Haunting starts with Eleanor Vance, Nell for short, receiving a phone call telling her to take a look at an advert in a paper. An advert which is seeking people who suffer from sleeping disorders to take part in some research conducted by Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) as well as paying $900 a week she gets a roof over her head for free. Since Nell has just been chucked out of her flat & has no money this doesn't sound such a bad idea & gives Marrow a call. Nell is instructed to go to a huge Gothic cross between a castle & stately home 'Hill House' which in reality is called Harlaxton Manor & is located in England, once there she meets up with another test subject named Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), they talk about Theo's fetching thigh high boots for a bit & explore the House & eventually stumble upon the third & final volunteer, Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson). Then as if by magic Dr. Marrow himself makes an appearance along with a couple of assistants, Mary Lambetta (Alix Koromzay) & Todd Hackett (Todd Field). That night Mary suffers an accident & is taken to the hospital by Todd & strange things begin to happen, banging at doors, whispering noises & an overall feeling of unease. The house seems to be effecting Nell more than anyone else, it seems to be trying to tell her something, something about it's dark past that Nell can perhaps put right but there are evil forces at work that don't like house-guests...The big, no wait sorry at $80,000,000 massive budget remake of The Haunting (1963) was co-executive produced , along with an uncredited Steven Spielberg, & directed by Jan de Bont & I actually found it a reasonably entertaining way to pass an hour & fifty odd minutes. The script credited to David Self based on the novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' by Shirley Jackson had a re-write done on it by script doctor Michael Tolkin & maybe the reason it's a bit of a lightweight mess is because two separate writers worked on it at different times, maybe. The characters are dull & unoriginal with virtually no development at all, I didn't care about anyone except Zeta-Jones & even then only because she's a bit of a looker... The ghost story itself is weak, big bad ghost wants to kill everyone & generally be evil while one character has a sort of sixth sense to know what's going on while the others don't. It's all rather predictable, yawn. The Haunting is at it's best at the beginning when it relies on noises, spooky goings on & an air of mystery but unfortunately The Haunting then descends into a succession of CGI ghosts & special effects which are not scary in the slightest, from this point it's downhill all the way to the obligatory happy ending. On a positive note it moves along at a fair pace, it has a few decent sequences & it kept me entertained for it's duration. The one area where The Haunting does excel is with it's production design credited to Eugenio Zanetti which is both a wonderful asset but at the same time a problem. While the film undeniably looks sumptuous with some truly fantastic & grandiose sets which create a certain atmosphere I couldn't stop thinking that this was indeed a film I was watching, something very man-made, it all looks very fake & overblown. Technically The Haunting is top-notch & very polished throughout. There is no violence or gore besides a quick bloodless decapitation, this is family friendly horror all the way. The acting is pretty bad by all involved, Neeson looks embarrassed, Wilson is a crap actor whatever he's in & The Haunting's only saving grace is the delicious Zeta-Jones & her thigh high boots... The Haunting is a passable time waster of a film, there's nothing deep or meaningful here but it kept me quiet for a couple of hours. Everyone seems to hate it but I think it's just about worth a watch, definitely not the worst horror film I've seen but definitely not the best either.",The Haunting
16,lastliberal,"Purgatory is over, you go to hell.",4,5 June 2007,"There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones.This was basically a one woman show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.I don't know what director Jan de Bont's problem was. he did a great job with Speed and Twister. he really fell down on the job here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, else this would be the worst picture of 1999.Avoid at all costs.",The Haunting
17,Boba_Fett1138,Lacking in almost everything a good horror movie needs.,4,25 July 2005,"This movie is mainly lacking one essential part for an horror movie; scary moments. This movie never becomes close of being scary, mainly because the movie relies too much on its special effects rather than the story.Yes, the story really is the weakest part of the movie. I mean let's face it people, this movie is basically about nothing! The story doesn't seem to go anywhere as the movie progresses and in the ending the movie becomes more and more ridicules and implausible. The movie is truly lacking in scary moments also because the timing is just plain bad. Not once did this movie become scary or even tense.Still you have to give the movie credit for a few things. The actors are really superb. But why on Earth is the main character played by Lili Taylor, when you have a cast with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and even Bruce Dern? Lili Taylor is the least known actress of the cast but yet she plays the main part. Yes, I know she was kind of 'hot' in the '90's but noway near as 'hot' as Zeta-Jones at the time, who had just done ""The Mask of Zorro"" or Liam Neeson who just before this had done ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and ""Rob Roy"", ""Michael Collins"" and ""Schindler's List"" a few years before. Bruce Dern and also Virginia Madsen are terribly underused in this movie, I wouldn't describe their roles as anything more than just a cameo appearance.Also something that this movie deserves credit for is the look of it. Director Jan de Bont had always been inspired by Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", also back in his days as director of cinematography. This is really notable especially in this movie. There is nothing wrong with the fine cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, who used to be the director of cinematography of many Roland Emmerich movies and Caleb Deschanel who later dropped out due to creative differences. That's mildly put, Jan de Bont basically is a pain to work with for cinematographers because de Bont used to be a cinematographer himself for years. Cinematographer Don Burgess already also had left the set after 'differences' with de Bont during the filming of ""Twister"". The editing however is bad, I can't believe that it was Michael Kahn who worked on this movie!Persons who will be fairly entertained by this movie are the fans of special effects. There are some nicely made effects, which however are not scary and suitable for an horror movie of this type.It's not a completely unwatchable movie but still a weak and un-scary movie that most certainly is not recommendable.

18,view_and_review,Light Weight Scary Movie,4,11 January 2016,"This was a scary movie light. But come on, how bone chilling could it be with Owen Wilson as one of the lead characters? The problem with this haunted mansion movie was the heavy reliance upon CGI. It was like the production team was this little kid that found a new toy and couldn't get enough of it. It made any and all attempts at spooky and dreadful into cartoonish and hokie. Even the overall mood was too lively. There was no eerie mood set by the music, the lighting, the characters, or the dialog. The characters never displayed a true fear so how could the viewers?Besides the mansion being big, old, and ornate with disturbing statues and carvings--there was nothing scary at all. It was a very tame ""horror"" movie that had no horror and not even a good story.",The Haunting
19,neil-476,Not to be compared with the original,6,25 June 2012,"The original film of Shirley Jackson's seminal horror novel was a masterpiece of suggestion, its frisson of fear coming from the expectation of what might be just about to happen rather than, wallop, here it is, now look at it.Many of the classic black and white movies have been remade in colour in the (often justified) belief that a modern audience won't watch monochrome movies. The Haunting didn't escape.This remake, blessed with living colour, glorious set design, and state of the art special effects, does away with suggestion and dumps its supernatural manifestations right in your lap. It also does away with subtlety and, sadly, what might have been its saving grace, heart.What is left is a generic, going through the motions, last man standing haunted house movie which flounders and ultimately sinks under the weight of its voluminous and largely unnecessary special effects.If you've never seen the original then you may well enjoy it.

A group of individuals suffer from insomnia and are summoned to an isolated mansion for treatment. This mansion has a past as the heroine can hear the echoes and cries of children. The film contains an eerie soundtrack and startling images. Special effects are breathtaking with an ominous presence about to give the mansion its haunting appeal. Unfortunately the screenplay presents a formula story with a climax that becomes ridiculous. Director Jan De Bont allows it to get away on him. It is as if he was given all of the budget and he could not figure out what was needed. He made Speed, which is his one worthy film but this film is a tad better than his embarrassing Twister and Speed 2: Cruise Control. Of the ensemble cast Taylor seems interesting as she struggles to figure out the bizarre around her. She comes from a broken home only to learn that she has connections here that elevate to a laughable outcome. Liam Neeson passes as the doctor while Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Owen Wilson wander about as if bored. Bruce Dern plays the gate keeper who is suppose to look sinister and more or less over the top. Special effects are the one saver otherwise it is hauntingly bad. Score: 3 / 10",The Haunting

As in all horror stories, the characters never see it coming. Catherine thinks the atmosphere is wild and exciting, Owen thinks it's creepy but he's too busy making jokes and hitting on Catherine to really take his worries seriously, and Lili is preoccupied with keeping her own secrets hidden. But when the house starts to come to life, the four of them have to band together.Everyone knows I'm a total lightweight when it comes to scary movies, and this one was just scary enough to make me wary of going to sleep that night, but it didn't give me nightmares. The first part of the movie is really fun, because Owen's character is written to be hilarious and his delivery makes him more so. Catherine is beautiful, but she's not really given much to do, and Lili is sufficiently intriguing to keep audiences wondering what her real problems are. Once things started getting spooky, I knew it was time to grab my pillow, lest hiding became necessary. I'll watch almost anything with Owen Wilson or Catherine Zeta-Jones, so I was glad that I didn't need to hide behind my pillow.

As the days and nights pass, the group slowly begins to learn the terrifying secret behind the house's former owner. They soon realise that the house is pure evil, and they must battle a terrifying spirit to escape the house of nightmares......In a year bereft of extremely bad summer movies (phantom menace, wild wild west, entrapment), there is no surprise that this carried on the trend of bad releases.Directed by a man who made one good movie (speed) and then some truly abysmal summer fodder, De Bont proves to be a one trick pony and does himself no favours with this.This is nothing more than an effects showcase, and admittedly, while the effects and set design are truly stunning, it does nothing for the fact that the re-make is unnecessary and the casting is bad and the script is the worst of the year.Neeson looks embarrassed (he must have hated 1999, no wonder he wanted to retire), Wilson looks bemused. The only person who comes out of this relatively unscathed is Zeta-Jones, but this is probably because she was at the beginning of a relationship with one of the most powerful men in the business, and her previous two films were solid performers at the box office.The film isn't scary in the slightest, not even for a haunted house movie, and it has no sense of dread or emotion at all.See for the sole reason of De Bonts career at it's worse, and he directed Speed 2...",The Haunting

Then you get to look over the house then promptly two of the characters leave...leaving less fodder to be killed.  Then again this is a haunted house movie so that is ok.  Neeson, Wilson, Jones, and Taylor do all right at the beginning.  Then the cgi nightmare begins as every scare is like a cgi statue that anyone who isn't blind can tell is not really there.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Nothing could have saved The Haunting,1,24 November 2003,"The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction ""WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE"" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and ""bad sleeper"" Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words ""Welcome Home, Eleanor"", and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid.

26,OllieSuave-007,Nothing haunting about it.,4,25 June 2014,"A supposed remake to the 1963 film, The Haunting, this movie is about a group of people taking part in a sleep study at a mansion and then finding themselves getting caught in the middle of the house's sinister ghostly past.I remembered watching this movie on TV and from what I've remembered, it wasn't a very haunting movie. The plot wasn't very captivating, with nothing that really stands out that would grab your attention and in which you would find riveting; the story was filmed in a way that is a basic, ghost-on-the-loose movie. The acting was pretty bad, as there is limited character chemistry or development, and the special effects for the paranormal menaces were not sophisticated.A few frightening moments may jump out at you here and there and the chase scenes might be a tad exciting, but overall, there are much more scarier and intriguing horror flicks than this.Grade D",The Haunting
27,sddavis63,Silly Rather Than Scary,2,13 July 2019,"To be perfectly honest, I wasn't really expecting this movie to be particularly frightening. Any kind of horror movie - in this case a haunted house movie - works better through the environment it creates. This version of The Haunting - a remake of a 1963 original - fails abysmally on that count. The environment didn't work to create any chills or fear. The house was frankly too much - it was too big; there was too much in it. The special effects (which I suppose were intended to create fear) consisted of ridiculous looking creepy creatures for lack of a better way to describe them. They were disappointing. And because they were so front and centre little was left to the imagination. There were no chills - everything was in your face, which isn't the way to approach telling this kind of story. The story was kind of muddled, revolving around a psychologist who lures a group of people to this big mansion (not knowing that it's haunted) on the pretext of doing a sleep study but whose real intention is to conduct a study on fear and how people respond to it. Incidentally, he should have stuck to the sleep study because this did put me to sleep for a little bit (maybe 10 minutes?) at right about the halfway point. Maybe I missed something. I'm not sure. I couldn't be bothered going back to check.Not having great faith in a remake, I chose to watch this largely because of the strength of the cast. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson - and I find him as irritating as I usually do. But Wilson aside, I've generally liked the work of Liam Neesom and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lily Taylor. But they couldn;t save this. Taylor was probably the best of them (and was the central character) but Neesom and Zeta-Jones seemed to struggle with the admittedly weak dialogue they were given.It's a very disappointing movie that ultimately comes across as silly rather than scary and that doesn't do justice to the original.

28,Buddy-51,modern trashing of a great classic,2,16 August 1999,"Recently, Entertainment Weekly published a list of the ""25 Scariest Movies of All Time"", compiled by the employees of the magazine.  Clustered atop the list were the usual horror film suspects, fine films all:  ""The Exorcist"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Alien"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Halloween"".  Perhaps predictably, absent from the Top 25 were the horror films of yesteryear, particularly four films from what I consider to be the ""Golden Age"" of horror.  For in an amazing four year span, 1960-1963, a quartet of films, each released in a different year, emerged to lift the genre to heights it has not been able to reach again.  In 1960 came the great British sci-fi thriller, ""Village of the Damned""; in 1961, there was Jack Clayton's brilliant ghost story, ""The Innocents""; then, in 1962 came the piece de resistance, what, for me, is the greatest horror film of all time, Herk Harvey's low budget masterpiece of eeriness, ""Carnival of Souls""; finally, in 1963, Robert Wise directed the classic haunted house spectacular, ""The Haunting"", based on Shirley Jackson's novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"".  Each of these films share, in addition to their effective use of black-and-white photography and haunting musical scores, an appreciation of the power of suggestion, their realization that true terror lies in the imagination and that a creepy mood counts for more than inane gruesomeness and heavy handed special effects that just end up detracting from the horror.  (I would include ""Night of the Living Dead"" on my list except that it was released in 1968).Now, with the new version of ""The Haunting"", each of these films has been subjected to the indignity of a modern day remake.  Jan De Bont's version is a travesty on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin, but each of its many failures stems from a basic problem of modern commercial moviemaking:  wretched excess.  The first element that makes it inferior to the original is one that probably can't be avoided in this day and age; the simple fact that black-and-white is far more effective a medium in establishing the kind of eerie atmosphere necessary for this type of tale. In color, the picture is simply too clean and bright and one loses the sense of danger hidden in the shadowy corridors and corners of the house.  And the house itself creates a problem.  For although the art direction is a true miracle of design and decor, it actually detracts from the suspenseful ambience the film so desperately wants to achieve.  Even Hill House has to be realized on a scale of some believability.  In the original film, the rooms looked as if someone might one day have actually lived in them.  Here, the setting is so preposterously ornate that the house looks more like a museum or grand fun house than a center of ghostly activity.The film fails far more dismally on the level of its screenplay.  In the original story and film, the parallels between past and present that connected Eleanor, the protagonist, to Hill House were worked out with such a fine logic that they helped hold the plot together.  For instance, an earlier inhabitant of the house was a bed-ridden invalid who had to be looked after just as Eleanor had looked after her ailing mother.  Also, the car crash that kills Eleanor in the original is presage by a carriage accident which kills one of the earlier inhabitants and which begins the curse that befalls this house that, as the originals claim, was ""born bad"". In the remake, the house has no logical reason for choosing Eleanor so the plotting degenerates into arbitrary silliness.  Indeed, part of the fun of the original was the atmosphere of anticipation that came from knowing this house had a reputation for evil and the slowly dawning realization that it was searching for a new victim.  In the new film, this is never established and, in fact, the characters aren't gathered to hunt for ghosts at all, but have been lulled there by a researcher, ostensibly to help them cope with their insomnia, but actually to function as guinea pigs in a study of the effects of fear on the personality.  Yet, this is inexplicable because the doctor has nothing to do with the ghostly phenomena and, in fact, doesn't believe in its existence, so, by what method was this fear to be manifested? This is typical of the illogic that permeates the film.  And, of course, all the sexual tension between the doctor and Eleanor is completely eliminated from this version.The ultimate indignity comes in the film's appalling final half hour when any attempt to replicate the subtlety of the original film is abandoned in favor of overblown special effects and lines like ""Hugh Crane, I'm not afraid of you!"".  By this time, the audience has erupted into bursts of incredulous laughter and Hollywood has succeeded in trashing yet another of its classic films.",The Haunting

I was very scary and you really did feel like there were ghosts behind you and from every other direction. It was most impressive.HOHH tried to be quick and frenetic.

30,tabuno,A Bold Experiment In Horror,7,13 January 2019,"21 May 2016. Lili Taylor starred as Nell in The Haunting (1999) around the same time that co-stars Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta-Jones were starting out in their own film careers. Lili's character in The Haunting was an amazing transformation as a sexy love interest of Ben Affleck's character in the super action blockbuster at the time Armageddon (1998) starring Bruce Willis along with Owen Wilson again as a co-star to a dowdy, care taker in The Haunting. Director Jan de Bont attempt at a different, creative special effect atmospherics is notable as the haunting ambiance presents an somewhat original eerie, almost living entity of an entire mansion. Yet de Bont's experiment with his special effects doesn't seem to quite have the same shocking horror value as one finds in Thir13n Ghosts (2001) or The Haunting of Hill House (1999) release as a remake of the 1959 version all based on similar written source material.What does make The Haunting stand out is the singular focus on the one character Nell, somewhat reminiscent of The Cell (2000), Cube Zero (2004) or Dark Water (2005) as well as the overall tone and outlook of the movie which isn't as common as other haunted house movies. But at the same time, it also makes The Haunting also somewhat more mundane for such a movie genre which was later more effectively captured in Soulmates (2013), or The Awakening (2011). For a even more intense haunting experience, Silent Hill (2006) or 1408 (2007) is suggested.",The Haunting
31,jacobjohntaylor1,One of the best horror movies ever,10,2 June 2015,This is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. People to say this not a good just because it is a remake. People are narrow minded about remakes. People say the original 1963 version is better just because it is the original. The only good thing about the original this that it is a precursor to this movie. The original did have an interesting concept. A doctor takes people to an old house and tell him it is haunted as an experiment to see how they will react. And turns out the house real his haunted. It gets ruined by a week script. An awful ending. And mediocre acting. This one has the same concept and the same story line and characters. But a mush strange script and mush better acting. A mush better ending. Of course the special effects are better. Don't even bother with the 1963 original version that is just overrated cheesy and lame. Just see this one. This is of the scariest movie ever. See it. Do not lesson to people who say this is no good and the original is better. If you want to see a really scary movie you see this one. This a great movie. This movie is very intense. I do not get scared of what I do not see. I can always go for walk in the woods and not see ghosts. I jumped a few time the fist time I saw this movie in the theaters. That did not happen when I watched the lame original on TV. It happened when when I watch The original Psycho on TV. I like a good scary movie. That is way like this movie.,The Haunting

33,filipemanuelneto,A funny light horror movie which is not truly a remake.,4,18 December 2016,"This film seeks to be a remake of the 1959 film ""House on Haunted Hill"". As in this film, the action takes place in an isolated and allegedly haunted house, with a mysterious and painful past, which is watched over by a couple of caretakers who refuses to sleep there, so everyone is left alone in the mansion at night. But the similarities end here because this story is totally new. If the original film's action took place during a birthday party, the reason for the stay in the house is now a scientific study of fear, disguised as a study of insomnia. So, comparing both films ends up being inglorious. As a remake, ""The Haunting"" sucks. But if we want to forget the 1959 film and see this production as something entirely new, although inspired by an earlier work, we can see this film from another perspective, perhaps more prudent and just.The actors in the film did a relatively decent job. The cast was led by Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. By virtue of their roles, Neeson and Taylor stood out, him with his skepticism and calm gradually fading away, she acting increasingly emotionally as she discovers the story behind the house. However, they have not always been up to the challenge, particularly Neeson, who seems unable to get into the spirit of the film. Sometimes the actors make small mistakes, exaggerate the theatricality, but this is due, in my opinion, to the bad management of Jan de Bont, a good cinematographer but definitely an incapable director and producer.Another problem with this film is the lack of sense of rhythm. The movie has two hours and a little bit, but the first hour is almost entirely spent introducing the audience to the subject, the mansion and so on. Not a single scare. The second hour is that it truly tries to scare us. The film also has enormous difficulties in provoking suspense and grabbing audience's attention through a mysterious and frightening atmosphere. The mansion's setting is fantastic and helps but it's not enough. The picture could be darker at certain times and sound effects are very poor. To make matters worse, the film seeks to frighten us through absolutely hilarious special effects, which end up having the opposite effect and make the public laugh.In short, it's a reasonable light horror movie, which is seen without great scares or expectations. The strongest point ends up being the house and the scenarios. I would definitely buy a house like that. Not being a true remake, it turns out to be funny because of it's poor special effects.",The Haunting
34,TheMovieDiorama,The Haunting may have spooked the visual effects department.,4,7 October 2018,"""The special effects will leave you terrified"". Umm yeah, it sure did! That budget was off the chain! $80,000,000!? Granted they've aged beautifully like a fine ghostly wine and actually give this remake some charm, but talk about over-visualisation. So, I've yet to watch the original which I've heard is a vastly superior horror film. After seeing this, I probably would agree as this is an absolute failure in terms of horror. However, viewing it as a mystery is a different story, and I slowly became invested in the legend of Hill House. Participants who suffer from insomnia take part in an experiment by being isolated in a luscious mansion that turns out to be haunted. Utilising a psychological perspective to masquerade the hauntings that occur has been done before, therefore this remake offers nothing new. In fact, it's fairly generic. Offering zero scares, no suspense and limited thrills. The acting was fine although laughably horrific occasionally, particularly from Owen ""Wow"" Wilson (I counted five times!) who looks utterly out of place. The high quality visual effects, as astounding as they are, diminish the integrity of the story. It really is more (cue Wilson voice) ""Wow! Look at that ghostly mirror!"" instead of ""Wow! I'm so invested in this story, what's going to happen next?"". The ending was predictably underwhelming and the sense of familiarity eclipsed the gorgeous production design. The mansion's interior design had a character of its own, exuding grandeur and regality. Forget about Neeson and Zeta-Jones, Hill House is the most investable ""character"" in the entire film. Strangely though, the story's mystery kept me intrigued (despite watching 'Scary Movie 2'), with each room hosting an array of clues regarding the owner's fate. It atleast made the film watchable. The Haunting may not contain anything remotely scary or exciting, but the technical aspects may keep you intrigued if you haven't watched the original. I don't know about you, but I automatically thought of Disney's 'Haunted Mansion' whilst watching this.",The Haunting

This is one of those movies that still gets my blood pumping, no matter how many times I've seen it. Every scene is a veritable feast of visual effects and psychological stimulation. If you liked the ""Amityville Horror,"" or ""House on Haunted Hill,"" you will absolutely LOVE this movie. There are no hokey effects, no trite dialog, no sloppily delivered lines and no failures in setting, scenery or prop detail. This movie delivers a solid, professional and delightfully scary end product which will make an excellent addition to ANY movie library.If you've enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend House on Haunted Hill, Poltergeist 1 and 2, Disney's Haunted Mansion, The Entity, The Bat, and the original The Haunting.It rates a solid 9.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Haunting
38,elshikh4,"""No, I Didn't !""",1,20 February 2009,"How this doctor managed to pay the rent for this huge castle? How a poor girl like (Lili Taylor)'s character afforded the journey to this one-of-its-kind therapy? (Or was it on the house?). How the doctor was that stupid to invite all of those guests to something else what he told them (they could've easily sued him to jail later!). What is the need for transforming (Catherine Zeta-Jones)'s character into a bisexual? What (Owen Wilson) is doing in this movie exactly? He even wasn't a satisfying jerk! We hear (Liam Neeson) says something about ""Mr. Dudley will fix everything"" though there is no Mr. Dudley at all!? Why the CGI wasn't scary or whatsoever? Why the unjustifiably eerie gatekeeper locked all the castle's doors? Why the castle's evil dark owner seemed in his photos like someone wearing a wolverine shoddy mask in a bad Halloween day?!! Why a fine actress like (Lili Taylor) wasn't suitable enough to be the lead? And why oh why the so desperate desire from the movie's makers to remake an old movie even by resorting to the original novel, since they didn't own the movie's rights??I think the answer for that last question can answer all the previous as well. Hollywood lately lives a bankrupt when it comes to good ideas. So they relied on the old story, hired the big names, and saved some extra money for the massive expensive sets by hiring a small name, as the lead actress, then made enough CGI, and the rest is history, humbug history! They gave the director chair to someone who with all the cleverness in the world couldn't make a good thing out of flat script. It's simply the case when nearly everything is high, except the screenplay. You can sense the bad irony during the whole movie: Grand music, dull characters. Great décor, trivial storylines. Good direction, idiot movie! It's all in the cheery music of the revolving ring that the movie concludes itself with; it's more like: ""Thank you for visiting our amusement center"" which wasn't any amusing by the way!So in the end, when the gatekeeper, played - for no reason - by Oscar Nominee (Bruce Dern), asked (Neeson)'s character the philosophical question: ""Did you find what you've been looking for, doctor?!"" I was laughing in bitter sarcasm on 2 hours that I had lost from my life and freely, responding instead of (Neeson): ""No, I didn't. But the producers in Hollywood maybe found what they've been looking for since the oldest times; the money that I paid for renting this. Though dear gatekeeper, I'll tell you what, they were making this kind of movies better and scarier in the past. Hmmm, I'll let you rest now, there is a lot of mess that you'll going to vacuum-clean inside, good day folks, taxi..""",The Haunting

I heard it got alot of bad reviews but hey i Never listen to the Critics anyway as i usually like what they usually hate!!! The Haunting is a classy & lavished movie filled with a beautiful & richness to it's stunning production design & look, this is a beautiful looking movie when we get to the huge old mansion. Now i love the little ensemble cast with the legendary Liam Neeson as Dr. Marrow who gets together a small group of people who have trouble sleeping so he brings them to Hill House to run some experiments on them & this group consists of the funny & chilled out Luke (the always fun Owen Wilson) the beautiful Theo ( Catherine Zeta-Jones) & the lonely & lost Nell (Lili Taylor) & each give a really good performance & create a bunch of nice characters that i enjoy watching. Now this is a Mystery movie too so not everything is what it seems & we learn that Dr. Marrow had over secret plans to document what happens when people are scared & how they each react to fear but as the story goes he didn't know the place was really haunted. It's a fun setup & i got a feel of what a Ghostbusters movie could've been like in the 90's that we never got as it's spooky & scary in bits but never too terrifying or too threatening & with Neeson's Dr. Marrow feeling like a Spengler or Stantz type who even has an assistant who very much resembles Genine Melnitz, so that's all fun & also this film has the Casper (1995) feel too with it's gorgeous, lavish & extremely rich & detailed production design & look, also the music is really lovely with a sadness to it that also reminded me of the gorgeous score for Casper as both had these really lovely playful but sad scores. The beautiful score here is done by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith & the movie was produced by Spielberg so it's got that best of the best richness to everything just like Casper had too.
Jan De Bont really done a superb job with directing the Thriller parts, the scary parts, the big c.g.i bits while still keeping a fun sense of wonder to it all. The c.g.i is abit dated but i like that as it's a product of it's time the Awesome 90's when Horror had a big comeback. The Haunting is extremely underrated & unloved but I've always enjoyed it & find it to be such a gorgeous late-night Ghost story with such a great little cast & one of the most amazing looking haunted houses ever put on screen!!!!
There's lots to love in The Haunting & i will always enjoy it. Great Supernatural fun.",The Haunting
40,drownnnsoda,"Nice Visuals And Atmosphere, But Pretty Bad In Comparison With The Original.",5,31 October 2006,"""The Haunting"" is a so-so remake of the horror classic. The plot is the same as the original for the most part, a quiet woman named Eleanor (Lilli Taylor) goes to an old mansion called Hill House to take part of an insomnia study for those who suffer from the disorder. There she meets the flamboyant Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke (Owen Wilson), a quirky baseball player, whom are both insomniacs. And there is Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson), who is conducting the study. Eleanor seems to have a strange bond with the house and begins hearing voices and seeing small children in her bedroom at night while she is sleeping, and learns of the dark past of Hill House, involving the man who built the home, Hugh Crane. Things then begin to turn violent, and the house literally comes to life, trying to kill anyone who is inside.When you compare the 1963 film with this, this remake seems like mediocre trash, because the original film is a horror masterpiece. This film, while nowhere close to the original, is still a decent little horror movie anyway, but you have to dismiss knowledge of the original, otherwise you'll more than likely hate it. This remake relies more on special effects rather than the shadowy atmosphere that the original had, but it still has a pretty effective atmosphere. In this film, the house is much more menacing and has a unique and very macabre style. The doors throughout the entire house are about fifteen feet high, and each of the rooms are very large, with vaulted ceilings and a Gothic tone to them. The entire house itself is really amazing actually, they did a pretty good job at creating a one-of-a-kind home to set the story in. The CGI visuals are impressive and look pretty neat, but they add a feeling of cheapness to the movie that I felt could have been done without. I wish this film would have fashioned the style that made the original so scary - that menacing, subtle, and shadowy eeriness. But the filmmakers opted for the in-your-face computer animation to get some jolts out of the audience, and I wasn't all too happy with that. The acting isn't bad, everyone turned in good performances and I didn't feel anything was overplayed or underplayed. There are a few good shock scenes and some spooky things that occur, but the film isn't anything really too scary.While the original film is miles better than this, ""The Haunting"" remake is still a decent little haunted house movie that is entertaining and enjoyable enough to watch. Don't expect anything better or even close the original, because it would be nearly impossible to top Robert Wise's classic. If you don't mind some cheesy haunted house fun though, there's worse ways to waste a couple of hours. 5/10.",The Haunting
41,davispittman,A pretty poor remake,3,30 June 2015,"First of all the acting in this movie is just atrocious, it's awful. I like Catherine Zeta Jones's work but even her acting was bad. Owen Wilson was the worst casting choice in this entire movie, in fact, that might be one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen in any movie, is acting and here was just so bland and fake. Liam Neeson wasn't a horrible choice for the lead, although he wasn't great. What I don't like is this movie is not scary at all it's just not! Also the filmmakers overused CGI to where it looked cheap. I watched the original from the 1960's and I wasn't a fan, I didn't like it at all, but the remake is even worse than the original. I guess it suffices to say that I'm just not a haunting fan at all. Also the script and the dialogue in this remake is just so bland and boring. If you are a true horror movie thing and then this is not a movie you want to see. It's really just an insult to all horror movies because it's just not scary. I do feel bad for the audience that was really excited to see this, meaning the fans of the original, I feel bad that they were horribly let down. Now I know that the original from the 1960s is held up high as a horror movie classic, personally I don't get that, I did not like it at all, but it's just not my cup of tea I guess. The one word that comes to mind when I think of the haunting from 1999 is just plain boring. Do yourself a favor and watch insidious instead of this.

First of all, this film relied too heavily on boffo CGI, and then it relied on the audience to suspend belief and expect Lili Taylor to carry the film (when she is really an indie star). Sure, it had Liam Neeson and the sensual Catherine Zeta-Jones (before she made Michael Douglas one of the luckiest men on earth). Jan De Bont's career definitely took a dive after this.

I don't get scared by haunted house stories too easily.  I need more than that, like DeNiro attacking my houseboat or the Devil possessing my daughter.The actors had fun making it, I hope, cause I doubt anyone watching had much fun at all.

45,ShootingShark,Quality Haunted House Yarn But Doesn't Do Justice To The Book,6,30 June 2007,"A psychologist researching fear invites Eleanor, Theo and Luke - three insomniacs with unstable personalities - to Hill House, a forbidding Gothic mansion. When ghostly noises and spectral visions start to haunt Eleanor in particular, her fragile psyche starts to crack and her soul is in danger of being trapped forever by the evil house.This is a thrilling, scary, brilliantly-designed haunted house flick, with a good cast and fantastic spooky imagery. Its one big flaw is that as an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's classic 1959 novel The Haunting Of Hill House, it's rubbish, both in comparison to the book and the spine-tingling 1963 film version. The first third is reasonably faithful but then it goes in completely another direction, inventing a standard fairy-tale mythology and warping the lead character of Nell into someone unrecognisable. In the book she's a childish, self-obsessed, neurotic but chillingly recognisable narcissist, whereas here she's some sort of avenging ghostbuster. If you take it as a movie in its own right however, it's a lot of fun; best of all is Eugenio Zanetti's amazing production design - the house is an incredible ramble of Gothic madness, peppered with hellish gargoyles, marble columns, gargantuan spaces and bizarre decor. The cast are all good actors stuck with a slightly lame script, although Taylor really gives it her all, but it's a movie where the characters are pretty much a distraction from the marvellous sets and nifty special effects (by Phil Tippett and Craig Hayes). With exteriors shot at Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire, and a grandiose score by horror expert Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen, Alien, Poltergeist), this is fine horror fare, confidently lensed by Dutch former cameraman DeBont. It's scary stuff, but it's not a patch on the book, which is one of the best horror novels ever written and will leave you shivering for a week.",The Haunting
46,Spleen,I admit my remarks may not be ENTIRELY to the point...,3,15 August 2000,"I promised myself that the next time I wrote about a Dreamworks film I'd mention how much I loathe their logo.  I now have the perfect opportunity. We all know, in this case, that the film following the logo is bad: you don't need me to tell you THAT.Jesus! how could they come up with something so awful?  Universal's globe (it looked great in the 1960s), MGM's lion, Columbia's torch-bearing lady (especially the older version, with the prism effect), J. Arthur Rank's gong, the Archers' target (my personal favourite), the Twentieth Century Fox monolith, Disney's castle, RKO's radio tower, even, perhaps, Paramount's unremarkable mountain ... all of these had class, some of them had poetry, some a decent fanfare.  Dreamworks gives us an ill-composed image of a small child (aw, how cute) fishing (aw, how cute) from a crescent moon (aw, how cute), surrounded by smudges of blue fairy-floss (aw, how cute - gag, choke), complete with tinkly music.The very name - ""Dreamworks"" - annoys me.  Schoolteachers, after telling small children the difference between ""its"", the possessive, and ""it's"", the contraction, should caution them to NEVER use the word ""dream"" to refer to anything other than those odd things we experience when we're asleep.  It's an insult to works of fiction to call them, or compare them to, dreams. (People also use the word ""dream"" as if it were synonymous with ""desire"", as if the word ""desire"" were too crude.  I disapprove of this, too.)  But I if Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg want to suggest that they're in the business of producing dull, slap-dash, rambling works of fiction - or perhaps by ""dreams"" they mean naked wish-fulfilment -, that's their affair.Anyway, about the film.  To be honest, I don't care of a film, any film, if it scares me or not.  (""Creepshow 2"", of all things, frightened me, while ""The Shining"" didn't; I certainly shouldn't conclude that the former is a better film than the latter.)  The problem with the cartoony, computer-generated ghosts is not that they're not frightening, nor even that they don't look real (what would real ghosts look like?); rather, they make one think, ""If there WERE ghosts, and they DID look like that, what would be so great about them?""  The story flops hither and yon in a confused daze, the group dynamics ditto (every so often you can hear Jan de Bont saying, ""Ah, to hell with all this character stuff""), and Owen Wilson plays the kind of person who would try to repair a broken television set by pulling it and sticking his head in, while the power's on.

Then, all of a sudden, Theo asks if it's one of Luke's sick jokes, considering that they've known each other for 30 minutes and Luke hasn't made even one single joke before that. Second, people start thinking that Nell is having a mind disturb due to the fear and the scariness; then, instead of doing everything to not scare her anymore, Theo leaves her in that creepy big room by herself - turning the lights off and closing the door before leaving, oh yea of course.

49,slayrrr666,Spooky Haunted House film,9,17 August 2005,"""The Haunting"" is a far better film than what most would believe.**SPOILERS**After her mother's death, Eleanor (Lili Taylor) is desperate to get over her feelings of despair. Research Scientist Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) is searching for subjects to participate in a study on sleep disorder, and Eleanor is a perfect candidate. Accepted, she travels to Hill House, the site of an infamous massacre years ago, and meets up with the other subjects of the experiment Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). After the usual introductions are done, Dr. Marrow briefs everyone about what they are doing and the purpose of the experiment. After an accident nearly ruins the experiment, Dr. Marrow decides to carry on. That night, strange banging noises haunt Eleanor and Theo as they try to sleep. The next day, she begins to see and experience strange events in the house. Trying to convince Theo and Luke that Dr. Marrow isn't interested in sleep deprivation doesn't work, but it brings Eleanor close to a secret that even Dr. Marrow didn't know about and that could bring the house down around them.The Good News: OHMYGOD! This has one of the creepiest houses ever in a horror film I've ever seen. It has the perfect blend of Gothic atmosphere and modern touches. It has an overall feeling of dread and suspense. With it's long, winding corridors, creature-busts for decorations, and artwork that is just as creepy as spending an eternity in hell itself, this house is just as creepy as the original. It is big and cavernous, and yet confining. These two ingredients are essential in creating the perfect haunted house movie, and the third ingredient is one of my favorite rules for haunted house is the ""things that shouldn't be doing that/that shouldn't be there"" philosophy. I love when haunted house films do that. If it's done right, it is an effective scene that really brings out the suspense of a movie. This movie does it right by keeping the first part of the film as a mystery as to why it's haunted, and the second half as a series of clues to lead us to a terrifying secret about the house. For the first half, though, we don't know the secret, and therefore we are left with a very spooky haunted house film. By making it just a spooky film, the paintings looking at us, the walls moving, it adds to create an atmosphere that very few haunted house films have created. There is one standout scene that really goes to prove this: as Eleanor is lying bed, she sees a black shadow enter the room on the ceiling and go over to her doorway. As the shadow gets to the doorway, it causes the archways in the door to raise, and it lights up these two red crystals. When it finishes, it appears that the door is looking at Eleanor with this demonic impression, and it is a very creepy scene. The ghosts are sometimes pretty creepy, and the way they interact with the cast is some great shocks. The one death in the film is one of the highlights. After attacking a picture of the owner of the house, the ghosts strike the person in the back and knock them onto a carpet. The carpet is dragged over to the fireplace, where it has a lion's head for a swing. The lion then opens its mouth and decapitates them, right in front of the rest of the group. There are many more different scenes that give some good chills, but would take up too much space to describe in detail. I even enjoyed the two different tones to the film. The mysterious first half is very well done, but the puzzle painted in the second half is very well thought out and is a bit out into left field, but it does make the movie seem a lot smarter than it probably is to some people.The Bad News: Despite one of the classic scenes from the original being cleverly homage in a scene that really sticks out since it doesn't follow the tone of the rest of the movie, this has one very classic mistake: the ghosts are shown. There are several scenes where we see the ghosts up close, and that really irritates me. This is the only real complaint: the ghosts are far too visible far too often.The Final Verdict: This is a better film than most admit to, but it really isn't all that bad. It has loads of suspense, a chilling house, and standout performances, all combining into a film that is a bit underrated. Watch this late at night with the lights out, and this might give you a few chills.Rated PG-13: Mild Violence, some language, and themes involving abused children",The Haunting

51,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Haunting"" (1999)- The subtle development and mature storytelling of the original are traded for loud special effects and lazy filmmaking in this trashy remake.",3,9 May 2017,"In 1963, director Robert Wise unleashed onto the world a pure vision of terror with his film ""The Haunting"", based on Shirley Jackson's earlier novel ""The Haunting of Hill House."" An incredibly nuanced and subtle exercise in fear and psychological drama, Wise's film is a incredible achievement by any stretch of the imagination, and to this very day it remains an important and beloved masterwork of horror. Some (myself included) would go so far as to call it one of the greatest horror films ever made....so why not put the remake in the hands of a director known for effects-driven action schlock? What's the worst that could happen? Oh, yeah... the worst that could happen is exactly what DID happen- it's a complete mess!Jan de Bont's 1999 release ""The Haunting"" (which is most certainly not based on the 1959 William Castle film ""House on Haunted Hill"", despite several other reviews incorrectly stating this) is one of the more notorious remakes of the past twenty years, in no small part thanks to its complete and utter misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the works that inspired it. Released in the late-90's heyday of then- modern digital effects and in-your-face thrills, the film is a complete and utter betrayal of the original. It takes the careful, methodical and subdued storytelling of the original and replaces it with on- the- nose set and production design and a plethora of ""Boo!"" scares. It takes the thoughtful and mature character development from that amazing film and replaces it with the broadest and most hackneyed of clichés and stereotypes. And it takes the subtlety of the Robert Wise classic and destroys it by smacking you in the head with its blatancy in every single scene. It's complete trash to the original's treasure.We follow a group of insomniacs who agree to be a part of a study on their condition, set to be held in Hill House- a mansion built in the 19th century by eccentric textile tycoon Hugh Crain. However, things are not what they seem, and the director of the experiment, Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) has actually lured the group there under false pretenses. He instead is seeking to study the effects of fear. Soon enough, it becomes all too clear that something is amiss in Hill House, and that the spirits of the past wander the hallways at night. And for some reason, group member Eleanor ""Nell"" Vance (Lili Taylor) in particular seems to attract the attention of the ghosts around her...To give the film what little credit is due, there are some positive aspects of the production that I could certainly see working with a better script and in the hands of a more confident and clever filmmaker. Lili Taylor makes for a magnificent protagonist and is splendid in a slightly modernized update of the character portrayed by Julie Harris in the 1963 classic. She's the only aspect of the film that felt like it could have fit in perfectly with the original. (Thankfully, she fulfilled this promise recently when she co-starred in the wonderful haunted-house thriller ""The Conjuring"", which finally made good use of her talents.) I also found the cinematography to be stunning, and the film does look oft-gorgeous. Director de Bont got his start as a cinematographer, so he knows hot to compose a shot, and he works well with DP Karl Walter Lindenlaub.Unfortunately, pretty pictures and a good lead performance do little to combat the negative effects of a contrived script and numerous sequences that are tonally confused at best... and brainlessly nonsensical at worst. The film can never seem to settle on what it wants to be... it tries its hardest to strike fear with Gothic set designs and digitally-assisted jump-scares a-plenty... yet it also wants to be a whimsical and uplifting story about how the ""power of love"" (ugh) can save the spirits of the damned. So you get a series of jarring and awkward sequences that radically shoot back and forth between two opposing tones in a very inorganic way.The ""horror"" of the film is poorly handled, and generally revolves around cartoonish ""ghosts"" that waft through the air with all the grace of a crumpled paper airplane and hilariously tacky digital renderings of the house suddenly ""morphing"" into devious shapes while horns shriek in the background. I'm not one to bad-mouth digital trickery and computer-generated effects... but they need to be used in moderation in key places to be effective in the confines of a horror film. Here, de Bont seems content with throwing as much at the screen as possible, giving it a kitschy ""made for TV"" kids-movie vibe. It's like one of the bad episode of ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" with a budget. It's lazy, trite and completely without atmosphere.And to top it off, the story and the characters are all lazily handled and mind-numbing thanks to a script that can only be described by the word ""hack."" Co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as a character named ""Theo"", whose only development involves showing off her barely- covered breasts and piling on references to her bisexuality. The story-line is incredibly dumbed-down and every major development smacks you in the face like a brick due to over- explanation. And without spoiling anything... the climax is completely out of left field, preposterous and anything but climactic.Jan de Bont is clearly trying to make the crazed 90's roller-coaster version of Robert Wise's film. And he's relishing in adding in as many loops, twirls, cork-screws and drops to its tracks as possible. But he's made one fatal flaw... he's wasted so much time on aesthetics, he's forgotten to add in the cars for people to enjoy his roller-coaster. And thus, we're left with something that looks exciting on the outside... but it completely empty and without any real fun or purpose.""The Haunting"" is a 3 out of 10.",The Haunting

Q: What are the odds that the house is actually haunted? A: Astronomically higher than the odds that the viewer will find any of it legitimately frightening. Clumsy attempts at jump scares aplenty, hamstrung further by overabundant (and below-average) CGI and the mistaken belief that ""more"" is ""scarier,"" this ludicrous haunted house picture gets worse as it goes along, and is convoluted-but-dumb enough to be mistaken for a parody (the setup would vaguely serve as the basis for an actual spoof movie, the second ""Scary Movie"").

The film is not subtle at all and when the floodgates of paranormal activity begin. It's a barrage of CGI that has everything from furniture to stone sculptures springing to life and attacking. Like I said before the movie it's a ton of fun and a truly rare example of an imaginative Hollywood reimagining with a budget so that the director of Speed and Twister can do everything his little heart desires. One of my faves.Budget: $80M

55,BrandtSponseller,The battle of the versions,8,19 June 2005,"Let's get this out of the way first. I like this remake of The Haunting better than I like Robert Wise's 1963 version of the film. However, the discrepancy between the two in my eyes on this viewing is nowhere near my last viewing in 1999, when I felt the remake was a 10 and the original a 6. My opinion of the original has gone up slightly, to a 7, and my opinion of this film has gone down two points, to an 8.Still, I can't see how someone can like the original film a lot and dislike this remake. There are more things about them that are similar than most folks admit. A lot of the negative views on the remake seem centered on CGI and other special effects. I think that puts a disproportionate emphasis on one element of the film, and it's not as if the Wise film was really devoid of effects, although I agree it had far less.Most folks think the original is scary and this one isn't. Maybe that's part of the problem. I don't think any films are scary and I never have. Fear is just not an emotion I can get from films.Like the 1963 film, the focus here is on Eleanor (Lili Taylor). The premise is basically the same, if some of the details have been changed. An academic researcher, Dr. David Morrow (Liam Neeson), wants to study the fear response, especially as it relates to group interaction. Morrow poses a ruse to get research subjects. He says he's going to be doing an insomnia study. He draws a few participants, including Eleanor, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson), to a huge old mansion--more like a palace--called ""Hill House"". He invents a story based on the true one (per the film's world) about the history of Hill House and plants the juiciest details with Luke, along with an instruction to keep quiet about it lest he scare Theo and Eleanor. Of course, Luke blabs, and soon afterward, spooky things begin happening. But is Dr. Morrow behind the strange occurrences or is there really something supernatural going on at Hill House? What will happen if the participants discover the truth behind Dr. Morrow's experiment? And why does Dr. Morrow, or whoever is behind the ""haunting"", appear to be picking on Eleanor? Director Jan de Bont gives strong nods to the original film in the remake's script, and he even goes so far as to recreate performances, specific shots and sequences. The strongest recreation of a performance is a minor one--Marian Seldes' Mrs. Dudley, who delivers the infamous speech about the ""rules"" of the house and her and her husband's caretaking habits with almost identical dialogue and intonation as Rosalie Crutchley's Mrs. Dudley in Wise's film. But all of the principal cast members are directed to give performances close in tone and disposition to those in the original. Sequences such as Eleanor and Theo running to each other as they experience strange sounds and something trying to enter their rooms are almost identical to the original, with de Bont taking great care to block infamous shots so that they're the same as the beloved Wise film. Other sequences, such as the sudden presence of cold, are changed in structure a bit, but retain the spirit of Wise. This is all evidence that despite the reputation of the de Bont film, it is much closer in tone--even with its strong emphasis on things only heard or glimpsed out of the corner of one's eye--to the Wise film than almost anyone admits.Of course, this version of The Haunting does have differences. De Bont was not shooting for a Gus Van Sant-styled recreation, ala Psycho (1998), after all. De Bont dispenses with Eleanor's narration (which I've always found annoying in the original), shoots in color, and goes bonkers on production design, cinematography and yes, special effects and CGI. Personally, I prefer going bonkers on production design and cinematography. On both of those ends, The Haunting easily deserves a 10. The sets are breathtaking, beautiful, bizarre and stunningly shot--the exterior of the house, too. I also like the special effects and CGI, but it may be important to remember that I'm not someone looking primarily for realism in films. To me, it's absurd to watch a film about the supernatural expecting realism, anyway. But that's because in real life, I'm a skeptic on all of this stuff. To me, this is a fantasy, as is the Wise film, and I welcome fantastical, surreal (read ""non-realistic"") imagery.However, unlike the first time watching the remake, I felt that The Haunting had flaws this time around. Maybe I didn't notice them in the theater because I was so floored by the beautiful visuals projected larger than life. The problem is that the story and the dialogue become gobbledy-gooky. There are a lot of non-sequiturs in the plot. Characters disappear for arbitrary lengths of time. Eleanor figures out mysteries that should require complicated sleuth-work without much information to the viewer about how she did it. Characters say things to each other that seem like necessary foundational exposition was edited out. On the other hand, the Wise film wasn't exactly free of these problems, either.And the focus here isn't primarily on a tightly woven story in the vein of a mystery flick, anyway. The focus is on atmosphere--a rich tapestry of visuals and sound, where the actors are just one element, all meant to evoke moods. The film tends to be more poetic in this regard. Viewed that way, it succeeds.",The Haunting
56,PatrynXX,"This is not a horror movie, but it's very entertaining.",9,9 January 2000,"That said, I loved it.  Had me glued to the screen the entire time.  I'd barely looked at the watch.  Horror fans, this isn't gonna scare you.  Don't look at it as a horror movie per se.  The problem we see here is whether it's a horror movie or just a movie that is creepy.  It's just your classic haunted house movie.  Original no.  But I personally loved it.  If you've ever played the Sierra video game Phantasmagoria (7 cd roms long) as it is an interactive movie, you'll simply love this movie.  I also appreciated the fact that whomever designed the pan/scan version took it upon themselves and preserved some integrity of the film by putting 1 particularly widescreen moment in the film along with a smaller, but equally just widescreen towards the end of the film.  Aspect wise, I think people are still confused with widescreen.  They would call us purists I suppose, but movies are meant to be shown in widescreen.  Widescreen is not like those rip off panaramic shots used by Camera's.  (those who have used it know what I mean)  I think it was wise that they used that widescreen shot in the movie to show what difference it could make.  Pan/scan versions are cropped and destroy the movies integrity.  Some movies are shot in good and poor widescreen, but one this is for sure.  Get ready for HDTV..... :)",The Haunting
57,baumer,Awful,2,14 August 1999,"Warning: may contain some spoilers.But this film has been spoiled.  This film was terrible.  I was so looking forward to The Haunting.  But once again film makers forget what is so obvious to the rest of us, that it is disgusting and repulsive, and that is the fact that very few people know how to make a terrifying film.  Very few people understand the craft and skill behind it.  Because I can honestly count on two hands the films that scared me, or at least left me filled with tension.  So in the history of film there has been about 1000 horror movies made and I have probably seen about 3/4 of them, how come only ten or so can truly scare?  The reason is because most film makers know that a scary film has to have atmoshphere, tension, a good script, perhaps music, lighting or lack thereof ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blair Witch Project ) and a director who knows how to use the camera so that it uses us.  The Haunting has none of that.  The Haunting is filled with lots of loud noises, a non scary entity that shows itself at the end of the film, possessed statues, sheets that move by themselves and every other trick that should make a film like this good.  But what it needs it better camera work, even a little bit of tension and hey, how about a scare or two.  The Haunting contains none of that.  This is one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  So here is my advice to Jan DeBont.  Whoever directed the trailer, get some pointers from them.  And get Linda Hunt to do some voice over work for the film as well, she had me glued to my seat with anticipation in the trailer ( these are its eyes ).  It's funny too, because Jan De Bont was a DP before he hit it big with Speed.  And one of the films that he was DP for was Cujo.  Now Cujo was a good horror film, not the best, but pretty good.  It's too bad that he couldn't learn from someone even like Lewis Teague, because any effort besides this one would have been better.  This is a disgrace to horror films and even as a film itself it is terrible.  You want to be scared this summer?  Go see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense.  You want to waste two hours?  Go see The Haunting!",The Haunting
58,sarastro7,A hopelessly unfinished movie,3,19 May 2004,"The first half or so of the movie is not bad at all. Interesting characters, intriguing premise, engaging storytelling. Even the thing about the kids make you want to know what's behind it all.The latter half of the movie is as disappointing as it could possibly be. The characterization (incl. some promising innuendo) is utterly abandoned, the story doesn't really go anywhere, it's boring, and nothing of what we want to know is actually revealed. The movie begins fine, and then ends as a mess so bad it isn't even ridiculous. It's tragic. (This is, by the way, the exact same problem Thir13en Ghosts had: a set-up, but an incoherent ending that fizzled out into nothingness.)The actors suffer under that same malady. It's not their fault that they don't get to develop their characters in the second half of the movie. Zeta-Jones is drop-dead gorgeous as always, and Lili Taylor is also interesting and appealing. Liam Neeson's heart is never in it (and who can blame him?), and Owen Wilson, well, he's never an asset to any movie, in my opinion.I give The Haunting 5 out of 10. And that's generous.",The Haunting
59,vip_ebriega,Worth looking at. Must dispose the script.,6,15 February 2007,"My Take: A triumph of style over substance. Many critics hate this remake of Robert Wise's classic haunted house movie because, they say, that it has little resemblance to Shirley Jackson's classic story, which it was based on. Well, the film does overemphasize the special-effects to produce thrills rather than story or the use of imagination. The film stops being Shirley Jackson's subtle haunted house story when the film itself becomes a haunted house. Well, the story does tell about a group of paranormal investigators daring themselves to live inside the old Hill House and find its mysterious remnants. But they, instead, discover a mysterious legacy of evil. The film was directed by ""Twister""'s Jan De Bont, so expect it to have a lot of special-effects and a famous lead cast, save the subtlety and psychological punch of the story. What story? Screenwriter David Self leaves it to De Bont and the parade of special effects to tell the story, as if the thing never needed the screenplay. Still, THE HAUNTING is more of a second round on Disneyland's The Haunted Mansion rather than a redo of the Shirley Jackson story. The lack of imagination to tell the story is made up by the imagination used to put it on screen. The special effects leave very little to our imagination, but it's as if a large amount of imagination used to create them. Eugenio Zanetti is the real star of the show, making Hill House a triumph of style and the stuff of nightmares. All this and more, save the messed-up screenplay and uneven use of its popular cast (Owen Wilson as a paranormal investigator?), make THE HAUNTING a worthwhile, but not necessary, diversion. Rating: *** out 5.",The Haunting
60,SanteeFats,Not bad,6,29 August 2013,I liked this movie. It seemed to be a throw back to the Hitchcockian type of horror/suspense movies where the writers and acting left a lot of the scary stuff to the viewers imagination. Until the last 30-40 minutes when they got way to weird with the special effects and the CGI's. I did figure out that the carved kids faces represented the dead children but I did not know he was the killer until it was explained. Liam Neeson's doctor character seems to be rather unethical in doing a study without the patients knowledge or permission. Owen Wilson was not that impressive in this movie. Zet-Jones acted a bit strange in her role almost like she was not fully committed to it. While Lili Taylor only got fourth billing her character is really the main one that everything ends up revolving around. The special effects with the children's faces were a little wooden (pun intended) but also kind of interesting. Will I own this movie? No. Will I watch it on TV again? More than likely.,The Haunting
61,stamper,Has anyone who voted seen the same movie I have????,8,13 May 2000,"Come on people, the average vote here and the word of mouth on the internet make you think this one sucks. So do all the Razzie nominations. I thought it would suck too, BUT, I rented it anyways, and I was NOT disappointed. Didn't regret a minute.
This is really a good flick. It has a good story, a good cast ,in which Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones (damn she's hot, wish I was Michael Douglas) stand out, the rest of the cast is OK. Taylor as the 'psycho' and Jones as a BISEXUAL (I believed it, then again I'm a guy). The effects and the music are great, the combination of the two really excited me and had me sitting on the edge of my couch (seat). Good direction too, no doubt as the effects and music made it an entertaining and exciting movie. It was not that creepy though, but still good entertainment. Now for the downsides of this flick, well there are actually no more than two or three: 1: Where does Taylor get the stuff she's saying from about family and so on. 2: I do not understand THE CALL (you'll know what I meant with these first two, after you saw this movie) 3: Ending is a bit vague.Take my advice, ignore everyone elses opinion and see this one, or look at how much money it made (pretty much I daresay), that says something too, you know

62,petra_ste,When Shirley Jackson becomes Scooby-Doo,5,23 May 2007,"The setup was creepy, cast members reliable, production values remarkable. Too bad director Jan De Bont is to horror what garlic is to vampires.An adaptation in name and general premise only, the Haunting has doctor Marrow (Liam Neeson) invite patients Nell (Lily Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) - plus other two who leave after a minute - to Hill House, an isolated mansion, for a psychological study about fear. It soon becomes clear the house is haunted and the group in danger.""Some house are born bad"", recites the ominous tagline; to this I may add ""and so are some movies"". De Bont, who did a competent job with a fast-paced action movie like Speed, is unable to craft a sinister atmosphere, relying instead on the patented ""whispering children"" shtick and on cheesy CGI ghosts; the psychological terror of Shirley Jackson's novel becomes subpar horror schlock. Too bad, because production design at least did a commendable job: the set for Hill House looks effective, a humongous, tasteless, unsettling Gothic manor. Even a magnetic actor like Neeson seems bored. Taylor starts well enough as the vulnerable Nell but then lapses into histrionics. Others aren't given much to do, with Wilson as the comic relief and Zeta-Jones as the eye candy (sadly, no Entrapment-like tight jumpsuits here).The Haunting has plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them, a sign of blatant disrespect towards the audience. My favorite is how the survivors at the end don't bother to mention to the returning caretakers that THERE IS A BEHEADED CORPSE IN THE CHIMNEY. I guess they are in for a rather unpleasant surprise - just like viewers.5/10",The Haunting
63,aesgaard41,A Step-up And A Step-down Remake,9,12 February 2001,"I have yet to read the novel by Shirley Jackson, but I have to assume that this remake covers all the material left out of the original that would have gone so far to explain the house's history and idiosyncrasies. The effects are very good, but they aren't very scary or likely in the boundaries of true haunted houses.Lili Taylor's performance takes back stage to Catherine Zeta-Jones which is quite the opposite of the original and does obviously impair the movie's likeability. Liam Neeson is rather distant to the character and events, and Owen Wilson is quite annoying as he tries to copy the original role set forward by Russ Tamblyn. The house, however, takes centerstage as the special effects take over the storyline midway through the movie. Complaints aside, this is a very good if not excellant movie. It ends rather on a confused edge, but thankfully, it does not try to copy the original.",The Haunting

If you want to see a good, genuinely scary ghost story, see the original. If you want to see how much FX stuff tinseltown can throw into a ghost movie, see this.  Like STAR WARS I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, this film has lots of razzle-dazzle, but little story. The remake relies on every ghost story cliché (groaning doors, cold winds, phantom noises, visions) done with the all the latest FX.  But the original bw film created mood, atmosphere, and suspense much more effectively with fewer, not greater, FX and with characters who actually developed a plot.  Since TITANIC, the rule seems to be FX. Too bad that plot and character get buried. ""Some houses are born bad"" says the film's ad. I didn't know houses were born. But movies are -- and the ad could just as well say, ""Some films are born bad."" This one is an example. To pick up on a few lines in the film, I'd conclude that the movie can be described this way -- Charles Foster Kane meets Charles Addams in the FX department late at night.",The Haunting
65,RonellSowes,Boring film that doesn't even try to be scary,4,17 October 2020,"The Haunting is a remake of an already subpar horror film and you might have some expectations for this film to be better than the original.

Unbeknownst to them he actually is conducting an experiment on fear and plans on making them believe that the house is haunted. The only catch is, that Hill House really is haunted.
Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson are all very watchable however the lead,Lili Taylor, is terrible and one of the major flaws of the movie.The majority of the movie includes very few scares and saves everything till the climactic third act so to speak. However, there is nothing in the picture that can be remotely frightening. The faces on the wall and such is a novel concept but it fails to be even mildly creepy. The giant ghoul at the end is comical and is 'defeated' in a deus ex machina style. And can someone please enlighten me how Nell died(with a classic head tilt)? The shots of the 'children's' sacred expressions are downright cartoonish and deplete any little drama there is.The production design for this film are definetly some of its redeaming qualities such as the hall of mirrors which along with a line about Charles Foster Kane, certainly feels like a nod to Orson Welles.The Haunting is an incredibly boring,ridiculous film that doesn't even try to be frightening.",The Haunting

Subtle and brilliantly crafted by someone who understood the psychological underpinnings of horror, Robert Wise's original 1963 film is a largely faithful, extremely well-made and atmospheric version of the novel.And then there's this.Everything that made the novel claustrophobic, compelling, frightening, and darkly elegiac has gone, replaced by relentless Caspar The Friendly Ghost-style CGI, bad acting and an appalling screenplay which bears no resemblance to the book whatsoever, apart from using the names of the characters and the same basic situation.This awful melange of steaming horse dung is a wonderful example of the direness of a lot of modern film-making. Bereft of skillful story construction and suspense-building - in fact bereft of story construction and suspense of any kind - this is what you get when the audience gets lazy and will watch any pile of old tripe.I really can't relate how bad this film is - like Van Helsing it occupies a place all its own.

The mansion is one of the greatest fictional architectural moments I've ever seen in film and is extremely rich with detail and dark. The soundtrack is also a point for praise, it has some really good tracks which are used well to set the scene. The house is really its own character. Furthermore, there are some very interesting story elements regarding the history of the house, such as the owner (the ghostly Hugh Crain) taking children from his textile mills and murdering them, stuffing their bones under the fireplace so as to have a family for all eternity.

This is a remake of a 1963 movie that was itself a poor poor adaptation of the Shirley Jackson masterpiece The Haunting Of Hill House- if you haven't read it, the book is like a modern day epic poem as a tale of horror. Certainly the 1963 film adaptation fell short, and this version manages to fall short of the '63, that's a big empty space of a difference between The Haunting (1999) and the book.

70,Movie-12,Some scary material and an involving plot makes this one work only by a bare minimum. *** out of ****,7,4 August 1999,"THE HAUNTING (1999) ***After viewing much of Jan de Bont 's screen credits I begin to notice a typical technique in his direction. His film's usually begin with a solid plot development and end with a spectacular denouement. Through the middle of his movies is where more of the problems come to mind. Most of the time, the characters just complicate the plot issues more, and mostly don't further the plot any. Remember ""Twister"" and ""Speed 2?"" All this holds true for most of Jan de Bont, including the new version of the Shirley Jackson horror novel, The Haunting of Hill House, called ""The Haunting.""""The Haunting"" does work, and compared to most of the other summer horror flops out there today (""Lake Placid,"" ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""The Mummy"" etc.) it is a true, horror provoking gem. But the film only succeeds by a bare minimum. It is like someone passing high school with a 74% when a 74% is allowed. I liked the movie's overall production, and much of its scary material. I found myself studding the characters, trying to understand the message, struggling to figure out the plot before it is revealed to us--in other words I was very involved in Bont's storytelling, but only enough to marginally recommend.The film opens with an experimental study of sleep deprivation by the mysterious Dr. Marrow, who takes his four patients, including Theo, a bisexual, Eleanor, a woman going into debut and Luke, a comical jokester, to a massive, antique mansion in the middle of nowhere to observe. Secretly he is conduction a study of fear in which he will tell the patients scary stories only for them to fill in the rest. During one of the screenplay's bad moments, the fourth volunteer in injured by a piano string and his carried off to somewhere else, That woman as no idea how lucky she was.At night time, the patients hear things that are frightening. The gather up, and investigate, only to find nothing. The house, called Hill House, is enough to give the boldest of beings a chill, but what the characters see and hear will make you shiver.As it turns out, Hill House has a past to die for and is haunted by spirits of children who are pleading to escape from a demon who has wickedly fathered them for many, many years, and plans on doing it forever. Eleanor turns out to have more to do with this story, and discovers secrets that turn her to believe that she is a great relative of the late children's mother, who killed herself when her husband drove her crazy.Structurally, ""The Haunting"" is passable, but characteristically, it is greatly flawed. Movies like this the audience needs some action, beyond psychological terror, too keep them interested. The way to do this is to have a cast member be killed in the process. We like to know what were upagainst, here, and the way to do that is to see how and what is killing the it's victims. But ""The Haunting"" doesn't have enough characters to pick off one by one. For instance, the piano string incidence, the character hurt and taken away, before the story ever develops, going from six characters to four. And they all have big names and play important roles in the film. So, who is the house going to kill? See what we're up against, here. There aren't enough central characters for the film to have fun with, therefore all we receive is instance after instance of noises, threats and scary music.However, the film does take itself seriously and has a lot of thrills in its plot, after the first hour of plot development is over. One more thing, however. The film has earned a PG-13 rating, and while I have always made it a point never to judge a movie on it's content or rating, I have to complain about this one. I am reminded of the 1996 horror comedy called ""The Frighteners"" which earned an R rating for terror/violence, the same reason ""The Haunting"" got a PG-13. But this film is much more adult in its subject matter. Much more tense in its storytelling. And much more seriously violent than the other movie, which scored a higher rating. My point: the MPAA has goofed up again. Little kids do not need to be seeing movie about evil spirits and hell. So do not be fooled by the rating, this is not a film for the very young of age.",The Haunting
71,Bogmeister,I'm Haunted by how bad it was,4,22 July 2005,"A re-telling of the classic haunted house flic from 1963 (based on Shirley Jackson's famous novel), this was criticized for being nothing but non-stop special FX. In this day and age, that's no surprise. The makers here obviously attempted the ultimate haunted house epic. We are privy to view some of the most opulent sets ever conceived; some of the rooms are larger by themselves than what an average house is sized at (some of this impressive set design may lose its impact on the small screen). Neeson is the researcher investigating causes of fear who invites a trio of insomniacs to this gigantic house under false pretenses. The house has a sad, evil history, the focus of which is lost under the weight of innumerable FX shots in the 2nd half. The house-spirits focus on the character played by Taylor, a social outcast who spent many years caring for an ailing mother. Plot revelations concerning her relationship to the house seem contrived & unnecessary, adding to a messy ending (also, a character's death is just ridiculous: how about just ...stepping out of the way?). Zeta-Jones is suitably great to look at. I get the impression of filmmakers given unlimited funds to realize a glorious vision and completely forgetting the main purpose of the whole project: making it scary.

But in secret he is really doing an experiment about fear and how it affects people. Soon though it becomes apparent that the house he has chosen for his study has more than planned to offer in the ways of fear.The cast of ""The Haunting"" is maybe not excellent, but it does contain a lot of famous names. The budget and premise also seems perky. And yet this turns into a crap-fest before long. How did this happen? In my opinion it's mostly due to the fact that the director and script-writers know nothing about the elements of good horror film.They seem to be completely ignorant when it comes to the concept ""subtle horror"" and ""chilling moments"". Instead we are treated to a special effects-extravaganza. It starts out rather well with a house that looks simply amazing. The art direction is excellent to say the least. But soon the movie derails completely and the special effects take over. I even get the feeling of a Disney-musical sometimes when the furniture and the whole house seems to start moving. Just add the carnival music and you would have a decent live-action ""Beauty and the beast"". Seriously this is just too much. Instead of creeping horror they opt for shock-effects, which is almost always the wrong way to go. And it shows here.This is just another movie that shows that special effects can never replace a decent script. I rate it 4/10.",The Haunting

Unless they were the ones that were supposed to do the scaring, but I don't remember that being mentioned either. Anyway... After a while one of the house guests (Lili Taylor) discovers a hidden secret within the walls and rooms of Hill House. And that secret isn't very happy about being found out. So the house attacks the guests and all hell breaks loose. Literally at one point.
The movie moves along very slowly. It kind of reminded me of what I've seen of The Shining in that way. Of course this movie wasn't nearly as good. It just moved along slowly, trying to build the suspense. But to be honest, I didn't really care what happened to these people. I was actually hoping one would die to make things interesting. One did die, but it took way too long for it to happen (although the death was quite exciting). The story about why the house is upset was a little convoluted. A second wife? I must have missed something. I did love the sets though. The house itself was quite amazing. Just looking at it and trying to imagine myself living there was frightening. But there were way too many hallways. I never got a real feel about where the rooms were in relation to each other. The acting was ok. Taylor takes a leap from her indie roots to try and make it in the mainstream, and does a credible job. She was just held down by a few awful pieces of dialogue. Owen Wilson seemed out of place around these actors. He never really got into the feel of the film. Zeta-Jones played her role well, but if there was supposed to be a small lesbian sub-plot, it was very very small, too bad. And Liam Neeson has never been one of my favorites for some reason. And he lived up to those expectations.So overall, there were a few chills and thrills, but too few to make it very exciting. The special effects were somewhat different and done very well, but in this age, I need a little more than cool special effects. How about a coherent story and some real frights? If you're looking for a good scare, I'd put my money on the Blair Witch.",The Haunting

I mean really, what a waste. It's not even a fun piece of junk, it's a shrill, overblown, irritating one that completely blows the psychological nuance and atmospherics of the original, and does not replace it with effective more-explicit scares. Like everybody else, I loved De Bont's directorial debut ""Speed,"" but it's pretty amazing how quickly he lost the knack. This stale popcorn flick is one good proof that sometimes the more money you throw at a project, the more likely it is choke on that cash.

There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you.  What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense.  Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much.  Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up.  The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror.   The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump.

The story might have been original before too many films used the same idea of a bunch of strangers arriving on an old haunted manor for this reason or another.Lili Taylor (main protagonist Nell) might be many things, but she's no actress. Her acting was so amateur and childish, it was like seeing a 5 year old playing pretend... the rest of the all-star set was luckily better. Catherine Zeta-Jones was exciting and sexy as city-girl Theo, Owen Wilson was as funny and charismatic as always, and Liam Neeson was a perfect choice for the role of Dr. Marrow.The children's ""ghosts' were a nice touch, but the main ghost was quite a let-down.

Not astounding, but certainly chilling. I loved the way the ghosts were merely suggested or roughly visible. I liked the house and I liked the idea.

Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects.

It is badly written, badly acted, and horribly directed by a man who should really go back to dropping cars from the sky (Speed, Twister).This is a B-Movie not at all disguised as a high-budget piece of trash. I'm sure I've seen the exact same script, with a budget of fifty bucks, starring 2 ugly guys and 2 Playboy Playmates who walk around topless the entire movie.  The premise makes no sense, the motivations of the characters make LESS sense, every character is present or absent from scenes at random, based on who showed up to work that day.  The ending makes no sense either-- the characters who die, die for no reason at all, other than it makes for another stupid, extremely expensive special effect.This movie works on NO level and I fail to see how any sane human being could find a single enjoyable thing about it.

85,Silverzero,The spooky house concept is used to moderate effect.,6,21 March 2003,"While it is far from being a bad movie, `The Haunting' is still unsatisfying in a few aspects. While the cast works well and the storyline is amusing, it doesn't let out its intended effect. The spookiness and disturbance seems very artificial and doesn't seem to flow naturally in the film. While the storyline itself is plain freaky, what the film delivers is something on a much lower note unfortunately. `The Haunting' takes on many of the usual horror clichés but, in this films case, it is used to its advantage.
Luckily, its small but likeable cast makes up for most of the flaws. Lili Taylor takes on the lead role and is adequate for the part. She is ably supported by the more experienced Liam Neeson. He is a welcome addition to the film and makes it all the more watchable. Owen Wilson is equally impressive and likeable as a super cynic and cocky show-off. The most colourful and developed of the cast, though, is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a flamboyant over-the-top bisexual. The fact that her character is bisexual is a blatant draw for the male audience but she does a good job in her role, even though. The only other problem with the film is the resorting to shoddy computer images at the end of the movie (the same problem was in the similarly themed `House on Haunted Hill'). As if the scares weren't disappointing enough as they were, the CGI didn't help matters one bit. Nonetheless, some genuine scares come out of the film among the rest of the dross.
The performances and likeabilty of the film fortunately overshadow the evident flaws, making `The Haunting' a general success. The formula and moderate blandness prevent it from being anything above good but you have a satisfying movie despite this. 6.2/10.",The Haunting

I was reading  Leonard Maltin's review, and he seems to state there were ""virtually no scares"" in the movie.  I was really scared. Perhaps people are getting desensitized because the movies are getting more and more graphic, more special effects, more deaths, more explosions. I think that what made Hitchcock's movies scary was what your mind put into the movie; suggestive, not graphic. I will not watch movies that will bring fear to my mind.

I revisited the film recently and I thought it was a brilliantly entertaining and well-made picture. The location of Hill House is a fantastic setting for the story and they use the location stunningly well, from the first sweeping shots of the four leads arriving there to the dramatic conclusion. Based on its locations, its sets, its art direction, its sound design, and the overall splendour of its visuals, the film is some of the best I think I've ever seen in the genre. Creating a haunted house with real personality and terror.The cast of the film is also fantastic. Lili Taylor without a doubt pulls out a riveting performance as Elanor. Catherine Zeta-Jones brings the sex appeal. Owen Wilson keeps the film light and humorous whilst Liam Neeson plays the medium between the group, the character-based moments at the start of the film are even interesting and the dialogue is smart and snappy.The story is an interesting spin on the original, with the message that love is the only true antidote to fear.

88,revival05,Don't believe anybody in this movie I saw the original...,3,31 October 2000,"--SPOILER ALERT--THE HAUNTING from 1963 holds my title for most frightening film ever made, and I figured to make a good remake the director should minimize the special effects to zero, and go for great suspense, mind-scares and some frightening production design.It makes no sense, the first hour tries to be a remake of the original, the second hour explodes to some kind of fun-house. The reason I hate this movie so much is a lot because I love the '63-version. Everything in it was right. I was scared to death, and it didn't have any effects, gore or action. From the start to finish it was a scare. I was afraid that this would be a step-by-step-remake like the Gus Van Sant-PSYCHO, but now I wish it at least was. Every reason why the original was scary has been wiped out and replaced by an anti-scare. The movie starts with Nell getting a phone call with a ""tip"" to look in the phone book to find an ad for insomnia-problem. Who this is, buy the way, never gets revealed, even though Dr.Marrow claims it wasn't him. In the first THE HAUNTING we quickly catch up sympathy with Nell, sharing her thoughts and memories from the past, and we are filled with horror when she aproach Hill House, the house stares at her and it feels as if she has been eaten by a monster when she is in it. In the remake it is the total opposite. We don't feel anything for her and since the house doesn't look scary at all she loves it, why? Because it is beautiful!!! Did the filmmakers notice that the house is supposed to be scary?Also Mrs.Dudley is a complete disaster. OK, so I might be a little too demanding but I think that she was the thing that told us in the first movie that ""there is something wrong about this place"". Her presense was cold and stiff and the way she says ""in the dark... in the night"" and suddenly smiles, when she's been totally numb in her face all along made me shiver. Here the way SHE says ""in the dark... in the night"" sounds like she's been studying the script a million times and is death tired of the line, not aware of that it is one of the most important lines in the movie.Casting Jones to play Theo was a pretty good choice, but the character is too annoying, jumping around like a schoolgirl, when she is supposed to be cool and ms.ESP as Luke so elegantly puts it in the original movie. The good thing about Luke in that classic is that he don't believe in the supernatural. Here we don't really know if he does, since Dr.Marrow don't care. He's not out to investigate the supernatural, he's out to investigate fear. Too dull to be true. Therefore the entire ""Hugh Crain-story"" is changed to a much more flat and un-interesting one.  And as you might know the main rule about THE HAUNTING is broken. The movie is filled with over-the-top special effects, when the original's essence was that it didn't have any. Well, I guess it's the American Way.I guess they can't make a movie about a haunted house that won't contain greased effects and blood and gore, they simply just have to kill someone. I thought it was a good idea to set in two extra passangers to Hill House... until a harp-string flies off and wip her across the eye and she and the other guy drive back to the city. And Luke actually gets his head chopped off! Since when did ghosts start to kill people?Everything good about the '63 version is missing in this version.  3/10",The Haunting
89,Catharina_Sweden,Both deep and scary as Hell - but suffers from the comparison,6,20 October 2011,"The big disadvantage with a remake, is the fact that one always compares it with the original. For this reason, I think the movie-makers should stop making remakes, and try to find some fresh new stories instead. All the fantastic special effects in this film, for instance, should have made a perfect horror movie somewhere else. But now, I could just think that they are trying to compensate for the perfect psychology and understated creeping horror in the original, by throwing in a lot of expensive technology instead.They also missed one important thing in this film: Eleanor should have been attracted to one of the men, and the other woman, who was beautiful and self-assured, should have stolen him in front of her eyes. For this was an important psychological turn-point in the original: Eleanor realized once and for all, that she had no hope of love, family or belonging in the world outside... And why should the other woman be bisexual, suddenly? - that did not add anything meaningful to the story.However, in both movies I find the basic story very sad, convincing and realistic. I think many lonely women - ""old maids"" - can relate to it. In reality, they often turn to religion to find communion with both the parish and the supernatural beings (God, Jesus, angels...) - that do not demand beauty, style, charm or social skills, but are there for everyone.In this story, it is only more extreme. Eleanor is so lonely and unhappy, that she is not even afraid of ghosts manifesting themselves anymore. Because she sees them as as a possibility of company, family at last! And she sacrifices her mortal life entirely, to become one of the ghosts in the haunted mansion (in the original), which is the only place where she ever feels that she has _belonged_, or sets them free and follows them to heaven (in this remake).",The Haunting

Now that the mother has passed away, she's having trouble sleeping so when she see's an ad for a sleep study on insomniacs, she jumps at the opportunity. She and two others (along with the head of the study) have to spend a few days inside a creepy old mansion in which it's deceased owner (Hugh Crane) was a sadistic creepy guy who loved children. Each night some strange stuff happens; loud noises, ghosts climbing into bed with Nell, that sort of stuff. The group discovers the secret behind Crane and the children who died there, leading to an odd ending in which Nell feels compelled to stay in the haunted house forever.'The Haunting' has got to be the most non scary horror film out there, when it really shouldn't be. It had a huge budget, a large creepy old house, a decent story had it been told better... but at the end of the day is just not scary or even remotely terrifying at all. The ""scares"" are few and far between, and when a ghost does appear they aren't eerie to watch. Most of the ghosts are the dead children from years ago, but they are nice ghosts and try to help Nell. The main villain Hugh Crane is not scary or intimidating at all, even when he finally appears it falls so flat. And one of the most disappointing things about this remake is that it does not use the huge mansion to it's advantage. The noises that we hear late at night are not well done at all, and the actors do not react in an appropriate way to the ""scares"".I thought Lili Taylor put in a very weak performance as the lead Eleanor. Some of the acting choices she made during the ""scary"" moments feel flat and felt forced from on her part. Liam Neeson hammed it up for the cameras and seemed out of place in this. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luke Wilson however did good jobs in the supporting roles. Overall 'The Haunting' remake is a failure. Stick to the original 1962 film, it was much better.4/10",The Haunting
92,HenryHextonEsq,A dull film to say the least,3,19 July 2001,"Dear me, a rather underwhelming display of noise, inane visuals and non-drama that expects one to empathise with its endlessly open-mouthed stock ""heroine"". Liam Neeson, so impressive in, say, ""Husbands and Wives"" or ""Schindler's List"", is scarcely a presence here. His character may have had potential, that I expect was tapped more in the original film. A problem is that once the special effects start to dominate, about 1/2 of the way through, there is literally *no* characterization. The characterization there is is all too scant, and no proper context is given to the film's events. It is all set up very suddenly, and the motivations of the characters are barely touched upon. Lili Taylor is rather annoying in a thankless role, meant to be the film's center. The delectable Catherine Zeta Jones, irritates rather less, as she does indeed appeal to the eye, and importantly as her character is barely involved in anything at all. The makers' intent - Ms Jones to act as eye candy to drag in a certain audience - is all too clear, hardly a new gambit in such movies. Each character is plainly a stereotype - Neeson as the sombre scientist, Wilson as the supposed ""everyman"", Taylor as the sensitive ""everywoman"" and CZ Jones as the sexy society girl. Wilson, bizarrely co-writer of the excellent ""Rushmore"", is the worst of a cast that is emphatically keen to go through the motions. His character is appallingly written and played with no stature whatsoever by Wilson. The script is utterly nondescript, and is not helped by dull, telegraphed music and bland direction. For a supposed Horror film, this has to rank especially low. There is a tangible lack of atmosphere, even of an archetypal horror sort, and this begs the question - what were this film's makers thinking? Surely at least one would attempt a more low-key use of special effects, and music of a less bland kind so typical of modern Hollywood. The use of lighting is mediocre, and although I wouldn't go as far as to say monochrome is truly essential to horror films, it is usually a very safe bet for effective atmosphere. I save seen some of the original film, from 1963, and it didn't appear to be particularly great to me, but it certainly got the horror basics right, and seemed effectively suggestive and low-key. This remake is pretty awful in every regard; the special effects even being far from eyecatching, and the admittedly reasonable sets ill used. A very inconsequential, pointless film; as far from unsettling me as a particularly aimiable episode of ""Bagpuss"".Rating:- * 1/2/*****",The Haunting

It has a great cast, particularly Taylor, Neeson and Zeta-Jones, but they really do play second fiddle to the special effects.  The set design really is magnificent, but the story is fairly average and the characters are unfortunately a little underdeveloped. By the end I was  bit bored with the 'creepy house', because it just was not 'creepy' enough.  Some of the lines were so laughable it could have been mistaken for a comedy.

I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case.   To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time.  Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible.  Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck.

97,senortuffy,Overblown remake of a 60's horror movie.,5,10 August 2003,"I have no idea why producer/director Jan de Bont decided to remake this classic haunted house movie from the Sixties.  The film seems to be designed to promote ILM's digital special effects wizards - the actors and the story are superfluous.  And whereas Director Robert Wise made a good film with considerably fewer resources in the original, Jan de Bont wastes a lot of talent here to produce a film that borders on camp.The weakest link in this film is the lead actor, Lili Taylor.  Her attempts at expressing horror and wonderment are just plain laughable.  When you see such actors as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Bruce Dern reduced to playing secondary roles, the blandness of Ms. Taylor's performance is only accented.The plot is similar to the original except the doctor in charge is conducting an experiment in people's reaction to fear, not an exploration of psychic phenomena.  Anyone could have played the part as it was written, so why bring in Liam Neeson for a second-rate part?  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the worldly traveler to Lili Taylor's spinster, and again, while she's drop dead gorgeous and I love to see her in anything, she's wasted in this part.As noted, the special effects are the star of the film, and ILM does a masterful job.  Nothing you haven't seen in other films, but the effects are pretty amazing nonetheless.  That having been said, the plot is pretty weak - malevolent ghost and former master of the house tries to capture Eleanor (Taylor) and keep her there. It's not a scary movie because you can see everything coming before it happens.  Other than drooling over Zeta-Jones, I didn't find much of interest here.",The Haunting

They thought they were improving on it? This film not so much remakes the original plot as rips it off. The big draw, they thought, were the special effects. At times, the special effects are so cartoon-like, I scoffed at them and was never scared by them. The haunted house in this question resembles a cathedral more than anything else, and the original owner is turned into an industrial magnate. There's added plots of his marriages and a bunch of trapped children, which is suppose to tug at our heart strings. Yeah, right. It's a surprise that some good actors were lured into starring in this, which did nothing to help their careers.

I would love to have a house with everything just like that inside it.  The huge fireplace, the wonderful hallway with a stream in it and books serving as stepping stones, etc. But they have strayed too far from Shirley Jackson's acclaimed story; the worst faux pas was making Evelyn anything other than a victim.  That is the essence of the original story: she is swallowed up by Hill House and hasn't the strength to fight it.  What's worse is that the story they do come up with is not fleshed out at all.  They just put these 4 poor actors in this gorgeous set, and have them all speaking lines that mean nothing and go no where.  If you must see this film, see it for it's visual splendor.  If you want to see the best and only adaptation to capture Shirley Jackson's story, see the 1963 version by Robert Wise, also called ""The Haunting"".  There is no comparison between the two.

Unoriginal and unscary `horror' film about adults who take part in a sleep study at a creepy old house with a horrific past. Every haunted house cliché imaginable is present here. A sheer waste of talent and 2 hours. RATING: 4 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence and grisly images.",The Haunting
101,robertofuiano,Very good.,10,26 January 2008,"Good little film accepted by the public. He truly remarkable capacity also scenic. Not underestimate the environment in which it was played the film. It borrowed from other films and then stirred all the ingredients. The rooms where there are all machining are reconnecting to the sick mind of the owner of the house. The final part is worthy of note. A film to watch without taking into account the least hysterical criticism of this review. Look it carefully Neeson after is a good actor and the atmosphere of the house really uneasy! Zones is more for the beauty that for acting, I repeat the settings of the film are excellent. Who loves these films must necessarily love him.",The Haunting
102,abooboo-2,"More Like ""The Snoozing""",2,25 August 2000,"At about the half hour mark I was thinking to myself ""Ok, flimsy premise, but cool house and looks like Lili Taylor is going to anchor things with a touching, three dimensional characterization, and there are some interesting possibilities with the rest of the cast."" I really was willing to give it a chance at that point. At about the 45 minute mark, I was getting a little restless, fidgeting in my seat thinking ""Oookaaay, ready for some scares!"" 15 minutes later, I was still waiting. 15 minutes after that, same story. 15 minutes after that I was too busy gagging at the increasingly banal dialogue and moronic situations to think much of anything. (Owen Wilson getting ""trapped"" in that economy car has to be one of the most hilariously suspense-LESS scenes ever filmed! Hey Owen, to get out you might want to try um, rolling the windows down?) Not too long after that, the closing credits started rolling and I vaguely recalled having sat through what must have been a motion picture of some sort. Only recently, with the aid of hypnosis have I been able to come to terms with the fact that I had just viewed something called ""The Haunting"", possibly the worst movie ever made - dollar for dollar.All that money, all that talent and this is the best they could come up with? A movie totally devoid of scares, chills or suspense of any kind? How ironic that much the way Liam Neeson's laughably conceived scientist character lures a group of people to a spooky mansion under the pretense of it being a study about insomnia; the folks who made this movie lured a group of people to see what was presumably supposed to be a horror movie when it was actually a cure for insomnia! Way to go Jan De Bont! He is like a failing student bluffing his way through an oral exam about a subject he knows nothing about! Because it is clear that this man has absolutely no feel for this genre, the mechanics of horror or the most basic fundamentals of story telling in general.His cast is marooned, stranded on a tiny raft swirling around in an ocean of incompetence and it's interesting, in a ghoulish sort of way, to see how each one of them deals. Lili Taylor DOES create a character and give her a soul - she's a wonderful actress and she has no choice, she can't help it, it's like a mothering instinct. But she finally goes under in the film's ""climatic"" moments - her stubborn professionalism capsized by a monsoon of stupidity. (Plus, her screams need a lot of work - she's like a patient opening her mouth and saying ""AHHH"" a little too loud.) Liam Neeson is in pain throughout - he's a good actor who's just very embarrassed. Owen Wilson is too much of a newcomer to truly understand how wretched the thing is. An offbeat presence, I think he had an inkling and spends most of his time on screen looking around for guidance that is not forthcoming. Given a paper thin character with absolutely nothing challenging to do and what could have been an interesting relationship with Taylor left totally unexplored, Catherine Zeta Jones just looks incredibly bored - like a high fashion model forced to babysit.The best word to describe this movie? HOLLOW. There's almost nothing to it. If you really want to be scared, check out the original. Now THAT was a creepy movie. There's simply no comparison.",The Haunting
103,billion_mucks,Idiotic Everywhere,2,4 December 2007,"Jan de Bont's puerile marijuana trip between reality and fantasy lies in a net where you can invent nonsense of ""scientific experiments"" and ""tyrant landlords"" just as an excuse to make a house come to life by moving statues in an idiotic routine. This movie also teaches a lot: 1) If you are trapped in a house where voices of children are heard, when paintings in blood are written, when doors are strangely closed: just stay a little bit more, some days more. If you die, you die. What's the problem? 2) You are doing a movie of ""suspense"" or ""horror"", just finish it by showing the credits with a merry go-round music! Anyway, children will like it. 3) If an iron statued-eagle goes crazy and decides to jump over you, fight it over with a stick. 4) When they take you a picture in the Medieval times, like the one showing Carolyne, take her kind of ten with her pointing to the fire place, even if she looks idiotic. It's a probable clue for your great grand daughter to free dead children: well that's a premise!! 5) Hugh Crain has the best haircut I've ever seen on a ghost.6) Jan de Bont has 12 years old and the writer is Rain Man. 7) Purgatory and Heaven are as easy to enter as in California. 8) If you have a companion that thinks her family is a group of dead children, take a step back.You may know; movies are not made for reality. But what is imaginary is Jan de Bont's intellectuality. The leading actress is so obnoxious in his Eleanor role that I would vote ""yes"" if someone proposes to exile her to Vanuatu. Catherine Zeta Jones? Owen Wilson? Acting touches rock bottom with their empty gestures. The movie gives a lot more importance to the visual stuff (like lion statues dancing) than to the importance of the script. It's an empty, very empty package. Recommendation: stay away from this movie.",The Haunting
104,cofemug,"Great comedy, bad horror",3,28 July 1999,"This movie was one of the worst movies ever made.  It ranks right with ""Twister,"" and ""Friday the 13th Part VIII,"" which this movie resembles. This movie was one of the clumsiest, most obvious, and down-right funny horror movies that I have ever seen.  The person I saw this with told be to hush because my laughter was disturbing the rest of the people.  But, the movie is not all bad.Plot: Great plot.  I am sorry but the plot is one of the creepier plots ever made.  They mangled it though.  The idea that a house where a man hunted children, and a distant relative saves their spirits is pretty good.  This was done from a book, and is a remade movie.  I have not seen the original, but since it had a different director, and special effects that couldn't try to steal the show, it must be better.Acting: I loved Lily Taylor.  As Eleanor, she was wonderful.  However, the rest of the cast needed a little help.  Owen Wilson was decent, but Zeta-Jones, although very nice to look at, was too outlandish in this movie. Liam was way to obvious for me.  Lily Taylor was good as a person suffering from true delusions, and almost breaking-down.  She should act her way into a better movie.Special Effects: Nice to look at but too much.  I mean, they were the most obvious effects imaginable.  The roof beating, the spirits in the drapes, and the pointy things on the bed were too obvious.  However, it also suffered from the ""Gee, how could I have missed that"" syndrome.  The room that resembled her mother's room was a direct result of that.  The eyes in her room were also direct results of that.  The only thing that worked in my opinion was Mr. Frosty.  You'll know what I mean, as the guy in the window.Dialogue: Horrible.  Not much else to say.Direction:  Blunt, obvious, and horrid.  He set everything up early.  The revealing of the fear experiment would have been a nice discovery/twist late in the movie.  The guy in the pond was too obvious.  Nothing shocked me, or made me scream.  I laughed at some of the things, like the fireplace.Sound:  Louder than a rock concert.  I can hear the movie in the next theater.  Really, I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and I heard the rumbling from the theater.  Prepare for loud decibels.  Also unnecessary low rumbling is constant through the movie.  It got annoying.  One cool effect is you hear the house quietly settling, and it goes from the back of the theater to the front. That was cool.The house rocked, and I want to live there.  But, I laughed through the movie.  It is blunt, obvious, and you will laugh at the bland attempts to scare you.  It is like going to a haunted house in October, everything jumps at you, and it does not work. However, I laugh at those houses, as I laughed at the movie.  For making me laugh--------3",The Haunting
105,vasco_cid,Definitely the best movie ever done.,10,7 September 2001,"To all horror movie lovers, to see a couple of times, attentionaly and bearing in mind that some bad reviews must not influence the final appreciation of a fantastic movie.The Best: The actors, the special effects, sound, art direction, sceneries, photography, directing, the majority of the script, after all : THE MOVIEThe Worst: Saying nothing would be stretching things too much, but my only complaint goes to the non inclusion of images of the house's past: construction, deaths and probably if there were more characters trapped in the house would be interesting.As almost everyone should know this movie was based upon the novel by Shirley Jackson The Haunting Of Hill House', and the following 1963 Robert Wise's movie with the same title. The first movie was very faithful to the book and this one was just based on it. So, for those who compared both movies really don't have a point for it, as the only thing in common are some common places, character names and plot scenes. Back in 1963, Robert Wise, director of West Side Story propose us a visit to hill house resulting in one of the scariest horror movies driven and acted well by someone who knows what is doing. Three and a half decades later, Jan De Bont, director of the fantastic box office hits, Twister and Speed offer us another visit to Shirley Jackson frightening manor, this time with frankly terrific results. Both movies are good and scary, but Jan De Bont's is incomparably better.For more than one century that the frightful and sinister Hill House stands alone and abandoned or so it seems. Intrigued by the house's storied past, Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) draws some people to the house Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Nell (Lili Taylor), Luke (Owen Wilson), for an apparently innocent experience. But since the moment of her arrival, Nell seems frightenly mutual. As soon as it begins to get dark, the study about fear is horrifically abandoned as the people discover the haunting secrets that fill hill house. This secrets are allusive to the house's owner Hugh Crain and the house's construction. At first they believe that the story is some kind of a fairy tale but as soon as this secrets are revealed by apparitions to Nell, she realizes that it is not that fairy tale but a haunted story of terror, slavery and death until the very revelation in the end.The movie is mainly focused on Lili Taylor's character Nell which drives her character's acting remarkably well, although the other main character's acting are very good indeed but it is clear for everyone that the acting' that steals the show is hill house itself. Set designer Eugenio Zanetti did a very good job designing the interiors of a huge manor that is creepy, beautiful, charming and mysterious altogether. It is very rewarding to see that this is one of those movies that are rewarding in every aspect you can examine. But this movie works fantastic as a whole not only in some aspects. Music composer Jerry Goldsmith gave us pleasant movie scores like Poltergeist', The Mummy', Hollow Man', Star Trek' among other instant classics and once more he did a fabulous job composing this score that perhaps is his best one in his career, creepy, beautiful and suggestive. Some time ago before 2000 Oscar ceremony I read a comment that if this movie was not nominated at least for special effects, sound, photography, set design and sound design I will be haunted', I just have to say that I totally agree. Director Jan De Bont proved that he knows how to direct not only action adventure movies but also horror/ thriller/ suspense and still keep the audience on their nerves. David Self's screenplay is not what people make of it, it contains very well written descriptions, memorable sequences, not included on the original nor on the book, remarkable dialogues and quotes.After reading hundreds of comments here on IMDB and other sites about this movie I just find curious that in all of them they only refer as negative the slowest parts of the movie never the best and memorable, why is that, were they to embaraced of stating they were truly scared or touched by those scenes. Are they true critics or selective critics. A movie comment is written selectively or as a whole? I have to confess that I laughed  my stomach out  reading those comments.Anyway, for those who are reading THIS comment and haven't seen the movie, don't let yourself be influenced by those critics, you better don't, and for those who have seen the movie and feel somehow divided, I advise you to see it again and again to let yourself be swept away by the hugeness and strength of the movie. If you allow it, Jan De Bont and David Self's THE HAUNTING will do it for you. I've seen hundreds of movies so far and none of them could touch me so positively as this one.The Haunting will also make you wonder: Who called Eleanor to respond to Dr. Marrow's ad?See it, enjoy it!   Oh, and Sleep Tight!",The Haunting

I would love to live in a house like that!  I loved all the antiques and creepy statues.  But that's really all I loved about the movie.  I did like the main character, Elenor, at first.  But as the movie draaaaggggsss on, I found Elenor intolerable as well as all the other characters.  In fact, I kept wishing the house would kill them all off.  This movie could have been done so much scarier and better.  It needed a better cast and alot more horror.  It also needed a bigger cast.  There weren't enough people in that house to kill off.  The whole movie is really a big shame.  All that money to build those impressive sets and all we get is a bad Poltergeist rip-off.

111,jackjack-2,About all that can be said is great photography and special effects.,5,13 August 2000,"What makes the film barely worthwhile seeing is the mansion, the photography, and the special effects. If one expects a thrill, forget it. The plot is very predictable and there is no suspense. Part of the problem is Lili Taylor who plays the main character. Her performance at times makes one wonder whether they are watching a comedy or a thriller. The film opens with a scene between Taylor and Virginia Madsen in a battle over the estate of their mother but the story never resolves that issue and leaves it dangling. The ending leaves one unsatisfied in that it leaves too many ends untitled. One gets the feeling that they are not watching a thriller but only the hallucinations induced by the fear that the Doctor has generated. Catherine Zeta-Jones provided nothing in her supporting role. One good thing for the movie was that there was no gratuitous sex and no profanity or vulgarity.",The Haunting
112,ed_two_o_nine,Little in the way of frights or empathy,3,25 November 2009,"This is a movie that does not start well and gets worse the longer it goes on (and it does go on). The basic premise of Liam Neeson's character Doctor Marrow conducting a study into fear by inviting people to a so called ""haunted house"" under the misinformation of it being a study into people who suffer from insomnia is interesting enough. This could of lead to some good psychological scares. However when the house itself does turn out to be haunted we really do gets by numbers horror where I found it incredibly difficult to find any empathy for any of the characters and also struggled to maintain interest in the film. Even the normally likable Owen Wilson was poor here. Certainly one to avoid abd not one for re-watching.",The Haunting
113,Norm-30,Not bad...if u don't compare it to the original!,4,4 August 1999,"If you don't compare it to the original classic, the remake is pretty good. One of the more interesting things was that they created a different ""history"" of the house, which is revealed, slowly, as the movie progresses.  It adds a ""diffent dimension"" (and, an interesting one, at that) to the film.But, the character's acting is EXTRMELY wooden, and Hill House is impossibly over-ornate (they would've needed over 100 servants to clean it all!  They went ""overboard"" on this!). And, of course, the special effects are top-notch!!!!!Again, if you forget about the '60's classic, and judge this film by it's OWN merits, it's pretty good!  (Look at the remake of ""Psycho"" -- they copied every frame, and everyone said,""Why bother remaking it?"").

114,Chrissie,Frighteningly bad,3,23 November 2004,"The scariest thing about ""The Haunting"" is that somebody spent that much money on such a bad movie.The sets, costumes, and special effects were worthy of the best Spielberg or Lucas could offer, but they're wasted on a Mystery Science Theater 3000 script. Who wrote the screenplay, R.L. Stein?The characters are utterly alien. They rush into situations where they should be terrified. They brush off serious questions, leave Nell alone when they think she's in danger, fail to even check on her claim that she found skulls under the fireplace (okay, the headshrinker makes a dulsatory attempt, but doesn't follow through), send the biggest and heaviest member of the group up a fragile set of stairs instead of having the slender woman come back down them, et cetera ad nauseum.If the dialogue got any cornier, the FDA would classify it as a vegetable and add it to the Food Pyramid.Visually, it's beautiful.

115,Keyser Soze-12,"Not the worst movie ever made, but horrible none the less",2,22 October 2000,"Some of the other reviews call this the worst movie ever made, well, it's not.I'm first going to say the good points about it.  First off, the special effects will make you drool.  They are so good, and so original that no one, NO ONE can say this movie is 100% bad.  Oh, and Catherine Zeta Jones is in it.  That's about it though.Movies like this are like M&Ms (this is a long analogy, so go with it).  The movie's soul (the characters, the acting, the plot, the theme, etc...) are like the chocolate.  The extra stuff (the special effects, the sound, etc...) is like the candy coating.  As you know, about 90% of an M&M is chocolate, because that's what tastes best.  Same goes with movies. 
Now, M&Ms need the coating too.  Other wise, it would just be chocolate, boring chocolate.  In movies, special effects are nice editions, but they need a chocolate center to cover.Now, if the IMDb editors haven't cut out my analogy, if the Haunting was an M&M, it would be all coating.  No chocolate, at all.  And that is pretty sad seeing how this movie is a REMAKE, of a movie BASED on a book.  You would think at some point along this movie's script they could have added interesting stuff.  But, noooooo.  It's almost like they subtracted stuff and replaced it with uninteresting dribble.The thing I hate most about this movie is Lillie Taylor and her character Eleanor.  First off, this woman can't act, period.  I break out laughing whenever she speaks.  Her character is also way too complex.  When someone makes a stupid movie, just leave it stupid.  There was no way of making this movie smart, and the good people at Dreamworks know that.  So why, WHY did they try to put a complex character in a movie where all the other characters are 2-dimensional recycled trash?I really don't consider this a movie.  It's a demo tape for the Dreamworks visual effects team.  It was made so they could say, ""Hey, I did the CGI effects on the Haunting"", and people will be impressed.  But, if some one, say the actors or the director says,"" Hey, I was in/directed the Haunting"", people will run in terror.  This is a scary movie.  It's scary that someone had the idea to make it.

One question: Where were the elevators??Aside from that, the rest just sucked. I sat there and waited for something scary to happen... and nothing happened! I waited some more... and still nothing!  Of course, special FX are pretty well special in the FX dept, but this is marred by the weak plot and lame acting. If only they had put more real scares into this, it would've made a much better movie, after all, it is a remake of a 60s flick!However the house is, of course, the best (and definatly the most memorable) actor in the movie.CONCLUSION: See this House first!",The Haunting

Although I don't consider it such a great film nowadays, specially when compared to much superior 1963 original, I consider it a fun movie that works better as a stand-alone film. As a matter of fact, I think it would've had much more praise had it been a stand-alone film. It's also better than most of the stupid, PG-13 remakes out there, like the godawful Prom Night remake. The film has something else that lacks in every PG-13 horror remake nowadays: the atmosphere. The Haunting is filled with atmosphere. The set desing is jaw-dropping, for the likes of Suspiria and The Shining. The dark imposing mansion, it's very creepy and the house setting in this film is better than the house from the original. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is haunting and beautiful, showing us he hasn't lost his touch, and it's up there with the scores he composed for The Omen and Poltergeist. The acting is, well, not so good, and you can expect that from Owen Wilson (WFT IS HE DOING IN A HORROR MOVIE ANYWAY?!). Lily Taylor does the best she can as the outcast protagonist and I sympathize with her character more than I did with Julie Harris in the 1963 film. However, the 1963 film is better in almost every way and it's of course a classic, one of the best of the genre. Liam Neeson also does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones steals the scene as the wild Theo, and is probably the best actress in the film. Even the direction is good, which surprises me considering it came from the director of Speed. DeBont proves to me he's a big fan of Kubrick's The Shining, considering how the film appears in a terrifc scene in Twister and here it's obvious he's influencd by that film. In any case, watch The Haunting. It's worth it, it's not as bad as people claim it to be and try to watch it with an open mind, I really hope you enjoy it.",The Haunting

To pad the review let me add Owen Wilson should be forced to eat brussels sprouts while buying a used car with a loan from a bank. Lili Taylor should stay away from the front of the camera and maybe work as a grip or in the deli section. Zeta-Jones should have taken all of her clothes off. At least it would have been a distraction. Liam Neeson should simply go find the original negative and burn it. Jan de Bont should pal around with Owen Wilson and eat lots of brussels sprouts.

124,RunningFromSatan,The Worst Reviewed Movie of the Year...,5,27 July 1999,"Even though 80 percent of the reviews of this movie were bad, I decided to go see for myself, because usually critics stink anyway.  They were sort of right.  I was mad in two ways: there was no good, memorable, scary scenes like the original.  There was no hand-holding scene (although you could hear Lili Taylor's character say, ""It was holding my hand"" for about a split second, but it was drowned out by the very loud music.)  I was also mad that the TV previews say only Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones's names when Lili Taylor's character was the lead!  Yeah, sure, she's an independent film queen, but at least give her some ""big-studio"" credit!Well, anyway, the movie was good in some ways, and it was bad in some ways. It was bad that the special effects weren't very scary, but in the original, it was scary with no SFX whatsoever. Also, the best moment that was in the original was NOT INCLUDED (the hand-holding scene)!  It was good because it did not have a single F-word in it and there was minimal gore.  Also, it was a little scary with the startle sounds and the sound effects (scary sounds were the best part of the movie.)  It was still kind of scary, but I still think that the original is best.  Also, don't go to the movie expecting Liam Neeson and CZJ to be leads, expect Lili Taylor.  She was great.",The Haunting

126,thousandisland,Really neat effects- and it actually has a story!,7,7 September 2002,"I guess people have canned this one because it doesn't have a lot of gore and blood.. but it's called ""The Haunting,"" which does suggest that it will be more about ghosts than murder, right?  (I mean, you wouldn't expect ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to be about bumps in the night, would you?)    I saw this in the theater and was scared out of my wits, but of course it's much less scary on TV.  I still like it a lot because instead of showing mindless dismemberment and disemboweling, they spend the time providing some personality to the main characters and letting you come along while one of them learns the secret of the house and eventually goes nuts.  (Ehh, and of course Liam Neeson is there looking very sexy and captivating, as always. That doesn't hurt at all.) It also has really neat special effects that aren't just ghosts walking around (ala House on Haunted Hill), but the house *itself* actually comes alive and you can feel the evil presence in it. Only at the very end do they show a definite ""ghost,"" and they build up to it - which is rare in modern movies.  I am surprised so many people disliked ""The Haunting,"" but I suspect it's because they were looking for a splashy-blood movie with main characters that are just dopes who wander around alone in basements, all but begging to be chopped up... not a ""real"" movie that details its characters and offers a genuine story.   The only fault in ""The Haunting"" is the ending, which is hokey because Nell ends up blabbering some really cheesy lines.  Otherwise I think this a really good one - (I've rented it several times.) because it isn't a brainless gorefest. If you want a movie like that, rent any of the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street installments.   ""The Haunting"" is a serious, chilly movie, not a cheaply made horror flick.",The Haunting

I must say I almost threw up once I left the theater after seeing this sure to be a golden raspberry nominee. The direction is more stale than a box of old donuts and the writing is even worse. I wouldn't even call this a remake of a classic. I'd call it a disgrace to a classic. A lame subplot overshadows a film that had such potential.

After seeing the very cool-looking graphics that were on the commercials, I was even more excited. Unfortunately, I found that I had already seen most of the best-looking graphics on the commercials. I didn't find the movie too scary, but it was spooky at some parts.Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) wants to perform experiments using human guinea pigs to learn about human fear. He takes three subjects, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sannerson (Owen Wilson), and Nelle Vance (Lili Taylor), who believe that the tests are about insomnia, to a giant mansion. The mansion has a scary history and some very creepy rooms, decorations and gargoyles. The subjects come to learn that the mansion truly is haunted, though Dr. Marrow thinks it is just part of his experiment. Soon, the four have to struggle to survive the night and get out of the mansion alive.The story line is fairly interesting, but this movie is overlong and tends to get boring at parts. The computer effects are fantastic, but they aren't shown enough until the end and most of those effects you probably saw on previews and commercials.Catherine Zeta-Jones stole the show, playing an extremely sexy bisexual. Liam Neeson did a fair job, but he does tend to go into spurts of over-acting. Owen Wilson does well as the comic relief and Lili Taylor did an OK job as the first woman to notice the mystery of the mansion. All characters are very different and it is fascinating to see how they all react to the haunted mansion.This movie is definitely worth a rent. You might be bored at some parts, but the action is good and the ending is fair. Go enjoy.",The Haunting
133,Willow192,This movie is classified in the wrong genre,1,15 March 2001,"The genre should have been comedy.  This movie was neither scary, mysterious, or thrilling.  It was a horrible movie.  Please tell me the book was better.  I found myself during all of the ""scary"" parts of the movie. The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out.  I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.  Liam Neeson was in good, quality movies until he hit ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" which is number 1 on my list of over rated movies.  It's like that was the movie that ruined his career.  Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic) is also a pretty decent actress.  I can't possibly come to understand what she was thinking when she said yes to this movie.  That blonde guy...I don't even know his name...will probably never get another role after this.  And then there's Lili Taylor.  What can I say about her? She was horrible.  Isn't she the girl from Ransom (which in my opinion was a good movie).  I can't remember her acting on this but I hope she hasn't gotten worse through the years.  I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and slap her.  Is this how she really talks?  Or is it her acting voice.  She had lines like ""the children need me,"" and ""even in death you wouldn't let them go.""  Who the heck cares about some children that died like 200 years ago?  They're dead...get over it.  And she has to be the one to save them because she is their great great great (sure there are some more greats in here) aunt.  There was no plot to this movie, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't.  OMG it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!  The ending will have you laughing and thanking God that this movie is over.

They also missed many opportunities to make you wonder what is really going on. I think it would have been more interesting if they had:
1.  Not killed anyone.  The one killing was gratuitous and not necessary to the show at all.2.  Kept you wondering if this is real or a put-on.

The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st-class cinematographer-turner-director who once showed promise (Jan de Bont- Speed) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage (Twister, Speed 2).Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film.  Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing.  Events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non-event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity.There really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now.

Because from this movie he could have learned that LESS is MORE. This is the ground rule in making a successful horror flick. Alien, Jaws, Poltergeist are all movies in which most of the time you don't see what the characters are up against. The same with the original Haunting from 1963 in which you don't get to see the enemy at all, you just hear it.This suggestion of 'something's in here with us' has been totally annihilated in this version. Added to that the horrible acting performances of the cast except maybe Lili Taylor who delivers a somewhat credible performance.The only positive credit goes out to the CGI and physical effects people for delivering astonishing effects, but regrettably this didn't help the movie much, it even diminished the scaryness factor.

And then, ""I won't let you hurt the children!""These two lines are perfect examples of how the movie fell apart in the second half. Mainly because there was no prompt for this iconic dialogue from the first film in the second one. No one was shown to be holding Nell's hand, or that her hand was in any position in which it would be 'held'. And secondly, she didn't hear the terrifying noises of child abuse in the dark. Being a remake of the 1963 classic, I don't think anybody expected it to be as good as the first. But still it was off to a promising start, with lonely, unwanted Eleanor against the glamorous have-it- all Zeta as Theo. Even Owen Wilson being Owen Wilson in Hill House was entertaining. Unfortunately, the second half nose-dived. They didn't keep up the motif of the desperate Eleanor with no home being hounded by society - except in that one scene in which Owen Wilson trashes her only legal possession against the iron gate (he gets his poetic justice). Instead of the house PREYING on Eleanor's weakened mind, the idea that Eleanor DID somehow legally belong with the house was pushed a bit too far (the woman wearing the necklace in the painting and Eleanor spewing a lot of ancestral details which no one can possibly verify there).

The sets are incredible and take your breath away.  Second everbody (except for Neeson) gives out good performances.  This is particularly impressive when you realize how howlingly bad their dialogue is.  The story was (unwisely) changed from the original (I'm still not quite sure who Neeson gets them all together--it sounds like to test fear????!!!!!).  There are two HUGE gaps in the script--two other people are introduced at the beginning, one gets hurt, the other drives her to the hospital--and they're never mentioned again.  The second one: when they try to leave the house when all hell breaks loose, the doctor says only the caretaker can let them out.  However, earlier we had seen him unlock the gates himself!  Those two lapses aside, the dialogue is incredible bad.  I can't believe they actually let this script by.  The audience was laughing at the lines!  (Also there's a plot twist at the end that was so ridiculous, I yelled out ""Oh come on!"" and audience members applauded me!)  Also it's not scary.

You have a menacing setting for a movie, throw in a cast of actors that deliver empty and meaningless performances, and completely misuse your elements of ""terror"". The problem with The Haunting is that it actually does an OK job of building suspense and making the audience feel a little awkward and tense, but ruins it by the end. There are some decent sequences that visually work and in the end, do make me jump. Like the scene with the fireplace. That was pretty good, because you didn't see what was coming. We've heard it a million times. It's always scarier NOT to see something. Now here's the problem. In the last 30 minutes of The Haunting, they have the idiotic idea of SHOWING us everything. All secrets and mysteries are revealed, which takes away all intrigue we had, because like in every horror movie out there now, the whole movie has to be explained so in depth. Remember when Horror movies were great because they didn't always answer all the questions. And then the second major problem. We get a huge visual effects sequence that's supposed to jump right out at the audience, stun us, shock us, and blow us away. But of course, how can this work when there's no mystery or suspense anymore. In the last act of this movie, there's nothing to be scared of because you've now seen everything, and know everything that's been going on. Plus, the audience can't be shocked or terrified by a huge visual effects monster when we've pretty much seen it all before. When effects have reached the point they have, nothing is stunning or frightening to look at. Also, if we know it's a visual effect, there's nothing scary about it. The Haunting does a good job of building suspense, but throws it all away on a cheap and goofy over-the-top ending. Strangely enough, this review I just wrote could be posted for House On Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts, Ghost Ship, or any other of the countless movies like it. Bringing me back to what I said at the beginning, The Haunting demonstrates what is wrong with ALL horror movies.But I will give Liam Neeson some credit. He had a really interesting performance, that unlike everyone else in the movie, he plays well. But alas, no matter how good a performance is, it's not enough to make up for cheap material. But I did catch myself flipping to this movie a few times on TV recently to see him again. That must count for something.",The Haunting
158,janeannafoote,Watch The Original Instead,5,28 October 2020,"You've got about 30 minutes of a decent movie here before it turns into a loud, annoying, computer generated cheese fest. All the elements are in place for a good, spooky time - the set is gorgeous and ornate with just the right hints of creepiness, the cast (maybe minus Owen Wilson) is excellent, and the sound design is near flawless. It stays understated for about the first half hour before everything falls apart, but that first portion of the movie is pretty good.",The Haunting
159,conspracy-2,An astonishing accomplishment in cinema,3,11 June 2005,"How on earth was this achieved? This movie had an incredibly lush set, and one of the greatest sets for scary spookiness I can imagine. A case in point: the indoors merry-go-round with mirrors is the perfect setting for oodles of spook. Just seeing it for the first time in the movie made my skin crawl with anticipation of the great chills to be offered. Hell, just the jingly clown music made my spine turn cold. We are introduced to characters with a slightly forced depth, especially Theo, but at least these are three-dimensional, interesting figures. The stage is set.And so, it begins. And this is where the true miracle of the screen comes. This movie is completely and utterly UNfrightening. In a set like that. I just don't get it. It's a miracle. Give a monkey a camcorder and stick it in that set, and it would shoot a more suspenseful movie than this. How is it possible to create such a bland, boring, unfrightening, laughable piece of trash with a set like that. It's a modern marvel. My hat is off.",The Haunting
160,john_oneill41,Better than it's score would suggest although not without faults,7,1 February 2010,"This remake of the sixties classic of the same name has unfortunately been somewhat slated by critics, although I feel it's better than most people seem to think it is.The location work is stunning and the set design has clearly had a lot of work put into it.Liam Neeson, Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones all perform their parts quite well, but Lili Taylor is not as good as she should be. On paper she should be perfect for the role of Nell and for much of the film she provokes the necessary sympathy. She seems unable, however, to scream properly, instead letting what sounds like an animal cry. Also, she seems to say ""Oh No"" in exactly the same tone of voice every time she sees something frightening, although to be fair this is as much the fault of the script as it is hers.Towards the end the atmosphere is slightly diluted by such things as having the beds and statues spring to life which makes these scenes much less frightening than they could be.In spite of all this, this movie has a certain something that regardless of it's faults, makes me want to watch it again and again, and ultimately you can't ask much more from a film than that.",The Haunting
161,astymegoesby,Could have been scarier!,7,19 July 2001,"The first reviewer said pretty much what I wanted to, except for a few things.  The house looks nearly identical to the one from ""Casper 'Friendly Ghost'"" & ""The Canterville Ghost"" - The acting was not bad but not good either with a few over ""exaggerated"" moments.  The bedroom in which the spikes came down is a cut + paste from ""Murder by Death"" - All the scary scenes & animation were well put together and very believable. The cast was picked well except for Owen Wilson who was better in ""Meet the Parents"" then this flick! Out of 5 stars, I give this movie 3 1/2.

163,Mephisto-24,Some houses are born bad. Films are just made that way.,2,20 March 2002,"The first scene in this remake of The Haunting is remarkably faithful to Shirley Jackson's subtle psychological chiller, but beyond that, any resemblance is almost purely coincidental. Jan de Bont's film is a gratuitous CGI-fest, visually spectacular but utterly inane. It owes more to television's Munsters and The Addams Family (both of which are mentioned) than to Robert Wise's eerie film or Jackson's novel, but unfortunately it is no more funny than it is frightening: any episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer would beat it on both counts. Lili Taylor performs well as Eleanor, and Bruce Dern has a nice cameo, but Neeson is wooden, Wilson is miscast, Zeta-Jones might as well be a shop mannequin, and the computer-generated ghosts overact atrociously. It's passable drive-in fare, and would make a cute ride at Disneyland, but it's a clear case of too many phantoms and not enough menace.",The Haunting
164,Sentinel-15,... And what a house it was!,7,21 April 2001,"To use an old cliché, if nothing else, this movie is truly a ""triumph of production design"". The house really is quite spectacular, beautiful, mysterious, filled with wonderful artwork - and lots of SFX.
While the 1963 version was very powerful in creating a ""haunted"" atmosphere, mostly by using the power of suggestion (using mostly sounds, special camera angles and creepy music, and letting your own imagination do the rest) here the makers took the opposite approach and pulled out all the stops in order to create a supernatural feast, truly making the whole house come alive.
Also very nice is the music by veteran Jerry Goldsmith.
So... is it a good movie? Well, I liked it. Was it over the top? Of course it was. And why not? What's the point in doing a remake of a classic if you're not going to try a different approach? If you don't like it, there's always the original...Check it out, if only for the gorgeous set design. A feast for the senses.",The Haunting
165,chucknorrisrules,Horrible,1,26 March 2010,"I was unlucky enough to be curious enough to see this film. At first glance at the trailer, it appears to be a sort of supernatural horror thriller movie, only to be sorely disappointed.The general storyline. Woman gets a phone call suggesting she sign up for an experiment in an old house. She meets a couple of other people (who seem to randomly vanish from the plot later without word of explanation) to take part in the experiment. Shortly after, strange things happen in the house, and things go further downhill (for the unfortunate audience).I first started to get suspicious when I saw the figures appearing via bedsheets, and somehow the main character doesn't find this remotely odd or scary. Later on, the house ups the ante, and I can't be bothered to further illustrate other than that the so called 'scares' are brought about by special effects (and not remotely scary), acting from all the cast is poor beyond belief - especially Lilli whats-her-face shouting 'you shall not harm a child' for no understandable reason whatsoever, and the climax seems to occur via something that wouldn't look out of place on scooby doo. All in all, I found myself inexplicably wondering why I hadn't wasted by time with a far superiour pile of cr*p. Like Freddie Got Fingered.Go and see paranormal activity instead. It is far superior.",The Haunting
166,MacBalthus,Nice creepy movie for kids.,3,2 December 2006,"The story is wild (in a boring way), the effects are good but simply not creepy at all and the actors seem to be as bored as the audience.The only tension I felt throughout this whole movie was when Catherine Zeta-Jones approached Lili Taylor with her sexual hunger. I was hoping for a little lesbian scene.You don't feel the evil in the house (which is a very nice house, I give the movie that) and without that, a movie about a bad house can't work. What does one need to create some nice horror? A bit of gore, some suspense, believable work of the actors, characters to relate to and an uneasy style. This was just a children's birthday party. Boring!",The Haunting

One cannot really call this much more than an ""attempt"" at a remake, as it fell flat on its face before it even got started.Perhaps the only redeeming quality of this film was that it featured Liam Neeson. The effects were overused or underused (depending on what point in the movie we are discussing), the characters were static (and Owen Wilson was horrible), and the attempts at comic relief were also a failure.4/10, for at least an honest attempt at making a remake of an old film which should never have been touched.",The Haunting
168,Superwonderscope,"BAD, BAD, BAD MOVIE",1,2 November 1999,"Never saw a bad movie like THE HAUNTING this year. Excellent FX and scary sound effects indeed. That's about it. First :Who cares about the actors? No one : Liam Neeson, owen Wilson and Miss Zeta jones might die,disappear, desintegrate... the story's still here, it can go on without them. Only Lili Taylor is necessary : do you call that a screenplay? Let's be honest, it's a symptom of screenplay. So D'WORKS needed name to sell this piece of rubbish called movie : let's take these guys, they might sell this good! (did they?) Second :Who Cares about the story? Why, why this need to rationalize fear, this need to explain evertyhing what's happening in the house, why can't people learn from what's has been already done? and WAY much better! Look at Robert Wise' THE HAUNTING. He just had the power to terrorize an audience without showing any ghost, without explaining the strange power of Hill House. The characters in 1963 had real motivations : they were real characters. The ghosts here are no the ones you expect. Jan de Bont piece of rubbish is no more than a wannabe-funhouse, totally useless, not needed, badly scripted and always looking for some more FX to keep you awake. Even the John HOUGH version of 1972 is far more scarier.Avoid that 1999 version  at any cost!",The Haunting
169,Eelco_1977,Pretty good movie!!!!!!,5,11 November 1999,"After reading a lot of negative reviews about this film, I found the time ripe to see and comment it too. When I look at the other films I've seen that Jan de Bont has made, Speed and Twister, I think The Haunting is, when looking at the screenplay, better than both those other two movies. But overall I think this movie is the second best Jan de Bont has made. Twister had a meagre story but never seen before special effects, The Haunting told a more developed story and had great special effects. Speed is still the best movie that Jan de Bont has made. The Haunting had a few very scary moments but wasn't as near scary as a horrormovie like Halloween, but maybe that's because in The Haunting a house played the leading role. The sets used in the film were extraordinary, I'd never seen such a beautiful scary house in another movie than the one that was in this film. Still, the movie had it's flaws. Not all the characters were well developed, the ending was a bit anticlimactic and not everything was as scary as it probably was meant to be. But overall a pretty entertaining movie (a 7 out of a 10).",The Haunting

You could take all the embellishment, visual and sound effects, add them up and compare them to just one scene in the orginal ""The Haunting"", - the ""bulging-door scene"" - and they would generate only a tiny sliver of suspense and terror that it did.  This will give you some idea of just how superior the original is to the remake.",The Haunting
171,Subzero7,EXCELLENT!!!!!!,10,31 July 1999,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!!!  This movie was sooooo good.  I went with a group from work and we all loved it.  It was the late showing and the auditorium was packed.  The whole audience got into it and laughed a little in the couple of humorous spots and jumped and screamed in the rest.  The acting was superb and the fx were top notch. (Done by ILM so of course they were.) :)  The story was great.  I saw the original a few years ago and it was great for it's time but this new updated remake for the 90's does make it even better.  I know not everyone likes it and of course the critics have given it bad reviews overall but hey, they're critics.  They wouldn't know a good movie if it came up and bit them in the a**.  :)  Face it, a good rule of thumb is, if the critics don't like it, it will be excellent and probably a block buster; if the do like it, then it probably sucks.  And excellent example is the Blair Witch Project.  They've given that movie top ratings and it REALLY stinks as far as it can.  Take the Blair movie and think ""Plan nine from outer space"" and you just be touching the tip of how bad that movie is.  But I digress.  Sorry.  GO SEE THE HAUNTING!!!!!!!!!

I figured that it was going to be a cheap Hollywood horror film designed to deliver profits and not much else. I was wrong. Though it starts just a little bit slow, once the action gets going it doesn't let up. The special effects used in the curtains and the stone creatures is fantastic. As far as spirits and ghosts go, it's no Exorcist, but it is a decent horror film with scares guaranteed to make you jump in your seat.",The Haunting

This is more of a family friendly horror film that really shouldn't be classed as a horror.Liam neeson gives a fair performance as does miss Zeta Jones but Lilli Taylor is depressing as the first hour is and seems to constantly repeat the same actions of running from her bedroom to the corridor then back to her room then being scared and going into the corridor again to which i found to be craptacular. Owen Wilson well, we'll just not go there.Jan De Bont really let himself down here, from films such as 'Speed' and 'Twister' to this which i was really looking forward. Another problem is that he did not pace the film well which is perhaps another reason for this film to be such a first hour of a shambles.",The Haunting

Bruce Dern's the only other actor here who seems more than cardboard.   Too bad he didn't have a bigger part.  This has been on TV several times and it's top notch by TV standards. It's entertaining, and one of the few films I've enjoyed watching more than once.   If you found ""The Others"" a total bore, as I did, you might try this film instead.  Beautifully filmed and with great special effects.

There's definitely an unsettling, creepy feeling throughout, but I admit that the Haunting only delivers a few good scares.  That, however, is no reason to avoid this film.  See it even if for no other reason than an incredible set and effects that are beyond special.  Okay, the face-in-the-sheet trick definitely gets old, and the story leaves something to be desired, but the effects are great, as anyone who has seen the previews knows.

This film is ridiculous in is setting and concept, and I have no idea what Liam Neeson was thinking when he signed on to do this stinker. Way over the top with special effects (why do so many filmmakers today think special effects are of paramount value? The are to be a part of the storytelling, not the story itself).

De Bont has forgotten that horror lies in subtlety and suspense -- you can't put a scarier image on the screen than the one the viewer creates in his mind.  But De Bont tries like hell, and ends up throwing out one bad computer generated special effect after another.  After the third or fourth ghostly face in the sheets, you'll be giggling.  By the time Liam Neeson is confronted with a huge face (in the ceiling, for a switch) and doesn't even blink, you'll be laughing out loud.  The house twists and turns and creaks -- except it really doesn't; it's all in a computer, and it's obvious.The end, with its lethal combination of terrible acting, horribly cheesy special effects, and utterly clueless sappy screenwriting (I don't want to spoil it, but it does feature Lili Taylor beating the hell out of a stone gryphon with a candlestick), will have you either rolling in the aisles or walking out of the theater.The movie is boring when it tries for suspense, funny when it tries to be scary, and braindead when it tries for drama.  It's a great, big, blunt object of a movie, and by the time it beat me over the head with the hundredth dumb line of dialog and the thousandth cheap special effect, I was down for the count.If you're looking for a laugh -- eh, go see South Park.

184,cubsckc,Worth a Watch,7,13 July 2014,"As a horror film, I think its a descent watch compared to many out there. Its a good watch to have one night for sure. Its different from most horror films because it basically deals with spirits and a haunted house. I would say this haunted house really did have a good way to grab the attention of the fans. So as far as directing the house to appear as an identity, I would say it goes as far as hitting farther than Amityville Horror. You could definitely feel the house. I was actually surprised to see the rating of the film. First of all, there isn't anything in this film that makes it BAD. To rate it a one, shows how terrible a lot of IMDb users are, who simply don't like something and put ones. I hardly ever give out a ten or a one because its an obvious ridiculousness. Okay, but what prevents this movie from being a big hit you ask? I would stress the acting as well as the plot are relatively underdeveloped. I think this is different from saying there is not plot or they didn't play out the plot very well. They invented a plot... and I'm just not sure many audiences can relate to it. Its an interesting plot but it doesn't really make you think you could be in a scenario like that. Part of scary movies and there suspense is that imaginative element that makes one play with an alternate universe where you could be in it. Instead, the scenario for these characters are not ones that anyone of us would like or even imagine ourselves in. As such, the protagonist and the actors aren't able to give that WOW factor. Mind you, it does have a creepy sense to it, but just doesn't hit it out of the park. I also question the use of Hansel from Derek Zoolander in this film. I actually think he made the movie less scary. All in all, if you haven't seen this yet, I say go for a watch. It will creep you out, and could give you the chills.",The Haunting

The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD, but I am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight.  After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't.  I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch.  Lili Talor was such a suck character.  I did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face.  I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film!

Neeson does his Star Wars thing again, good acting in a movie he shouldn't be in. But the worst is Catherine Zeta Jones, she may look hot, but she is a wooden actress. No one is going to listen, but trust me, despite its good premise, this film is awful. But you won't listen, cos it has a good premise. And all you need is a good premise to make a cinema full.

190,behamut,The children!,4,10 May 2002,"I thought this movie could have been done much better.  The special effects were incredible, and the sound quality was so immersive that one should listen to it for the experience alone.  But as for the story, it was pretty lame.  I don't remember how many countless times Lili Taylor (As Nell) was heard saying, ""but the children!""  ""Oh!  The children!""  It was so much it began to become stupid.  And just how she ""knew"" everything from the beginning.  It was irritating. As for being scary, let's put it this way.  I have a girlfriend who jumps at anything.  I can say, ""I'm going to scare you in three seconds. 1...2...3 Boo!""  And she'll still jump.  This movie bored her. Special effects alone won't save a movie any more.  EVERY movie has special effects, and any more, almost all of them are good.  This movie seemed to forget that fact and relied it's success heavily on amazing computer generated images and such.  Wasn't enough. I guess if you're in the mood for just a movie to watch, this one won't hurt.  It's not going to be overly entertaining for you, but it's not the worst movie made.  Just nothing to get excited over.",The Haunting
191,Mac-59,Boring,3,17 November 1999,"After reading a great deal about the film on the IMDB and in magazines, I was delighted to find my expectations for this film pretty much at rock bottom when I walked into that theatre last night. Unfortunately for me and my sister, the Fight Club was sold out, so we had to settle for the Haunting instead. The movie starts and we get a great shot of the haunted house known as Hill House. Wonderful! Beautiful sets and location saved this film from totally bombing but the effects were of no assistance. I've seen cooler looking ghosts in Casper or the Frighteners where they were supposed look cheesy. The Haunting was supposed to scare me. Guess what...it didn't. Instead of being scared I spent the whole time trying to figure out why supporting actors and actresses were vanishing from the script, if Liam Neeson was and good guy or a bad guy, and if Zeta-Jones is a lesbian. These are the only things that the film succeeded in making me think about. As such, I can basically sum up this movie in one word: boring.",The Haunting
192,Valek-5,Could have been a little bit better,6,2 November 1999,"This film relied a lot on visual effects (which were amazingly brilliant) and the house itself, which was a sort of ""Citizen Kane meets the Munsters"". The house itself was awe-inspiringly immense and ornate beyond description - it cannot be put into mere words the size and decor of this place.The beginning of the film was quite boring.  For the first 5 minutes I had no idea where the film was going.  I think it was just there to tie up what the rest of the film was about.The film itself started off with a good storyline which it kept almost until the end.  Having a main character become one with the door (and therefore, of course, the afterlife) was, I think, a bit of a let down.  They could have done something else with her.I think overall the imagery in the film made it the hit that it is, but it is still definately worth a see.",The Haunting
193,Bilstein,It was a film of three parts.....,1,9 July 2001,"Actually, this film was bought for me as a birthday present. I'd seen it in Woolworths, looked at it and thought it might be interesting, but nothing special. I had not specially asked for it, and the original film was rated by one magazine as the 4th scariest film of all time. Therefore, I didn't really have any expectations of this film. I expected it to be average, nothing spectacular and probably not as good as the original. Indeed, I began watching it in a fairly neutral mind.And it has to be said, things were going promisingly, what with the weird caretaker and wife, and the 'beautiful' (although that's arguable) carvings of the children's heads. The story about the former owner, who couldn't have looked more evil in his portrait if he had tried. It was working well, leaving me intrigued as to what was going to happen and when.Then we move to the rather unfortunate second part of the story. I can't really describe this part in any detail simply because it was so rushed that I didn't really have any idea what was going on or why. The startling discovery (which wasn't all that startling anyway) simply lacked justification. Why did it happen? Why did the former owner do what he did? Hello????And of course, the totally rushed second part makes way for the utterly awful third part of the film. What took place, for lack of a better word, was inane, utter drivel. And because I didn't know what was going on in the second part, I honestly couldn't say I cared that much about the third part. But what I find all the more amazing is claims by people that they found it scary. Er, when exactly? I found myself mildly amused by the pointless chasing about and ridiculous ending, but I never even jumped at it. A house with lights for eyes, and a plume of smoke for a villain simply made me look on in disgust.What started promisingly became a messy, ridiculous, overplayed storyline lacking any sense or ways to justify it.3/10 - simply for its promising start.",The Haunting
194,pain93,"Typical Hollywood, not very good, but never the less enjoyable!",7,15 March 2008,"I am usually not scared of horror films much, but I will say the original 1963 classic chiller 'THE HAUNTING' based off of Shirley Jackson's novel 'THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE' scared me to death! I think what made the original film so scary is that it makes you rely on your imagination, as you never really see any monster or ghost, while here it's one huge special effect after another which really, the CGI effects look terrible. The problem I think here is everything is handed to you with poor special effects that look cheesy...BUT if you can get passed those, even though it's a remake, and not very good...'The Haunting' is enjoyable.The house and set and Jerry Goldsmith's amazing and gorgeous score help engage you into the film as well as some nice cinematography. The acting is so-so, with Catherine Zita Jones being a pretty face to look at, but an 'OK' performance. Lili Taylor, I personally think does very well, though sometimes a bit fake...Owen Wilson makes things look too goofy, but isn't terrible and Liam Neeson is okay. Over all is you can tell this was a Hollywood movie...it looks as if the film makers and studio said, ""Lets make a film that we can have loads of special effects with!"" Not even bothering to care about atmosphere and other important factors of a horror film.But after all these terrible not very good moments and even though it is a remake of one of my all time favorite horror films, if you can get past the terrible effects, sometimes bad acting and writing...well you might find 'The Haunting' pretty enjoyable.",The Haunting
195,suemartin23264,Why?,4,25 June 2007,"The Shirley Jackson novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric tale of terror, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece.The 1963 chiller 'The Haunting' stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. Excellent! And then, Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.It starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.From then on, the film just spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue).The special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother listing them.So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money!Final rating: 4/10",The Haunting
196,r_ende,A weak horror movie!,4,21 December 2006,"The Haunting is a very disappointing movie. Although the actors play well the plot is so absurd, weak and ridiculous that it is not a good movie. The first 30 minutes of the movie are quite boring and nothing happens. Then the persons in the castle are attacked by ghosts and the plot becomes absurd. I really wondered how film-makers can have such absurd ideas by developing the movie. The only point I like is Jerry Goldsmith's score. The main theme which is related with the score of ""Hollow Man"" makes the atmosphere at least a bit scary. But all in all this film is not a good horror movie. There are many other films which are much better!",The Haunting

198,donaldsonramsay,THIS IS A TOTAL STINKER,4,25 March 2020,This is a very very bad movie. Where to start the cast just look like they're just wandering around overreacting to special effects. It's not scary. Catherine Zeta Jones should hand back her salary for this. Liam Neeson fairs little better and Owen Wilson is just Owen Wilson.. The main character whose name escapes me just basically runs about screaming the entire time. The story such as it is concerns an evil house with a shady and frankly quite tedious past.

I don't know what he tried to make, but he must have failed miserably.Liam Neeson started out as charismatic as ever, but ends up as demotivated and lost as the rest of the movie and cast. Owen Wilson is always good, but not here. Nothing is good in this movie, except for some of the decorations in the ""haunted"" house. Which seems to be haunted more by an awful crew and some pretty misplaced SFX, than by something creepy. I didn't jump in my seat once. It didn't even startle me. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones managed to thrill me, and she was a blast in The Mask Of Zorro (and in Entrapment). I gave this movie one star, and it got that one star only because I couldn't give it any less. If you see this movie, you'll waste almost two hours of your life. You'll never get them back.

200,Franklin-2,Despicable Adaptations R Us,1,28 May 2000,"I know it's not fashionable nowadays to complain that a filmdidn't do its source material justice, but I think it's ajustified complaint in this case as a) one of the sources isanother film and b) the people who mouth this blather probablycan't read anyway so who cares what they think.  That much said,""The Haunting"" is a terrible disappointment simply because itdraws on a masterful novel and very frightening earlier film andturns the material into so much pap.  Why do they have toexplain the haunting in human terms?  Why do they have to linkthe main character, Eleanor, to the house to explain itsapparent preying on her?The sad part is that this film was perfectly cast.  Lili Taylor,Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson could havedelivered knockout performances as the characters Ms. Jacksoncreated.  And I think the story could still work in itsoriginal, subtly psychological form (witness the success of ""TheBlair Witch Project"").  But instead the material was reduced toa six-year-old mentality and the whole thing overloaded withspecial effects that often arouse laughs (Taylor fighting off agiant stone griffin with a candlestick is  a real howler).  It'ssad when you prostitute yourself to the lowest common denominator and can't even deliver at that level.The only excuse for renting this film is as the centerpiece ofan MST3K party.  Other comic highlights include the housekeeperwho says she's too busy cooking dinner to answer the front door,then immediately leaves her cooking to show Taylor to her room;Wilson getting dragged around helplessly on a killer rug whenclearly all he has to do is roll off the damned thing; andTaylor almost getting raped--by her bed.

As a thriller, it's not thrilling. as a fantasy, it's not fantastic.I'm not trying to be funny, but this is a horror film that has barely any fear in it. I'm not a fan of jump scares, but at least they scare you. There are no dark scenes, no silences, no creepy music, no scary situations. There's too much light throughout the film. The monsters are primarily furniture - a bad with some sort of sharp tentacles, statues that come to life but go back to being statues after being slapped with a broom for a bit. Also the bed stops attacking when other people are looking at it.There is no real mystery. There's some ridiculous story about children or a painting or whatever, but you don't wonder what's the secret. They're mentioned at times, but it has no consequence on the plot. It's just anecdotes rather than plot points.The whole thing is contrived - a sleep study in a haunted house.The acting is ridiculous, as well as the casting.

Whereas the Wise film subscribes to the ""Less is More"" school, the 1999 filming falls victim to the ""More is Less"" approach. Despite a promising cast, the film gives them nothing to do except wander about in absurdly grandiose CGI interiors. The CGI itself is often disappointing, caught in that lost decade when the technology was more ambitious than convincing. But worse, the terrific dialog that Jackson wrote into the book, and that Wise remained faithful to, is lost. Indeed, the story bears little resemblance to the novel, except the broad outline of the four investigators plus the Dudleys and the name of the house and its builder.While there are a couple of creepy scenes (think of the flip book), the film overall has the sensibility of a low-rent Monster House.",The Haunting

I have the original film and although they are similar, they are enough different that you can enjoy one and then the other.  Everytime I watch the new version I concentrate on the detail present, it is mind boggling. The ending of the film I think could have been a bit better, perhaps, but the rest of the film was good enough that the ending was OK; which made it a bit like the original film. If you have never seen the original, you should. It was super and it never really shows a creature or demon. But, you are convinced they are there, just the same. I should say that I have the advantage of viewing the new movie on DVD and with a very good sound system.  With a big screen and a good sound system the film really gets you.",The Haunting

I was expecting a scary or spooky movie and it was neither. The premise of the movie was never studied. It turned into more of a silly mystery story than anything. Only Lili Taylor's character was even used in the movie while ignoring the others. It spiraled into a typical Hollywood overblown blow everything up movie.

Instead of just throwing a ton of good graphics around with barely any connection between them, here everything is well-put together. Even the ending has more of a psychological and moral meaning than most of the ghost movies I've seen lately. I realize it was a remake of a 60's movie, however, and the original always has a bit more insight than a remake, so I'll probably watch the original version now, and recommend anyone to do the same.

So I admittedly give this film more leeway than I might with another actress in the role.Having said that...THE HAUNTING is a fun ride.  Outstanding visual effects, great use of sound, amazing sets.  Some hokey dialogue (mostly from Lily Taylor's character and progressively more of it as the movie goes on) and some thin plot points hamper what was otherwise a good light-hearted scare.  Some of the early scenes and dialogue are very self-effacing and tongue-in-cheek.  The welcome-to-the-house speech from the caretaker's wife is hilarious.  If that tone had been maintained throughout, so much the better.  Sadly, half the cast plays it straight.  Would have appreciated a more consistent tone from director Jan DeBont.Worth seeing for the effects.  Some decent frights.  It'll make you look at your own house differently.

The first one didn't need special effects at all, and this computer generated farce made a mockery of the good work that was done by Ms Jackson and Robert Wise. I even wrote to the distributor from which I bought the flick, and they were going to give me credit for it if I sent it back. I didn't take them up on it however; I merely wanted to register my distaste for it.Owen Wilson was atrocious as Luke Sanderson; how could someone be so obnoxious? Lili Taylor was good as Nell Lance, however, and I felt sorry that she had to deal with this tripe.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is a stunning vision but her character has no depth or decent lines to work with.  Lili Taylor makes the best of it and her character is definitely the most interesting in the film.  Liam Neeson seems bored and Owen (can't remember his last name as of now) seems to be transplanted in from a different movie.  Lots of talent, lots of promise but no deliver.

This remake dumbs down the story seemingly to target 8 year-olds. It relies on artificial special effects rather than good acting. The cast does not fit the story, indeed the cast seems like a random selection of mostly comedic stage personalities, not chosen for their acting ability, Liam Neeson notwithstanding.

Jan de Bont has been involved in some great movies, but on checking his filmography I think I spotted a thread:  He's done some great looking films as a cinematographer (Die Hard, Black Rain, Hunt for Red October, Flatliners) but his films as a director (Speed, Twister, Speed2 and The Haunting) all exhibit common traits.  They are much more interested in stretching the technical boundaries than the dramatic ones, and they all really just let rip with effects in the latter part of the film.

222,Sylvester,Poor remake of a classic chiller.,1,10 May 2001,"This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects.  For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room.  Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her.  Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor.  It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened.  And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean - ""It's about family.  It's always been about family""?The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth.  In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion.  Zeta-Jones, however has to spell it out, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.",The Haunting
223,number909,Spiritual throwback to the old haunted house films.,5,13 June 2000,"Without overwhelming the film, the special effects in The Haunting nake it a very satisfactory remake. Perhaps this is a sign that producers and directors are beginning to learn that the FX need not be the star of the film, but an integral part. Most of the effects here lead up to a final burst at the end. Throughout they add to the ...well...spiritual ambiance. I felt it was a throwback to the old haunted house films, where mood and atmosphere really build suspense. Perhaps it's a good thing if a director has to work within a PG-13 rating. My love for Stephen King aside, it's sometimes way too easy to go for the gross-out. The plaintive sounds of the spirits haunting the house were truely evocative of their pain. I liked the way they connected with Lili Taylor's character, and her reactions to the manifestations were unexpected. It's an entertaining movie which keeps things going without going over the top.",The Haunting
224,rageinblack,"Ignore the critics, go see this underrated gem full of eye-candy!",10,19 January 2018,"I went to watch this movie at the cinema when it came out in 1999 and I was blown away. No matter what people say, this movie will always have a soft spot in my heart. Let me, first of all, say that I knew nothing about the movie or even that it was a remake. Little did it matter, because I enjoyed the movie so much it was very entertaining!First of all, let me say it is pure eye-candy. Everything, the visual atmosphere was perfect, the location was top notch, visual effects were superb for the time, and still look good today, IMO. The story was mysterious intriguing and creepy, the acting was not that great, but quite ok. But above all, It opened my mind to the world of ghost movies, made me absolutely love them and search for them ever since.I then later saw the original The Haunting from 1693 and I could understand, why the remake got so much hate, since it strays so much from the original black and white movie, which is in my eyes awesome, very well done and oh so haunting. The 1999 version is like it's completely different movie. It does share similarities but it does not feel anything much like the original. The original didn't show any entities, the remake showed a lot of them, making most people hate the fact because it lacked subtlety. And that is true, however, I like both movies a lot, it is just that I look at them under a different light.While the original haunting from 1963, was a more serious, darker movie, its remake from 1999 is a more lighten-up version, we can safely say that it's made to appeal to a younger generation, especially with all that eye-candy treats and also some pretty cheap humor. But to be honest I don't mind its flaws. Not many movies intrigued me to the level that The Haunting (1999) did when I first saw it. True that some CGI may look silly and might be overused, but I will be forever grateful to this movie and for me, it's a criminally underrated gem. It's mysterious, creepy and scary but also Beautiful, I don't know what we want more from a horror movie? 
Its biggest mistake was indeed, to take the reputation of being the remake of such a classic gem. If it would've come out with a different, original name perhaps it would most likely get the respect I feel it deserves.It's perhaps the movie that reminds me most of Phantasmagoria, an exceptionally creepy PC game from the '90s put on 7CDs, and an interactive movie, as they called it. On a side note; someone should make a movie adaptation of it as well :) Also if you like the story from The Haunting, you should also check out ""The Legend Of Hell House (1973) and The Uninvited (1944)""",The Haunting
225,supertaz80,Not a faithful adaptation but a fun scary film nevertheless,6,24 February 2021,"A satisfactory b grade thriller.This film is based on the Shirley Jackson book Haunting of Hill House. However, this film, while utilising characters, settings and some plot from the original, takes great artistic license, adding plot, backstory, relationships that weren't on the original book/film.You do need to take this as a stand alone thriller though as this is only loosely based on the Jackson novel, and if that is your benchmark, this may disappoint.Review of Film on it's own merit
***************************************The story, plot and acting are all fine. The premise probably wouldn't happen in real life (is the premise that gets them to the house...). The 'house' is magnificent in scale and features, much more so than the original house concept (possibly too much so really). But there are parts with 'effects' that are a bit much- almost circus like. It uses more overt terror, scares and incidents which are typical of the modern style of horror film, than the original. This will probably suit many audiences today.In terms of acting Lili Taylor is great and the others are fine.
Personally, the ending was contrived, a bit silly and a let down. I deducted a point for the ending.There are better scary films like The Conjuring (also with Taylor), but this one is a fine 'B grade' lark.
Review as an adaption
****************************
This is absolutely not Jackson's story.It is loosely based on her characters and story, but takes great creative license to change everything up. Luke is not the owner. The doctor is not investigating the paranormal as such. The house is ridiculously embellished with quirky rooms that are a bit clownish.The backstory of Crain to add 'depth' and 'fill blanks' is new and macabre. The paranormal incidents are overt and visible - very 'modern' unlike the Gothic style of Jackson which relied on the unseen. In fact this version is more of a haunting of ghosts rather than the original concept of a house being bad 'not sane'. Also, the ending is vastly different and problematic and kind of ridiculous. Although I was a little let down by Jackson's ending, this one is laughable.This film lacks the subtlety of the original story which relied on what you could not see. This film uses CGI to 'show you'. Which is not necessarily a bad thing in general, although at times here it's a bit silly.Do not approach viewing this film as an adaptation. If you want a filmic version of SJs story - there's the 1960s film.
or my preference the Netflix series which also takes license but is more interesting, believable and in tune with original notions.",The Haunting

Any guffaws were derisive in nature.Once again De Bont proves he has a great talent with action, but has no talent with a story.  The ending was so cliche, so trite, so hackneyed... It's like he took every horror movie cliche he could find and threw them all into the last 15 minutes.He's a director who needs some studio masters to take him in hand and assign him projects where he cannot deviate from the screenplay.  A decent development exec or producer with a head for a story instead of bean counting and testing things to death, combined with De Bont's skill, and you could get a few more good movies out of him.Sadly, the grosses on this one are likely to give De Bont carte blanche to do a couple more bad movies.",The Haunting

Anyone who has seen the original will have to admit that the ""spiral staircase"" scene is a big improvement over the '63 version.

Once you got into the legitimately scary parts it was fairly intense, but by that time I honestly could almost not care less.  This movie had a lot of potential I think.

The special effects, while maybe good, become annoying and you soon finding yourself questioning your own sanity as the characters lose theirs.

237,Skeptic-8,My pulse rate didn't increase by so much as a beat.,1,25 July 1999,"This film would have to improve a few notches to be considered merely bad. Whether in its acting or creaking FX, it was risible from beginning to end.Somewhere in the machinery of special effects, Hollywood has lost sight of the essence of a good scare, which is what H. P. Lovecraft, master of the horror tale, identified as ""nameless terrors.""  What he meant is that no physical depiction of scary things can ever chill the marrow so much as what the mind conjures up from images implied but unshown.  The fundamental error of this film is its reported expenditure of $75 million to create a mechanical set that makes the menace visible.  The Blair Witch Project, with a total budget of $20,000, and without any resort to special effects or scary-looking things, is much more genuinely chilling than this lumbering, clanking bore.It would be indictment enough to call a horror film ""numbingly dull,"" but this film commits other sins worth noting.  For instance, what is Liam Neeson doing here?  An actor of both stature and reputation, one can only conjecture that he was blackmailed into taking the part of the Machiavellian doctor who lures subjects to a purported sleep study at a creepy house, while actually studying the effects of fear.  The role is so ill-defined and cartoonish that it could more inexpensively, but equally convincingly, have been occupied by a cardboard cut-out.  Neeson barely improves upon that option.  Other cast members are equally unconvincing:  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a schizophrenic role apparently cut from 23 different personae, none of them believable, and Lili Taylor's entire assignment is to look scared, which she only occasionally manages.If you want a good scare, read Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, on which the film is purportedly, though unrecognizably, based.

239,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,"A haunted house movie that's high on budget, but low on scares.",5,6 February 2007,"""The Haunting"" came out back in 1999 and is directed by Jan de Bont (Speed, Twister). The story is set up when Dr David Marrow convinces three insomniacs to spend the night in a mansion. He does so by telling them that he is studying insomnia in an attempt to help individuals such as themselves. What he's really doing though is studying the effects of fear and how different people react in very diverse ways. Sure enough, the group begin to show signs of paranoia and fear. But are they imagining things or is there something far more sinister happening in the house? I thought this version of ""The Haunting"" had a fair few things going for it when I heard about it. Firstly, it's based on a successful 60s film that was really very good. You'd think that with an increased budget ($80 million) and standard in both audio and visual effects, they'd be able to improve on the original. It also has some big names in it with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson all included. Even the house that the film takes place in is suitably massive and creepy. Surely all these ingredients would add up to an above average fright flick! Well unfortunately, it didn't work out the way it should have. The reasons for this aren't all that easy to define. I mean, the acting is OK (Owen Wilson shouldn't play these roles though, he should stick to comedy), the house itself is perfectly designed and the audio is filled with creepy sounds and disturbing whispers. But even with all this, it's just not frightening in any way. The movie spends the first hour setting things up and your patience will seriously be tested. When things actually do start happening towards the end of the film, it feels contrived and even unintentionally humorous at times. The dialogue is fairly atrocious, the first death scene is ridiculous (will you just move!) and there's nothing subtle about anything that occurs. This is the main difference between the original and the remake. The 1963 version worked on the viewer's nerves through suggestion and believability. It was all about what you couldn't see that was frightening! Instead, the creators of this version decided to show us everything, and considering how fake a lot of the CGI appears, it only lessens the effect rather than improving on it.As you can tell, I'm disappointed in this film. It's not a complete waste of time and I've definitely seen worse. But I can't really recommend it as a must see film.

I like Liam Neeson as an actor, and I could just sit and watch Catharine Zeta-Jones for hours at a time, but their talents are wasted here. The idiot writers changed the story (where do the children come from?) so that it's nearly unrecognizable and then add the usual bloody gory special effects which are not in the original at all. One of the things that makes the novel and the original movie so special is the fact that nothing happens on stage at all. Everything is left to the mind of the viewer and that makes it very scary.

I rate how I feel about a movie based on a combination of what my expectations are for it based on the advertising, how much they spent making it, who is in it, and how much I paid to see it.  So, a low budget clunker that I see at a $5 matinee show will get a pass over a high budget clunker that I pay full price for.  The Haunting fits into the latter category.  This is just a putrid pile of puss of a movie and I would think you would be better off in a dentist chair than sitting at home watching this film.I was sitting around a few years back watching some bad horror movie and realized that I had not seen a really frightening movie in a long time.  I was in the mood to be scared and I saw the making-of video for The Haunting on HBO.  It looked like it might be scary, with all of those menacing looking sets, so I decided to go see it that night with my wife, thinking we would be in for a scary movie.  Turns out that the whole movie was nothing but menacing looking sets, with no scares behind them at all.  In fact, my wife and I spent most of the time in the theatre laughing very loudly at the horrible plot, the inane dialogue, the misplaced special effects, and the absolutely horrid acting by Lili Taylor.  I'm not sure what else she has been in, but based on her performance in this film I would never watch any of her other movies.  I literally laughed every time she said ""Hugh Crane"" or whatever the ghosts name was.  She acted the way a little kid would on the playground if they were playing The Haunting.By far, the thing that ticked me off the most in the movie was the menacing sets.  It felt like they were setting you up the entire movie for something really scary to happen in one of these ominous rooms, but nothing ever happened.  They spent an hour showing off the mansion and how weird it was, but nothing happened.  A great example was the mirrored-room with the carousel.  They went in there in the beginning and I thought something would happened.  It conjured up images of Something Wicked This Way Comes, so I thought ""OK, something weird has to happen in here"".  When they finally go back there, all that happens is that Nell sees herself in the mirror looking pregnant or something.  What is that?  How do you run around for two hours going ""oh my God, something frightening is going to happen"" and then nothing happens... Oh my God, the one lady got hit in the eye with a broken string form the harpsichord...ooooo I have to hide my eyes.I normally give any movie a chance, but we almost walked out of this one. If it had not been so comical seeing these actors floundering in the muck, we would have left.  Never rent this, never buy this.  It's one big, over-budget, set-driven nightmare that stole $18.00 out of my pocket.  You want to be scared?  Watch Jeff Goldblum's performance in The Fly.  You want to laugh?

This movie ruined the whole haunted house stories for me.  I didn't understand why the director decided to show camera shots of completely unrelated things like water dripping off of the car.  That served no point at all.  Let's even assume that it was gas dripping from the car instead of water, THE CAR WAS TOTALED!  This movie put me to sleep three or four times.

255,pwfinch,How to callously slaughter a great movie and an even greater novel,1,7 April 2007,"First, the bits that work: the house, both externally and internally (where it is a miracle of pseudo-Gothic design). Now, the bits that don't work: every other aspect of the film.My only conclusion can be that Jan de Bont doesn't understand the first thing about horror. It's clearly a forlorn hope that he has even an inkling of the subtle psychological nuances that made the original novel and the very effective movie version of 1963 such benchmarks in the genre, but on this showing he doesn't even understand basic horror, preferring to plunge his viewers into the breathtaking but ultimately brief world of visual roller-coaster rides rather than exposing them to the sort of deep-rooted primal fears that will linger long after the projector has stopped running.I'm sad to say it, but almost every decision he made in this very unwise remake of a movie classic appears to have been the wrong one.Whereas in the original we wandered nervously through a shadowy world of eerie statues, patterns in paper, pounding doors and unhinged minds, here we watch bored as monsters emerge from fireplaces, big faces appear in ceilings and beds come to life in order to eat the people who are sleeping in them. Whereas in 1963 only one character was really haunted, and even then we weren't entirely sure that she wasn't responsible for it herself, in 1999 the entire cast are subjected to a procession of overblown CGI horrors, many of which border on the totally silly.This movie lacks any sense of mystery or suspense. Within a few minutes there's no question in our minds (even if there still is in the ultra-dumb characters' minds) that a malevolent and very real supernatural force is at work here. Instead of trying to work out whether we're dealing with psychological aberrations or something more sinister, we're very quickly trying to find out who the spirits are and why they're here, which while it might be diverting enough for a family audience watching a Disney ghost movie, is no challenge for hard-core adult viewers who are here to be spooked. I don't wish to keep harping on with this comparison, but despite the presence of accomplished actors, the performances here are a million miles from those tautly realised characters in the 1963 movie. Liam Neeson sleepwalks through his part, on occasion playing it for laughs, on others looking mildly tense and worried, but never even hinting at the depths of deviousness a person would require to entrap all these people in such a dangerous place. Catherine Zeta-Jones is slinky and sexy and pretty, and completely superficial and shallow  a very pale imitation of Claire Bloom back in '63, whose ice-cool cat woman (and lesbian) was the last word in independent-minded womanhood. Owen Wilson, not yet a star at this stage, tries the hardest to give a 'real performance', but only succeeds in creating a twitching, irritating oddball, whose very presence is a distraction from the main story. As for Lili Taylor, who has the pivotal role of Eleanor Lance, suffice to say that it's not entirely her fault. The film's makers clearly decided beforehand that their Eleanor would be a self-sacrificing heroine, rather than the main victim (and possible cause) of the Hill House horrors. Therefore Taylor can't be blamed for making her character an innocent lamb, deeply abused and neglected, but then rising fearlessly to the challenge and eventually giving it everything she's got in the embarrassing finale, when all the tortured souls are rescued and go to Heaven  which, to say the least, is missing the point of the entire story, though by this time of course, any semblance to either of the original two masterpieces is long forgotten, so it probably doesn't matter anyway.But these issues of movie taste aside, considering they spent $80 million on this, it's all such a porridge. In technical terms alone there are quirks galore. Two characters, one of whom never even speaks, arrive with the team early on and a very short while later leave again, having served no purpose whatsoever. By the same baffling token, the screenwriters would have us believe that eminent psychologist Neeson has deliberately lured a bunch of people with sleeping disorders to this house, where he confidently expects them to be terrified out of their wits and plans to study their reactions, and that he expects to get away with it (have these guys never heard of malpractice suits?). In another scene, utterly ludicrously, Neeson is grabbed by a gigantic bronze hand, which comes to life for no apparent reason, and dunked in a stagnant pond  only to walk calmly away afterwards and get on with his weekend as if nothing has happened. To me, that latter incident underlines this movie's main weakness  it treats its audience like a bunch of imbeciles. We queued up to watch it in order to be scared  at least as much as we were by the original, if not more so given the larger budget this time around. We didn't come to be wowed by a plethora of special effects, which at the end of the day have become fairly routine in modern movies. A clunking travesty, which sums up so much of what's wrong in Hollywood these days: ""Forget the vacuous script and dud performances. Just pack it with snazzy FX and the popcorn crowd will be satisfied.""",The Haunting

Knowing the plot was a little bit elementary and the characters were incoherent in the story, The Haunting made my nerves stiff. What really bothered me throughout the movie was the main character, Eleanor. The actress who plays this role can't act. Throughout the entire film, she always seem to be delusional, psychotic, and plain mad. She sees the children ghost fluttering around, but she isn't terrified by this abnormal sight. Instead of screaming her lungs out, she goes along with the ghost and tries to help free the children from this old guy and I don't want to spoil the rest for you. Another thing that annoyed is the reason why the ghosts only communicated to Eleanor but not the other three members. It's like they're there just to be there. I am going to sum it up for you: Eleanor is completely annoying, the minor characters don't really do much, could have been a lot more spooky, and the ghosts should had affected everyone.",The Haunting

Wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place.  The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way.  The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was.  Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand.  Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her.

For the first 3/4 of the film, it was quite an intense experience..before the digital effects came in. C'mon...they absolutelly ruin the horror element for me. The script writer (and De Bont) should have realised that seeing less is better, not the other way around. The ending though was a bit too melodramatic and groan inducing. Script wise, it started out excellent during the first half, with some clever dialogues before deteriorating tremendously near the end.All in all, not as bad as people would lead you to believe but it could have been great...a bundle of unrealised potential.

When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, ""The Haunting"", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects.  But, deep down, I had faith.  Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety.  Well, subtlety, where are you now!!??  My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies.  In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.  We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown.  No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what?  As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly.  And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that. Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown.  I'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity...only groans.

May be they payed him good enough to make it bearable, but its a step backwards for the talented actor.Catherine Zeta Jones, who showed everyone in movies like 'Traffic' and 'High Fidelity' that she is not just a pretty face, but also can act as good as anyone, is not as impressive as in those works of her. Including the leading actress Lily Taylor (Gaudi afternoon, Ransom, High Fidelity) and Owen Wilson (Armageddon) although none of the four are at their best, I still can say that the acting is the only thing that makes you watch it till the end.This is neither a ""guys & girls from school goes to a deserted camp & got killed"" movie, nor an old fashioned thriller. Computer tricks supposed to scare us but most of the time it does not. I think the best word for the plot is dull. Instead of being scared, you got bored. You notice some logical mistakes while you are watching and this was a huge distraction for me.The director, Jan De Bont - who I must admit is not one of my favorites - was much successful as a cinematographer by involving in movies like Lethal Weapon 3, Hunt for Red October, Flatliners, Shining Through and Die hard.

Too bad they *did* hire Jan de Bont, because as it went on, it became more and more predictable and ridiculous. In the end, it was in shambles.

I wouldn't mind living there, sans the annoying ghosts, of course. It's campy, sure, but remember that this is a haunted house picture. And as far as campy horror flicks go, this one had potential. I say that in the past tense because as it went on, it quickly went downhill. By the end, it was in shambles, having succumbed to every horror cliché in the book. The characters were unconvincing, the story was ridiculous (i.e. Eleanor's relationship to the house), and there were no real scares. Even the special effects were overdone, even for a big budget movie.In the end, the only thing more predictable than this storyline is that Jan de Bont will, unfortunately, continue to make bad movies.

275,BlackVelvet88,Tried to take it far but didn't,5,5 August 2006,"This movie wasn't necessarily scary, but it was mysterious and freaky, I'll give it that. The set designs were great; they really gave the spooky haunted house feeling. The artistry of the multiple statues in the house was good, too. The cinematography was OK; the lighting kind of weakened it. And the acting was good. They weren't the best, but, fairly talented.However, it was disappointing. The script was, I guess, OK, but the rest - the story, the children's tale, the drama - were all things to frown at. A few of the actions there were really unnecessary, some of the elements of the house that ""welcomed"" protagonist Eleanor (Lili Taylor), I could see was sort of copied from Rosemary's Baby, as I said - were unnecessary. I think they were put there to make intense moments in the film or ""take it far,"" But as my title suggests, they just couldn't.Let me state some examples (if some of these were in the book, I can understand why they were there. If not, then I cannot). Near the end, an enraged Luke (Owen Wilson) suddenly went mad, tearing away at Hugh Crane's portrait with a candlestick and then raving away that they should burn the house down, thus angering the spirit of Hugh Crane. This gets him killed. First of all, I don't think they should have gotten him killed. Luke was just a ""fellow insomniac,"" as he likes to quote so much, with opinions and reputations no worse nor better than any of the other characters in there. He had no reason to die. It wasn't going to alter the film so much, nor was it going to teach anything, and it wasn't going to make it better or more intense. In fact, it just made it worse. I was thinking, ""whoa, why'd he just do that?"" Even so, if he really had to die, then he could've done it in a better way, instead of that random, suddenly-going-mad drama (that was very unlike him) that he broke into. The part where the carpet drags him to the fireplace and he is smashed (or gorged) by that chimney opening thing was scary, but honestly, if the film went like it was supposed too, it wouldn't have to have been there.And especially so, what was the conflict between Hugh Crane and Nell? At one point she says that he wants her, then later it's revealed that she is one of his great-great granddaughters, indicating the obvious fact that Crane won't let her go like he didn't let his other ""children"" go. But sooner or later (or the middle of that), Nell sees herself pregnant in the spinning room illusions. Now what? He wants incest with her too? Even if that pregnant thing has got nothing to do with Hugh Crane or her, it's too random. Why'd they put it in there? And if it's not random, that some of the hidden facts in there set if off, then I demand an explanation telling exactly why.Overall, I would have enjoyed this film if it didn't have such excess intensity. Anybody else would have. I wish I'd seen the original film based on the book (which I haven't read yet).

Then, I viewed the 1963 original version and again, found it significantly faithful to the novel as to be chilling and engaging.This version is, at best, boring. In retrospect, the best scene and the one with the most chance of evolving into a decent flick of any genre is where Eleanor has to deal with her sister and a ruthless brother-in-law. From here on the acting falls flat and character development is non-existent.

282,Transit,Unrealized potential,4,5 August 1999,"It is surprising how many of the characters in the film come across as superfluous. I mean, really, the whole tale seems like it could be carried by Eleanor Vance vs. the spirit world, if only they could come up with a more convincing way of getting her into the house.The character of Theo is a prime example. Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous and provocative, but one can't help feeling that her sole function for being in the film is to look pretty and say outrageous things in a desperate attempt to shoehorn sex appeal into a plot that has no real room for it. In fact, the only part of her that is not shown off to good advantage is her acting skill, making it painfully obvious that her role is primarily decorative. But the sad part is... that alone makes her far more useful than most of the rest of the cast.Her scene, for example, with Liam Neeson, as Theo chastises the good Dr Marrow for his tarnished ethics and poor judgement in having put them all in this situation in the first place lacks the passion one would expect from someone who's got so much right to be angry at being made a lab rat, yet, it's just as well, as Neeson himself seems half asleep while she rants, and strikes me throughout the film as never really understanding his role.And as for Luke (Owen Wilson) --- oh, my. Has there ever been a character so utterly pointless for anything but getting himself killed by angry spirits? And the way the whole thing is put together and acted out leaves us unable to believe the whole death scene ever happened in the first place. I mean, what was that emotion supposed to be, anyway? Panic? Or just utter stupidity? If possible, this character and his portrayal are even more disfunctional than any of the others.I agree with other comments I've read, that Lili Taylor manages to pull off her role [Eleanor] with some degree of dignity, but even she has a hard time portraying the sense of encroaching madness one would expect under such stresses, though her role was the best one the film had to offer, and she does manage it with some degree of grace and skill.The technical effects in the film were very nice. I'm a fan of such things in general, although I was disappointed that easily four fifths of the best fx were already seen in the local TV ads, they were, in general, nicely supplemental to the incredible atmosphere created simply by the sets themselves. A house so elaborately designed as Hillhouse is portrayed would, in and of itself be an awesome effect, even without the techno trickery brought on by the plot.

I got what is expected out of a basic horror movie: some frightening moments that make you jump in your seat and others that just make you shiver.  The plot was above average and the acting was not poor in my opinion, but what lacked (like in many other horror movies) was an ending that flowed and did not just wrap things up.  I felt like everything was rushed and every loose end was cut off to look like a neat package.  I can remember seeing for my first time my favorite horror movie, Hellraiser.  The movie left me disturbed yet all together happy because there was no neat package to admire at the end.  It left things up to your own imagination which is what is the source of fear in the first place. The Haunting delivers a great plot and first two acts, but then fails to deliver the third with as much power.  So although the previews may have excited and driven all of us to see it, I believe that many times a movie is judged on the feeling you are left with.

287,ross-41,"Real potential, but wrong script",5,10 September 1999,"The first 15 ~ 20 minutes of this movie set up for the greatest ""ghost house"" movie of all time,... but then it spirals in its own fatal flaws:The good: The setup was amazing.  I still can't get over the house, those huge bed rooms, the ""canal water"" hall, the ""revolving"" room,  The setting was just what was needed for the mood. The characters were better than average,  we had a manipulative professor, the low-self-esteem house wife, the housekeepers that clearly know more than they let on, the sex-symbol incarnate of Zeta-Jones.... These people were classic requirements of the tale to be told.The Bad:  After about 20 minutes of the movie, specifically the first night in the house...  all that glorius setup is dumped in the toilet....  The professer turns out to be a sniveling waste of science with no real motive or control as we might have guessed.  The fireplace was a b-movie side set...  the ""canal water"" hall was never explained, it seemed to be just an excuse to see Zeta-Jones's rear as she hopped from book to book earlier in the movie.. The ""revolving room"" was just a visual effect,  The much reported ""stairwell scene"" was more of an annoyance than any real story or plot device.  Two characters were even dropped 1/3 of the way into the movie without any attempt to check up on them later.The Ugly:  The story Clearly this is a case of a poor story that SKG tried their darnedest to hide with state-of-the-art FX, which by only helped to confuse the already clouded and vague ""dead children who need rescued"" plot line.  The ending was visually impressive, but it made no sense on first viewing, and left no desire for repeat viewing to figure it out.  Characters devolved into cardboard cutouts of their potential. Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones both need to have serious discussions with their agents.  Liam is a proven actor when it comes to strong convictions and manipulative planning, (see Rob Roy and Schindler's List) but here his talents were wasted.  Catherine was on a huge upswing when Zorro came out, due to her physical presence, and getting out of the hero's way when called needed.  But with a dissapointing performance in Entrapment, and no real character in this movie, her career may be over before it beginsIn short, if they took the inital setup and ran with it, it could have been a hell of a movie.  Don't compare this to Blair Witch,  it wasn't trying to be that type of movie.  The setup and special effects were fantastic, the story and plot were lacking5 out of 10",The Haunting
288,ladyjane99,The Hill House May Cause Insomnia,9,23 January 2000,"The camera work, special effects and sound effects in this film are truly enjoyable, and give you all the creeps you need. Plus add a good cast to go through the haunting experience, and you've got a pretty good movie. Makes me wonder why critics were putting it down. I enjoyed it, and liked the fact that it actually had a plausible story. Not something unbelievable out of space or a cosmic creation, or a revengeful ghost killing everyone. Maybe that was best about the movie, killing the characters and thinning out the cast was not the main point but it were the creepy sounds, the things you didn't see and then the visual effects that kept you in suspense. Well, there are these haunted houses in New England... (though the ""castle"" of this movie was in Britain.)",The Haunting

And the message's this: you cannot escape your fate. Poor Nell Vance played by Lily Taylor thought she could find relief living for a short time in this magnificent mansion. She had been taking care of her Mom till her death and she doesn't know that she'll find in that haunted manor not only the ghosts and the fears of her past but that she's also doomed to die there. What I mean is : is there an unluckier woman than her? Lily steals the show undoubtedly in this flamboyant movie, whereas Catherine Z. Jones shines only because she's really very , very hot.As for Liam Neeson who plays Dr. Marrow and Owen Wilson who stars as the third guest of the manor,: well let's be honest their roles are not so poignant in this movie although  Dr. Marrow's idea of causing fear in his patients is not such a bad idea.Problems come when he loses control of the whole thing",The Haunting
290,vickievallencourt,Modern FX ruin the re-make of a horror classic.,1,2 June 2004,"The 1963 version of this film managed considerable chills and thrills WITHOUT resorting to silly special effects. This awful re-make is an example of Hollywood at its laziest. They've taken the basic premise (a scientist enlists two young woman and a skeptical young man to participate in his overnight study of a haunted mansion) and stuffed it full of loud, obnoxious special effects. Director Jan De Bont doesn't know the first thing about suspense in film. With any good horror movie, the imagination of the audience is the most powerful tool in a filmmaker's arsenal- Hitchcock, Craven, Carpenter, and Shyamalan all know this. Unfortunately, the dreadful 1999 version of THE HAUNTING never even tries to engage our imagination; it's too busy piling on the CGI.",The Haunting

292,lindalozar,Please spare me from remakes,2,21 June 2021,"I have seen both the original & this one several times. They both are faithful to the book, up to a point. The original could have worked better with a bit more back ground on Nell, but over all good. This one is a travesty. It starts off fine, a little truer to the start of the source material, but then it goes wrong. We have some strange young man as the 3rd subject instead of the nephew ""overseeing"" the project. There are children talking to/ trying to reach Eleanor, who is slowly going crazy from all this. There is no subtle flirting with the head of the group, who has lied to get them there. There is no wife showing up unexpectedly, no ""trying to communicate with the spirits"". Basically, we have 4 people who may or may not be attacked by spirits. Eleanor is sure the house wants to keep her there-the children need her. The house now does a lock-down. They can't get out, Luke gets killed by the spirits when he's, basically, decapitated by the fireplace. Eleanor announces that she has discovered, because of her necklace (a family heirloom), she is descended from Hugh Crane- in fact, a great granddaughter. She gives herself to the house-a pure, willing sacrifice in order to protect the children. Unless the studio was prevented from doing this the right way, there was no reason for the butchering. A new view of the source material is one thing. A butchering of the source material is not.",The Haunting

294,supahz,A Haunting Disappointment (5 out of 10),5,25 July 1999,"Here's the quick take... pretty decent special effects; a beautiful house; great performance by Zeta Jones but lackluster Liam Neeson; somewhat confusing script; weak story with lots of holes in the plot; hokey ending.The truth is, this film could have been scary, but wasn't.  The ghost had a good deal of menace, but the explanation of what he did in life is scant and doesn't give the viewer a sense of creepiness or horror that you'd expect an evil ghost to give.  Hence, the audience laughed a couple of times where laughter wasn't really called for.  This was also due to the lackluster plot, which contained some cheezy lines.  I could go into how some of the various effects were nice but misguided (a ghost who can turn statues to life could easily dispose of house guests without the elaborate nonsense as seen in the bedroom/ceiling/spike sequence).  As for the acting, Neeson's understated acting was perfect for ""The Phantom Menace"" but here seems ineffectual.  Zeta Jones is great, and Taylor does a solid job.When the movie ended I felt strangely unsatisfied.  Movies like the Haunting have a way of creating hype and promise in previews, and most always have a way of being a disappointment.  It's too bad, because there was great potential here.  If you're really looking for scary, go see ""The Blair Witch Project"".",The Haunting

296,concord-4,Another poor remake.,1,2 August 1999,"As I think of summer 1999's poorest movies:  Wild Wild West, Inspector Gadget, The Thomas Crowne Affair, and, of course, the Haunting, it becomes clear that Hollywood is not having much success at riding on past successes. This is a result of the difference between a producer discovering a good script and then producing it vs. deciding to recreate a concept and then delegating the scriptwriting.  The lack of any suspense in this particular film is demonstrated by Lily Taylor's line following one of the film's attempts at a horrifying scene:  ""Oh no.""  Oh no, indeed.",The Haunting
297,Rick-245,Scary-Lite,7,26 November 1999,"After reading many of the negative reviews here, I was curious to rent this movie and form my own opinion. To get straight to the point, I think this film is getting a bum rap, at least from most of the reviews in this forum and, because of this, I wasn't expecting too much upon inserting the video into my machine. However, when it was all over, I was surprised. This remake held my interest from start to finish. I felt the performances were good, the storyline believable, the effects very good. After seeing the video, I would really like to see this on the big screen- I'm sure it would be even more intense. Okay, so it's no ""Poltergeist"" as far as scare factor, but I still think it held it's own, as far as being true to the original movie. Personally, I'd like to see a sequel. Definitely worth renting, if you're into haunted house flicks- despite all the bad press.",The Haunting

This movie starts quite nicely, but at some point the director (or the studio or whoever) decided that it would be difficult to sell this movie without some kind of ""extra"", so they decided to fill it up with special effects. The result is disappointing. The plot is thin and you notice immediately that nobody had control of the movie, so they decided to accept everybody's ideas. Makes you wonder what it took Liam and Catherine to accept their roles (torture?). This one is definetely out of my shelf.",The Haunting

How can you have an horror movie without horror, without scares, without gore, without any content not suitable for children? What's next? An action movie without violence?

I thought to myself that this was about the worst-or, at least one of the worst-movies ever. Some of the lines and the direction were so campy, it came across as a satire of a horror movie.  So when my SO came home the other night with this tucked under his arm, I figured that maybe I was being too judgmental and would give it another chance.  Well, it wasn't much better.  What I did do this time, was to enjoy the scenery.  The mansion is pretty cool. Liam Neeson is quite dishy. Catherine Zeta Jones' spends a fair amount of time running around in lace and tall boots. Lily Taylor plays the quirky girl to the max. And Owen Wilson brings in the bad-boy humor.  Imagine: a bad movie that has something for everyone!",The Haunting

Since the two movies were made in the same year, and both involved a ghost house, I thought Haunting would be as good as Haunted Hill (I consider B-rated special effects and many by some called 'cheap' thrills good, Haunted Hill was one of the few movies in a long time I saw that gave me the creeps). How could I be so mistaken? This movie is called a horror, I would go as far to call it supernatural drama. The only time the house really murderers (I don't consider the ending murder), It was over too fast and you could see it coming from two miles away. Only plus to this movie are the special effects and Liam Neeson's acting. You want horror with ghosts inside walls?

308,Magnum-9,"We have another ""Godzilla""!",1,27 July 1999,"Now, whoever thinks this hokey rubbish was ""scary"" musta been watching a different movie.  You kidding me?  Junk, junk, and more junk.  Not an ounce of scare,  but tons of laughs (including one that's HIGHLY unintentional). This film, in my view, is the worst of '99.  I don't even have to see the other ones, cause it was SO BAD that I'm already thoroughly convinced.  And what's with this script?  Quite possibly the worst big budget Hollywood script ever produced.  The characters are complete and utter morons.  ""What? Is the house really haunted?""  Couldn't they have figured that out fifteen minutes into the movie?  What morons.  They just seem to keep ruling out the ""strange events"", which are stupid at best.  And the only character this script even focuses on is that of Lili Taylor.  The others are just a sideshow, who play no important role in moving the story along.  Hell, one gets taken out of the picture in the first five minutes!  What was that all about?  What purpose was there for even having her there?  And why the hell is Catherine Zeta-Jones's character bisexual?  Totally pointless cause it holds no meaning and is just a paper-thin stereotype, which seems to be merely tacked on.  And this story, boy this story, just bites the dust big time.  First of all, what the hell WAS the freaking story?  I don't even know cause I was too busy sleeping.  Some crap about a father killing a bunch of kids or something.  But that's beside the point in a ""Hollywood horror film"" of this caliber.  You don't need plot to make moolah.  Just throw in a bunch of stupid gags laid out to allegedly ""scare"" the audience and you got yourself a cash cow.  What a horrible mess!  About at the mid point, everything goes down the tubes and the script becomes uneven tripe, making no sense, managing to be extremely annoying and boring in the process.  There literally IS NO POINT TO THIS STUPID MOVIE and never will be.  It just wants to find an excuse to dabble in the computer animation field.And that's another thing.  What the hell's so scary about computer animation?  I dunno.  Maybe I'll go to sleep tonight and have a nightmare about computer animated cherubs with stupid faces, saying stupid stuff that makes no sense.  Yeah.  Or maybe I'll have a nightmare of what Hollywood will sink to in ten years.  Can it get any lower?  I mean, it's already taken a moronic script and turned it into a stupid mega-budget movie that's allegedly ""scary"" and ""entertaining"", but in fact has no value whatsoever, in any field or category.  I mean, come on folks!  Who really talks to themselves?  This Lili Taylor chick made a point to babble everything she was reading in an ""eerie"" way, which made me cringe, because I hate to see dialogue go to waste.  Ditch it!  We can freaking read already!So when you watch this, IF you watch this, make a point to laugh at Owen Wilson's ""tragic"" fate, and to fall asleep during the senseless dragging on of the climax, and to wonder what the hell has happen to the other three characters, and to figure out why they even bothered to attempt at a plot (the ""Matrix"" syndrome), and to figure out why they even made us think there was steam between two of the characters, and to try and not laugh at the computer-generated ""scares"", and also, the most important part, to figure out why this movie even got made.  And why rubbish like this still gets made and makes money on a daily basis.  I mean, if a script like this can get produced, ANYTHING can get produced.

Though the FX were quite brilliant (DreamWorks, SKG rocks), they did not embellish on anything that was the least bit scary.  Liam Neisson was under-used and mis cast and the supporting cast was adequate at best.Though the premise of most horror films are usually quite flimsy, this movie makes Jason Vorheeves and Freddy Kruger seem as though they were born from Academy Award quality scripts.Sorry there is not much of a plot summary here, but, alas, there was none. Two words of advice...  SKIP IT!",The Haunting

322,deciphur,Not as good as the first time.,10,20 June 2004,"I remember seeing this and being freaked out of my mind. I told a friend that I remember writing a review five years ago that said it was the scariest film I had seen. How embarrassed was I?I cranked the volume, turned off the lights, built up the movie, and watched it on a 36"" (good enough I think); what a disappointment. Everyone was like ""Well, I guess it was a little scary."" Totally just easing my embarrassment in recommending this. It was quite strange. I mean, at times I was just like that was so stupid. And like, they did not just say that.The acting was very iffy and with a pretty good cast, it was odd! The main character, especially, was not believable. I cannot believe how something can change in half a decade! Not the scariest movie I've seen anymore!!!",The Haunting
323,Dragon S,Though in itself a moderately entertaining film...,4,26 July 1999,"If you plan on feeling fear, being constantly frightened, and shuddering from spine-tingling psychological horror...you will be sadly disappointed. Though in itself a moderately entertaining film, The Haunting proceeds with standard ""horror-movie"" techniques (loud noises, sudden movements, hanging bodies) and fails to succeed where the previews lead you to believe you were going.The moving children, living statues, and windows effects - once you become immersed in the story - are no longer scary because of their involvement in the plot.  Cliche story development, typical plot additions, and over-used plot-devices slowly begin to weed away at a potentially great film.Towards the end of the movie you feel cheated at having believed that you were seeing a mind-tingling, spine-chilling movie and thrust into a fear-lacking and story-boring standard ""horror flick"".  Worst yet is the actual ending.  The defeat of the ""villain"" is an overdrawn scene with a ""whole lot of nothing"" going on.Overall the effects were absolutely brilliant, but over-used.  It seemed that some scenes had no reason to be used other than for the presentation of ""special effects""...something too many films suffer from today.  The acting was excellent, but the end of the movie pollutes these great characters with useless actions balanced with just as useless lines of dialogue.  The word ""cheesy"" came to mind more than once.  If you are expecting nothing more than ""another horror movie"" then you should enjoy ""The Haunting"".  For those hoping for something different, let's hope that the ""Blair Witch Project"" can deliver.",The Haunting

The movie was ok, but certainly not frightening. I don't understand why the film was even based on the novel. The only things that stayed the same were a few character names, and the name of the house. Why not just change the names of the characters and house, and then have a completely original film not based on a book, or a previous movie?

Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; ""Well they got your money!"" She's right, don't let them get yours.

I do not know when and what guy that Hugh Cran could have built such a castle without people constantly looking at it. Jerry Goldsmith's music was also a plus.

While House on Haunted Hill was rated ""R"", The Haunting was only ""PG-13.""It should have been obvious that The Haunting wouldn't be too great of a scary movie from the PG rating, I saw it anyway. My hunch (which I ignored) proved to be right.The Haunting has some nicely done special effects. Unfortunately, this was about all it had. The movie had a few parts that might make you jump but these were so scattered and few that the movie doesn't really rate as a horror movie.The actors played their parts rather well, even though there wasn't too great of a character development; and finally, the ending seemed tacked on.I would recommend House on Haunted Hill over The Haunting. There's a lot of other movies in the horror/ghost genre that are scarier than The Haunting but since Haunted Hill came out at the same time, it's the first one that comes to mind. And besides, Famke Janssen (Haunted Hill) makes for a far better temptress than Catherine Zeta-Jones.",The Haunting

The cherubs faces imprinted into my brain since I was 11. The sets, architecture and attention to detail are incredible.The production value is second to none especially of a film from this era. This type of film has an Erie hand unsettling feel and it's a different class compared to the copy and paste films of today. The whole thing has a very Del Toro esque feel which pre dates many of his films.This film is a childhood classic and a very good horror movie.

330,traineraz,Shirley Jackson didn't write this . . .,2,16 August 2001,"Why the producers claimed that this ""new and improved"" version of The Haunting (1963) was based on ""The Haunting of Hill House"" by Shirley Jackson is beyond me.  They kept a few of the character names, but only three of the actual characters remained more or less intact:  Eleanor, though significantly toned down and ""stabilized""; Mrs. Dudley; and the lesbolicious Theo.  The other characters were completely rewritten, as was the entire plot.  It really would have been easier to change a few names and call it a new story.This high-budget B-movie manages to obliterate the psychological terror of the novel, which was followed relatively well in the 1963 version of The Haunting.  1963 gave me chills without any visual special effects to speak of, while 1999 spent lots of money and computer animation trying to give me thrills, with really stunning effects with little purpose.  The new plot, which includes scores of abducted children whose souls are being held prisoner, a la Freddy Krueger, seems contrived to move us from one special effect to the next.An unnecessary decapitation and the clear SANITY of Eleanor at the end leave all traces of Jackson's brilliant story in the dust.  1999 is a brutal rewrite which ignores subtlety and, like so many modern movies, needs to force the good-vs-evil duality in the viewer's face.  Apparently, we're not bright enough to understand anything more complex.My recommendation, as I've said before, is to hit the classics shelf and rent the original.  Read the novel.  If you have a 2-4-1 night at your video store, then maybe rent 1963 and 1999 and compare.  If you prefer slasher flicks to psychological thrillers, you'll like 1999.  If you like to think a bit about a story, even after it's over, you'll like 1963.  I, for one, decided that 1963 has a happy (well, bittersweet?) ending.  1999 doesn't.",The Haunting

332,Ramon_Rojo,Your brains will ooze from your ears....,1,24 September 2003,"There are several things wrong with the remake.First of all, I kind of get this feeling that no one who was involved in the production ever saw the original film by Robert Wise. The 1963 film was a marvel of suspense and one could look at that film as being the spiritual cousin of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING. If they did, they would have know that they had to work toward something.Let me tell you why the 1963 film worked: it was its subltety and the way it allowed you to fill in the blanks. (Is she imagining all of this? Is the house trying to control her?) From this, this is main reason this version fails miserably.When we come to the Crane Mansion in this film, there is nothing to wonder. It screams BIG SCARY MOVIE SET. All of the apparitions jump at us in their computer-generated glory. Above all, the climax of the film......I felt my brains oozing from my ears.In short, in order to make a decent horror film with subtlety requires thought and intelligence from the screenwriters. That, for this film, was in short supply....",The Haunting

The film builds pretty slowly and the house itself if wonderfully mad in its layout - leading to some pretty good set pieces. There's a bit of gore but most of the 'horror' is moans, groans and chases - with a nicely dark back story to build the tension. The biggest downside is the 'special' effects - they're quite frankly awful. When a ghost is crawling down the wall, you don't really want to be laughing at the shoddy computer graphics so a great deal of the tension is lost. Aside from that, this feels like an old fashioned ghost story and for those looking for a film that slowly builds the tension and opts for creepiness and shocks rather than gore, it's worth checking out.",The Haunting

Clive Owen, Luke, Cathrine-Zeta Jones, Theo, and the professor played by Liam Neeson. Very soon things starts to go bumping in the night..

But when I read the pre-screening reports of audience members ""laughing where they weren't supposed to"", I knew I could see it.  Nay, I knew I HAD to see it.  As promised, there were some funny, not scary, moments.  And, there were a few cheap shocks.  And the house (who is, after all, the main character) was elaborate and spooky, from the vine-covered chained front gate, to the eerie towers and turrets, to the frighteningly dark bedrooms. Unfortunately, the movie took a turn for the cheesy with Lili Taylor's declaration:  ""She's my great-great-great Grandmother"" and her ""Home is where the heart is"" and, (my favorite) ""I'm not afraid of you, Grandpa!"".I would have been happy if the characters remained unrelated to the specter... I would have settled for them merely being SCARED of the phantasm.  I wasn't looking for a family reunion.But, the movie was gorgeous, really great sets & location, cool special effects, good actors (although I really hated Liam Neeson in this movie).

Like the house itself, the plot is full of long passages leading nowhere in particular. When the evil spirit behind the malefic mansion manifests itself, it turns out to be curiously impotent -- its scary antics are limited to slamming a few doors and producing a vaporous spectre that growls unconvincingly.

There are plenty of moments that make you jump (and a few that made me scream), but the way the movie ends just leaves you feeling like you worked up all that adrenaline for nothing.  I think DeBont should've not concerned himself with the MPAA rating and just gone for the full-on scare.  The music is chilling, and if you get the chance, watch this on a home theater system because the sounds are amazing!  The cast did a wonderful job of being terrified, and they passed their fear right on to me.  There are a few places in the story that make you sit up and say, ""HEY! Where did that come from?""  Some details that one character manages to come up with are completely unexplained; I cry ""FOUL"" on a character that is suddenly imparted with knowledge that the audience has no idea of where it came from.

354,Kritic-3,A disappointment to say the least,5,4 January 2000,"The Haunting is a visual masterpiece.  The special effects are phenomenal, and the images are very demanding; almost too demanding. Yet the film runs into a problem that many recent films have also encountered(in contrast to the technological revolution). The film is about two girls and one guy, placed in a haunted(literally) house, for the experimentation of human fear. As time passes, and the characters discover the horrible truths of the house, and the previous inhabitants, one of the characters finds a hidden and lost connection with herself and the house.  Finally she is able to free the house from the haunting ghosts and demons that had roamed the house for years. The film depends on the special effects to carry on the movie, which is a mistake to begin with. The most important part of a film is the script, which can be simplified as the plot. Not only is the haunting too dependent on special effects, and visual scare, it lacks a decent plot to accompany it.  A film cannot be good without a good script, but a film can be good without great special effects. Aside from these factors, the acting wasn't too great either, and the film also fails to accomplish one of it's goals. It isn't frightening.  The plot is predictable, which results in a lack of fear in the audience.  The film could have been a lot better, had it simply spent more time and concentration on developing a more believable and more detailed plot.  *****(5 stars of 10)",The Haunting

Since then I have always tried to find something worthwhile in a film, no matter how disappointing...and 'The Haunting' is an extremely disappointing film.Set design and special effects are both excellent (although borrowing heavily from H R Geiger's designs in 'Alien') and, once again, Jan De Bont demonstrates that he is an excellent cinematographer.  However, De Bont is not a Director and, in the light of 'Speed', 'Twister', 'Speed 2' and now 'The Haunting', it is time for him to realise his limitations.The 1963 'Haunting' was always going to be a difficult subject to emulate. Robert Wise's production relies predominantly on atmosphere and characterisation, so important in making it a genuinely frightening film. The 1999 'Haunting', however, opts for computer generated images rather than plot development and, as a result, betrays its weaknesses from the outset.Incredulity is stretched to breaking point (who would willingly spend the night in a house like this?).  The characters are so thinly drawn that they evince neither sympathy or antipathy (this is a film Liam Neeson will want to forget) and, despite some pleasantly diverting shocks which send a ripple of nervous laughter through the audience, much of the film is so outlandish as to descend into farce (please try not to giggle when you see the portrait of the villain).In the hands of a better Director and with a more intelligent screenplay this film had the potential to be one of the best films of the year. Instead it is cliché ridden, predictable and, at times, boring.It is a piece of work which my English Teacher would have returned unmarked with a polite note saying, 'I think you should do this again.'",The Haunting

They took a great story, hacked it down to its bare bones, and rebuilt it Scotch tape and gum. It's just so flimsy. All the actors are capable of giving good performances, the problem is rotten material.The filmmakers clearly underestimated their audience. They took out the story and replaced it with meaningless special effects. I've never heard of a haunted house with moving woodwork. The only real similarities with the book are some character names, and the name of the house. They changed the reason these people are even at the house. They added extra characters (but took them out suddenly, then we never hear from them). They killed one character that shouldn't have died. But maybe that was a good thing. He was likable in the book, but not here. The list goes on and on. All of it pointless. Just watch the Robert Wise version.

The only thing I truly enjoyed about this (fancy?) remake was the house, in my humble opinion the true star of the film.The acting was so-so (though Lily Taylor did a nice job, same for Luke Wilson) and the effects were not as creepy as they should have been for a movie that's rated +16 (in Belgium this equals the 'R' rating in case you're confused)... not to mention they look 'old school'. This movie lacks soul, and the plot gives you a 'been-there-done-that' feeling. Yet I bought it on VHS, because I simply LOVE Hill House. The sets are magnificent and it's best to simply not pay attention to the action or dialogues and feast your eyes on the splendour of the rooms and hallways. The Great Hall is my favourite: with its huge empty space, creepy statues (the lions above the fireplace are much scarier than Hugh Craine's portrait...) and the large doors which, *possible SPOILER* according to Theo look like Rodin's Gates of Hell are splendid examples of Eugenio Zanetti's talent.Other than that it can and will be a boring, dull ride...",The Haunting

I went in to the film expecting something empty and poorly done, and I came out of the film having been well entertained by something the played like the tales I read each month in Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine, and having been very well done.

The story was sketchy, the character development non-existent, and the house a cartoony joke.  The scariest part of the entire movie was when the house formed eyes and stared down at the bed-That's it.  Personally, I wouldn't want to watch an entire movie for only one scare.  The computer effects were not in the least scary and at most startling.  And, while the actors portrayed their weak written roles as best as possible, still the essence of the movie drains through the plot holes.

(it is right up there with some of the best computer effects I have seen in movies.)  The story however is somewhat slow paced.  That however is understandable since it is based on an older novel.  The pace does speed up for an all out spectacular ending.  I give this movie 4 out of 10 stars because although many people will enjoy this movie, I believe it may be to slow paced for some people.",The Haunting
367,john t-2,"The Haunting is okay, but differs greatly from original",5,28 July 1999,"I am a big fan of the original film ""The Haunting.""  I saw it for the first time as a child and have considered it the most frightening movie I have ever seen.That said, it was unlikely that the new version could live up to my expectations, but I still had high hopes for it.  I was thinking that perhaps they would develop the characters just a little more fully than the original film.This new film isn't necessarily bad, but I feel that its major flaws are that it is too overblown and that it runs too far afield of the original (book) story.  One fear I had was that there would be too many special effects.  There were.  This story is one that relies mainly on the things that you don't see happen.  The fright is built on the sounds, the tensions, and the feeling that things are not at all well in this house.  There are only a few physical manifestations in ""The Haunting"" and these few are enough to convince you that something is terribly wrong without going over the top as they have done in the new version.As to its adherence to the story line, this version is only very loosely based on the book.  If they had not used the same character names and lifted a few lines of original dialog, it would be nearly unrecognizable from the original story.  That's too bad because, being regarded as a classic horror story, it's hard to imagine how the filmmakers sought to ""improve"" (?) on the original by changing it so drastically.Finally, while the original has a brooding ending, this film has a basically triumphant Hollywood happy ending.  Although I like happy endings, it just doesn't work so well here.jt",The Haunting

The CGI is cartoon, Liam Neleson is really bad in this (and this goes as one of his worst performances next the Clash of the Titans remake), Owen Willson is so annoying that he makes you castrate yourself and this whole power of love thing is getting tired and makes me angry. And to make things bad, the great Steven Spielberg who was influenced by Robert Wise had involvement in it. But lucky after this abomination, he announced that he will never work with Jan de Bont forever and has the same thing as George Lucas has with the Star Wars Holiday Special which is prevented this film to be released on Blu-ray and it's a good thing Spielberg had his named uncredited in this awful movie. Which means that Steven Spielberg is the guy who said that The Lost World and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is okay, while this remake is the project is the thing that he is personally ashamed of. Let me repeat that again. The Lost World and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: okay. The remake of The Haunting: Personally ashamed of. My advice see the original Haunting it is more better, it has a good ghost story, great Psychology horror, has better character development and has no cartoon CGI, annoying characters, and stupid Disney good vs evil story in which piece of garbage has and should never be on DVD or Blu- ray.",The Haunting

The plots are very similar but the Shirley Jackson story is far superior. Jan de Bont could have made a delightfully terrifying movie but instead made a movie in which the special effects are comical. Stained glass that becomes eyes, ceilings that twist and swell. The set designer for this movie missed an opportunity to use available technology to scare the daylights out of us. Instead of a truly frightening house, we got a mishmash of tacky decor and comically used sculptures. The only element of Gothic scariness was the painting of Hugh Crain at the top of the stairs. The house looked as though it had been a project on HGTV's Designer Finals and the designers lost. The story, itself, could have been retold by de Bont, in a way that would put it right up there with the 1963 version but he chose instead to try and frighten us with cartoon-like special effects and a lackluster and disjointed script. Too much about the Hugh Crain story is left as a puzzle. But, the biggest puzzle of all was why de Bont wasted all that talent and money to give us such a disappointing movie.",The Haunting

380,Shifty,Haunted house heavyweight KOed by dreadful screenplay,5,11 August 1999,"If movies about haunted houses were judged solely on the merits of the houses themselves and their ability to awe and terrorize the viewer with a presence and personality all their own, The Haunting would easily be considered the best of the genre. Unfortunately, other ingredients like screenplay, plot, pacing and acting are not nearly as tightly constructed as the magnificent sets and production design that are Hill House.Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Theo describes Hill House as ""Citizen Kane meets The Munsters"" and I can't help making a comparison to the hotel in The Shining. Both are isolated grandiose dwellings with opulent interiors where within every shadow evil lurks. But while the hotel in The Shining achieves a foreboding presence Hill House goes much further, it becomes a character in the film; the star.The Haunting's Hill House is a vast brooding evil looking gothic structure (Harlaxton Manor in England) introduced to us in wide sweeping panoramic aerial shots and closer by liberal and skilled use of cranes and other visual devices that are breathtaking.  The interiors are equally immense complete with huge chandeliers, massive staircases, endless corridors and walk-in fireplaces. The set designs are rich, detailed and voluptuous, bordering on decadent; the ornamentation and artwork classical gargoylesque.Production designer Eugenio Zanetti put together a masterpiece of a haunted house and filled it with dread. The rumored price tag for the interior sets alone is eight million of the total ninety million budget.  Add a creepy sound track by Jerry Goldsmith and some fine sound editing effects reverberating throughout the grand rooms and corridors of Hill House and it comes alive.Not as much can be said for the screenplay, it contains the type of dialog you only hear in the movies. You'd think with a budget as large as this one they wouldn't have entrusted writing duties to new comer David Self who is unable to provide much dimension or motivation for his characters. The story itself departs just enough from the novel on which its based to create some major plot holes.A talented cast including Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Lili Taylor go through the motions largely because there isn't much to sink their teeth into. Liam Neeson, a professor who is conducting an experiment in the psychology of fear lead three insomniac volunteers to the isolated Hill House under the guise of studying sleep disorders. When things begin to go bump in the night and its clearly not the professor's doing the real fun begins.Zeta-Jones, one of the two women subjects, has little to do other than look sexy as the glamorous and confident artist Theo opposite Taylor's introverted soft-spoken Nell. We learn early on that Theo is bisexual but no sexual tension develops between the two women or Luke (Owen Wilson), the other subject who is basically cast to fill some space.It soon becomes apparent Nell is the central character and Lili Taylor's performance is more than credible given the material. She's in almost every scene and is able to convey her until then untapped strength of character as Hill House reveals its secrets to her in some truly scary scenes.As the climax approaches The Haunting bogs down under the weight of nonstop special effects that are clever and even original at times but if you recognize a special effect as clever and original the fx boys haven't done their jobs have they?Although the shortcomings are plentiful The Haunting is a very watchable horror movie.

The acting was believable, with good chemistry between all characters, the sets were to be experienced, not described, and the musical score did a wonderful job of supporting and augmenting the action on the screen. Some critics go on about audiences laughing at the action on the screen. Well, some parts are intended to be funny. It was like being on a haunted house ride at the county fair, and should be enjoyed as such. Despite occasional popcorn munching and general clatter, the spooky moments popped up out of nowhere and definitely got our attention. When the spectre of Hugh Crain, the film's biggest baddie ghost, comes booming out of his 20' portrait at the top of the staircase, some of us almost came out of our seats!

Effects, in themselves, are not frightening - they just make you decide if yes, it was pretty realistic or no, it was pretty fake. I found the first film creepy due to its lack of explanation.

I think the reason it had any appeal at all is because of the director's eye. There are some beautiful shots in this movie, and the imagery is superb.

HEY...LOOK...THOSE 35 BUSTS OF CHERUBIC LITTLE KIDS ARE COVERING THEIR FACES IN CGI TERROR! Neurotic Eleanor can't sleep because her invalid Mom used to POUND ON THE WALL WITH HER CANE! Which her annoying little nephew GETS TO DEMONSTRATE FOR US!  Just like THE BANGING ON THE BEDROOM DOOR IN THE NIGHT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY IN THE ORIGINAL, BUT IS NOW JUST THE BEGINNING OF A LONG SLIDE DOWN INTO UTTER TEDIUM. If ever a movie was doomed to failure by the hiring of a director, this is it. Jan De Bont has displayed no understanding whatsoever of psychology or nuance or...hell, let's call a spade a spade...of acting in his directorial career to date. The whole project is an overblown and patronizing mess, only slightly redeemed by some beautiful sets.",The Haunting

I was hoping to be scared, but instead I exercised my eyes as I was continously rolling them.The first half of the movie isn't bad at all, the characters are introduced and the legend of the house are all laid forth. Then the last half of the movie took all of that potential and wasted it away with bad dialogue and cartoonish special effects.By the end of the movie I ended up disliking the only character that I liked from the beginning, Nell.  I'm not complaining, it was worth the 4 bucks I paid to see it...despite all of it's flaws it IS entertaining.",The Haunting

The effects help tell the story rather than dominate it and the acting and characterisation draw you in nicely. The pacing could have been better but it's still adequate enough to hold the interest.

The first half hour or so is mildly entertaining and because it sticks fairly close to Shirley Jackson's original story, it has a few chilling moments. Unfortunately, the entire second half is an exercise in trite special effects and writing that can only be described as sophomoric. None of it holds together and the ending doesn't make any sense at all. All in all if you want a good scare rent the 1963 film or read Shirley Jackson's fine novel.",The Haunting

I continued watching it thinking it would pick up the pace or actually do something to merit me spending $3.59 but to no avail. I am a big fan of haunting movies.

The ghosts of the children keep on trying to tell Nell something and it is only when she starts to figure out that Hugh Crane takes control and the terror level goes up big time.I believe that people will like this movie better if they think of it as a mystery instead of a 100% horror movie.If you want a haunted house movie that is 100% horror go see ""House on Haunted Hill""",The Haunting

This version is laughable. My wife and I recorded it from TV and then regretted the time we had wasted watching it. The effects are too much and downright silly, and in places downright ridiculous. Whatever Liam Nielson was doing in this film I'll never know. Some how, this film tells the audience too much and delves into the original house owner's life.

The remake was some months later broad casted.In the original movie you do not see any ghost, no blood, no injuries, ... Nothing. The creepy feeling it gives you is physiological: is it really there or is it just imagination? The film is shot in such a way it overwhelms you. In many scenes (eg where Eleanore is running in the house) you always have the feeling that something scary is going to happen or pop up but nothing happens (except the scene where with the stair where Grace Markway opens a door - it scared me btw). Globally, there is not much physical ""horror"". But it is made so well it gives you the creeps. I went to bed afterwards and I could hardly sleep from all the noises I heard. (The noises are most probably always there at night, but you don't spend attention to it). It took me days before I could put the movie out of my head. What actually happens in that house. It does not give you an answer. To me, the movie has an open ending. The only negative is the slow start and the voice-overs (there are too many). I rate this version 9/10.This remake is the opposite. It is not much physiological, but all physical: you actually see the ghost, the things that happen do effectively happen. It does not give you the constant feeling something scary is going to happen. The scene with the stair is miserable. None of the horror-things in the movie (eg the bed that locks up Eleanore) gave me a creepy feeling. The film has no open ending (the ghost is chased off) except what's going to happen with the soul of Eleanore. This film must have it from the special effects. It does not scare you much during the movie nor afterwards.If you want to rent/buy ""The haunting"" please be sure you have the version from 1963 and not the waster from 1999.",The Haunting

405,taylor-chicklin,Loose the CGI!!,4,25 February 2015,"What made the original so haunting and unsettling is its atmosphere, and its psychological effect on the main protagonist. This film, however, takes the whole psychological and atmospheric concept and replaces it with crappy CGI and a horribly written story. Since this was during the time when CGI was being exploited, I see what they were trying to do with this. However, its tacky that they should rely on new technological features on a remake of a film that was purely affective for its subtly. In terms of writing quality, if your expecting a film that dives into questioning the parallels between the paranormal and the human psyche like the original, be prepared to be disappointed. There is no mystery behind anything- this purely a light vs. dark movie. It's not smartly written what-so-ever. This being said, I surprisingly do have a couple of pros. (1) the mansion is unbelievably and gothically beautiful, and even more than the one from the first movie. The house they used is called Harlaxton Manor, which is owned by the University of Evansille for students studying abroad. It is the PERFECT setting for a Gothic horror movie. (2) casting is actually decent (minus Owen Wilson. Sorry bud, not your movie). Lily Taylor is actually a pretty good replacement, bringing a gentleness and gravity to the role. These two pros are what really makes me sad. With such an incredible setting and actors who can actually act (once again excluding Owen Wilson), and if they had just lost the CGi and stuck to the psychological story- this could have been a decent movie. Really disappointed!",The Haunting

Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are great actors, and they deserve to be in much better movies than this. We've even seen Owen Wilson do better!Other than that, it just didn't do anything for me. The story, the CGI effects, and the attempts to build suspense just fall flat.

The effects are kinda goofy, totally ruin what little movie there would have been. Sadly, an episode of Charmed will stimulate your brain more than this load did.I gotta say tho, Catherine Zeta Jones is sure fun to look at. She's more convincing hawking cellular phones than she is in the movie. And is it me or is Lili Taylor really attractive in a jump-out-and-say-boo kind of way.

I would rent the shining(1980)instead, scary, worth your money, and a lot cheaper. If you really want to see it rent it but if I were you I would just want till it comes on TV again. I have to say the mansion looks amazing, thats the only good thing about this movie.

It is a pure DVD-made horror(?)movie with some very good points and plenty of others which were either bad or improvable. The setting of Hill House was MAGNIFICENT: all the large rooms with all these carvings, statues and cherubims-work of art set an ideal surrounding for a creepy story to take place. I also have to praise Lili Taylor for her (although debut)very good and sensitive performance on the role of an ordinary woman with financial problems who realizes that her familial past has something to do with this house. I believe that she carries on her shoulders the whole acting level, although i also liked Catherine Zeta Jones and Liam Neeson. The picture was beautiful, the score adequate. That's it for the good part. Let's move on to the bad points. Although the plot and the past of the house is really interesting, the interest at the beginning expires after the first half, when the pure ghost atmosphere is replaced by VERY cheap, and goofy, and funny, and stupid, and uninspired special effects, clear product of the American comprised film-making.Some scenes are really funny, but I won't mention them:whoever has watched it knows. Owen Wilson breaks on my nerves as he is too cool and ""I don't care about anything, I live in my own world"" character, and I really liked it when the flue eats up his head!I also have to say that the ending was OH MY GOD!Just awful!

If you want Oscar-worthy performances, and a storyline with no plot holes, well, then go elsewhere. It's a popcorn flick. But is it really, really bad? Not at all - for what it is, it's actually quite good and a lot of fun!'The Haunting' has a lot of eye candy, and the set design is just incredible. Many of the rooms in the house are incredibly imaginative and/or beautiful, and all of them fit in very well. And the special effects are just amazing... the house actually does seem alive! Most of the ""ghost"" shots are nicely done as well. Overall, this movie just has loads of atmosphere, as well it should. It's a ghost story, after all!As for scare value... no, it's not as scary as some movies I've seen, and it is NOT a horror movie! (Although I'm not sure what category it *does* fall into...) If you sit through it with a cynical attitude (as many critics seem to have done), or it takes a really twisted movie to scare you, then you'll walk out yawning. But if you just go with the flow, certain scenes will have you jumping. This is especially true since a lot of the fright value comes not from what actually happens, but the buildup it takes to get there.In terms of storyline and acting, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Catherine Zeta-Jones has yet to prove that she can act (and I'm still betting she will one of these days)... though there were certain aspects of her character that, although good for a cheap laugh, could and should have been left out. Lili Taylor was completely likeable as Eleanor, although her character's actions and reactions didn't always make sense given the circumstances. Liam Neeson wasn't bad, although his role didn't give him much of a chance to distinguish himself. Owen Wilson played his character exactly the same way he did in Armageddon... and for the most part, just as badly. No one really stood out, but the cast did just fine in establishing the necessary feel... not trustful of each other, and overall, scared out of their wits. Most of the time, that is... at other points, they didn't seem to be scared at all when they probably should have been cowering on the floor.Overall, a very fun movie! You won't be making repeat theater trips for this one, but it makes a great one-timer. Naturally, the reviewers hate it... it's not ""pure"" horror, it botches a few of its jokes, and the plot has holes here and there.

416,Kolby,"Entertaining and, at some points, very scary film",7,6 October 1999,"I have not read the novel or seen the film from 1963, so it is safe to say that I, in that way, went in to see this film with an open mind. I had no expectations, just hope of seeing a scary film.
The opening of the film was not that positive. The dialogues were bad and not remotely interesting, plus the acting of the housekeeper was simply laughable. The other characters were not that convincing either. Thankfully the creepy atmosphere of the house takes over, and both dialogue and acting gradually improves (the actors never truly impress, though). The peak of the film is definitely half way through, and especially the psychological thrills I found very scary. You also get a couple of shocks, but, in my opinion, a thousand shocks cannot replace a well made psychological thrill. Unfortunately the psychological thrills are much too few in this film. Towards the last part of the film, the visual effects completely take over, which is very nice to look at, but not scary at all. So once again, as it happens in several horror/thriller movies, the ending lacks tension and thrills.
Hill House is without a doubt one of the most atmospheric settings I have seen in a long time. Only Bates' motel and house in Psycho and the Overlook Hotel in The Shining come to mind when thinking of more frightening settings. The fact that the house is truly magnificent as the setting just makes it all the more disappointing that it all ends up in a special effects orgy. Impressive as they may be, the effects did not scare me.
All in all an entertaining film that could have been even scarier, if they had put some more weight on the psychological thrills. Don't get me wrong, there are several scary scenes in the film, but also several soft spots. So, what is my conclusion? Well, an above average horror flick with the usual cliches, a decent plot, average acting, a couple of good scares and thrills, and, unfortunately, a sh*tload of visual effects. Definitely worth watching, though.

So the plot was pretty much predicatable, but was Titanic really a surprise in any way?I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this film.

421,Arachnyd,"If you hear ""boo,"" it's probably the audience",2,26 July 1999,"I wanted to like The Haunting, I really did. It's been a long time since I've seen a good spooky movie about ghosts and haunted houses. Most of the horror fare that's been released in the last several years seems to revolve around alien monsters that have a penchant for disemboweling or beheading hapless humans. The last good scary movie I saw of this sort was Aliens. So I was really looking forward to The Haunting. The cast looked pretty good. I'm not Liam Neeson's biggest fan, but I can think of worse actors to cast in role like this. This film showed a lot of potential. The story is intriguing, and the lead character, Eleanor Lance, played by Lili Taylor is very likable. I found myself more interested in seeing the story revolving around Eleanor (or Nell, as she prefers to be called) unfold than the plot that brings the characters to Hill House in the first place. The story goes something like this: Psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Neeson) decides to gather a group of folks suffering from insomnia at Hill House under the pretense of curing their sleep disorders. In reality, he's bringing his subjects in to study the phenomenon of group fear. Thus, he's using this creepy old house to scare the folks. This brings us to the first problem with the film: Marrow's group consists of a mere three subjects. Two folks accompanying the group exit very early after a freak accident injures Marrow's assistant, who, unfortunately, of all the people present, seemed to be the most genuinely afraid. I still wonder whether or not the accident was real or whether it was part of Marrow's plan to spook his subjects. He seemed rather unfazed by the incident. There are several events like this that occur in the film, and it's often difficult, if not impossible, to discern whether or not they're a part of the Marrow's experiment. Director Jan de Bont could've used this ambiguity to his advantage to create scary situations, but he doesn't. When Eleanor and fellow insomniac Theo, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones arrive at the mansion, Mrs. Dudley (Marian Seldes), one of the caretakers of Hill House, states that she and her husband, played by Bruce Dern, don't stay overnight. They leave  before it gets dark. They never stay  after it gets dark. The whole thing is overplayed, and Eleanor even mocks Mrs. Dudley's spiel as she's delivering it to Theo. I was sure that this melodrama was part of the instructions given to the Dudleys by Dr. Marrow, but, honestly, I can't be sure. The characters don't take it seriously, and since the whole purpose of it would have been to set them on edge, it fails miserably. Thus, it fails miserably on two levels: It fails to spook the characters, and it fails to do anything more than amuse the audience. Owen Wilson, who plays insomniac Luke Sannerson, provides the comic relief in the film. He has quite a few truly funny lines. I found his character to be one of the truly enjoyable aspects of the film. His character reminded me a great deal of Hudson in Aliens. Maybe they should've cast Bill Paxton in this film somewhere. The best scary scene in the movie comes when Nell hears strange noises and jumps out of bed to investigate. Nell's problem you see is that she had so much of her life caring for her recently deceased mother that she's still awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of her mother rapping on the wall with her cane. So when she hears the cane knocking on the wall in Hill House, she reflexively jumps out of bed and says, `Coming, Mother.' This was the one spooky moment in the whole film, because we all know it's not her mother. The question is, is it Marrow's doing or ghosts? I suppose it doesn't really matter, but this is a part of the story that's completely ignored. Nell's story is the focus, and rightly so, unfortunately, it falls on its face after showing some early promise. Which brings us to the real problem with the movie-plot elements are far too often revealed in flourishes. I won't divulge any secrets, lest you decide to subject yourselves to the film, but instead of feeding the audience key bits of information a piece at a time, some elements are pulled abruptly from behind a curtain. I'm reminded of the scene from Independence Day in which the President states, after having had psychic contact with the aliens, `I could sense its thoughts. I know what they're planning to do.' I could probably have forgiven the overblown effects if the story had been handled better. If you want to see digital wizardry used more effectively to create scary situations and images, look at The Frighteners, a film that was not outstanding, but was certainly better than The Haunting. The special effects, like many other elements designed to scare us, were a horribly overdone. The house itself is overdone. The architecture, the elaborate mantle carvings, the columns, the huge doors, all of it is hyperbole. The most effective horror films are much more subtle than The Haunting. And the end of the film is the worst offender. De Bont decided to rely on big-budget, overblown special effects in attempt to bring this film to a shattering climax. What he actually accomplished was send the audience a clear signal in the form of a digital crescendo that their suffering was nearly over. All subtlety in films is gone. I think one of Eleanor's lines offers the best summation for this film. As she walks toward a door behind which she hopes to find the answers to the mystery of Hill House, she covers her nose and states, `What's that smell?' Alas, it's this film.",The Haunting

436,Ricochet84,The Pieces Are Here Save For One,6,24 March 2010,"'The Haunting' is a theatrical adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"". Therefore, despite what some seem to think, it is not really a remake of the 1963 film. I myself have not read the novel, so I cannot tell you how closely this follows it. I have seen the original film, but a while back. I seem to recall enjoying the movie, but not the ending. I was always a ""Happy Ending"" kind of guy.But this review isn't about those stories; it's about this one. So here goes:First we are introduced to Miss Eleanor ""Nell"" Vance; a mousy, yet good-hearted caregiver. She receives a call from a Doctor David Marrow(Or is it?), who invites her out to Hill House, the estate of the late Hugh Crane, to assist in a study on what he claims to be Insomnia Research. He pays 900 dollars a week, plus room and board. She accepts (I would too) and journeys to the manor itself. Quite a home. The exterior of the mansion was Harlaxton Manor. The interior was most likely sound stages, for it was a bit too creepy to be real. What with spikes hanging over the bed and all.Nell meets the caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, played by Bruce Dern (The 'burbs), and Marian Seldes (Tom and Huck, Home Alone 3). Mrs. Dudley gives Nell a lengthy explanation about just exactly how alone her and her fellow research subjects will be. ""I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. We live in town, nine miles, so there won't be anyone around if you need help, we couldn't even hear you. No one could. No one lives any nearer than town; no one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark."" She ignores this not-so-subtle B-movie hint, of course. If she didn't, there would be no movie.Next she meets Theodora ""Theo"". (I don't remember her last name. She might not even have one.) Theo is a gaudy, brazen, bisexual cosmo girl, who is apparently attracted to Nell. (In spite of what some think, there was no deleted ""love scene"", just a slightly sensual scene leaving Theo's attraction to Nell undeniable. Read the script for further info.) Next comes Luke Sanderson, the boyish cynic with the dry wit. And finally, Dr. Marrow. After dinner, some drinks, and a bedtime story involving the house's haunted past, Marrow explains his goal: OK, so why are we here? Probably to answer the most basic question: ""What is wrong with you people?"" After a pretty much unnecessary scene where Marrow's assistant gets slashed with a piano wire, and taken to a hospital, never to be heard from, or of, again, we descend into the pit of Hell, I mean Hill, House, and watch as the main characters get chased by ghosts, spooked by specters, and haunted by haunts. Think 'The Haunted Mansion'. But, we mainly get barraged by some of ILM's special effects. Which are quite good, I think. Scenes that stand out for me include a ghostly scene involving a ghost traveling through and under a bed sheet and curtains (you really have to see it), and scenes with hands reaching out of walls. (Those are always cool) And, of course, a breathing ceiling.When I started watching, I thought to myself ""Jerry Goldsmith would be perfect for this movie. To my pleasant, he did compose the music. What more can I say. It's awesome. The sound effects are also very good; a 5.1 speaker viewing is recommended.The movie's errors lie in the screenplay itself, which is plagued with plot holes and corny lines. It's as if there were no rewrites. The screenplay is obviously the most important factor in a movie, so I am forced to give this film 6 stars out of 10 stars. Extremely fun to watch, and listen to, but that's about it.",The Haunting

Now, everyone I know has seen the original. So even the haters in the world should understand the power of this remake. There are horrible movies out there. Why dog this one? It was fun.

""The Haunting"" must be one of the worst 'reading' of an old masterpiece.As viewing the original before the remake, I pretty much knew the story and the intense scenes to watch out for. A fun cast is the positive thing to begin with, the acting was mediocre but I really developed a 'relationship' with all characters in the film. The movie, had its moments. The ghost chasing Nell through the building being the thrilling scene. Just that this thrilling scene did not come over as horror/thriller at all. It truly gave me the feeling I was watching a fantasy film, for instance ""Lord of the Rings"" even. Luke's death must have been the biggest injustice against the original and was the biggest anticlimax in a movie ever, him being the funnest character. The whole confrontation of 'Nell' and the Ghost only gave a bigger feel of fantasy film. 'Nell' dying the death she did die, is the absolute no-no.The original was so much better than this weak remake. It was not bad, and it had its moments, but it lost the complete mood of the original. The whole ending was different, and it did not do the film good at all. Watching this makes the remake of 'The Birds' even more disappointing than it already is.

Highlighting just the spooky visual elements  would have created a better sense of creepiness.  The Pit and The Pendulum or some original black and white Frankenstein films are works in which one can find what isn't in this movie: a good dose of visual Poeism.The old castle is intriguing but too orderly and well kept to evoke the sense of impending doom that this movie desperately needs.  A few well placed cobwebs and some appropriate moldiness might help but It doesn't happen in this film, nor do the elements of tension and suspense develop.Instead Jan de Bont puts all his money on effects and a weak script with a formulatic and flawed plot (in the beginning of the action characters are introduced only to unexplainedly disappear from the rest of the story.)The only thing new in this movie might be some special effects techniques, but the days of relying on effects to satisfy an audience are numbered.

452,Conor-10,Horror movie for the kids.....,4,19 November 1999,"The Haunting had alot of good things going in its favour. For instance, the perfect setting of an old house, a shady history of a strange previous owner and a group of hapless people who have no idea what's about to happen. But sadly, none of these aspects are used to its fullest potential. It seems that through-out the movie there is a sence that it was made for the younger generation rather than the almost unshakable older crowd. And this is a problem. Because its aimed at younger people (and to acheive its PG type rating) the scares are extreamly subtle and the suspence and gore are practically non-existant. You can't help but think what type of movie it could have been if differant producers and a differant director were involved.The horror (if you can call it that) is mostly made of sound effects and CG soaked imagery. The CGI is another problem. It's so in-your-face and glossy that it looks out of place. Hollywood, it seems, needs to take a leaf out of the Blair Witch Project book. Much more could have been done here if simple suggestion was used instead of a barrage of technology.On the plus side of things, the preformances are fairly good. Liam Neeson gives his usual above average and Catherine Zeta Jones seems extreamly comfortable with her caracter. Lili Taylor, however, fell foul of the script writer. Her's is the deepest caracter here. There was enough scope to write a brilliant piece of script, but alas she is only 2 dimentional. Her climactic scenes are almost laughable.To sum up, The Haunting is a poor effort of a story that had so much potential. The kids will love it, but the older generation will be dissapointed. One only hopes that the director, Jan De Bont, is given back the freedom of film-making he had when he directed Speed.",The Haunting

The house where it takes place is breathtaking, and the visual effects were tastefully done until the end, where they made the mood way too cheesy to stomach.  The plot, as I've already mentioned, is interesting but far too unfledged to be reason enough to watch this movie.

I've heard so many poor reviews of this movie and some people say it's not scary, but they are all missing the point: it may not be scary, but it's thrilling and fun; good old fashioned popcorn fun.  I also like the liberties they took with the original story, which gives it a life of it's own.  It's a good balance of having enough the same and enough different to keep it fresh and exciting.

From start to finish, ""The Haunting"" was one of the worst movies I have seen, including those on MST3K. There was no suspense at all, as the movie repeatedly told you everything that was going on. Nothing was scary, since when something potentially scary occured, you could see it coming from a mile away.  And when someone was killed, it was generally very funny, not scary. Furthermore, the director had some bizarre obsession with constantly showing closeups of Owen Wilson. That, combined with the laughable acting and extremely obnoxious character Mr. Wilson played, had me screaming for his character's death the instant he appeared in the movie. This was a very poorly written and a very poorly directed movie. I admit the CG effects were neat to look at, but that doesn't make a movie.  Neither does casting Qui-Gon.  Indeed, I think that is the only reason Liam Neeson appeared in the movie... in attempt to milk success from Star Wars.  Had the movie pursued what appeared to be a potential relationship between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor, it may have been watchable. But alas, the focus was on a convoluted, nonsensical... something... that may remind one of a plot. I give this piece of dung 1/10th star (and the CG was what give it that).",The Haunting

468,Scarz,Great Movie,8,26 July 1999,"Critics are over rated in themselves.  I have no idea why anyone could not like this movie.  The acting was good, effects were great, and in a certified Dolby Digital DTS (the newest sound like used in SW Episode 1) the sound kicks some major ass!  Go see it in a good cinema while you still can!",The Haunting
469,s.world,Low on horror but great summer fun,9,31 July 1999,"I saw The Haunting the night it opened and I loved it. Let me say that I'm a horror fan in general, and I prefer a good ghost story to a hack and slash movie anyday. Still the Haunting had very few scary scenes.  It is not in league with ""The Shining"" or even ""Burnt Offerings"".  That aside The Haunting had an interesting story, great music/sound, good FX, and the coolest mansion even filmed.  Indeed the house is the star of the film (as it should be). For haunted house fans it's worth the price of admission alone.
The movie has some faults, but most are minor.  A lot of reviewers note the cheesy dialog, but the truth is that there are only about 2 or 3 bad lines in the whole picture (""home is where the heart is"" & ""it's about family"" being the worst).  Not enough to ruin it by any means.  The acting is top rate.  Lili Taylor (as Eleanor) is fantastic, but Catherine Zeta Jones seems to steal every scene she's in (doesn't she always).  Liam Neeson is somewhat wasted as the doctor conducting a study on the other three.
A major complaint I hear a lot is that only Lili Taylor's character is really developed.  True, but so what.  Do you really need to know everything about a character in a movie.  The Haunting is about the house and it's relationship to Eleanor. The other characters only serve to define her.  For example:  Catherine Zeta Jone's  overtly sexual Theo serves to contrast with Lili Taylor's Eleanor to show us a woman lacking self esteem and confidence. It is Eleanor who the story revolves around, and Lili Taylor does an excellent job of bringing her to life.It's also nice to see a horror movie that uses style and mood over gore & blood (of which there is very little). Those expecting to be scared out of their skin with the Haunting will be disappointed.  Those wanting a good summer movie with a big budget, big stars, and lots of special Fx set in a very cool haunted house, will find The Haunting very satisfing. 9 stars (out of 10).",The Haunting

It still effectively scares without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and believable.For readers of the book, the  from 1963 follows the it much closer.",The Haunting

And that is exactly what you get from The Haunting, for about a split second.  In fact, the only thing impressive about this film is the house itself.  Somebody must have spent a good long time making it move like that, and for that I am grateful, because nothing else in the ""movie"" moved at all.  I'll make this short and sweet:  If you are a fan of special effects, or just really cool looking houses, this is a movie for you.  Otherwise, you're wasting your time and money.",The Haunting
472,Krip-3,Surprisingly fun and scary,10,1 January 2000,"I was a little apprehensive in viewing the Haunting as I'd heard several critics and friends slam it to hell and back, but upon seeing it for the first time recently I was pleasantly surprised and found that I liked it a lot. The performances are suitably great from it's leads but Lili Taylor just steals the show as innocent and vulnerable Eleanor ""Nell"". The screenplay plays great with her emotions and you really feel for her character as the movie progresses. Rather than remake the original as in ""Psycho"" 98..Director Jan De Bont has told his vision of Shirley Jacksons wonderfully creepy novel and what he delivers is really breath-taking...from the house's gaping interiors to smothering carvings, he really uses these as characters unto themselves and as the story unfolds and night falls the films atmosphere stirs up a suitably wicked air of menace. I can't recommend this movie enough...don't compare it to the original, go in from a fresh perspective and I guarantee you'll be enthralled.",The Haunting
473,Erinn,"Very good - scary, great effects...I liked it!",9,26 September 1999,"I thought that The Haunting was one of the best films I've seen in a long while.  I know all the other reviews around say it isn't scary and there's no characters or plot, but I personally found that the characters had substance, there is a pretty deep plot (though they could have made more of the sub-plot between Nell and Theo), and it DID scare me.  I have the childrens' voices in my head still.  I went to see it at a late night showing (midnight), which I guess probably helped somewhat in making it really scary. Amazing special effects too.  I liked the idea of using the curtains as a way to see the childrens' ghosts.  And Lili Taylor was brilliant in it. I did think that it shouldn't be a 12 though.  Okay, so there's no swearing or gory violence, but all the scary things - rooms changing shape, statues and pictures coming to life - are things that will really scare younger children.",The Haunting
474,aidy-4,I am ashamed to have contributed to this film's box office.,2,29 September 1999,"This film epitomises the worst of what Hollywood is capable of: sloppy screenwriting (dire plotting, poor structure, zero interesting characterization) combined with big-budget effect excess. OK, effect movies can work (Jan de Bont's 'Twister' did), and it is possible to make non-humans protagonists... but wasn't this film supposed to be at least a little bit scary? Interesting? Fun? Something? What were all these high-profile actors doing when they signed up to this bomb? Well, they certainly weren't looking to do any acting.I'm afraid it's an all round disaster. None of the roles' potential was remotely fulfilled (Zeta Jones' part was, to all intents and purposes, non-existent). And any interesting story developments were soon abandoned to some rather mundane effects, which rather than create anything nearing a frisson of cinematic pleasure, merely turned the whole debacle into a farce. And was it scary? No, it was just funny. The only shots or scenes which went any of the way to creating any feeling of tension or fear were made without a single computer effect. Which must be saying something.",The Haunting
475,kat-142,So bad it was BAD.,1,15 October 1999,"One of the worst films I've ever seen; its awfulness was compounded by the fact that I had seen the original (a classic) only two weeks previously, so was expecting good things.  My expectations were also raised by the reasonable cast including the wonderful Lili Taylor. (Dreadful script, meaningless encounters, reliance on special effects rather than acting and plot... Need I say more?",The Haunting
476,RichardJ,Special effects no substitute for good acting and plot,4,15 October 1999,"A classic example of how modern day special effects, no matter how well crafted (which they are in The Haunting)  can ruin an otherwise good, if well used,  storyline.  If film makers limited the use of special effects to support the actors and plot, rather than as a substitute, then I think we would all benefit.The film begins with a steady, albeit predictable build up and the first scenes in the house really make you want to believe it is has a mysterious and sinister past.  However, about half way through the film the actors become secondary to the overdone special effects and seem to confine themselves to wandering around aimlessly.At no stage during the film did I ever feel scared nor did I receive any sudden frights (compared, for example, to the ""choke on your popcorn"" frights delivered in Sixth Sense).   If this was the aim of the film, then I'm afraid it failed miserably.   In the scariness stakes, repeated loud noises and wobbly walls are no match for the brief glimpse of an unexplained shadow or a rapidly moving household object narrowly missing you.I felt the ending to The Haunting was very abrupt and did not satisfactorily explain all that had happened in the closing scenes.  While I usually don't mind films to end in such a way that make the audience work out the ending, I found in this case I didn't care.By no means the worst film I have seen this year - there are a few good creepy scenes and the house is truly magnificent.  The Haunting was sufficiently ""average"" to avoid me feeling cheated of my admission money, but it is not a film I intend to see again.",The Haunting

The Haunting is the worst film I've seen to date. The 1963 B&W version is a psychologically terrifying adaptation of Shirly Jackson's nightmarish novel The Haunting of Hill House.

482,Doylenova,Not Haunted by the new The Haunting... (may be spoilers),1,20 March 2001,"How viewers react to this new ""adaption"" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards ""special effects"" being the first and last word in how ""good"" a film is, are going to love it.
Things I did not like about this adaption:1.  It was NOT a true adaption of the book.  From the articles I had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to.  And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie.  Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING.  I didn't like that, either.  What the movie's press release SHOULD have said is...""We got the basic, very basic, idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.""2.  They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been ""born bad"".  No, instead, this ""doctor"" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their ""insomnia"" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy).  This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.3.  In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies ""some houses are just born bad"", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, Nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of THE CHANGELING).  The only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH. It's first ""victim"" died before ever setting eyes on it.4.  The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it's ""history"")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar.5.  I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family, and Mrs. Dudley's little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING.  It's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do.6.  I missed Nel's narrative through the whole movie.  The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version.  They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine.  The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper...  This one was almost too good to be true.  This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.7.  They changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no ""companion"", and there was no nursery.  There was also no ""Grace"" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways.  These changes, changed the story WAY too much.  I don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...BE SORRY (if ya get my drift!!! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke (appropriate substitution of the word ""house"" for ""movie""!):  ""This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!""  My favorite movie of all time remains so.  No competition from this one.",The Haunting
483,zephyr-34,Put Casper In While You're At It (Sigh)...,4,1 July 2006,"I really wanted to like this movie about the haunted house (hoping it would be like others, much older, that I've seen), especially after seeing the special about it on the TV, made prior to its release.However, this movie did not work at all for me for the following reasons:1. Hard to believe at first, but it had too much of a ""Casper"" feel. I think this is because the children's ""ghosts"" are so amazingly unconvincing and fake-looking, that it is hard to believe they would even release it like this. The children are all generic-looking and doll-like, as if the people who made this never saw a real child. (Could they not get any child actors?) It also reminds me so much of the CGI trickery in the Casper movie, but unlike Casper, this is supposed to be realistic looking, yes?2. I did not at all like the character of Dr. David Marrow, especially in thinking anyone who acts a certain way is having some sort of ""episode"" and is in a state of delusion as if he ""knows"" everything. Why do some ""professional"" people assume they have any more understanding than anyone else (relative to actual experience, not just going to school)? This does happen in real life, but far more in movies, it would seem, I guess to purposely make you hate the character?3. I may be wrong in this, but how many absolutely identical paintings (one in the kitchen?), one on the wall in the stairwell, and at least one more? - were there of Crain? This is not in the lists of ""goofs"" as far as I can tell, but seems very obvious, more than other listed goofs. Why would you have copies of the same very large painting in different areas? This was very annoying for me and damaged any potential realism. Dorian Gray, he is not.4. I know the house is always ""changing"", but how can it be so different on the outside than the inside?5. Finally, Mrs. Dudley's ""in the dark"" speeches made me laugh, which I do not think was intended, and the ""I can see my breath"" scene was also a bit silly.I will say that the carved cherubic faces of the children ""coming to life"" and also making outlines in curtains and sheets was very creepy (perhaps the most interesting facet of the whole movie, in concept - having the feel of an old DC comic), but the more obvious CGI ghost children, as well as their unchildlike voices (with regard of what their spirits must have went through, especially), completely ruined these connecting elements.I also feel this movie would have been more entertaining if they had not shown Crain at all in his ""human"" form. And the ending made no sense to me at all. I didn't at all understand the supposed explanation of Eleanor's history, nor why she had to die when I thought the ghosts were ""protecting"" her. This, as well, was extremely annoying.I will give this movie a 4/10. Not so bad as to deserve a 1.",The Haunting

However after 30 minutes I wondered what that was supposed to be. I would rather describe it as a horror-comedy or even parody. But even if that should have been the intention, it went wrong. The film is full of cliches of average horrorfilms. Additionally the story is completely predictable. There are strange statues in the house, blowing winds, whistling sounds and of course an ancient ghost. Even the special effects, which are in fact high-quality don't prevent the movie from being boring. These effects create an artificial impression: The winding of the ceiling or the braking window might have worked for a sci-fi movie, but not for a horrorfilm which is supposed to scare. The actors can't save the movie either: Liam Neeson is top, but the two girls (especially Lily Taylor gets on your nerves after a while)are just average.The set of Hill House is nice, and the rooms in there are pretty impressive but without convincing story-who cares?

The elements of the house and the characters are in perfect symbiosis...you keep your eyes open because the perspective of every character that enters in each floor and room are in a way, extensions of each other...what a classic way of enjoying films that don't rely on convoluted plots and/or reading the psyche of the enemy as if its mind is stretched to a 100 ft. deep. Nothing is far too complicated here and it makes for a pleasurable experience.

So didn't know quite what to expect... And so onto the film, it concentrates (unfortunately) on Eleanor (Lili Taylor) following the death of her mother.  She responds to an ad looking for insomniacs to take part in a study undertaken by Dr David Marrow (Liam Neeson) who is actually going to try and scare them and see what happens. Fair enough, so they meet up at the haunted house along with Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones), and Luke (Owen Wilson) and we wait for scary things to happen. Unfortunately it takes far too long for the scariness to begin (what little of it there is).  Yes, the house is weird, lots of odd rooms ready for scary set-pieces, but they are not exploited as they could have been.  Eleanor is just so dull that I just ended up not caring about her in the end.  The special effects were also a little boring.  It is much scarier not to now what the cause is, rather than seeing some face in a curtain. Our one quality piece of entertainment was the flume-decapitation of Owen Wilson, a classic.

Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's.

While it naturally fails to measure up to the original, the fact that it attempts to pass itself off as somehow ""original"" in itself lowers an otherwise typical remake to the level of utterly abysmal garbage. I had the pleasure of watching this stinker back when I was still in high school, and it has left me with a tarnished image of the horror genre ever since.I won't waste my time or yours outlining the details of the plot, but suffice to say, it's your typical haunted house story, only enhanced by a melee of ""ethereal"" 90's special effects. The actors, with a few notable exceptions, all deliver campy if not completely unbelievable performances, highly unmemorable whether viewed collectively or individually. The one major attempt at a ""plot twist"" of any kind (though ""contrivance"" would be more suitable) appears toward the very end, and it is laughably conveyed- presumably unintentionally- in what must surely be the cheesiest way possible.Obviously, I would advise against watching this movie under most circumstances (no, it's not even worth a rental) but if you're curious or even remotely masochistic, try to catch it on public television. It's a favorite of many broadcasters during the Halloween season, so this October, keep your eyes peeled...just make sure you don't gouge them out of their sockets in retribution.That might actually be scary.",The Haunting

This 1999 version is completely different to the original, so much so that perhaps it shouldn't of been coined as a remake to the 1963 one.The first time I watched this film, I hadn't seen the original, so I guess I had nothing to pin my hopes on. I personally loved this movie. So did all my friends that I showed it to. Forget that it's a 'remake' and just watch it without any outside or prior knowledge, but this is one entertaining flick.I'm no sucker for CGI and special effects; I've always been against them. However this movie has some very good effects, that are used well and for the right reasons. The creators don't overuse them or simply add them in for cheap tricks and thrills. They are placed in nicely and make the film feel a lot more exciting.The acting I found was very well executed. The actors, who were well cast I believe, are very interesting and their characters offer traits that are often found at the ends of the human psych scale. There are no average or normal people in this film and that keeps it entertaining and likable. They're 3 dimensional and you easily find yourself really giving a damn about them.The storyline I'll admit is slightly diluted. They seem to not give much suspense to the actual story behind why they are all in the house. However with that said, the script is well written and actually quite intellectual at points. I personally didn't find it much of a problem about the story line, because I found many other things that helped the film.The music and general sound of the film are wonderful. I have a sub-woofer and I honestly recommend you watch this with surround because it is just, epic! The bass in this film is so powerful, even during bright daylight I felt like I was in the actual movie itself just from the bass alone. Not exactly a big deal to many, but to those who have the right equipment, it's heaven! Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and watch it at least two or three times a year. You really should not judge this movie, as you shouldn't any others, by the reviews of other people. Mainly because I think as I said previously the hate is down to the love of the original. Definitely give it a go, you have nothing to lose but could end up finding your new favourite. Just like me.",The Haunting

The movie builds up this sense of horror inside this evil house, and then ends with a silly sequence that supposedly ties everything together.

The only scary thing about this is the thought of all horror movies turning into 'THE MATRIX with a monster.'  The movie had one (maybe two) creepy parts and a jump or two, but it almost doesn't even fit in the horror genre.  The story was confusing and not worth caring about.  The acting was up to par, but the actual characters weren't worth getting into the movie for.  Owen Wilson's character was hilarious and well-played too.

The film forgets one key ingredient in making a horror film, is that you must focus more attention on making the characters then making the effects for there emotions travel through them into the crowd. The Haunting is about as enjoyable as a trip to the doctor. The film takes so long to get started by the time it does you want to 1.

Special FX are interesting and are used in a proper way. What dosen't work is the plot, too linear and not much developed. Also the general atmosphere should (and could) have been far creepier and obsessive. I think the production wanted to make a movie for the general audience, kids included, but that definitely ruined the movie. Horror movies should be scary, and, if it is necessary, graphic and disturbing; that's what they are supposed to be. I think that the best american movies are those whose production have the courage to make a movie that is not necessarily ""for all the family"" and don't have to be something even Disney would produce. In my opinion movies that are afraid of achieving their full effect are really disappointing.

Those are the award winning cheesy moments, but, if you're a cheese lover, this is the velveeta of movies, so there are plenty of varieties of cheese here...

The script is so bad, I think that two pieces of bread could have better dialogue.  Don't even get me started on how lame the whole story was, including what is supposed to be the big climax, which is more like watching a remake of the Exorcist by a bunch of 5 year olds on a camcorder that think they should do everything in slow motion just to make the scene more dramatic.  I don't understand.  Jan De Bont started off so well with Speed (OK, not an Oscar Caliber movie, but at least it was enjoyable), then Twister, then that piece of crap Speed 2 and now this. Geez, the more I think about this movie the more frustrated I am getting.  I have to talk to the executives at Dreamworks and ask them how the hell I am ever gonna get back those 2 hours of my life that I completely wasted watching this trash.

512,JavaBuzz,A hilarious mix of horror and Liam Neeson,6,24 July 1999,"After seeing the film I must say that I was entertained, so it is not at all a bad movie. However, special effects alone are not enough to carry a movie with plot/unity gaps big enough to drive a small Buick through. In terms of the horror genre, I did jump at some of the ""Boo!"" parts, but I also think that some of the scenes that were supposed to be frightening, came across as humorous instead. Overall: **1/2   C+/B-Perhaps it was the fact that this film was released in the US not long after Star Wars: Episode 1, but I kept expecting (wanting) Liam Neeson to pull out his lightsaber and use the force.",The Haunting
513,Mark-303,Great Entertainment,8,14 October 1999,This film manages to scare and shock much more than could be expected from the 12 certificate.

Some of the best sets ever.  The actors were well chosen and did a good job of things.  Catherine Zeta Jones especially was marvellous in her role, playing it with obvious relish.The special effects were middling; slightly unconvincing, plus, as is all too often these days, YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL (almost) IN THE TRAILER.The script, however, sucks.  All the time is spent in setup, and the payoff is pathetic and over WAY too quickly.  Kudos to the writer/director/studio for not slavishly following the who lives/who dies formula for horror movies so perfectly captured by 'Scream' -- but that's all the credit they're going to get from me.  The ending is all too pat and too easy, and doesn't make enough sense.  There are some good lines, but the overall structure is bad, and one leaves with a sense of dissatisfaction with the entire thing.  I really hope that the flaws are due to overzealous cutting or meddling -- if the original script was that bad, I'm amazed they ever started to make the movie, and spend that much on it.",The Haunting

I loved the atmosphere. It starts out extremely beautiful, you almost want to see this house for yourself. but I'll tell you, your glad you'll never set foot in it by the end! I loved how everything focused on one main character, this poor girl and everyones reactions towards the house's repeated attempts to get her. As much as I loved this movie, I do wish they had done certain aspects of it better. The movie seemed to start at a very unhurried pace, Pulling us into it. We get to enjoy the character's reactions to the house. I think one of my favorite parts to this movie are the ones that involve everyones reactions to Nell when they think she has snapped. Though, I do believe the ending to this movie is quite hurried and left a lot to be desired. The ending felt extremely rushed through, almost like they didn't know exactly how to resolve it so they spent most of the movies time in the ""getting to the end"" parts that were wonderful, because they knew the ending wouldn't live up to the rest of the movie. It needed to be longer and they needed to touch onto more aspects of the plot than they did, instead of slamming it to a halt. Nell's speech to the "" bad guy"" at the end is even a little bit silly! But the ending didn't stink, it was even pretty cool, it just could have been better. The movie as a whole was great, and there were no parts in it that detracted from the enjoyment of it.

The characters were awful (Liam--why?!?), all stereotypes, the direction and camera angles tried oh-so-hard to inspire fear but didn't, and the acting was awful. And this chubby lady sitting behind me kept gaffawing every two seconds. Was that a horror flick or a comedy? No, it was so cheesy it was funny.

There is no comparison of the recent release of the ""Haunting"" to the original. While I may agree the   current version could be ""scarier"", I have never sat through a more boring and uneventful movie than the 1963 Wise original.  The interior sets looked as if they belonged in a 1950's sitcom rather than ""Hill House"", and the only thing frightening was that I actually wasted the money and time to watch this old and poorly made movie.The one good thing about Robert Wise's ""Haunting"", is that it proves that just because something is the ""original"" or old, doesn't mean that it's the best, and that remakes of old movies can be better than the original.",The Haunting

This movie was NOT SCARY...in fact, people were laughing throughout it.  The acting was bland, and the characters flat.  The dialogue was utter cheese, and the story full of holes.

533,Arne-14,"An over the top turkey, a worthless waste.",1,24 July 1999,"Shirley Jackson's story, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is one which has twice scared the willies out of me.  Unfortunately neither time was when I went to see Jan de Bont's film, ""The Haunting,"" which opened this week amid hype and hoopla. Compared to Jackson's original novel and Robert Wise's 1963 film version, de Bont's remake seems cheap, obvious and phony. It neither scares nor convinces.Watching this movie is like having a talkative guy sitting next to you in the theater poking you in the ribs and yelling, ""Hey, this is scary, eh?""  For instance, I'm sure that the sound department didn't intend to make a confusing muddle out of the the story.  But that's what happens.  The major scares in Jackson's story come from the sounds of the house.  De Bont fills the sound track with groans, creaks and heavy breathing, so many that the viewer doesn't know whether the sounds are there because they are in the story or are just window dressing for the movie viewer.  This outright spoils several of the scenes and waters down the effect on those where the sounds are meant to be heard by the characters.  In the earlier Robert Wise direction, the sounds truly mean something to the characters and present a wonderfully frightful experience for the film viewer. In this turkey some of the groans are coming from the audience.Character development is likewise in-your-face.  For instance, where Wise lets Theo's lesbianism be subtle and under the covers (so to speak), de Bont has Catherine Zeta-Jones do her usual over-acting in tight leather in her very first scenes.  Although Lili Taylor could probably do a very credible job as Eleanor, the script doesn't help her develop Eleanor's fragile persona.  Regardless, what little good she does in the role is completely ruined by the idiotic and special effects filled ending which requires her character to somehow cast off the fragility and metamorphose into a pontificating Superwoman. The rest of the script is equally ridiculous and unbelievable. Liam  Neeson's ample talents are wasted.If you are tempted to go see ""The Haunting"" in the next few weeks, my advice is to either go to the library and check out Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel, ""The Haunting of Hill House"". Or, if you insist on seeing a movie, make it Robert Wise's truly chilling 1963 black and white version, also entitled ""The Haunting.""  And, sweet dreams.",The Haunting

But it might not have been so bad if the CGI ghosts were not so...dumb-looking.  And the ending was a little too Disney-esque for me. Although this is just my opinion, a haunted house movie, particularly in a house that was ""born bad"" does not necessarily need a ""happy"" ending (especially one that seemed so contrived). But it certainly wasn't all bad.  The house is incredible, and I thought the sounds and music were first-rate.  There were a few good effects too.  I'd just like to use my imagination a little more and not have everything spelled out for me.

Certain events did, but for the most part, it was a completely different storyline.However, I did enjoy the film as it had the ability to make me jump (and scream outloud once, I'm ashamed to say) and the computer animation was extremely well done. The cast itself did a really decent job of portraying the characters from the book accurately, although I left wanting a little bit more.  While Shirley Jackson focused more on the mental aspect concerning her characters reactions to the various manifestations taking place, the was more or less pure Hollywood in that what the characters saw rather then what they felt took precedence. All in all, it was definitely scary and the plot, while changed dramatically, was still interesting.  My only recommendation is that you read the book after seeing the film, or you may be disappointed.",The Haunting

Nell's growing insanity is replaced with obvious ghouls and ghostly apparitions calling in the night.  The web of suspense and uncertainty woven by the author is replaced with a climactic fight scene between Nell the Strong and Crane the Evil Ghost.  Be sure, this is not the mousey Nell of the novel but a new, heroic Nell the Conqueror.If you have not read the novel, avoid this movie.  The characters exist for no reason other than to be exposed to the crumbling house and mobile statues in the climactic scene.

I first saw it when it was released (I was 12) and to this day if I watch it I get chills (and I've seen it many, many times.) The terror came from the fact that you never saw what, or who, was haunting Hill House.  You only saw a door bend in and out, or you heard weird sounds, etc.  Everything was pretty much left to your imagination--and that's where this remake goes terribly, terribly wrong.  Aside from the fact that parts of the original Shirley Jackson story were changed for no apparently valid reason, in this version, you see far too much, virtually nothing is left to the imagination, and the end tries to wrap up everything in a ""we've got rid of the ghost"" scenario, (also a departure from the original story.)

Had the  script writers/editors picked one plot line to develop, movie-goers may have cared what happened to the different characters.

So it was strange when I really wanted to see this movie... My reasons being I love Liam Nelison, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also the speical effect totally blew me away during the trailers. So I went to go see it on opening night in my very small home town. And I have to tell you I LOVED IT! It is very creepy and scary, but not in the blood and gore way like all the rest I've seen.

What The Haunting is, is really the trailer I mentioned above (which is a few minutes long) extended to almost 2 hours of repetitive acting. The movie itself is very slow moving and what little that happens can easily be guessed long in advance. (Facts are I could guess 100% of what little story twists existed in the movie and I had not even seen a single trailer before seeing the movie. Nothing like any of the twists in The Usual Suspects)For the hype about the special effects.. well to start with, they were few and the quality of them was nothing spectacular.. about the same as all other movies with digital post production effects released -99.My tip to you: See the trailers and skip the movie, since the movie itself was among the worst I've seen in years.

559,BigFat,Perhaps the worst film I have ever seen,1,21 September 1999,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Having read a number of reviews on this website, I think that my summary of this movie will ring false to many people.  I thought for some time about what to say about this film, and realized that very little else would express my views.  This movie does have good special effects, and it is only due to that that it gets the one star out of ten that I would give it.  I can deal with movies that are supposed to be fun lacking brilliant cinematography or fantastic acting.  All that I ask is that the film live up to what it is meant to be.  In the case of ""The Haunting,"" that is a horror movie.  I swear to you that I am not exagerating when I say that the closest I came to having a frightened response to this film was one slight flexing of my right calf muscle in one scene of the movie.  It really wasn't a frightening scene - just startling.  My biggest beef with the movie is that it has all of the sterotypes and stupid audience grabbing devices that tend to piss me off.  An example:  Catherine Zeta-Jones has several incredibly heavy-handed lines that hint at her bisexuality.  Message, ""hey adolescent boys, this character might hook up with another woman.  Watch and get turned on.""  It is a lame device used in the abscence of real plot to draw people into the film.  The same thing is done with the special effects.  Basically, I hated this film.  If I hadn't been with a group of friends on whom I was dependent for a ride home, I would have walked out.  It was not fun to watch in any way.  As a fellow audience member said on the way out to people waiting in line to see this film, ""Just stick a fork in your eyes.  It will be cheaper and more fun.""",The Haunting

But alas, Neeson, Zeta-Jones et al, couldn't scare a 15 year old girl from Northern Norway, let alone her uncle. I hoped it would be an ordinary but scary movie. But apart from the spectacular special effects, it was a huge disappointment, even for my expectations. The plot is wafer thin, the characters cardboard-like, and the ghosts are as scary as those in Ghostbusters. Two things crossed my mind when I was suffering in the theatre: What the hell was Neeson thinking, when he said ""Yess!"" to this movie?

It is a scary movie, but not in the usual sense of scariness.  There is no guy in a black hooded costume chasing innocent young girls with a butcher knife, but instead a house come to life by things unknown.  The special effects are used in this movie like no other.  Instead if using goriness to freak others out, they imply violence, rather than showing it to you face to face.  The CGIs are astounding.  They bring the house to life for the viewer without making you feel that you are inside some elaborate computer game.

Its a movie that if you watch alone at night try just try to sleep with out the lights off! The sounds of banging on the door is chilling. This movie version does have a great house as did the 1963 film. I don't know where the new one was filmed. The house in the 1963 version was filmed at Ettington Park Hotel in England and its house that truly has a life of its own. And this house in the new one has that same feeling.

577,frank3142,The Worst Remake Ever Made,1,10 April 2008,"One of the most atmospheric and frightening films ever made was 'The Haunting', the black and white original film made in 1963. I am not easily scared by a film, and seldom twice by the same film, but the fear this one engenders is primal and eternal. I still wont watch it alone even now. It touches something deep and terrifying inside you. What a film.Then a crime was committed; it was re-made in 1999 and turned into a Hollywood joke of a film with Catherine Zita Jones and a ton of special effects. The result doesn't deserve to ever air. Its a dull self indulgent bore of a film that desecrates all that was brilliant, and everything that was scary, in the original. It's a familiar story. The Director doesn't have the skill to create narrative tension, but boy do they have a special effects budget so lets throw millions of dollars at it it and yawn. Of course the problem with special effects is that they're not that special anymore, and the idea that you can prop up a badly made film with CGI surely doesn't apply to audiences over 18 years of age? Then there's the cast. Oh dear. This story assumes powerful and complex characterisations to develop and advance the narrative. Paper thin acting doesn't hack it no matter how glamorous or over-paid the performers may be. For my money there has to be a certain arrogance in thinking you can remake a brilliant film, so if you're going to, you'd better deliver. This is a catastrophe of ego and hubris unredeemed by vision, talent, or tension.The only frightening aspect of the film is wondering how many millions of dollars were squandered on this folly - putting the cash in a big pile in the street and setting fire to it so tramps could get warm on cold nights would have been a better use of the money.

It didn't show any gore, not even any blood, yet it had you checking under the bed, inside the closet, and behind every door before you went to bed that night (& maybe a few nights thereafter if you were sensitive to horror movies).

She has no will to resist the deadly spirit of Hill House. In the re-make, Eleanor is a highly sensitive strong willed single woman (if she's a ""Spinster"", WOW!) who was badly taken advantage of by her family. Having gone through 11 very hard years with her invalid mother, she has developed the inner strength to stand up to, and defeat the deadly spirit of Hill House. The all-star cast helps the re-make, the house itself (well, the special effects) is a leading character in the re-make & is VERY impressive.

The effects were fun, and very much my style of creepy, suspense, and just plain disturbing. And for being made in 1999, The Haunting is very well done. You clearly see the fear in the characters as they try to figure out what was going on, and the change that happens in the main character is very subtle and empathetic to a receptive audience. I don't watch horror/suspense movies because I am very empathetic and remember details, but this is a movie even for 'chicken' audiences.

584,Bernie_Ohls,One of the worst movies of all time.,1,13 September 2019,"This remake is on my personal list of the five worst movies of all time, and a serious contender for the absolute worst -- right down there with ""Night Train to Venice"" (1993). It is as if a couple of illiterate junior-high-dropout stoners had been hired, at great expense, to adapt Shirley Jackson's disturbing, even terrifying, novella into a seventh-grade level comic book. The kindest thing I can say for the actors is that they try to work with the dreck they've been given. (They don't succeed.) The director has no idea of how to generate suspense, or fear, or horror. He apparently believed that a battery of increasingly ridiculous CGI special effects would take care of those things. (They don't.) The movie is campy, overproduced, and ludicrously over-the-top. At one point, around midway through the film, I literally fell off my couch laughing at a ""dramatic"" episode that was meant to be frightening but was instead face-palmingly moronic. After that brief moment, however, sad to say, the film went ever more rapidly downhill -- from mildly amusingly in its stupidity to preachy, saccharine, self-important, embarrassing, incoherent, and just plain boring. I sincerely hope that this film damaged or ended the careers of its chief makers. By the time the credits rolled, I was angry that I'd wasted my time watching this meretricious trash and felt like I'd lost twenty points off my IQ in the process.",The Haunting
585,Monkeychimp,You want to know what's scarier than this film?,1,2 March 2012,"My balls are scarier than this film. Seriously. I looked down at my balls in the shower today and thought, ""Crikey, aren't my balls unsightly"". That feeling was more unsettling than anything that this film has to offer. If that mild feeling of displeasure caused by glancing at my own balls were to go for an interview with this film for the position of being engaging on any level, they would be sent home for being vastly over qualified. In an interview, my balls would have shown the interviewer - this film - up for the lame, lazy, celebrity vehicle it is. In fact, MY BALLS SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN AND DIRECTED THIS FILM. My ugly, wrinkly balls. All hail my balls! Hail them! By the standards this film has set, my balls will rule Hollywood. I have Shane Meadows balls. Kubrick balls. They are downy haired Nolan balls. One day, they will put together a film ever so mildly scary and it will make all responsible for The Haunting (1999) cack in their pants. The mildly scary movie my balls will create will blow their obviously very limited minds.",The Haunting
586,ahmed9073,i like it,8,26 April 2013,"I like that movie ...it have all thing In all Action It has real meaning I've seen a lot of horror ةخرهث, but this I Like itThis movie takes you back to the classic horror movies of the past with a 90's technical twist. This is definitely a A+++++ experience. It keeps you riveted to your seat (When you're not jumping out of it) Worth every dollar! Go See It !What is everyone's problem with the movie? Why can't you just sit back and enjoy it rather than look for all the bad mistakes the director made or how the actors should have been someone else. I thought it was a great movie and saw it thrice.",The Haunting
587,CreativeSpaz,One word: UGH,2,1 June 2005,"This movie was incredibly appalling. As a fan of the book, I was interested to see if this version could hold up. It couldn't. It's funny with trying to be with horrific dialogue predictable events. I ended up laughing through 90% of the movie and groaning through the other 10%. The special effects are horrible as well-I wondered through most of it if the animators even tried at all. Everything's very cartoonish and cheesy, which took away a lot for me. Even seasoned actors such as Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor couldn't pull this mess up. I expected better from them, but they didn't have much to work with. The only really good part of the movie was the photography, but that was overshadowed by the bad.Read the book or see the original, and skip this one.2 stars out of 10, out of pity.",The Haunting
588,Xena123452001,Great Movie (some spoilers),10,14 May 2007,"First of all I have been reading a lot of bad reviews for this movie. So many comments are saying how the 1960s one is the best I cant even try to understand how an old movie that probably had bad special effects or no special effects can be better then the 1999 version. I mean seriously the movie was beautiful it had a good plot and great characters and a nice story line and for those who do not understand the movie must not have been paying attention at all. My god people these days don't know how to review a movie take the skeleton key for example that movie was good till then end then it just sucked. That was two hours that I wont get back,But people reviewed that movie as if it was the best thing they had ever seen. I think this movie was great because how remarkable it was. Eleanor was the best character in all the movie how she wanted to save the children and how caring she was.This movie may not have been scary but I enjoyed the movie till the end especially the music which was remarkable. That movie is old but I can still watch it over and over again.",The Haunting
589,earlcampbell20,The worst movie I've ever seen.,1,17 December 2005,"I'm not going to say this is the worst movie ever because I haven't seen every movie in existence, but so far, I have never seen such a horrible movie. The acting is awful. Lili Taylor would not pass as a good actress in an elementary school play. I can't even believe somebody would pay her to act. The script is just plain terrible. All of the characters are completely cliché. The special effects are laughably cheesy. The plot is almost as bad as the acting (and no I have not read the book).In summary, do not watch this movie. Don't even think about watching it. It is slow torture.",The Haunting
590,machoman_19,Disney horror,8,21 July 2014,"Because the overall reviews are just so bad i felt compelled to say something. I saw this movie when I was around 15 years old and thought at the time that it was pretty scary, now not so much.I find it to be a Disney horror, if Pixar and Disney were to make a horror movie this is what you would get. you have mystery, action and a feel good ending. I never saw the original and I'm not really someone that likes horror movies so that says enough about the film to know that it really is not that scary. I loved the special effects and build up to the end, although the end is somewhat exaggerated I loved the part when he is defeated and the child ghosts go to heaven.What can I say I love Disney movies.",The Haunting
591,kolaboy,Beware...,1,4 September 2005,"The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the ""I'm gonna get us outta here"" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). But, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the ""star"", I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since ""The Cowboys"". Stop it.",The Haunting
592,cassmc,How utterly horrible,1,5 July 2005,"I'm stunned. Is it possible to miss the point of the book any more completely? It's supposed to be a psychological thriller. The *whole* point was the ambiguity.The reader (or watcher if you're talking about the old B+W version) is supposed to decide for themselves if the house was really haunted, or if Eleanor was just suggestible and in need of a home, or if Eleanor was doing it herself with her mentioned paranormal abilities, or if it was maybe the house *and* Eleanor both doing things. You never saw the actual ghosts because you weren't supposed to know for sure if there were any! This bears no resemblance at all to Shirley Jacksons lovely, spooky psychological thriller.",The Haunting
593,tmeveline,Lili Taylor,10,21 October 2020,"So sad Lili Taylor was not first in the recognition of casts on here. She made the show, it was her story. Catherine Zeta Jones was not the star.",The Haunting
594,the_witch_next_door,The Haunting,1,25 July 2005,"So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see's s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says ""oh no"". The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.",The Haunting
595,delldiablo,No point in watching this film,3,18 January 2017,"This film has nothing to say, so I won't say much about it. It was meant to make money, it made it, now let's move on.Liam Neeson is wasted here.Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, her lines are crap and her personality is a caricature. Owen Wilson plays Owen Wilson, although his name in this film is Luke.Lili Taylor plays some kind of character. Not sure what. She saw a decapitation and just said ""on, no."" Theo (CZJ) was screaming - she covered her mouth in horror but the sound was coming as if it wasn't muffled, as if it were dubbed.The music has some ridiculous circus themes. I don't know what this film wants to be. Haunted house? Undead children? Scary paintings? Gargoyle statues coming to life?Why not all of the above?How about some comedy. Dr. Marrow says ""what do we all need in life, the basics, food, water, shelter."" Theo (Zeta Jones) interrupts/adds ""sex"" with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, to which Luke (Owen Wilson) responds ""meow."" Yups, Owen Wilson plays himself. If you've seen him say ""wow"" many times, then meow isn't far off. It's not scary, not funny, not entertaining, not dramatic, not mysterious, not anything.The special effects, some look good, some bad, but I won't give it plus points over good effects nor minus over bad ones. The attacking spider bed effect was interesting, but that's not why anyone would watch a film.Don't watch.",The Haunting
596,razzle-3,I very much enjoyed it!,9,27 December 2006,"As I have recently watched many rather stupid and low budget horror movies, 'The Haunting' really did it for me. The set was definitely mind blowing, even though most of it was recreated on a sound stage in the US. The enormity of the house depicted has to be seen to be believed, even then it cannot be.I found 'Hill House' incredibly haunting, so any plot staged in that place would be creepy by nature. I don't usually find special effects believable and mostly they are completely over the top. Effects in this movie are excellent with photography to match. As for the very creative and enormity of the sets, they were stunning and very professionally done.I rate this movie as a 9......that's quite high I know, but it really tickled my imagination. The best movie I've seen in quite a while, (most movies along these lines are rubbish) so I'll definitely watch it again.",The Haunting
597,willruddock-36172,Oh Painful. Painful,4,18 November 2017,"When I saw this movie in theaters, I couldn't sleep for days. I was 12 and images like Hugh Crane lunging out of the fireplace or his angry face appearing in the window frightened me beyond belief.I watched it last night for the first time in many years a few days after revisiting the 1963 film. And it was just truly awful. I found myself resisting the temptation to quit early because I believe in seeing things true to the end unless I absolutely can't bear it. Annoying acting saved by Liam and Owen. Catherine cannot play terrified and as much as I admire Lili, she's no Julie Harris. I will admit that the face in the window seen still gave me a little bit of a chill but nowhere near what it did when I was 12.One other positive is that it has reaffirmed my enthusiasm for exploring huge houses.",The Haunting
598,foxygirl21591,lame lame lame,1,8 August 2006,"This was pretty much the LAMEST excuse for a horror movie i've ever seen... the acting was terrible, the special effects were worse and whatever plot the movie had was made into a complete joke by how stupid and unscary the movie was. I don't have anything else to say but it was just really bad and really lame and I hate Lili Taylor in that movie because when she screams it sounds totally fake and when she tries to look scared it's just weird. I have to fit ten lines in this so i'll just keep criticizing the movie. But really, if you think you want to see this movie, really really don't because its a complete waste of your time. Unless you want to laugh because it is sometimes very funny how unscary it is. And also, it had a pretty lame ending that didn't make much sense to me. I'm sure in the book it made a lot more sense so I feel bad for the author of the book since it was made into a complete joke of a movie. Sorry guys. It was bad.",The Haunting
599,Johnfm625,This film is a disgrace!,1,15 March 2006,"They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story! I hate this damn remake!",The Haunting
