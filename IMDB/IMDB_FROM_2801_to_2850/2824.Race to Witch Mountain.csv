0,TheLittleSongbird,Decent family entertainment,6,30 October 2011,"I have nothing against remakes, and I had wanted to see Race to Witch Mountain for some time now. I think it is a decent movie, I do remember the original movie with fondness and feel it is a superior movie, however compared to other remakes I've seen like Psycho, Stepford Wives and Wicker Man Race to Witch Mountain is not a bad movie. It looks great visually, whether it is in the effects, the scenery, the cinematography or lighting. The soundtrack has some pleasing and memorable themes, direction is solid and the script while not award-worthy is good. The cast are fine, Dwayne Johnson carries the movie and he has so much charisma that it is a joy to watch him. AnnaSophia Robb once again proves herself a promising actress, and Ciaron Hinds is a fun villain. Only Carla Gugino disappoints, she's beautiful but her performance and character are dull and she and Johnson have no chemistry. The characters are on the stereotypical side particularly those of Gugino and Hinds, the pace is rather jerky in places and the story while having an appreciative nostalgia as well as a darkness the original didn't have I feel has a number of predictable spots. All in all, a decent if unexceptional family film. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Race to Witch Mountain
1,bkoganbing,Some Cabdrivers Do Get The Most Interesting Fares,7,13 April 2009,"As they did with reviving Herbie the Love Bug for a film with Lindsay Lohan a few years back, the Walt Disney Studios decided that the two popular Witch Mountain films from the Seventies could also use a nice computer graphic remake. The Magic Kingdom has always been known to milk a good thing to death.In this case I think they did better here than with Herbie. Two alien kids with some extraordinary powers get into a cab that's driven by none other than Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson. What a fortuitous circumstance that turns out to be, because youngsters Alexander Ludwig and Sophia Anna Robb are going to need every bit of the fighting skills that the Rock can muster.They've got two enemies on their trail, first the US government who has kept a lid on news of visiting aliens for decades and they're represented by hardnosed bureaucrat, Ciaran Hinds. They've also got a robot assassin on their trail, just as deadly as Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator without any of his wit and charm. In addition Johnson's trying to steer clear of some wiseguys for whom he worked as a wheelman and did time in prison for same.They do get some help in the form of scientist Carla Gugino who proves to be resourceful in her own right.The kids here are as winning as Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards who starred in the two Witch Mountain features back in the Seventies. They have a good chemistry with the Rock and with Gugino.I'd recommend Race To Witch Mountain as a fine family film, one of the better items to come from the Magic Kingdom.",Race to Witch Mountain
2,Leofwine_draca,Lacks charm,4,23 December 2019,"RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is an ill-advised Disney remake of its own successful children's franchise of the 1970s, but of course in the modern era you get car chases, speedy editing, and a random tacked-on alien soldier monster who goes around blowing stuff up. Inevitably, along the way in this Hollywood version of the familiar story, the old sparkle and magic is lost somewhere en route. Not that it's a particularly bad film, just rather generic. The actors are generally adequate, from Dwayne Johnson to Ciaran Hinds' baddie, but they all play very hackneyed roles in a script that always comes second to more CGI and more spectacle. Stick with the original.",Race to Witch Mountain
3,SnoopyStyle,Michael Bay wannabe not for kids,5,8 January 2014,"Jack Bruno (Dwayne Johnson) is a Las Vegas cabbie who finds two strange siblings (AnnaSophia Robb, Alexander Ludwig) one morning in his car out of nowhere. They are hounded by evil government agents almost immediately. After many alien and government attacks, the trio escapes and enlists the help of UFO expert Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino).It's a Michael Bay wannabe. It's too dark for a kids movie. There's too much violence. It's edited like 'Armageddon'. The action comes one after another. I'm surprised they don't have blood splattering everywhere. They certainly blow enough stuff up. I'm not sure how many bribes it took to get the PG rating. The problem is that it occupies an area where the adults can't take it seriously, and the kids really shouldn't be watching.",Race to Witch Mountain
4,Prismark10,Aliens to go home,5,18 August 2017,"Race to Witch Mountain is a remake that relies much on Dwayne Johnson and Cara Gugino's charm. It is an exciting if bland Disney adventure with too many cardboard characterizations.Johnson is Jack Bruno, a Las Vegas cab driver with a shady past. Some mob figures are after him and he knows how to drive fast.When two kids suddenly appear in the back of his cab wanting Jack to drive them somewhere and offering him a lot of money to do it. The boy and girl are in fact aliens with special abilities, before long they are pursued by government agents and an intergalactic cyborg.Jack teams up with Dr Friedman (Gugino) and has to get the two aliens to Witch Mountain and onto their stranded spacecraft while evading their pursuers.The film is thrilling enough to keep the kids entertained but it is also slightly anodyne. Film director Garry Marshall makes a cameo appearance as an alien conspiracy theorist.",Race to Witch Mountain
5,claudio_carvalho,Delightful Family Entertainment,7,1 August 2009,"In Las Vegas, the regenerated ex-con Jack Bruno (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) works as taxi driver. During an UFO Convention at Planet Hollywood, the skeptical Jack picks up Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), who will present a scientific lecture in the event. Then he is pressed by two henchmen of his former boss, the criminal Wolff, that wants to talk to him, but Jack does not want to return to the crime life. Jack fights and gets rid of them; out of the blue, he finds two teenagers on the backseat of his cab. They tell that they are siblings, Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig), and they need to travel to a location outside Las Vegas in the middle of nowhere. Meanwhile the government finds a spacecraft that crashed nearby Las Vegas and is chasing the two aliens; after the investigation of the men of Henry Burke (Ciaran Hinds), they discover that the two siblings are the aliens. Jack Bruno, Sara and Seth are chased by Henry Burke's team and by the ""Syphon"", a killer from outer space that has been sent to kill them by the military of their planet that want to invade Earth. Sara and Seth explain that they traveled to Earth to collect scientific data of an experiment and save Earth from invasion, but they need to return immediately to their planet. Jack teams up with Dr. Alex to retrieve their spacecraft in a secret base in the Witch Mountain.""Race to Witch Mountain"" is a typical movie from Disney, i.e., a delightful family entertainment. The story is predictable and uses the usual clichés of the genre, with the heart-warming hero; the despicable villain; the chase and the car race; the corny conclusion after the first contact; despite of that, I liked ""Race to Witch Mountain"" a lot. The pleasant cast performs enjoyable characters, and I particularly like The Rock, AnnaSophia Robb and Carla Gugino very much; only the boy Alexander Ludwig is unknown for me. I do not understand why some masochistic viewers that do not like this type of movie waste their time watching them and then write bad reviews; what would they expect? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Montanha Enfeitiçada"" (""The Bewitched Mountain"")",Race to Witch Mountain
6,kosmasp,Rock climbs a mountain,6,15 August 2009,"Dwayne Johnson is so much more than a brow. The guy has charisma and he has an on screen presence that is really exciting. He is even able to elevate movies. Where Vin Diesel struggled with kids movies, Dwayne seems as relaxed with that, as he is with his action movies. Acting-wise he hasn't been challenged yet, but I think he will even hurdle that obstacle with ease.There is not that much story here, but I went into the movie completely unprepared to what would happen. I thought this was a race movie (because of the title). Well I was apparently wrong, but it was nice to explore the movie, while watching it. It made the clichés more bearable. Plus Carla G. adds a nice flavor to the whole thing too. It's nice, it's funny, it's family entertainment.",Race to Witch Mountain
7,jboothmillard,Race to Witch Mountain,6,7 February 2014,"I had seen Escape to Witch Mountain from 1975, and the sequel Return from Witch Mountain, and even the dreadful 1995 TV remake of Escape to..., but it was interesting to see Disney making another more modern version, from director Andy Fickman (She's the Man, The Game Plan). Basically an alien spaceship crashes near Searchlight, Nevada, over one hundred miles from Las Vegas, Henry Burke (Ciarán Hinds) leads a secret Defense Department unit to seize the ship and take the passengers, but none are found. Former criminal Jack Bruno (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) has turned his life around and works as a cab driver, one of his passengers on this night is failed scientist Dr. Alex Friedman (Spy Kids' Carla Gugino) who is attending a UFO convention at Planet Hollywood, and Jack no longer wants to accept jobs with the mob. Two teenagers, Sara (Bridge to Terabithia's AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig), get in the cab are paying him a high fare of $15,000 to head in a particular direction, no given destination, Bruno assumes the government agents following the cab are more mob, he avoids them with his driving skills, and Seth uses his ability to vary his molecular density to allow their escape. The teenagers explain that they are are aliens that look human and have advanced abilities that people on Earth have not discovered yet, including telekinesis, telepathy and varying molecular density, and finding an abandoned house he sees them retrieve a device they will need for their ship, and they are again pursued Burke's agents, as well as powerful armoured alien assassin Siphon (Tom Woodruff, Jr.), but they manage to avoid them and carry on. Bruno takes Sara and Seth to Dr. Alex Friedman, she realises she is what she has been theorising on for some time, she joins the group, the teenagers explain their world is three thousand light years from Earth, despite the idea being unpopular their government plan to invade the planet so that their race can survive, their parents were experimenting to find a way to survive without invading Earth but were arrested before completing, so the teenagers went to Earth to find the successful findings, to save both Earth and their race they must return to their world in their spaceship. Fellow UFOlogist and conspiracy theorist Dr. Donald Harlan (Garry Marshall, director of Pretty Woman) helps telling the group that the spaceship was taken to Witch Mountain, a secret government base in California, they arrive there but are captured and the teenagers are knocked out to be surgically experimented on, and meanwhile the Siphon attacks the soldiers, while Bruno and Friedman get back into the base and save the teenagers. Sara and Seth launch their ship and escape Witch Mountain through the tunnels, the Siphon is finally killed by the high voltage energy from the ship core, once landed the teenagers give Brun and Friedman a tracking device son they always know where to find them, they wish them a tearful farewell and return home with hope they rebuild it somehow, in the end Bruno and Frideman become successful authors with their book about their experience, and as they leave the device activates, this suggests the humanoid alien teenagers may be returning. Also starring Tom Everett Scott as Matheson, Chris George Marquette as Pope, Kim Richards as Tina, Ike Eisenmann as Sheriff Antony and Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Eddie. Johnson isn't the best at acting but proves a good enough being surprised and a hero, Robb and Ludwig putting on British accents and speaking perfect English sentences are likable, the story is simple enough for all the family, and assisted by terrific special effects, a few explosions and cool chase sequences it is moderately exciting, an enjoyable science- fiction adventure fantasy. Good!",Race to Witch Mountain
8,Tweekums,Solid Disney Sci-fi,7,21 March 2019,"Jack Bruno is a Las Vegas cabbie trying to go straight after earlier troubles with the law. It isn't easy as former criminal associates don't want him to retire and it only gets tougher when two teenagers, Sara and Seth, turn up in the back of his cab. They aren't ordinary teens though; they are aliens whose space ship crashed in the desert. They also have special powers; Sara is a telepath with telekinetic abilities and Seth can alter his molecular density, enabling him to pass through objects or stop bullets. The US Military now have their ship and are searching for them; that isn't all; an alien assassin is also hunting them. Jack drives them out of Vegas and after various events learns the truth about them and why they are on Earth. They need to get back to their ship if their planet is to be saved and an invasion of Earth averted... it won't be easy though.Given that this is a PG rated film from Disney one shouldn't expect intense action or a high degree of threat. That doesn't mean it is boring though; it just means it can be enjoyed by all the family. The story is fairly simple, without major twists which suits the target audience. Dwayne Johnson is solid as Jack; he plays the role straight, never dumbing down because it is a child-friendly movie; teens AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig are good as Sara and Seth and Ciarán Hinds is solid as Henry Burke, the military man after them, despite the character being far from original. There is a decent amount of action, much of it enhanced with high quality special effects. Overall I'd say this is a solid sci-fi adventure; it made a refreshing change to have such a film that didn't feature material to bump it up to a '12' Certificate.",Race to Witch Mountain

The two children with mysterious powers played by Alexander Ludwig and Anne Rob are enjoyable and The Rock is likable as tough and agreeable ex-convict cabbie . The picture results to be a modern remake of ¨Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)¨ and sequel ¨Return from Witch mountain (1978)¨ by John Hough but quite different , as the pursuer was a millionaire played by Ray Milland who wanted to use their powers for his own aims and in recent version is performed by Ciaran Hinds as government agent . As homage to former adaptation appears the children Kim Richards as Sara and Ike Isenmann as sheriff in a brief roles . Furthermore , the movie contains a colorful cinematography by Gardiner and moving musical score by Trevor Ravin . A good children's film with impressive special effects . The motion picture is professionally directed by Andy Fickman though with no originality because being a simple remake .",Race to Witch Mountain
10,moonspinner55,A prime example of what has gone wrong within the Disney organization...,1,8 September 2010,"Two teenagers from outer space enlist the aid of a Las Vegas cab driver to help them escape from an intergalactic assassin as well as a secret organization hoping to harness the kids' extraordinary powers for their own gain. 1975's modest fantasy ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" wasn't a blockbuster, however it made a good deal of money for the Disney Studios and has held up over the years simply by virtue of its charm. This rethinking of the story is full of slam-bang action and wise-ass exclamations (practically directed straight at the camera for that instant audience rapport), yet it is completely disposable. All the money has been sunk into the special effects and car smash-ups, leaving the characters and the script wanting. This is a committee picture by design, and every decision--from the casting down to the bulldozing laugh-lines in the script--has been made with both eyes on the box-office. Dwayne Johnson does about as well as can be expected with this lackluster material, yet his inefficiency at comic exasperation is matched only by the illogical nature of his impatient cabbie (whose vested interest in the goings-on isn't even questioned). The film is so clumsy, so inept, it fails even to introduce the two children (ostensibly the focal point of the story) with any care or foresight. Since the people on-screen do not emerge as anything other than running targets, the only thing holding the viewers' attention is the over-amplified noise. This isn't a movie, it's a distraction. NO STARS from ****",Race to Witch Mountain
11,paul_haakonsen,Fun for the family...,6,29 December 2015,"This is a Walt Disney movie in the very essence of the meaning. As such, this is a movie that is suitable for the entire family. Watching it as an adult with no kids around, then chances are that you will find this movie to be too family-friendly.The story is about a taxi driver in Las Vegas who find two teenagers in the back of his taxi. These teenagers claim to be from outer Space, and as things become turbulent around every corner, taxi driver Jack Bruno starts to think that there might be something to the extraterrestrial claims.There is a lot of action and adventure in ""Race to Witch Mountain"", but it is done in a manner that allows even a younger audience to watch the movie as well. And the storyline is fast paced and has a good continuous flow to it.The effects in the movie were good, and the visual effects department did a good job in bringing the movie to life on the screen.While this isn't Dwayne Johnson's best movie, it is still fun and entertaining for the family to watch.",Race to Witch Mountain
12,tavm,Race to Witch Mountain was an okay update on a couple of Disney hits from the '70s,6,18 March 2009,"Having seen and enjoyed both Escape to Witch Mountain and Return from Witch Mountain as a double feature during the late '70s at the Broadmoor twin Theatre back then, I decided to give this new one starring Dwayne Johnson a shot especially when I read that the original kids-Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann-would make cameos. This version takes place in Las Vegas during a sci-fi convention where cab driver Johnson takes passenger Dr. Alex Frideman (Carla Gugino) to. As he goes further down the desert, two kids-Seth (Alexander Ludwig) and sister Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) stow in his car and ask to be taken far away. From here is where you get some plot points of the original Witch Mountain. Not bad and there are some amusing touches like Meredith Salenger playing a reporter with a very familiar name not to mention that those original Witch Mountain kids-now grown up-provide some speculation with the roles they play here of their, and this, movie's connection. And then there's Garry Marshall as...well, watch the movie. So in summation, while no great shakes, Race to Witch Mountain is fast paced in a pretty entertaining way.",Race to Witch Mountain

As the agents go to the crash site the aliens, looking like blonde teenagers, end up in Las Vegas where they get into a cab driven by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Of course the kids are tracked and the chase is on.Okay, here's a film that is as clichéd as they come and yet it works. I was Groaning during the set up scenes as every bad scifi cliché was hit. We've been here how many times...and then some where about the time Johnson shows up it all comes together in such a manner so as to say ""Yea you've seen this but come anyway because the ride is fun"". and it is. Its like riding the sister roller-coaster of your favorite one. Sure you know how its going to go but you don't care because you're having fun.High art it ain't. Real fun it is. Whats especially nice is the references to the first two films that include cameos and knowing nods (the camper).Honestly normally I loath the blatant promise of a sequel for a film doesn't need one, but in this case I'm actually looking forward to the implied second film, especially if they can make it as fun as this.Give this a shot.

15,view_and_review,"Aliens Good, Government Bad",4,27 July 2021,"Benign aliens that just want to ""go home"" are being pursued by the government. Sound familiar? Even if the parallels to ""E. T."" aren't that many, this movie is still like so many other movies about aliens/supernatural beings. They always have to have an uber-nemesis and usually the U. S. Government is the only adequate, yet so inept, choice.In this predictable and cheesy feature that's a bad remake of the 1975 Disney movie ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" taxi driver, and obvious hero, Jack Bruno (Dwayne Johnson) picks up two aliens who look like human children. Seth and Sarah (Alexander Ludwig and AnnaSophia Robb) are siblings from another planet that crashed landed on Earth and need to find their ship. Jack, with the help of failed astrophysicist Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), helped the two kids elude the government as well as an intergalactic bounty hunter (think ""Terminator"" or ""Predator"") to get them back to their ship. Between the bad CGI, the weak dialog, and cartoonish action this movie wasn't racing anywhere except to the dumpster.",Race to Witch Mountain

Carla Gugino joins in the fun, Ciaran Hinds gives the rather one-note spook boss more colour than the script does, and AnnaSophia Robb is as winsome as ever.

It just happens, with some decent effects, an endearing performance from Johnson, a cut price Predator, and two kids that are not very annoying. It's the kind of film that you don't really have to concentrate on, just sit back and watch the show. The narration is okay, the story is just there to assist the set pieces and the cringe worthy jokes, and the film is all bright and happy in a way that only Disney can do.It does hark back to the live action films Disney made in the seventies, but that isn't really compliment.",Race to Witch Mountain
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Race to Witch Mountain,7,14 March 2009,"If aliens exist, and if they have access to the films made from Earth, they would likely make a mental note to remind themselves that should they visit our planet on terms other than a hostile takeover or annihilation, to avoid landing in the USA at all costs. Hollywood has enough dough to continuously churn out effects laden science-fiction movies, and most of them are big budgeted action fests like Independence Day and Men In Black, which don't exactly paint a good picture of the extra-terrestrials. Aliens who have more benign intent, would be frightened by how trigger happy and violence prone the US is toward illegal aliens, even if popular culture meant the landing zone for extra terrestrials is the USA and not other larger countries.Race to Witch Mountain being Disney fare means the toning down of practically everything to ensure that it is safe for the entire family to experience together. Dwayne Johnson seems right at home in family friendly flicks like The Game Plan (also directed by Andy Fickman), and I guess his action days on screen will be few and far between, especially when he gets to flaunt his dramatic and comedic flair. Woe is the fan boy like me who have grown up with The Rock, but there's no more people's eyebrow, and we should start to get used to seeing our idol in a different light on celluloid.Johnson plays a Las Vegas cab driver Jack Bruno who has a colourful past that he tries to bury, in order to earn an honest living to buy his dream Mustang featured in the Steve McQueen movie Bullit. In a confluence of the stars he picks up a scientist who specializes in extra terrestrials, before chancing onto two of them when they boarded his cab without his knowledge. The brother and ssister aliens  Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alenxander Ludwig)  are here on a noble mission, and are in hot pursuit by the shady government agents led by Henry Burke (Ciaran Hinds) as well as something like a Terminator from many light years away.This naturally gives rise to your standard set action sequences where we get to see the alien twins exercise their rather innocent demeanour (""they're only kids!"") to their advantage, behind which hides the immense powers they possess such as Telepathy and Density manipulation, which I thought was a very cool power to have. Imagine being able to pass through walls, yet having tremendous strength in the form of a road block, literally. AnnaSophia Robb whom I felt did a fantastic job in The Bridge to Terabithia, stars as the female child, and because of her character's ability, she brings forth a more trusting, and empathetic character, in direct contrast to the other alien Seth (The Seeker from The Dark is Rising is all grown up now), who's more direct, commanding, aloof and untrusting of humans in general, no doubt their initial experience was in having their space ship confiscated to Witch Mountain, and being chased for the conduct of experiments.Carla Gugino, last seen as the aged Silk Spectre in Watchmen, got active only in the last third of the show, which was somewhat of a pity because she shared great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and got involved quite late into the thick of things. But of course if there's any consolation, like how the bits during the end credits would suggest, and depending on the box office results, there might be room for more in a sequel, if it comes. There are references galore in the film given that there's a science-fiction convention event featured in the movie, and you can't help but also think about the potential for theme park rides with the yellow cab being pursued and pretty banged up. In fact I was wondering each time the cab got put through an action sequence, that it would make for a great 4D ride in Disneyland. You can't help it because it was quite in your face, with the sequences designed in that manner, deliberately or otherwise.Despite some glaring plot loopholes, Race to Witch Mountain has all the ingredients for a great family outing. The story doesn't try to be more intellectual than it can handle, and doesn't let the special effects run wild and take over everything else. For being such a sentimental fool, the ending also got some brownie points from me, as it's tough not to shed a tear or two given the trials and tribulations from which a solid bond is formed amongst all the characters. Recommended for a family outing, but don't go expecting something out of this world (pun not intended), as everything's pretty formula.",Race to Witch Mountain

This one is about kids, aliens, alien kids, dogs, The Rock and evil cardboard government agents and alien clone assassins.I thought it was fun enough. Completely predictable, of course, but also fun, which is what these movies are all about. I like Dwayne Johnson and I really think he could do better as an actor.

20,namashi_1,Adventurous!!,7,2 August 2009,"Andy Fickman is a good filmmaker... I really liked 'The Game Plan' and I enjoyed 'Race To Witch Mountain' as well. Author Alexander Key's 1968 novel Escape to Witch Mountain sure must have been a rage at that time. I haven't seen the 1975 version, but I must say, I repeat, this one's a quite good flick. Don't think of watching an EPIC when you tune in 'Race To Witch Mountain', this film promises to entertain, and it does! A catchy script, with good execution doesn't disappoint the viewer! Another reason I enjoyed the flick is because, it stars my all-time favorite Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, who's the ultimate Rockstar and a WWE Legend.Summing up the review, Get this straight: 'Race To Witch Mountain' is escapist Cinema at its very best.

22,thesar-2,Speed Racer??,3,21 March 2009,"I am an avid movie watcher, a lover of the cinema. And the very first movie I can recall seeing, ever, was 'Escape to Witch Mountain' back in the 70s sometime, at a Kodak ""family"" day  my parents worked for Kodak in Rochester, NY and they had us all watch this movie on a big screen in the basketball stadium. So, I thought it fitting, that for my 35th birthday, I would go see the re-imagining of that film: 'Race to Witch Mountain.' I sure did love that original movie when I was a child. I could relate with the boy in the film and imagine myself as him and sister (I, too, have 1 sister/sibling.) Unfortunately, you get none of the magic in this update. You do get two kids who know they are aliens, an ex-con-turned-straight cabbie who befriends them and a bounty hunter out for them. These are all new to the 2009 film. In fact, very little is transferred from the original to this, other than the fact there's two alien kids who can use telekinesis, a mobile home and a place called ""witch mountain."" I give Disney kudos for making another kid/family friendly film void of language, sex, drugs and nudity. Unfortunately, they erased any of the adventure of the original and added a boat-load of violence along with an unusually bad performance of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who nearly killed the film with bad acting and dialogue. 'Race' is not an appropriate term, much as 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' was in 1997 as neither contained any sort of speed. Not recommended, though not a horrible film. It's just that the original was so much more entertaining and wholesome. Might be great for the 10-14 year old male crowd, but avoidable for the rest.",Race to Witch Mountain
23,bensonmum2,"""Don't go in the pimped out fridge Jack...""",7,23 August 2009,"We hadn't had a family movie night at our house in several months. So when the idea came up, I naturally let my 6 year-old pick the movie (I, on the other hand, picked the pizza.) His pick – Race to Witch Mountain. I'll be honest, neither my wife nor I were terribly excited about his selection. As we popped it into the player, we both settled in fearing for the worst. Instead, the whole family had a great time with the film. It's not a masterpiece, but I don't think that's what the filmmakers were going for. Instead, Race to Witch Mountain fun-filled ride full of special effects and loud explosions thrown at the viewer at break-neck speeds. There are really very few opportunities to catch your breath, which is probably a good thing. If you spent too long analyzing just what's going on on-screen, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable. The plot involves Jack Bruno, a cab driver trying to make a break from a shady past, who discovers two kids in the back of his cab. As he soon learns, these aren't ordinary kids. These kids are aliens (the outer space kind) and they're on a mission to save not only their planet, but Earth as well. Howver, it seems that everyone is after Jack and the kids. Secret government agents, Jack's former crime boss, and an unstoppable alien assassin are all out to make sure the kids don't find their ship. Sure, it lacks some of what made the 1975 original (which I don't think I've seen since 1975) so memorable, but it makes up for it with some terrific CGI effects, humor, and outrageous action sequences. The acting was okay. No one looked terrible. Dwayne Johnson, whose wrestling persona The Rock seems to be a distant memory these days, isn't too bad. He's definitely got a screen presence to him. The rest of the cast is fine. My son especially enjoyed Carla Gugino who he immediately recognized from the Spy Kids series. There are a few really cool cameos from the likes of Cheech Marin. But the absolute coolest for an old guy like me was seeing Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann, the kids from the original Escape to Witch Mountain, with bit parts in this re-imaging. So overall, we enjoyed Race to Witch Mountain. Go into it with an open mind (and a good pizza) and you're family just might find a wonderful night's entertainment like we did.",Race to Witch Mountain
24,bowmanblue,Fast-paced sci-fi family action,7,23 August 2014,"The Rock, or 'Dwayne Johnson' as he's now known, is a down on his luck cabbie in Las Vegas, that is until he accidentally picks up two young alien children who happen to be looking for a ride home. Unfortunately, his taxi doesn't go into space, but he vows to help them get back to their ship. Naturally, those shady Government agents have other plans and set out to thwart them.If you could imagine The X-films, but on at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, then you're sort of in the right area, only 'Race to Witch Mountain' has more chases than Scully and Mulder normally have to get through. In fact, the first half of the film is pretty much one long chase. Therefore, when the film takes its foot off the pedal (so to speak) mid way through, the paces feels like it's slowed dramatically, which is a downside, but simply because the beginning has been so fast.But, don't worry, there are more chases and action to come - With Mountain isn't an easy place to just walk into, so Dwayne's punching and kicking skills will be tested to the limit as he has to fend off not only the U.S. Government, but also an alien bounty hunter.This is family fun. There's nothing new here, but it's one of those rare action films that the whole family can sit down and enjoy.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Race to Witch Mountain

It was just plain silly. Using all these video feeds all over Vegas, just not possible. And if these alien kids had all these powers, there is no way they would get caught. And if Seth was indestructible, like when he let the SUV hit him and it smashed up the SUV, why didn't he just take care of all the FBI agents tracking them to begin with.The Rock was OK in this, but he really needs to pick better movie scripts. And why does he keep doing kids' films? FINAL VERDICT: I only recommend it for kids around 12. Otherwise, if you don't fall into its target audience, I'd skip it.",Race to Witch Mountain

I'll be the one to say he did a great job here.This is about a taxi driver who ends up with two aliens in his taxi disguised as kids and they want him to drive them back to their spaceship so they can leave.The special effects are very good especially for a kids-friendly Disney film.

Surprisingly enough, Race to Witch Mountain Managed to exceed my expectations thanks to some wise casting, and enjoyable action scenes in this movie. Dwayne Johnson's undeniable charisma serves this movie well, and I enjoyed the kid actors more then I did in the original. Favorite two scenes have to be where Dwayne takes them to hide out at a restaurant, and the taxi chase scene. It's far from perfect, but it's really a decent little family movie.Performances. Dwayne Johnson is at his charismatic best here. I've whined in the past about him relegating himself to Disney movies, but let's face it. He's fantastic in them. He carries the movie with his swagger and charm, and I loved his performance. Carla Gugino is very easy on the eyes and a credible actress to boot. Her chemistry with Dwayne seemed very natural. Alexander Ludwig and AnnaSophia Robb are likable as the kids, and show decent poise for there age set. Ciaran Hinds is decent as the villain.Bottom line. I quite enjoyed this one for what it was. Dwayne has a solid career ahead of him, and dare I say this is better then the supposed classic original? I personally feel it is. Give it a whirl!6 ½ /10",Race to Witch Mountain
28,tabuno,A Decent if Not Very Original Movie,6,20 January 2019,"18 March 2009. A few weak special effects, especially the the helicopters at the beginning of the movie and a few actually slow or emotional not engaging scenes where it appeared the music attempted to carry on the movie's appeal. Perhaps, this movie is a victim of continuing advances in technology which this movie fails to retain that current edge and feels somewhat imitative. The whole movie felt derivative with nothing particularly new. Instead this movie brings together a whole number of old cliques and reworks them to bring another version of Witch Mountain. The best and most intriguing feature of this movie were the children who came across as literally the most refreshing character(s) of the movie. The dialogue and acting were almost spot on as alien children. The comedy and Dwayne Johnson continued his usual antics with some impact. Overall, just when the movie seemed to run out of interesting scenes or overused plot devices, the scriptwriters came to the rescue at the last minute virtually almost every time to provide some resemblance if not fantastic logical and reasonable explanation to keep the story acceptable. This usually entertaining movie had its moments, but nothing except the children stood out. 6 out of 10 Stars.",Race to Witch Mountain

I never expected it to be this action-packed, though! The film can pride itself on some excellent action sequences and fantastic visuals and photography.A very good score helps to drive the film. It is fast-paced and action-packed to satisfy the most discerning action palate. I thoroughly enjoyed Dwayne Johnson here, adding humor, charm and muscle where it is most needed. Carla Gugino's character, Dr Alex Friendman, was for most part comical, but nevertheless still enjoyable. The kids' dialogue was a bit annoying, but probably done to distinguish them more clearly from the rest of the...well, humans.There were quite a number of conveniences, but heck, this was a lot of fun and the incredible action scenes compensated where the script lacked. It was actually better (and more enjoyable) than expected.",Race to Witch Mountain
30,Floated2,It was alright,6,7 August 2009,"I decided to give this movie starring Dwayne Johnson a shot especially when I read that the original kids-Kim Richards. This version takes place in Las Vegas during a sci-fi convention where cab driver Johnson takes passenger Dr. Alex Frideman (Carla Gugino) to. As he goes further down the desert, two kids-Seth (Alexander Ludwig) and sister Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) show in his car and ask to be taken far away. From here is really when the action and amusement happens. There are some real nice scenes with action and some funny parts. Some bad things about this movie is that it seemed kinda rushed, and the camera work was annoying (It was barely still throughout the movie). It was also weird how Sarah and Seth spoke. The movie also seemed sort of childish. So in summation, while no great shakes, Race to Witch Mountain is fast paced in a pretty entertaining way.6/10",Race to Witch Mountain

32,DarkVulcan29,"Alright, but not a totally great Disney film.",5,23 March 2009,"I liked the idea, that this is not a remake of the Disney classic Escape to Witch Mountain(1975), it's more of a rebooted version. Some remakes try to be carbon copies of the original, like Pyscho(1998), and The Bad News Bears(2005). This films premise is sort of the same but others ways different.The story begins in Las Vegas, where Jack Bruno(Dwayne Johnson) is a cab driver, and is really not a people person. But one day things change, when two siblings named Seth(Alexander Ludwig) and Sara(Annasophia Robb) enter his cab ask him to drive to a certain location, and they give him large sums of money. Jack is hesitant, but does it anyway. But then things are not so simply, when the government starts chasing them. Turns out these kids are aliens with special powers, that need to get to a certain location called Witch Mountain in hopes to prevent an alien invasion that could destroy earth. And a famed scientist(Carla Gugino) comes along for the ride.Now the moments between Dwayne and the kids are memorable. But the rest of the film kind of falls on itself. The action and effects where alright but nothing you'd call spectacular. Carla Gugino I felt by watching that she was written in at the last minute,cause they wanted a beautiful actress for Dwayne play off of, but Dwayne and Carla have no chemistry. And she does not look like she is having any fun doing this, she is just in it to cash a paycheck. And so was the rest of the cast, besides Dwayne and the kids. I didn't know when too laugh at times, I mean there times it was funny, other I couldn't tell at times if they where trying to be funny or serious for some scenes.",Race to Witch Mountain
33,dee.reid,"A fun ""Race to Witch Mountain""",7,1 November 2009,"Andy Fickman's ""Race to Witch Mountain,"" a 2009 update of the classic Disney movie ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" - which I haven't seen - is a fun ride, even if it lacks the sophistication of classic Disney flicks, and abides by slick, big-budget 2009 Hollywood standards. What makes this movie work, at least to me, is Dwayne Johnson, having finally shed ""The Rock"" from his name, and shows that he does have what it takes to be a leading man with some rather strong acting chops.With that said, I'm actually quite positive that he is on his way to becoming a bankable action movie star, and kiddie action hero. Here, he stars as Jack Bruno, a Las Vegas cab driver who picks up two mysterious adolescents - Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig) - who pay him 15 grand to drive them out to the middle of nowhere. What follows next is a series of excellently staged car chases and action sequences that brings the disbelieving Jack Bruno face-to-face with the reality that the universe is really a whole lot bigger than he imagined it could be.I'm sure you already know the twist with Sara and Seth: they're aliens, on a mission to save their dying home planet, while being chased by a hulking extraterrestrial assassin that looks like a cross between the Predator and RoboCop. And a shady government organization wants to use Sara and Seth's extraordinary paranormal powers for their own nefarious purposes. Along the way, Jack and the kids also seek help from Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), a UFO expert in town attending a UFO convention at Planet Hollywood.Having never seen the original film nor read Alexander Key's book ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (the original source of both films), I can only judge what has been put before me. ""Race to Witch Mountain"" is an excellent family film that has been easily geared toward family audiences, even though I do question this movie's hard violence, which I'm actually quite surprised didn't get this movie a higher rating. But I guess since it's all bloodless pop violence and a Disney movie to boot, the censors were willing to give it a pass.""Race to Witch Mountain"" is just a fun ride, even if it takes some time to get going. But once it does, it fires heavily on all cylinders. ""Race to Witch Mountain"" is a lot smarter than you would have it, being that it's a Disney movie and all, and I long ago gave up on putting the words ""smart"" and ""Disney"" in the same sentence. Dwayne Johnson is one of the smarter Hollywood muscle-men out there. His predecessors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone unfortunately made a lot of unwise choices outside the ultra-violent Hollywood action movie market and trying to expand their talents into family-oriented pictures.Dwayne Johnson seems to be making an easier transition to kiddie flicks that can sometimes make better use of his acting talents, and he can act, in addition to kick butt in a friendly, ""PG""-rated manner, and deliver some occasionally funny one-liners. He also seems like a nice guy, too. The movie also makes no attempt to cover up the fact that his character here is basically a thug who has done time in prison, and is now trying to go straight - seeing his mission to help out Sara Seth as his chance at redemption, and a classic 1968 Ford Mustang (like the one Steve McQueen drove in ""Bullitt""). See what I mean when I say I'm surprised the MPAA let this movie get by with a ""PG"" rating?If you have a heart for Disney action flicks - I haven't completely given up on Disney flicks, yet - ""Race to Witch Mountain"" is a fun ride, no more, no less. I'm sure this is one ""Race"" I'll want to take at least one more time.7/10",Race to Witch Mountain

This kind of adventure plot where the adult character protects younger characters, let them be aliens, foreigners or other kind of situations, and go through all kinds of things where the movie eventually ends happily with the ones being protected get to safety, is really a plot too often done in the more mature action movies, particularly those of secret agent movies. It even comes complete with the side plot of having government agencies chase after them beside the actual bad guys. Sadly, besides having Dwayne Johnson, this movie doesn't really bring any new stuff to the table. On the adventure side, particularly the alien movie side, which is in itself has become kind of a culture; this movie only repeats all the recipe of previous alien and kid movie. The acting overall is just a standard work, particularly so because this movie has Dwayne Johnson in it.

With the help of Dr. Alex Friedman, the trio travels to Witch Mountain, a secret government outpost in the Nevada desert, with the hopes of evading their pursuers and sending Sara and Seth home--and saving Earth in the process.I would like to note that I have not seen the original film. RTWM is a sci-fi action flick which seems to be targeted to kids below the age of, I don't know, nine and below. However, I was surprised the tone of the film was a little more darker and mature than what usually comes from kid's movies these days, especially with the opening credits which gives a vibe of the BOURNE series. RTWM is the final product of what Paul Greengrass would have made if he were to make a PG rated BOURNE movie, action and pacing wise.This is a good thing because the movie will entertain both the adults and kids for a couple of hours. It's a roller coaster ride because the action starts right from the beginning, pulling the audience into a world filled with hyper kinetic cuts and a fast moving score playing throughout the movie. The film has little time to fully develop each character, but it doesn't need to because a couple of minutes is all we need to get a basic idea of who these characters are.RTWM knows its goal and does it with so much eccentric energy and fun that you forgive its implausibilities. The action sequences are really well done, although there are some uses of the shaky cam in which we usually see in most action movies these days. The visual effects is mixed, some parts which is really well done while other parts which seem too cartoonish and fake. Dwayne Johnson brings some charm into this film with his funny and sympathetic role. The kids, AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig, also do a well job as the alien visitors.RTWM is a film that knows exactly where its heading and what to do. The film is very enjoyable with its highly octane non-stop action sequences, along with its many explosions, although I think it should be PG-13. The MPAA is too lenient with Disney movies, don't you agree? The film is also supported with its strong performances by the three main leads and by the end, you may be a bit disoriented and confused, but you know the ride was fun.

41,IonicBreezeMachine,Escape to Witch Mountain is given the post Transformers blockbuster treatment making a serviceable chase film anchored by a good comic performance by Dwayne Johnson,6,30 October 2021,"Jack Bruno (Dwayne Johnson) is a hardscrabble cynic working as a cab driver in Las Vegas following a previous stint as a wheelman for the mob. Two children Sara and Seth (AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig) appear in Jack's cab and offer him a large amount of money to drive them to a specific point in the middle of the desert. Eventually Jack learns that Sara and Seth are aliens who have come to Earth seeking to stop and invasion by their people and save both their home world as well as Earth. Jack becomes the two's reluctant protector and along with astrophysicist Dr. Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino) must try to find a way to get the kids back to their home planet while contending with a shadowy government agency run by agent Burke (Ciarán Hinds) as well as a biologically engineered extraterrestrial assassin called a Siphon.Published in 1968, Alexander Key's science-fiction adventure novel, Escape to Witch Mountain, has been revisited for adaptation a few times by the Walt Disney Company. With the success of the first adaptation in 1975 Escape to Witch Mountain, it's success lead to a sequel Return from Witch Mountain in 1978, an aborted TV pilot in 1982 that while it never went to series did appear on The Wonderful World of Disney as a one off, and a TV movie remake in 1995. Development began on a theatrical remake in 2001 but entered development hell. Following the success Dwayne Johnson and director Andy Fickman experienced with the sleeper hit The Game Plan, the remake regained momentum as a reteam for Fickman and Johnson. Much like how the '75 film drew from paranoid thrillers and supernatural children that permeated much of fiction at the time, and the '95 film drew from genre sci-fi/fantasy TV like Twin Peaks, Quantum Leap, or Eerie, Indiana, this reimagining is very much inspired by the post Michael Bay Transformers blockbuster era with the likes of Eagle Eye, Jumper or the Keanu Reeves fronted remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Much like those films, Race to Witch Mountain is a loud energized exercise in CGI bombast but thanks to a quick pace and a solid turn from Dwayne Johnson, it's an enjoyable exercise in CGI bombast.Johnson is really good playing a hardscrabble cynic who's just trying to get through the day making an honest living despite his old life refusing to leave him be. He approaches every day with an acerbic level of humor but isn't afraid to let fists fly if pushed into a corner. Despite at this point in his career not headlining action films as many expected (thanks to the box office bombs of The Rundown and Walking Tall) we can still see that A-lister potential in Johnson's performance that would define his career with his reintroduction to the public in Fast Five 2 years later. AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig are good playing the children in this incarnation who unlike previous incarnations are aware of their alien heritage from the get go and take an almost Starman-esque approach to the characters, I honestly liked the idea of them being unfamiliar with Earth in a similar manner, but unlike Jeff Bridges in Starman or Michael Rennie in the 1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still it's not really used to much effect and outside of the opening few minutes the children pretty much know how everything works. This results in the kids feeling more like macguffins than actual characters and they're often overshadowed by Johnson who's given more inner turmoil and character to play against while the kids can basically be boiled down to Seth is distrustful of humans and Sara has more faith in them.The writing is pretty standard for this kind of chase movie with co-writer Mark Bomback brining the same breakneck speed he brought to Live Free or Die Hard and the following year's Tony Scott film Unstoppable. Despite the PG rating there are some good chase and action sequences with Johnson more than capable in selling them, and the special effects by Alec Gillis and Amalgamated Dynamics are quite well done with a mixture of CGI and practical effects with an alien outpost looking fairly impressive and the Siphon assassin a well-constructed costume with intimidating features (especially in the finale). The movie does a good job of updating itself to the post 9/11 world with mentions of The Patriot Act as well as incorporation of mass surveillance, but at it's core it's basically the same overall framework as in the original. The movie's incorporation of multiple antagonists was a nice shake up from the rather silly magnate villains we'd had in the previous three films, but Burke never comes across as anything more than a generic G-man and Siphon is mute basically making him an engine of destruction.Race to Witch Mountain is a solid update on Escape from Witch Mountain. While the movie's core framework is very familiar hitting most of the expected beats, the quick pace and Dwayne Johnson's strong presence help keep it engaging for its target family audience. It's not an especially memorable or quotable film, but it's reasonably diverting entertainment.",Race to Witch Mountain
42,blott2319-1,Decent adventure film for the whole family,7,9 December 2020,"In Disney's never-ending quest to remake everything from their past, Race to Witch Mountain is one movie that kind of came and went with very little notice. I recall thinking it was decent when I saw it in the theater, and returning to it now, I still found it to be a moderately enjoyable adventure film. I tend to connect with movies where the heroes are on the run, and they do a good job here at telling that type of story. Dwayne Johnson shows that he is an endearing hero, and I think his rapport with the kids was solid. They make a point of sprinkling action throughout the movie, since there is very little in the way of plot. I'll admit that there are some serious flaws in the logic of Race to Witch Mountain. Most notably, there are several times when people do something stupid or out of character with no justification, and I was scratching my head. However, this is the kind of movie that had enough entertaining elements that I was able to shut off my brain and have some fun with it. I was also surprised that they did such a solid job of justifying why these kids were here, and explaining the importance of their mission on Earth. I won't say that Race to Witch Mountain is brilliant, and it's been so long since I saw the originals that I couldn't possibly compare the two, but I liked what this film delivered and don't regret watching it again.",Race to Witch Mountain
43,vip_ebriega,Slick but hollow remake.,5,5 April 2010,"My Take: Fast-paced and action-packed, but is neither exciting nor imaginative.Perhaps the sincerest recommendation I can give RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is that it wasn't as bad as it should have been. Loaded with action and chases, this amped-up remake of the Disney minor classic moves at a rapid pace, with maybe a few jokes thrown in by its star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, but it is, at best, a well-crafted but uneven experience.The original ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN wasn't exactly an immortal all-time classic that's being revered in the same way as STAR WARS, but there's very little reason to remake it other than to amp up the action level and provide a suitable vehicle for The Rock (who, after GAME PLAN, proved that he can be a bankable Disney lead). In a way, director Andy Fickman delivers a passable attempt to revive the 1975 original with The Rock playing Jack Bruno, a ex-con turned taxi driver who gets caught up with a pair of extraterrestrial siblings Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig) who, like in the original, wish to head back to their spaceship while X-FILES-type government agents are in hot pursuit.But instead of just another race atop the titular mountain, this remake also throws in a mostly-unseen assassin with more than a few similarities to PREDATOR. To give the race a little urgency, these two alien siblings have to get to their ship or else Earth will be invaded. These few, along with several chase sequences by beat-up cab or Winnebago, are among the few added frills in this admittedly stylish do-over. However, despite being a busy fast-paced adventure, RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN never really comes off as exciting. Fickman is no action director, but he keeps the film alive with tons of chases and pyrotechnics as if it were a toned-down Michael Bay movie, but its more busy than thrilling. And with maybe a few elements borrowed from other sci-fi adventure movies, neither is it original or imaginative.Regardless, RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN might make a decent distraction for 98 minutes. The action is brisk and The Rock is appealing. Maybe someday Dwayne Johnson will be able to find a better material to showcase his superstar appeal.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Race to Witch Mountain
44,ajs-10,Does what it says on the tin...,6,3 May 2010,"I fancied something that would entertain me, but at the same time wouldn't tax my little grey cells too much. What better than a Disney action adventure, I thought, and I was right, it does exactly what it says on the tin.In the desert outside Las Vegas an alien spaceship crashes, the two occupants get away, but the Department of Defence lead by Henry Burke is on the case. Meanwhile, Jack Bruno is an ex-con who is now trying to go straight and is making a living as a Las Vegas cab driver. Ferrying people from the airport to a UFO convention is getting a bit tedious for him. One of his passengers, Dr. Alex Friedman, gives him a ticket to her lecture; Jack thinks nothing of it and puts it in his visor. When two teenagers, Sara and Seth get into his cab his world is turned upside down. They ask him to take them to a desert location, offering him a very large amount of money. On the way there they are followed by Henry Burke and his team but the kids, being the aliens they are looking for use their special abilities to get away. Arriving at their destination the kids find an alien assassin is waiting for them, but they retrieve what they are looking for and escape with Jack. They now need to get to their ship, which has now been moved by Burke's team. Jack remembers Alex Friedman and they go to the convention to get her help, not knowing they've been followed by the assassin. Escaping the assassin, they are now in a race to the location of their spaceship, Witch Mountain.It's all pretty well done, decent effects, an easy to follow story, likable characters (the good guys at least) and some reasonable performances. For me, the villain, Burke, was not as threatening as the assassin, but I guess it was made for kids and you can't make them too scary. For the performances, honourable mentions go to Dwayne Johnson as Jack Bruno, AnnaSophia Robb as Sara, Alexander Ludwig as Seth, Carla Gugino as Dr. Alex Friedman and Ciarán Hinds as Henry Burke.Over all, it's not great, but at the same time it's not rubbish. It's family entertainment and, as I said at the beginning, it does just what it says on the tin. I should point out there's not a lot for the adult viewer, but it's all very well made. My little grey cells weren't too taxed and it was entertaining. Recommended for those who just want to switch off the little grey cells for a while and just be entertained.My score: 5.6/10",Race to Witch Mountain

Sure, you will have to research the film schedule for your local multiplex to find compatible show times, but trust me, watching only the ""best"" half of these two flicks will greatly enhance your cinematic experience.",Race to Witch Mountain
46,johnstonjames,Above Average Remake. And I Hate Remakes.,7,14 June 2010,"not bad. i still preferred the original. the original was a quaint, charming children's sci-fi flick with lots of Disneyish innocence and cuteness. it could also be dark however.it was directed by John Hough who gave us some of horror's scariest screamers like 'Legend of Hell House'. definitely one of Disney's most interesting outings from their golden age.the sequel doesn't fare as well in terms of originality but it is still entertaining and solidly made. it also has a decidedly more adult appeal to it than the original which was aimed at younger children. this version is more likely to appeal to tweens and young teenagers. for one thing the characters of Tony and Tia (called Seth and Sarah here for some reason) are older. the casting of older juveniles works far better than the terrible decision to cast an too old teen actress in the horrible remake of 'Freaky Friday'. The teen actress in 'Friday' was far too mature to play a role that was basically for a much younger child.the story in the 'Witch Mountain' remake also has a more mature feeling to it and it dabbles in a more serious sci-fi approach. but the emphasis seems to be mostly on it's action stunts which are far more spectacular than the obviously fantasy driven action in the first movie. it's really nice to see Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards, Tony and Tia from the original,making brief appearances in surprisingly gritty roles as a small town hick sheriff and a trailer park type waitress called, what else, Sheriff Antony and Tia. it was also fun to see the actress from the wonderful Disney flick 'Natty Gann' playing a reporter called Natalie Gann. cute.even though a lot of this was more grown-up than the first, it still had a very Disneyish feel to the whole thing with references to past Disney films and of course a nod to the whole cute animal thing with Sarah befriending and talking to, a cute doggy.even with the more mature themes and updates, this 'Witch Mountain' remains true to the Disney values of wholesome entertainment and is far better for kids then some of the more violent and sexier sci-fi fare.",Race to Witch Mountain
47,artzau,Fun movie,7,15 March 2009,"Hey, don't believe the downers trashing this movie. It's fun. Non-action stop from beginning to the end. Dwayne Johnson, who finally shed his former wrestling nom de lutre, is a much better actor than people are willing to concede. He has a mobile face and uses his big body well with a lot more expression and ability than some of the other shoot'em up and knock-about action heroes. This film, a remake of the old Disney classics with a CGI uptake and story rewrite, is entertaining, engaging and full of witty little pieces for the watchful viewer. When the alien bad guy gets knocked for a loop and everyone ducks for cover and the 2 UFO-Trekkie-types rejoice, (Wow. Best convention ever!) and the one I liked best, one of the nerd bad guys named Analyst D. Pleasance, for the veteran character actor, Don Pleasance who played the bad guy in the Disney originals. Also, Irish actor, Ciaran Hinds makes a superb Man in Black Suit bureaucrat villain and lovable Cheech Marin as the sleepy mechanic gets his licks in too, albeit in a bit part. The beautiful Carla Gugino comes across as the UFO seeking academic and Director Garry Marshall as the nut case UFOligist makes for good comic relief. The two kids add the mixture with AnnaSophia Robb reminding me of one of my granddaughters and Alexander Ludwigs serious facial expression adding to the fun. I found this film fun from the get-go and recommend it highly.",Race to Witch Mountain
48,bopdog,"Exciting and fulfilling action for adults (and families, too). Great film!",10,16 March 2009,"If you fancy a night out with the wife or your mates and just want a light-ish, but fulfilling action movie that pleases the eye and entertains the mind, please go see this. The cast is superb--- the hero is properly human and flawed, but big-hearted and true (Dwayne Johnson), the heroine (played by Carla Gugino, the mother from the ""Spy Kids"" films) is attractive, brilliant, and resourceful, and the kids are able actors bringing a realistic depth to their characters. One finds oneself rooting for the good guys to win this one! As an audience member, you will certainly be the winner yourself.As a much younger person I enjoyed the first two instalments of Disney's ""Witch Mountain"" movies. I was hesitant to see this one, because watching a kiddie show as an adult can be tedious (and a bit embarrassing, if you are not in the company of your kid).Reading some great reviews, however, I decided to take a chance. Also, Dwayne Johnson is likable. I was very surprised by how UN-kid-like this movie was. Child-wise, it was more adult than ""E.T."" but not as ""conceptual"" (and therefore boringly adult) as ""Close Ecounters of the Third Kind."" This movie is suitable for the whole family--- but I would wonder what a child under 10 would get out of it. There is real peril, lots of action, lots of special FX, crashing cars, shooting enemies in flying saucers and helicopters, ""Indiana Jones-ish"" adult danger/adventures, and a very close encounter with an ""almost vivisection"" that was kind of gruesome to contemplate. If a child was old enough to get the implications of all that, I would like to feel the child was also old enough to understand it is just a film, and to know how to avoid falling into terror or fear.Bottom line, great and exciting film, even if it is for families too.",Race to Witch Mountain

Then he is pressed by two henchmen of his former boss, the criminal Wolff, that wants to talk to him, but Jack does not want to return to the crime life. Jack fights and gets rid of them; out of the blue, he finds two teenagers on the backseat of his cab. They tell that they are siblings, Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig), and they need to travel to a location outside Las Vegas in the middle of nowhere.

Sara and Seth explain that they traveled to Earth to collect scientific data of an experiment and save Earth from invasion, but they need to return immediately to their planet. Jack teams up with Dr. Alex to retrieve their spacecraft in a secret base in the Witch Mountain.""Race to Witch Mountain"" is a typical movie from Disney, i.e., a delightful family entertainment. The story is predictable and uses the usual clichés of the genre, with the heart-warming hero; the despicable villain; the chase and the car race; the corny conclusion after the first contact; despite of that, I liked ""Race to Witch Mountain"" a lot. The pleasant cast performs enjoyable characters, and I particularly like The Rock, AnnaSophia Robb and Carla Gugino very much; only the boy Alexander Ludwig is unknown for me. I do not understand why some masochistic viewers that do not like this type of movie waste their time watching them and then write bad reviews; what would they expect?

51,Ali_John_Catterall,WWE meets UFO,5,3 November 2009,"A real rock, that Dwayne Johnson. But don't take our word for it - just ask the legions of healthy, happy kids who've benefited from his charity the Rock Foundation. He's a bit special among American sports stars (and wrestlers in particular) too, for making just as bankable a crossing from the ring to the screen, in the process garnering the kind of box office receipts Roddy Piper or 'Hollywood' Hulk Hogan can only dream about. This, despite making his feature film debut in a spin-off movie to a so-so sequel. Back in 2002, who'd have bet on The Scorpion King turning out to be such a stinging success? So it's a shame that this likable and funny actor, so good as gay Samoan bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm in Be Cool, hasn't yet been offered a decent vehicle, a Conan or a Terminator - even a Riddick - to bounce him into the A-league. Race To Witch Mountain isn't going to be that movie either, unless there's a sudden hunger among pre-teens for films about laid-back Las Vegas taxi drivers who are a bit handy with their fists.Johnson is Jack Bruno, aforementioned cabbie and ex-felon-going straight, who discovers two mysterious children, Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig), in the back of his cab during the midst of a Vegas sci-fi convention. The siblings, who possess amazing paranormal powers, are on a mission of urgency factor 10 and, along with pretty UFOlogist Dr Alex Friedman (Carla Gugino), they're soon embroiled in a gigantic cover-up involving Area 51, interstellar warfare and the immediate future of planet Earth. Hot on their galactic heels are the Men in Black, led by laconic Major Henry Burke (a faintly embarrassed looking Ciarán Hinds, but the best thing here). Also chasing them are Jack's former mob connections and a Predator-like flesh-eating alien called a 'Siphon'. Now there's a name crying out for an interplanetary smackdown.Surprisingly, as it's hardly classic Disney, this is the latest update of a story that's been kicking around for over 40 years - ever since Alexander Key's original 1968 novel - via Escape To Witch Mountain (1975), sequel Return From Witch Mountain (1978) and second sequel Beyond Witch Mountain (1982), along with a 1995 TV movie. Back in the 'me' decade, the children, then named Tony and Tia, were wanted purely for the power their supernatural abilities could bring to millionaire Aristotle Bolt. While in the sequel, Christopher Lee's scientist aimed to subject them to his mind-control technology to gain wider recognition within the scientific community.In the immediate post-Dubya, post-Guantanamo, post-Patriot Act era, the bad guys come in the shape of the government itself. For Major Burke, the children represent ""illegal aliens without passports"", subject only to detention, interrogation and, ultimately, firing squads. This at least educates tweenies in the less salubrious aspects of US domestic policy - along with a primer in UFO conspiracy lore. And not least, an introductory lecture on determinism and chaos theory, courtesy of Dr Alex. All good subversive stuff, but aside from the usual yawning plot holes - why should earthly anaesthetic work on the aliens? - and the fact that it's all a bit low rent (their spaceship looks like it came out of a flatpack), the big problem is that it simply fails to ignite or excite.It's all going on up there on the screen, explosions and car chases and bodymorphing and whatnot. But does it grip the attention? Does it hold any suspense? As Gordon Brown might say, it 'Disney'.",Race to Witch Mountain
52,blackmamba99971,A nice refresh of a classic,10,20 April 2010,"I thought this was a good rehash of an old classic. I like the fact they used the original two from the first Disney movie (Escape to Witch Mountain) with Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann. Kim playing the waitress and Ike playing the sheriff. And in the middle is Dwayne Johnson. Who plays Jack Bruno, a hard and gritty taxi driver who wants nothing more than to do his shift and go home. Yet in this case here comes two unsuspecting teens, who are visitors from another world. Their mission is to save their planet, using certain fragments of DNA which have been collected on earth in order for their home planet to thrive once more. Once the two get back that is. But there is always an obstacle, like an assassin built by their military to kill both Seth and Sara and start a colonization plan. And to add more difficulties, a rather maniac government agent wants both to be captured and eviscerated. With all sides closing in, jack remembers a fare about a woman who is a debunked physicist and goes to her for help. With all parties chasing them its a time line now of how to get their ship back from the government, evade an assassin, get themselves back home and save their world. And with Jack, his feelings to the kids had become even more special. He would protect them at all costs, to keep them from harm and to make sure they can get home. In the end he was also given a special gift from Sara, the ability to communicate with the mind. I thought this was a very good film.

It's got some thrilling moments thanks to the UFO chasing the taxicab, and the movie does a good job at entertaining young audiences with all the special effects and the spaceship and humor intended for kids only. But to me, in the end, the movie is just one big blah!Here's another movie about environment and saving planet earth once again. If I could get a penny for every time I come across a movie with this kind of agenda, I'd buy me the Bahamas by now. First half of the movie might get you as confused as Dwayne Johnson's character as to what on earth (or beyond the earth) is going on. The pacing is a bit inconsistent, the direction is all over the place, and it's too predictable but it's a family movie that comes out in the spring, so what'd you expect, right?WWE Superstar turned actor The Rock, who now only goes by his real name Dwayne Johnson once again tries to be the ordinary honest joe-schmo with a rough background, the perfect ingredient for a hero and I think Johnson gives a decent job of pulling that off except he could definitely show some more 'kick' to his performance, because there are times when you can tell his character's supposed to panic and yet his reaction doesn't show it. Maybe he's too concerned about looking all macho. Carla Gugino who is an eye-candy plays the sexy professor (something you don't see everyday), is a character way too familiar, the ones that others mock but then something comes along and proves her right, other than her looks, she doesn't add much for her role really. Annashopia Robb and Alexander Ludwig who play the two young alien passengers must've seen a thousand alien sci-fi movies or something because they have that robotic, clueless but know-it-all expressions down pat. By the way, is it just me or does Anna Sophie Robb look like she could play a younger version of Keira Knightley?!I kinda have to blame the director Andy Finkman who also helmed The Game Plan. The tone of this movie is flat, for the most part you feel like you've been robbed, it dumbs you down and only has a few exciting scenes that come off desperate because without them, the audiences would've walked out halfway through the movie already. Frankly, it baffles me why Disney keeps hiring Finkman to do their bidding. What irritates me is Cheech's cameo who doesn't do much as a comic relief, the movie doesn't allow him to be what he's famous for, what you'd usually expect him to be.. a show-stopper. The only actor that does a splendid job in this movie is Ciaran Hinds who was fantastic in Munich and HBO series Rome and he's just too damn good for this kind of gig, an easily forgettable family movie.--Rama's SCREEN--",Race to Witch Mountain
57,cosmic_quest,A worthy sequel,7,11 April 2009,"There was much complaining to be had when it was first announced this film was in the making. Understandably, fans of the previous two 'Witch Mountain' films were concerned that this was to be an unnecessary remake and a shoddy one, at that. However, 'Race to Witch Mountain' is not a remake but a sequel to the 1970s Disney films and, as someone who was worried themselves, I have to admit that it is actually quite a good film in its own right. The film begins with a space ship crash-landing on Earth, near Las Vegas, and agents of some sinister government group quickly work out that there were two occupants of the crash who are now on the run. It is then revealed that the two aliens are, in fact, fourteen-year-old siblings Sara and Seth who have psi abilities and have attached themselves to taxi driver Jack Bruno thus embroiling him in their adventure to allude the agents and an assassin from their own planet while retrieving an object that is the key to saving both their home and Earth. Along the way, the trio gain assistance from astrophysicist Alex Friedman and Junkyard the dog.The teen leads AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig do a good job in portraying their roles as the young aliens who are more somber and restrained than typical human teenagers. They do well in both expressing this 'alien' awkwardness to their characters but differentiating themselves by the depiction of Sara as more empathic (in part, due to her telepathic skills) and open compared with Seth, the stand-offish sibling who initially doesn't trust humans. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who plays Jack Bruno, is actually a bit of a surprise to me in this film because he proves he can bring a sensitive nature to his character and do more than just look good and jump around in action-packed scenes. While he's not quite ready for a part in 'Schindler's List', he does stretch himself as an actor and prove he can do the paternal with a deeper emotional side role with some flair.In terms of the actual storyline, 'Race to Witch Mountain' is quite dark compared to recent Disney films over the last decade or so and it is a refreshing change to find a Disney film that is actually aimed at most of the family rather than primary school kids and shallow teenagers. The characters are put in danger, they are hurt, they have guns aimed at them (well done to Disney for this rather than dumbing down a la Spielberg with his rubbish re-release of 'ET') and they are hunted by adults who are not nice and never will be nice, and this all makes for a film that can be enjoyed by everyone over five. In fact, this is a very good film for sci-fi fans to introduce their children/younger siblings to the genre since there is a lack of age appropriate science fiction films out there for children. What was also a huge positive to this film was the absolute lack of teeny booper romance, as if Disney realised that it is possible to have a film featuring teenagers who don't fall in 'love'.There were a couple of negatives to the film. It may have 'Witch Mountain' in the title but it really does not have much connection to the previous films other than cameos from the two former child actors of the 1970s film and the inclusion of male and female siblings. Although that does not diminish that this film is enjoyable in the slightest, it just seems that there could have been at least some tie-in/homage to the prequels. The character of Alex Friedman should have contributed more to the plot or should not have been included since she seemed to be there just for the sake of it, added on as an after-thought to provide a female adult lead.In all, 'Race to Witch Mountain' is good family/sci-fi lite film to catch over the Easter holidays and it certainly does not let down the 1970s films. It's a film that almost reminds me of the 'old days' (pre-2000) when Disney was good for producing worthwhile family flicks that did not condescend entirely to the nine to thirteen crowd and with characters that were likable rather than obnoxious or snotty adolescent brats.",Race to Witch Mountain

Also, there was more fun to be had with their reaction to our world, but, again, without a deeper story about them and their world, we would not have been able to see why do they react that way and thus it would have not been that funny.Also, Carla Gugino and The Rock don't work well together.

59,Jay_Exiomo,Mountain dreck,4,13 March 2009,"The Rock and company may be game, but the race turns out to be less a game than a drudgery. A victim of its own desire to have Dwayne Johnson's crowd-pleasing macho element sub for the youthful innocence of its young protagonists (and even for the amiable charisma of Johnson himself), ""Race to Witch Mountain"" loses much of the sweetness in this re-imagining of a 1970s adventure tale that starts amusingly enough but ultimately never comes across as more than a turgidly forgettable family fare.Ex-con Jack Bruno (Johnson) is trying to attain a clean slate by living a reformed life as a Las Vegas cab driver when he inadvertently becomes the chauffeur of two young passengers (AnnaSophia Robb and Ludwig) who show him a big wad of cash to drive them out of the city. It turns out that the juvenile customers are superpowered aliens out to save the Earth from an imminent invasion by their kind, and the only way to prevent the planet from being taken over by an intellectually superior extraterrestrial race is if Jack, along with an ardent astrophysicist (Carla Gugino), successfully guides these kids to the mysterious Witch Mountain past a joyless baddie (Ciarán Hinds) and his military men.To get there, however, means having to endure a tedious chase punctuated by flat action setpieces so perfunctorily packaged as a merchandise to fit every member of the audience, where everyone gets a dumbed-down sample but no one gets the real dose. Director Andy Finkman was responsible for the highly forgettable ""The Game Plan"" which, if nothing else, got Johnson into a tree costume; no surprise, then, that here, in what seems to be an attempt to buff up the former wrestling star again, Finkman diminishes Johnson's everyman appeal and Robb's likable presence into mere players in a race that never gains enough momentum.",Race to Witch Mountain

I never knew his name. My mother responded, ""The Rock."" Of course, that's not his name because his name is Dwayne Johnson, but you get the idea. My mother called this movie, ""boring, but cute"" in very, very similar words. When I decided to choose to watch this movie because I didn't want to go to the movies to see an R rated movie with my mom, like Watchmen and The House on the Left. I guess I can watch them on DVD. Well, this movie did not disappoint. It was hilarious, and is the movie that is excellent for kids and adults.There is a thing that bothers me. The children aliens. I do not believe that if we finally are contacted by extraterrestrials (or if the government gives out the information) that the extraterrestrials, if they are humanoid, in fact looks exactly like us, that they would live their lives talking like idiots. ""Hello, what do you command Jack Bruno? Why must our faith be tied to this cab, Jack Bruno? Something else, Jack Bruno?"" That said, I think the acting is terrible for that, but it's still quite cute.I enjoyed that the cops did not act like idiots in this movie except the younger CIA agent or whatever who wanted a gun and said, ""dude"". For example, in the Disney films that usually comes out as far as I know, there's these idiotic cops who work with the CIA and who get kicked in the balls.

61,RichardSRussell-1,Race Away from Witch Mountain,4,24 March 2009,"Dwayne Johnson plays Jack Bruno, Las Vegas cabbie, and Carla Gugino is Dr. Alex Friedman, UFO expert. Perhaps you saw the preview in which Bruno and Friedman are crawling thru a tubular tunnel and she admits to a bit of claustrophobia. Just then Bruno reaches an opening into a deep vertical shaft and asks ""How are you with heights?"". It was a good scene, with a bit of low-key but contextually appropriate humor that the former Rock has learned to deliver effectively, making him a big, strapping brute of a guy that you feel comfortable with. But that scene isn't in the film itself. Instead, we see the aftermath, in which Friedman is still a bit freaked out, for no apparent reason.The rest of the movie was like that, too. People seemed to be doing things with no credible motives. The 2 adults flee from no fewer than 4 sets of pursuers exhibiting varying degrees of hostility (The Government, a space-alien cross between Predator and Inspector Javert, Bruno's former mob boss Mr. Wolf and his henchthugs, and the LVPD). They do so to protect 2 teenage Swedish, I mean space, aliens who are here to retrieve the mcguffin, um, recording device that will prevent their planet from launching a hostile takeover, uh, invasion. The gal of the pair, Sara, is played by AnnaSophia Robb. We know from her performance in Bridge to Terabithia (2007, 9*) that she can be a tremendously appealing young actress, but here she gets to do stuff like pointing her finger and monotonically saying ""Go that way, Jack Bruno."". The boy, Seth, is played by Alexander Ludwig, a cipher.The government's head alien tracker warns Bruno that the kids are not what they seem to be. Anyone who's ever seen a science-fiction movie (which apparently includes precisely zero of any characters who are actually IN an SF movie) can only begin to imagine what might lurk beneath those placid blond exteriors, but this proves singularly untroubling for Bruno, leading right up to the snuggle-bunny ending (Disney, y'know), which was likewise not well set up by any of the preceding events.The scenes set at a UFO convention make good sport of fannish stereotypes, which some people might find offensive but I choose to treat as endearing. And I loved the sly humor that they DID leave in the script, wherein Bruno asks the kids at the controls of the flying saucer ""Do you know how to fly this thing?"", they respond ""How do you think we got here?"", and he replies ""Well, you crashed!"". More of that, from another couple of passes thru the typer, would have earned this one an upgrade.*Best SF&F film of the 21st Century so far, IMHO",Race to Witch Mountain
62,kyle-cruse,"Starts good, ends weak",5,10 April 2009,"I went to see this film because I heard it was somewhat of a throwback to the good-old days of Disney, so to say. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite what I had hoped for. First I'll share my positive comments. ""Race to Witch Mountain"" started out pretty good. There are a few laughs at the beginning, and the first 20 minutes or so set up the plot very well. As a matter of fact, the first half of the film remains pretty enjoyable and engaging. Dwayne Johnson plays his role pretty well the whole time, and AnnaSophia Robb does a good job, as usual. My beef with the film starts when the second half does. As soon as the three main characters get back to Las Vegas, the film takes a downhill turn for the worst. All of a sudden, a lot of new (and very annoying) characters are added that end up ruining the rest of the film. I found myself groaning at the awful jokes and lines delivered by the rest of the characters at this point. Even a cameo from Cheech Marin does nothing at this point. Also, parents should know that this really isn't a great kids film. This seems much more like an action movie than an engaging kids' story. The action almost never lets up, which takes away from this film rather than benefiting it. I hate to put down this film too much, but the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. I wish it could have remained good the whole time. If you want my suggestion, wait to rent this one on DVD and don't waste your money at the theater.** out of ****",Race to Witch Mountain
63,mgruebel,Give me Milland and Pleasence any day!,6,15 November 2019,"Well, Donald Pleasence and Ray Milland were way better evildoers in the 1970s original ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" The story of the 70s flick also made more sense and was better paced out. (OK, I'm old, so I can handle movies that are paced out instead of one lamb-bang action scene after another).Nonetheless, the remake is not all bad. The two kids are suitably alien (definitely acting on the part of Robb, judging from earlier movies with her). Dwayne Johnson delivers plenty of dry humor that feels as well-placed as Arenold-quips of the 80s. And there is a certain Chemistry between his cab driver and Carla Gugino's scientist that works fairly well.Still, the special effects are largely infantile, the alien assassin moves like a wooden puppet (although it's a guy ion a costume), and the story of getting the kids back to their spaceship so Earth can be saved is simplistic, leaving out the relationship development that happened in the original. And as I said, the original Milland/Pleasence evil guys were intelligent and sinister, and just all-around much better.It was OK to watch once though, so I give it a 6/10.",Race to Witch Mountain

The family that dumbs down numbs together? The plot, although not very clever, is not terrible. The lead male actor is the typical ""hunk"" these days who gets off a few good lines but mostly just looks like he waiting for his turn at the barbells. The special effects weren't bad, circa 1960. But one chase scene after another, the evil doers in hot pursuit with a robo assassin for spice. Really? The two alien children seem to have super powers that they keep forgetting to use. And if there was anything that seemed utterly ridiculous it was the fight between our hero and robo assassin... it can level buildings and do all sorts of horrible things, but chooses to fight Hero, mano a mano. Where does the nonsense stop? Of course, it started within the first 10 minutes and never stopped. This is a real klunker.PS.

You can have plenty of action without nauseating violence! It was also a delight to see a powerful science fiction story suitable for even small children.I like the underlying premise that an alien race, with tremendous technological and mental powers, can act in an ethical and selfless fashion. It's also interesting that there can be more than two sides to a story, in this case 4 sides - two factions of aliens and two factions of humans all with different agendas!This is also a blatantly anti-military, anti-military intelligence and anti-secret government story. Two opposing philosophies are made crystal clear: Might makes right, on one hand; and courageous ethical behavior is its own reward, on the other! I shudder to think what would happen to an extraterrestrial alien if they were ever captured by our government or any other major power! As silly as this may sound to some people, I really hope an International treaty is ratified and Federal laws are passed giving sentient extraterrestrials legal standing! Otherwise, why would they ever want to risk exposing themselves in this selfish, and violent, world of ours?

66,brandon_lee420,Could not surpass the original!,6,8 January 2010,"Having high expectations for this film, I rented this from Video Ezy along with another movie and couldn't wait to watch it. The reason I wanted to view it was because it starred Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson and it was a remake of the original: Escape To Witch Mountain. That film is one of my favorites as a kid and I wanted to find out if the remake would be better. Sadly, the answer is no! Even if it has cool fight scenes, it could not surpass the original. The original had better acting and a better story than Race To Witch Mountain could have ever done and the alien kid sucked balls along with his sister. There was hardly any emotion in some scenes, for instance: When the Rock finds out that their aliens, he looks like he believes them or in one scene they are being chased by baddies and two minutes later they are all calm and pretend it never happened. It is not entirely the actors fault but instead the directors, Andy Fickman, and he sure has made some pretty bad movies including the latest one. Kids would surely have a good time enjoying this because they give every movie ten stars but adults would be sleeping two minutes into the movie. If a sequel ever comes out I hope it is better than the first one.What can be worse than two alien kids in your taxi with a truckload of cash? What can be worse than running away from the U.S. government and helping the aliens reach their spaceship? Well, out of nowhere two aliens with superhuman abilities require a ride all the way to witch mountain, so they jump into a cab and give the driver lots of money. Jack Bruno is the unlucky cab driver who later gets involved in a out of the world adventure. They have to fight through government guys, bad aliens, hovercraft's and many more dangerous things.The action will leave a smile on a kids face but certainly not yours. The movie is sometimes clichéd and that sucks. The chase scenes are alright but could have been way better. The story sometimes slow downs and then goes fast and the cycle keeps on repeating over and over again. Dwayne was pretty good in this movie and I can see that he will have a successful career in acting and I can't wait to watch The Tooth Fairy. That's all from me but check out and decide for yourself because this was all a glimpse of what the movie will be like. A good time well spent is a wonderful time. 6/10",Race to Witch Mountain
67,byson5186,Brother And Sister Aliens,8,16 February 2015,"I've seen this movie a few times. I have to say, we get to know a very popular actor who we call The Rock, as Dwayne Johnson has a role in this Disney sci-fi adventure. I guess he was already a big actor by the time this movie was made, but this is a Disney movie he gets an exciting role in. We also have a couple other actors like Alexander Ludwig who seems like a well known actor now. This is one of the movies we probably remember him from the most. We also have Anna Sophie Robb in this movie, and this is the only action movie I can think of her in.This movie is a fast pace exciting sci-fi adventure movie with action throughout the movie and Disney appropriate PG action. It seems to show fictional action, as in a lot of action movies a lot of the action we see probably could not take place in real life and never happens. But, they do it for fast paced movie entertainment. This movie also has like a common plot. I mean there seem to be a lot of movies about aliens coming to Earth. Sometimes they come to earth for violence, and other times they seem to be friendly extra terrestrials which people make friends with. I have to say, of all those movies my favorite one would have to be Earth To Echo. Interestingly, I showed it to two girls in my apartment yesterday who hadn't seen it. They both loved it and want to own a copy of that movie. I feel like that movie is the best one and would strongly recommend it to all of you feeling like that movie is way too underrated.In this movie, we get a different view of aliens. We have our different ideas of what aliens would look like, but in this movie the aliens are clearly human aliens. The aliens are early adolescents played by Alexander Ludwig and Anna Sophie Robb. Not only that, but these alien bodies are basically the same as human bodies minus having certain super powers. These aliens have typical English names, Seth and Sarah. They are Caucasian with blonde hair looking like they are from a European background, which if they're aliens they obviously couldn't be from a European background. The planet they come from doesn't even seem to be that much of an earth like planet. The kids in this movie act like typical kids and even speak English using complicated vocabulary. What is nice about this movie, I always feel like it's nice to see a brother and sister getting along, as Seth and Sarah clearly are working together in this movie, and get along. They don't fight. You know those two really care for each other and think somewhat alike. It's nice to see how they work together and how Jack Bruno and Dr. Alex Friedman help them.If you're up for a sci-fi adventure. Or, a Disney live action movie then you ought to see this. It's an OK movie, and it doesn't seem like it's anything too out of the ordinary for a movie. A lot of Disney movies are worth seeing, and I like hearing about Disney live action movies when this movie is really well action packed. I give it an 8/10.",Race to Witch Mountain
68,quiqueperezsoler,Promising premise and intriguing set up but it lacks charm and feels generic,6,11 April 2020,"Aware that it's a remake of their own 1970s' franchise, this film had potential with the updated CGI and special effects of the new century and the cast it had but the humor fell flat and the plot felt dull and generic after the first act.The premise hinted at a retro view to aliens' visual cues from the 60s and 70s as seen in the montage of the credits at the beginning of the movie but the movie didn't embrace that aesthetic and tried to mash it up with modern aliens resulting in a very generic and flat aliens movie when it could have been so much more retro. Many themes were reminiscent of movies like John Carpenter's Starman and E.T. and it would have benefited the aesthetic of the film if they had embraced that aesthetic.But as mentioned before, the set up is really engaging and the use of UFO conventions to bring some characters relevant to the plot was also very entertaining and well thought out. The villains were a bit generic but it's a Disney family-friendly movie so there was no expectation for anything else. Also some of the plot didn't make much sense or was really unecessary to a point of if they were taken out of the film the movie would have been much shorter. They felt a bit of a waste just to fill up the runtime, I for one would have preferred they developed more of the backstory of the main characters instead of providing the required information when the plot needed it. THe movie was fast paced which prevent it from being boring but unfortunately provided no rest for developing more the characters. Chases are a lot of fun but the audience and the characters need to catch their breath in order for the chase to feel earned and most importantly realistic. (Dwane Johnson is a human cab driver yet he can take a group of federal agents and thugs and survive a lot alien explosions... We want heroes in our stories but we are not dumb, all this fighting is bound to get them some scars, innit?)IN CONCLUSION, it is mainly a kid-friendly movie full of good action, forced humor, good performances and interesting but at times generic plot. Recommended for kids but adults won't take much from it that they haven't heard or seen before. Nice chill entertaining alien-themed movie",Race to Witch Mountain
69,marcotiero,Best in the series,7,29 June 2020,"I'm giving this one a soft 7, after rating the previous 2 both a 5.Obviously with this one, bigger budget and higher production values means a vast improvement on the special effects, however, this meant there was a risk of over-use of the kids powers, which thankfully wasn't the case. This is contrary to the previous 2 when they couldn't go more than a minute without some ""power"" ability.I prefer the more serious tone to this one, too. The others were too cheesy, especially the gang in ""Return from Witch mountain"".This does have plenty of flaws though. The story was too simple, not enough drama or tension created, no plot twists, just by the numbers.The Agents seemed to be after them for no reason at all, like they were expecting the aliens to land, instead of something happening and they are called into the situation (like any other movie). This version of Deraniun was pretty useless too. Wasn't menacing at all, never any real sense of danger from him. Lastly, the mob guys were only in a couple of scenes, what was the point in them? Jack could have just explained he previously worked for the mob and that would have been suffice.",Race to Witch Mountain
70,powerfull_jedi,If you smell what cooking up on Witch Mountain,7,22 July 2009,"I like Dwayne Johnson's work(even his kid friendly stuff such as Game Plan) and since watching him steal the show from Steve Carell on Get Smart, I always wanted him to go back to making good PG-13 or heck even R-rated action movies, so I'm proud to say that we get a bit of that ""action""-Dwayne in RtWM. A remake of 70's movie that I never saw. It's kinda fun, something along the lines of a typical sci-fi conspiracy movie with a dash of what could be considered a G-rated version of Predator. So we get Jack Bruno, a taxi driver, frustrated by his work that consists of picking up sci-fi geeks in Vegas, while being harassed by his former employer's henchmen, until he picks up two mysterious kids who appear out of nowhere, they sound weird, they act weird and even more troubling an evil organization is after them, which is apparently some sort of spin-off of the Department of Homeland Security who want to take in these kids. And they are evil, why exactly? I have no clue, the writers forgot to give us any indication as why the movie's main villains do what they do, apart from general vagueness of it all and an eye-rolling random and out-of-context mention of The Patriot Act.Heck, the alien stalker(which could be mistaken by some as The Predator's baby brother)should've been the true main villain and he has a far more solid and clear motive. Oddly enough, for a movie based on sci-fi, they also pokes fun at the tin-foil mentality of the science fiction and nothing really changes with the main characters, Jack Bruno doesn't go gaga after all is revealed and Carla Gugino's Dr. Alex is amazed but never warped. On the acting side, Dwayne Johnson performs his little act with both physical prowess and some subtle acting, the kids are generally likable, though the little girl who plays Sara got a little on my nerves as she at times was either over-acting or just being over- dramatic. The main villain is well, evil, has an evil stare, it's a completely different contrast to his own henchmen, namely Chris Marquette who looks like he's in a completely different movie, though he gets kudos for his delivery on that particular gun stand-off that seems like it was taken from a John Woo film. My advice: It's worth watching at least once, if you haven't seen it yet, Rent it. It's 90 minutes worth of good family friendly action fun.",Race to Witch Mountain

Oh how I long for the days when movies had plot, character development, and heart and also made sense. I have no problem with remakes if they're done well and enjoyable (i.e. Adam Sandler's remake of The Longest Yard). Despite having the likable The Rock, this movie was really bad. It was one long shootout and car chase, with negligible character development and no heart. There was no explanation of anything, such as what exactly were those glowing blobs of goo beneath the abandoned house? And, although I don't normally have a problem with ""politics"" entering a film if the film is good, the whole scenario of having the alien kids trying to save their planet from environmental destruction and the Earth from destruction by their evil military was not only silly but smacked of liberal nonsense.",Race to Witch Mountain

There's an exciting car chase where the authorities are after the aliens (who are disguised as kids) in the first 15 minutes or so (great fun) followed by an alien hunter also in pursuit of them (this is not quite as entertaining, but fairly explosive). As you'd expect for a 2009 film the special effects are very good as the kids special abilities are gradually revealed – however these are kept to essentials only and the CGI is not overblown. The dog is very funny. There's a suitably exciting rescue attempt from inside the mountain (a sort of secret Area 51 base housing the kids captured saucer) and a final confrontation with the alien hunter (who looks a lot like 'The Silence' from Doctor Who once the helmet comes off).

There is no blood seen, but lots of shootouts, explosions, and physical violence in this movie, so parents, be aware.

The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) was pretty good in this film and Carla Gugino is one of those solid, nicely understated actresses who does whatever role she's in justice but that's about it. The story has been updated and changed from the original's gorgeous, scenic locales to crummy Vegas and the plot is a whole lot thinner. The character development of the two kids is sadly lacking (though Ludwig and Robb do the best they can with what they've got) so the film relies heavily on tons of special effects and lots of car chases to fill in the huge holes in the script. Again, what a bummer. This wasn't the worst movie I've seen but I'm sorry I spent the money on it at the theatres. This would've been a solid cable flick and not much more.

80,jerry07,Probably fine as a family movie,6,9 December 2012,"I am of those who actually saw the original and although I cannot remember the story or the scenes at all, what I remember clearly is that as a kid, I had great anticipation and excitement to see it and a week full of dreams afterward. I can imagine that if I saw it again, I may not be as enchanted. Hard to see both a newer version of it (usually, the remake are bad and disappointing) and see it as an adult. One needs to make special efforts to be be balanced and see it with eyes as close to the one I vaguely remember having ""then"".Overall, this version stands by itself as a family movie and in the genre, it will be entertaining and make even more kids dream and have this feel that if they were a cab driver (or anyone else), they would certainly help those aliens too. Most of the movie is predictable for sure: alien good only trying to stay alive and return home, men in black bad and focused on ""getting them"" - a bit of the ""StarMan"" generation as theme. Then there is the cabi from LA protects the children (cute eyes a-la-puss to insert here) because ""they are only children"". OK, saw this too before.Now, cannot say that I would have imagined Dwayne Johnson in the role of cab driver Jack Bruno but I think at the end, the choice works fine and the acting is aligned with this style of movies. The actors playing the aliens/kids (Anna-Sophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig for Sara and Seth) I think play their role pretty well - scared kids (alien) in need to return home and being chased by all kinds trying to stop them, split in their approach: one is trusting the other one suspicious of humans. The rolling eyes and expression of Anna-Sophia are especially convincing. This certainly recovers from the modest performance of other actors (Sr something ... can't even remember her role in the movie, it was that shallow and irrelevant). Add to this some cheap humor (the UFO nuts at the convention) and you get a movie which is in doubt entertaining for the targeted age, full of action, car chases, explosion and effects and one which, while it may not make the cut for a great movie for adults, will not be boring either for the more mature audience.",Race to Witch Mountain

As one who fell in love with her in ""Bridge to Terabithia"", and thrilled with her acting but not so much her bratty Character in ""Sleepwalking"", I wanted to see her alive and well and thriving. Hey, in this movie she is all that and more, she even has adorable Superpowers! (I went to theater to see her in ""Jumper"" but she's only in the first few minutes.) This is the first movie I've seen with Alexander Ludwig, playing Brother, Seth to AnnaSophia's Sara. He was brilliant in the part, and I hope to see him again, with or without his superpowers.It was a pleasant surprise to see, even if in a minor role for Chris Marquette as Pope. Chris played Adam in the ""Joan of Arcadia"" TV Series. He played slightly flawed but ever lovable character, and not that different here as a Government Rookie. I'm always pleased to follow any of the cast from that show.I was not drawn to see Dwayne Johnson, but as Jack Bruno, he brings a strong balance to the young players. Garry Marshall, Carla Gugino, and others bring a wealth of credits to the table and are a credit to their parts. And Why is Cheech Marin as the Reluctant Mechanic Uncredited? I have to mention the amusing and entertaining irony of having our real Space Aliens at a UFO Convention full of crazy looking caricatures of other favorite Sci-Fi Movies and UFO Psychos!

Then the slightly less impressive 1995 version is still more store then action. This one is pretty much action start to finish. There is a story that doesn't actually even start explaining anything that's happening till well over 30 minutes in. Even then it's interrupted by the action starting up again. Unlike the three previous movies that the mission is to get to Witch Mountain to get home this is not the case here. They do about an hour end discover the reason they have to get to Witch Mountain but it wasn't because it was the way home as in the previous three.

What the ""the Rock"" does convey is an involvement with the characters around him. Until I saw this film, I had this picture of him as a real blow-hard. Not only is Johnson a pleasing actor, but he is funny while playing the tough guy. I have yet to see his other pictures, but I do hope he does more films along the lines of ETWM. He is perfect for what I call family adventure films.JKHolman",Race to Witch Mountain

89,paulcheetham,The Rock rocks,6,26 April 2010,"The film has an easy to follow plot, Dwayne Johnson is a Las Vegas cabbie who becomes embroiled in helping two, quite annoying, teenage aliens with supernatural powers get back to their spaceship after crashing on earth, meanwhile escaping from a shady government division and an assassin from their home world. The film has a good pace to it which helps keep your attention on what is a fairly poor and predictable story. The action was flowing and set pieces well put together but then I expect no less from a Disney production. This film reaffirms in what I believe 'that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is a good actor' despite the fact that his acting background comes from pro wrestling. His natural screen presence for me makes anything that he is in watchable. Overall I thought it was an enjoyable film which would be good for family viewing.

And I also liked how the director incorporated the storyline to the effects. Congratulations to Disney – with the other two movies, this one outranks.

93,jayroth6,Super-Disneyfication: they come in peace,10,15 April 2009,"Race to Witch Mountain (2009) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1075417/reviewed by Jay RothermelRace to Witch Mountain is the latest opportunity for ""tween"" kids to drag their ""twifty"" grandparents to the multiplex Walpurgisnacht and shovel some more money into Disney's satanic furnace.The plot: Earth must be saved by blonde Aryan alien overlord teenagers with help of kindly American he-man.Dwayne Johnson in Race to Witch Mountain is Disney's answer to Vin Diesel or a young Harrison Ford. He is also reminiscent, in his skills and range, of Joel McCrea: a man who looks good whether as a cowboy or a playboy. He is fit, handsome, self-deprecating, and has a movie star's faultless teeth. The action and light comedy demands of Race to Witch Mountain and previously Game Plan (2007) seem to fit him better than Rundown (2003) or Walking Tall (2004), two obscenely humorless and over-determined action vehicles from earlier in his career. Not that Race to Witch Mountain isn't ""over-determined."" But its set-up and the early ""meet cute"" moments between male and female leads (Johnson and Carla Gugino) are calmly and clearly handled in a matter of minutes.Seems an interstellar race of very white Anglo aliens have turned their home world into a polluted dump. The most socially conscious have, in experiments conducted on earth, found a way to turn things around. Sadly, the rulers of this distant world have decided to colonize earth rather than clean up their own mess. Two alien teens are all that stands - as the saying goes - in their way.Race to Witch Mountain is the supreme Whitley Strieber/Art Bell/UFO/secret government movie. In fact, Strieber makes a cameo appearance, just to show what a good sport he is as the last twenty years of his life are sent-up for Big Studio Hollywood derision. The movie's opening credits are a kitchen sink montage of every piece of UFO folklore in the last 60 years. Mission to Mars (2000) and Signs (2002) are sanctimonious pikers when compared to this hymn to the manias of pseudo-science.Before James Randi and Michael Shermer have aneurisms, rest assured Race to Witch Mountain bears the same relation to John Mack/Budd Hopkins la-la land as Michael Buble does to the American Songbook: it is aesthetic mountaintop removal of the most primitive sort.The political stance of Race of Witch Mountain is New Age Democrat: a multi-racial hero not unlike Barrack Obama (and Dwayne Johnson is the most ""not unlike Barrack Obama"" actor working today) clobbers the sinister Bush/McCain Patriot Act/black helicopter crowd. Additional theses: only saviors can save polluted planets; yellow cab drivers are losers; heroes drive a 1968 Mustang GT 390 Fastback and villains use fleets of black SUVs.Said villains all look like they've just emerged from an Alex Jones version of Men in Black. Their Witch Mountain headquarters: Dick Cheney's Xanadu as imagined on Harry Shearer's radio hour Le Show.The bubble in live-action Disney movies (High School Musical 3 (2008), Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience (2009), Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009)) aimed at our pre-teenagers and used as battering rams to end resistance to the merchandise the movies spawn, shows no signs of recession. Back in the 1970s movie critics started talking about the Disneyfication of popular culture. Progress since then has been leaping forward: we now enjoy the super-Disneyfication. Or perhaps it is ultra-Disneyfication? No matter what you call it, rest assured: they come in peace._________________________________________Jay Rothermel lives in Cleveland, Ohio.",Race to Witch Mountain
94,doctorcd2005,A stretch of the imagination -peurile,2,17 July 2009,"You know it never ceases to amaze me how poor alien technology could be.I mean how can an alien spacecraft that is capable of traversing 3000 light years in an instant can be so inaccurate when it comes to its weapons fire when pursuing a clapped out old taxi on a straight road ? How can a top secret military base be subverted so easily, and the staff convinced to evacuate by a stranger with no ID ? This is just a couple of examples of the many I had to stretch my imagination beyond the realms of acceptability to rate this movie with any degree of credibility.Perhaps I am being too critical, I alas I am not a kid anymore but I'd hoped for a bit more pragmatism to broaden its appeal. The plot really had some potential for something bigger and better, its potential reminded me of ""Starman"" from 1984 or ""Contact"" from 1997. I think just a bit more thought may have had me thinking this movie exceeds the puerile category.",Race to Witch Mountain
95,jmelvin1-1,Painfully close to a great movie,7,14 March 2009,"First of all, it's not great. Second, any of the reviewers who talk about the original being a classic, I was 11 in 1975. Give me a break. It was typical of the Disney crap released at this time. Finally, when I say close to great, I mean in an ET/Iron Giant way. Instead, it's more along the lines of Cocoon.This is a good movie, and at times, it IS great. But as a whole, it falls short. Much of the film is typical. You know, Aliens are good, men in black are bad, action, chase, environment message, yada yada. Here's where it's better than your typical sci-fi action family film.1. Everyone except Carla Gugino (Dr. Alex Freidman) is excellent in their rolls. Even she isn't particularly bad, just not as good. There are some good cameos. Gary Marshall is great. 2. The action: while this is PG, it doesn't shy away from violence or guns. But the catch is when Dwayne Johnson and the teen-Aliens are running from an Alien Bounty hunter early on, the teens look scared. Anna Sophia Robb's eyes really deliver a sense of vulnerability. I found this as effective as the Train Tunnel chase.3. It is rather dark for a PG film. The men in black are a culvert group from our federal government, who point their loaded weapons constantly at innocent US citizens. The film briefly makes the parallel to the Alien Bounty Hunter, who is a military agent from the teen- aliens' planet. Washington is mentioned behind the men in black. They want to kill our beloved Alien teens.4. As with most great Sci-Fi, it relates to our times. Our protagonist teens have no rights because they are illegal aliens. The Men In Black are out of control. Granted, this would work better if Bush was still president, but still, it directly plays on the reality that the executive branch of our government has unchecked power.5. Two sections of the movie takes place around a sci-fi convention. This allows for plenty of gags that remind us that the film makers didn't take this movie too seriously.Now, if this isn't your kind of film, don't be tempted to see it. But for family action, yes. For Sci Fi, it's a must see. For a Sci fi action flick, it does everything well, except the ending. And that's its fault. It is the typical corn ball alien ending (al-la Cocoon, or Splash). After the first two acts being so strong, it's too bad.Let's compare this to Bolt, since both are PG family Disney fare. After a poor second act, Bolt delivered with a rather emotion resolution. With Race to Witch Mountain, Act 3 becomes a Ron Howard formula. Strange, as Act 1 and Act 2 were almost good enough to be a must see for everyone.How could this film have delivered better in the end? First of all, play up the teen-aliens sacrificing themselves to save our world. Environment, so it reminds us of ""This Island Earth"". And Sarah dies making this sacrifice. Now, Seth and Jack stay strong until the end, when they finally let loose with the tears. Sarah's innocence was very effective in this movie, and this would be just emotionally devastating. But in the sequel we discover that Sarah's body has been reproduced, and her soul was stored in Jack Bruno's brain (think Star Trek 2 and 3). So he has a sudden fetish for female teen accents and a strange fascination with Hannah Montana. Would you pay to see Dwane Johnson air singing with a Hannah Montana wig, earrings, and a bow in his hair? I think so. So, Disney may have missed the boat on this.

I heard this is a remake and it seems that it is not a real good one.Dwayne Johnson should stop making this kind of movie before his movie career goes down in smokes.

Scenes where traditionally someone would die in most films of this nature, they are either badly injured, but will live, OR simply not mentioned/shown dying.Disney does know how to make a family film that can rely on plot and story, over violence and questionable content.

The scene where Seth slips out of the cab and causes the car following them to crash was probably my favorite scene in the movie.Unfortunately the negatives of this movie by far out weigh the positives. The big bad Cipher(sp?) that was following them was easily killed. The Secret Service guys were always easily lost. The few scenes that required high quality special effects (the floating objects in the car, and the bullets at the end) were all extremely fake looking and cartoonish. There was not enough character development. The most HIGH security place is easily penetrated by a Ufologist and a cab driver. What was the whole point in the big ""mafia goons"" following Jack except to ""attack"" him for a few seconds in the whole movie?

The first 20 minutes is a blinding blur of wild editing and camera movement that completely loses any sense of wonder. eg. when the human beings encounter the downed spacecraft you should have amazed characters marvelling at something they've never seen before accompanied by some kind of horner or williams heart strings.

105,clueless_man16,A sci-fi film for kids. Simple.,5,26 December 2009,"So i was searching the local library for a DVD and i happened upon this title. Being a fan of Anna-Sophia Robb since Terabithia, it was inevtiable that i would pick this up. Now, for the practical and technical review. #1. Acting I was in no way shape or form attracted to the film by The Rock. Dwayne portrays your average, touchy, yet level-headed every day guy. His comedic timing with the humorous dialogue was on par, but nothing deep, moving, sensational, or definitive about his performance whatsoever. Anna Sophia Robb. Should I be commenting on Carla Guginno first? Nah. AnnaSophia played the role of Leslie in the film adaptation of the children's book Bridge to Terabithia. The film made me cry. Nuff said. This film, made me groan. The dialogue provded to her is limiting and stiff, giving her little chance to prove her potential. As some have said, they found her performance to be over-dramatic and whiny. This is not fair. She had a script and did her best with it ( though the perpetually worried look she sports throughout the movie is not pleasant). Shes the innocent, vulnerable girl, so what was she to do? The end scene, however, did nothing at all for her career. Shame, really. Shes a secondary character once more, so Im hoping her future project Dear Eleanor (under direction of the dude who brought us Princess diaries) will proide her some meat to chew on. Carla Gugino. The scientist in search of life on other planets. We recognize her from spy kids and Night at The Museum. She's merely there to provide a pretty face for Dwayne to drool over and to provide a ""mother figure"" for the aliens. Right. Prepare to be unamazed by her linear presence. Alexander Ludwig. Ummm, who? Well, he provided a strong, sharp, pretty cool character. His ability to control his molecular density was not over the top original, but hey, its something to look at. His dialogue is not unlike that of a computer owners manual, yet his facial features and expressions make up for it. I guess.... There was cameo i heard, though I recognized none. The Italian- new-york guy was rather amusing in his brief bit, thats all.#2: Camera work. Hey, I saw everything I needed to see, so I'm happy.#3 Sound. It's your usual big-fat orchestra soundtrack. Strings, horns, percussion, yadayadayada. Oh, and the vocalizing when the UFO flies over the mountain. Unique is the sound of Ciphons laser blasts. Besides that, its all so very boring for the ears..# 4 Effects. OK, why is there a jungle in the fridge> No, more importantly, why does the jungle look like a vegetated Costco with the old halloween decorations still lit and lying around? The alien is fine. Just fine. Scenes where people are knocked into the air and stuff are made to look pretty good, though the laws of physics are often disobeyed. Laser fire: not bad. Explosions: What else does a Hollywood explosion look like? AnnaSophia robbs telekinetic powers: they're alright. The scene where for some vague reason the bullets ricotchet off of our three heroes is just so..... horrible. Absolutely horrible.Conclusion: I didn't mind it. Really. I didn't. The acting keeps you rather entertained with its polished mediocrity. The story line is perfectly simple for the childs mind. The violence is your typical shoot-the-alien-that-can't-be-hurt-by-bullets type action, along with two extremely brief yet satisfying kick-butt scenes, plus a part where The Rock beats a sand bag with bare fists. I can watch it with my little bros for temporary kicks. I am glad no one spent 19.99 on it, though.

106,gypsycaine-351-934643,Started slow but ended up quite enjoyable when I gave it a chance.,9,3 August 2021,"I got the DVD out of the library and watched it. My attention span for movies is less now that I've gotten older, but I also have housework, kids, etc to take me away from watching a movie straight through. I watched up to the scene right before where we first see Seth do his thing, and I wasn't too into it so I stopped. Yesterday was a month or so. I had been jonesing for the original series along with a few other things on Disney+ (Loki looked amazing) so reactivated my membership and then started with Escape then to Return and then stared at Race. All right, I'll give it another chance. My opinion was that it was a vehicle for the Rock to look bad ass in and draw in money.Then I started from the moment I had ended and watched Seth. And then the kids did their thing and we got to the point of the fare drop off and things continued to go beyond that. I had already had the cameos (except Cheech) mentioned to me, but I'd like to think that Tina/Tia ""talked"" to the kids when she took them back to clean them up; that she was still the same Tia from the first movie and that she and Tony had established themselves in Stony Creek to help lead other children to where they needed to go. Just these children weren't following the old plan; they had mentioned the refuges earlier connecting the two movies after grabbing the ""results machine"". It's a bit too pat to have Anthony (Tony) and Tina (Tia) with the original actors to not think this way. Like in Return, Tia's able to deliver memories at flash speed so we can assume Sara can do similarly.The only thing that didn't make me squeal when I saw/heard about it from Harlan was that Witch Mountain was a fortress. It made no sense to me. It had been the haven of the refuges. How did it end up in the military hands? That part spoiled it a bit for me because it put me outside the movie and the questions sort of made me not want to give it that extra star. It was never explained.Was it a good movie once I gave it a chance? Yes. Was it a great movie? Not so much. It WAS a Rock-let-me-show-off vehicle, but as time went on the other actors were able to make it their own too. You hated the bad guy, felt bad for the junior bad guy that kept wanting a gun. I really enjoyed Alex the doctor and thought the chemistry between her and the Rock. Was there too much action? At times. The Siphon was HEAVILY used and though I understand the reasons for the destruction it reaped, it was a HELL lot of damage and bloodshed (Disney style) and it looked like death. I don't think the Rock caused death at all. Little kids might be scared of the movie and the PG rating is well earned because of that, but the tension is well mixed with humor and the Rock has a wonderful delivery of these sarcastic one liners too. I did cringe at the bumper stick. Dad was a car dealer and I was taught. NEVER put a bumper sticker or it'll take a couple thousand off the car resale value.Watch it with an open heart, a bowl of popcorn and a 32 oz pop and a few buddies to poke fun at it.

All in all the story was good. The acting. Well Mr. Dwayne Johnson was funny. the kids,Anna Sophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig.Their acting was fine. As for Carla Gugino she was did fine as well. It was nice to see some of the original actor who played in the movie. Good cameos.That is alway nice when they do that. So go see it.It is for the family. The original is better, but give it a chance. You'll enjoy it and you'll have fun talking about it after wards.So go. It's good to go.",Race to Witch Mountain
115,blackbuster_critic,Great for the family!,7,13 March 2009,"I just saw this movie about an hour ago, and I gotta say I was impressed. I'm not big on remakes of classics, and I was kinda turned off by The Rock being in the movie, but I ended up being entertained quite well. Surprisingly, I didn't expect so many people to catch The Rock's elbow blow. XD He kicked some major ass in the movie. The movie is basically about two alien children with powers, that employ The Rock, who is a taxi driver, to take them to their destination, to find some alien object; and later to their ship. They have to achieve this all while being chased by the government agents. Gun fire, explosions, alien weapons, and alien powers all rolled into one film. This movie is a great movie to take the family to see, or you could even go see it yourself. Even with all the action, and The Rock smacking heads, and the great chase scenes, they managed to put in a pinch of funny into the film.",Race to Witch Mountain
116,kwaski,"Boring, stiff and rushed",3,5 May 2009,"I gave this movie three stars for the three things I liked about it. Seeing Tia all grown up. Seeing Tony all grown up. Seeing the reporter in the beginning, thinking she looked familiar, and then she said, ""This is Natalie Gann, reporting for (such and such).."" It was Meredith Salenger, title character from the 80's movie ""The Journey of Natty Gann""...one of the best Disney movies ever. That was really fun and unexpected for me, who loved that movie so much. Those three appearances were there only thing I liked about this movie. My kids thought it was ""OK."" Wish I had saved my small fortune to take my family of 6 and waited for the DVD. This movie had no emotion, no heart. Do your kids a favor and rent or buy the original ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" It's a hundred times better. In the original, the alien children had powers but acted human, I grew to care about them, I felt for the old man who helped them, he had emotion, he was believable as a crusty old man whose heart was softened as he helped the kids. By the end you will care about them. In this movie you won't. The special effects in this movie of course surpass those in the original by far- but it had NO HEART.",Race to Witch Mountain
117,willythebetzel,"Very fun movie, should have a sequel",10,28 July 2013,"I saw Race to Witch Mountain recently when I saw it show up on TV. I read a brief synopsis for it, and saw the cast, and I decided to give it a shot as it sounded like a good movie. Like most of the other Disney live-action movies, I found Race to Witch Mountain to be rather entertaining and fun. Not having seen the original 1975 film, I went into the movie with an open mind. When I was done watching it, my first thought that this movie established a new re-imagining of Witch Mountain and I felt that this movie should have a sequel. However, it is more than four years later and a sequel does not appear to be coming, which is a huge disappointment. I really was looking forward to watching more movies surrounding the principal cast and I could easily picture where Disney could have taken the franchise. The soundtrack was pretty good, the cast really seemed to be trying to play their roles well, and while the story is nothing ground-breaking, it was still entertaining enough to fill its 98 minute running time. I appreciate the combined efforts of the cast into making this production an enjoyable experience. Overall, I recommend the film for anyone looking to have fun for 98 minutes.",Race to Witch Mountain
118,robertuk-69390,great film,10,3 April 2020,As with all dewight johnsons films great story line a bit lose but still good action is good the film i believe has had other film but still good like them all,Race to Witch Mountain
119,mia_marauder,Good Movie for Kids-OK for Adults,7,19 March 2009,"This is and is not a remake of the original Witch Mountain movie. It's more follows the guidelines and then takes off on its own in a more modern twist. If you liked the old one, you will probably still like this one too.The actors did a pretty good job all the way around. The main bad secret agent guy was a really flat character, while everyone else was more dynamic. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was great in this movie. He really keeps it going for the audience and is really funny. The kids are good as well. All the others did an alright job.The plot has good twists to it and has multiple sides that are all crashing in together at the same time. The flow of the movie is a little jerky in a couple spots, but overall is an action packed ride.The CGI effects are well done and believable. I enjoyed getting to see that aspect come to life, where the original Witch Mountain could only dream of seeing such cool stuff! Overall it is a good movie. Your kids will really like it and you will enjoy it as well. I recommend going and seeing it to anybody!",Race to Witch Mountain
120,Gmechanic,Unique story that made me race in nostalgia!!,10,14 March 2009,"Despite a good amount of bad reviews, people are flocking to see this film! I wonder if it's the picky old men that don't find a kids film decent enough for a proper work that disappoint me. I mean, who worse to judge a kid's movie than an adult? At least a teenager has still got the perspective of a child...The film really brought me back to good times at the theaters. I wasn't around for the original so, I can't compare the two, and went in not knowing what to expect.Initially, you could go in and see all the things structurally or aesthetically incorrect and unpleasing about the story film-wise. However, if you take the movie for what it is, you'll see that it's truly the beautifully crafted action-adventure every kid longs to experience and captured within the mysticism and excitement of a good space story using just enough cgi to compliment the film, without overpowering it's actors as so many movies do today. It promises a simple story with inspiring ideals and experiences woven into its heart.So, I couldn't help but put myself in the story for this one, and became completely immersed in the race. The great plot, unique characters, and pulse-racing adventure will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end!",Race to Witch Mountain
121,per-jakob,Should come with a warning label,1,22 April 2009,"Just came back from spending an hour and a half in a movie theater wishing I had stayed at home.The plot is so-so and full of loopholes, the acting is surprisingly lame (I really like Carla Gugino, but here she gives her weakest performance to date), but what really irritates me is the camera-work and editing.In the style of all to many movies today, the camera is never still. I mean never. The camera-work is supposed to mimic the authenticity of a hand-held camera I suppose, to create action, but the only thing it creates is motion sickness. Then add an editing that just throws images at you in a furious pace and you get something that just is not watchable. It gave me a splitting headache. In my opinion; this kind of camera-work and editing is used to hide the lack of plot and should come with a warning label.Don't waste your money on this, I would have liked mine back.",Race to Witch Mountain
122,imaplowboy,OK movie but not what I expected.,5,17 March 2009,"First of all, I would not consider this a remake of either of the earlier movies Escape to and Return From Witch Mountain.I would consider this movie closer to the Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the one where everyone was making mountains out of whatever they had handy and ended up going to the actual mountain where a secret government operation was going on to actually attempt to communicate with the aliens, in which they somehow succeeded.In the original movies, Witch Mountain was a place where the aliens parked their spaceships (or lived) and has nothing to do with the government at all. I also felt that the title was misleading as well.I do feel that this movie would have gone off better as a sequel to the original two movies other than a remake attempt. It should have stayed along the lines of the originalsI also think that a good story line would of been that Tony and Tia (or Anthony & Tina) have grown up and get married and have kids of their own. While taking their kids to visit Earth something happens to their parents, then the two kids find out that they have powers and have to get help from someone to get them back to Witch Mountain to get help to rescue their parents. Something along the lines of the original movies with some variations to avoid being an exact copy of the originals.In conclusion, from the Witch Mountain perspective, it doesn't even come close to the original movies, however, from the Close Encounters perspective, the movie wasn't half bad",Race to Witch Mountain
123,cazth,Awesome acting,9,11 April 2009,"While the plot was predictable at times, and some plot points were a bit unbelievable, what saved this film was the unbelievably AMAZING acting. The two child stars who played aliens Sara (AnnaSophia Robb) and Seth (Alexander Ludwig) were absolutely phenomenal, and wrapped their way around your heart. While it was a Disney film so you know it would all turn out okay, the acting and music was enough to get your heart thumping in suspense as you waited for the bad guys to rear up again.The movie was very fast paced yet very coherent. There were several really funny moments, with more adult humour slid in every now and again to keep the older groups happy, yet still plenty of hilarious moments for both children and adults of all ages. As you walked out of the theatre, you were definitely satisfied with money well spent.I'm 18 and really enjoyed it, and all the kids in the audience definitely did as well. I recommend it to any fans of fantasy/sci-fic/action, and to anyone who loves to see an amazing cast of actors really on fire together.",Race to Witch Mountain
124,CarltonSummers,Very good movie,8,7 June 2009,"lots of action, saw it with my kids and it got a bit intense but they both loved it. this movie was much better then the Keanu Reeves movie about the ""day the earth stood still"". Unlike that movie, all of the action in this one was not shown in previews. Also like the plot and reason why the aliens was there. It was logical and not insulting to the intelligence. The connection between Rock and the kids was genuine and you didn't get that feeling that he was overly sensitive to their needs just because they were kids and you didn't feel that he was playing a bad guy role to an unrealistic degree. Normally I like my aliens in non-human form, but the kids were presentable enough so that my kids could relate and fear for them at the appropriate time.

125,kingspades,This movie made me realize something,3,19 July 2009,"Watching this movie made me wish I was 12 years old again. Because if I was, I might have been able to enjoy it. As another reviewer depicted, this is a great movie...if you're a teenager. And I agree. I have a tendency to watch movies based on IMDb ratings, and being a sci-fi fan, anything above 4 stars is sufficient for me. But I myself decided to give it 3 stars, however, that is only because of my age. Hence the title of my review as I realized IMDb should have age-group rating. So that I could see what people my age rate it, compared to what younger viewers rate. Had I been 12 years old, I might consider rating this movie an 8 or so. My conclusion is that if you're older than 15, this movie is going to be a waste of time, but if you're younger, I'd definitely recommend it.",Race to Witch Mountain
126,adewodu_omotola,Race to witch mountain,10,10 November 2009,"The movie opens with a vignette talking about UFO's and conspiracies. It then opens to a scene where a group of government agents track a flying object that flies into Earth's atmosphere over Las Vegas. Henry Burke (Ciaran Hinds) gives the orders for his fellow agents to follow where it crashed and get whatever information they can. Meanwhile, in town, cab driver Jack Bruno (Dwayne Johnson) picks up a couple of dudes in Storm trooper outfits, who speak in robotic voices to take them to the UFO Convention at Planet Hollywood. He takes their plastic rifles and points to a sign in his cab that says ""NO WEAPONS"". Meanwhile, back in the desert, Burke and his men examine footprints, while something unseen rustles in the bushes, watching them. Through further analysis from his right hand man Matheson (Tom Everett Scott), they've taken humanoid form. Burke slowly backtracks how the two managed to get out of the desert overnight (the analysis is done when they get back to the office) and discover the two of them, disguised as teens, snick onto a senior citizen's tour, headed right into Vegas. long story short there are two teens named Seth and Sara, however, Seth found some egg-shaped thing and sets down a switch. He reaches inside and pulls out a sensor of some kind, and him and Sara are both excited. However, their excitement is short lived when the space suit guy charges after them with a laser cannon. Jack tries to hold him off, but gets knocked down. Soon, everything in the atrium is set ablaze, and Seth is knocked unconscious. Jack bewilders the space guy and gets the kids out of there as everything is blowing up around them. He gets in the cab and drives off with them in tow. He stops and asks what the heck just happened out there. The space suit guy is in hot pursuit in his spaceship, shooting at them with everything he's got. Jack drives into a train tunnel and narrowly avoids the hunter's sensors,Jack starts to drive over a bridge, and the hunter reappears, shooting at them with lasers. They enter another tunnel, and Jack discovers that a train is coming from the other way, with the spaceship in hot pursuit. Sara makes the taxicab go faster, and it manages to escape a collision while the spaceship is totaled. however, jack reveals the alien dude's ugly face. Seth goes to help Jack. The manual airlock door opens, revealing a glowing energy source at the bottom of it. The helmet falls in and is completely vaporized. The hunter and Jack continue to fight until Jack falls in, just narrowly landing on a ledge next to the energy source. The hunter comes down to finish him off, but Seth distracts him and almost makes him fall in. Jack grabs the hunter, only to pull him up, punch him in the face, and make him fall into the source",Race to Witch Mountain

128,sarrkmmm-12466,Good family movie,10,16 September 2021,"Even though this movie has a few errors in continuity it's a nice movie for the whole family. It's refreshing to see a movie where the women and young girls aren't spilling out of their clothes. Ciaran Hinds makes a perfect government ""man in black"" character. I really disliked the character of Henry Burke. He had no feelings and was your typical yes man doing whatever the government asked of him even if it meant killing someone. Annasofia Robb was great. She showed a lot of emotion and brought Sara to life. Alexander Ludwig played the typical teenager in a way I just wanted to slap him at times but by the end of the movie he had grown up quite a bit. Dwayne Johnson was a good protector and also showed a lot of emotion. The rest of the cast was also equally good in their performances. This is a great movie for the whole family to watch together. Aside from some violence there was no drugs or sexual scenes making it a good choice for families to watch together. Grab a bowl of popcorn and watch this movie. Makes for some good quality family time.",Race to Witch Mountain
129,ladystorm282001,Good family movie,9,14 March 2009,"I don't see why some people say that they don't like this movie. I thought it was a very good family oriented movie. It had a great blend of comedy and action and I found it very refreshing.I love the Rock and I think he does very well in these types of movies. I love the old Witch Mountain movies and wasn't sure at first about this one but it was different enough to be well liked by those who have watched the old ones and enough action to get the younger crowd. I also love Ciran Hinds and even though he was playing the bad guy in this movie it was nice to see him in a role that had him in most of the movie instead of bit parts, he is a great actor and I hope he gets some larger roles in the future.Over all a nice family movie.",Race to Witch Mountain
