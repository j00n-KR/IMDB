0,Horst_In_Translation,Munchhausen meets Hitlerjunge Salomon,6,19 March 2018,"""Der Hauptmann"" or ""The Captain"" is a new German 2-hour movie that premiered back in 2017, but was only released days ago to general audiences here in Germany. After making films in Hollywood for roughly 15 years and working with big names like Willis, Freeman, Malkovich and Bridges, this one is writer and director Robert Schwentke's (temporary?) return to Germany. The film with the exception of one shot is entirely in black-and-white and in my opinion, that was a good decision. The main character is played by Max Hubacher, an actor I was not too familiar until now, but he does a fine job given the fact thatg he is in basically every scene of the film. Fehling, Lau and Peschel are among Germany's most known at this point and they all play supporting characters. I must say though that the significance intended for Lau's and Peschel's characters was not really executed in a satisfying manner. Fehling does well with what he was given, even if it is not too much. This film plays during the final days of World War II and the consequence of this taking place in the battlefield and military, female characters are almost completely non-existent here. Not a problem though. The film shines through authenticity, shocking but realistic moments and eventually as a really good character study that goes way beyond the main character. The pair of Jewish entertainers in the last third of the film is another example of fine depictin and writing in terms of how differently their paths go. Guilt is a dominant subject here from start to finish and the question when evil is justified is a crucial one here all the time. Which of his actions are agreeable from the perspective that they saved his life or at least helped in saving his life? Which of his actions are just as despicable and undefendable as the ones by his tormentors? Everybody will have a different opinion on that I''m sure. i also liked the film's audio side. It was never in your face, but still elevated the material. The actors were almost all good and it is a successful return for Schwentke (the year he turns 50) without a doubt proving once more that the subject of WWII is still possible to produce quality movies even with the hundreds already existing about this darkest hour in European history of the 20th century. You just need to bring the talent creativity and approach. You could probably argue that what you see in here is not too realistic given the fact that it is all done by such a young man and how could they all be this stupid to fall for him. But then again, the one thing that destroys this argument is that it is based on real facts, a real character and to some extent all this really happened. And it is not as if he is depicted as the new messiah, that absolutely everybody falls for him: He has several antagonists in here who may believe his story, but still aren't ready to accept his authority. And that makes the watch even better, even more realistic. It was easy to care for the characters in here, to wonder what's going to happen to them next. At least for me and the longer the film went, the more curious I became if Herold would live or die. Well, it was something in-between then I guess. It is definitely impressive that this film never really dragged despite how long it is. I recommend the watch to everybody with an interest in this historic era. In my opinion this film is a success and I'm glad I saw it.",The Captain
1,kosmasp,It's the end of the ... war as we know it,8,19 May 2021,"Well maybe ""knew it"" would be better ... but that would not be as close to the song as I had in mind. Just a little nugget/hint/joke I like to make with my summary lines. Not that this is a comedy - most German movies are either known as romantic comedies/dramas or have the second world war as a topic - this obviously being the latter.This has an intersting twist with a character assuming a position and power grab, that will run throughout the movie. War is not a game and what it does with people (especially when they get into a position of power) is shown here very vividly. Very well played and acted (mostly in black and white nonetheless). If you don't have issues with the subject matter and the symbols shown, the movie might be something you want to watch. Interesting take to say the least.",The Captain
2,grantss,"Interesting, novel WW2 drama",7,6 June 2020,"Germany, April 1945. WW2 in Europe is almost over, resulting in mass desertions and disorder in German ranks. One deserter, Willi Herold, is on the run when he comes across the abandoned uniform of a Luftwaffe captain. Impersonating a captain he gathers together a rag tag group who assume the role of an anti-deserter/looter task force. Things come to a head when he is given responsibility for a camp where deserters, looters etc are detained, with dire consequences.Interesting WW2 drama, based on a true story. Quite novel in that it doesn't involve any confrontation with the enemy (well, except for one scene): the struggle is all internal. Also covers areas of WW2 that don't get much attention: the post-apocalyptic-like final days of Nazi Germany, the treatment of deserters etc and this series of events in particular.Plot is reasonably engaging, though a bit too drawn out. It could also have been more powerful: despite the events portrayed it really didn't feel that gritty or shocking. Everything just seems to happen, sometimes as if in slow motion. Maybe that's the effectiveness of the film: by the time you reach the critical moments you've become desensitised to all the killing, anarchy and atrocities. Still, it felt a bit flat to me.Great performance by Max Hubacher in the lead role. Solid supporting cast.Worth watching for a different angle on WW2. Not a must-see though.",The Captain
3,ferguson-6,corruption by power,7,26 July 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's mind-boggling how many fascinating stories - both large and small - continue to come from World War II, even 75 years later. Writer/director Robert Schwentke (RED, FLIGHTPLAN) abruptly opens his latest with a single soldier desperately running from a posse of Nazi soldiers who appear to be hunting him down. The soldier manages to escape, kicking off an incredible journey that we are informed occurred during the final two weeks of the war (April 1945). Max Hubacher stars as Willi Herold, the soldier we are to assume has deserted his military outfit and is now dirty, hungry and cold as he evades German patrols. Things change drastically for Herold when he stumbles on an abandoned suitcase neatly packed with a German Captain's coat and full uniform. We are left to wonder what happened to the officer, but do get to watch Willi's crazy next few days as he impersonates a German officer and assumes command of his situation.Circumstances result in ""Captain"" Herold gaining followers, each of whom are as lost or unwilling to continue fighting as himself. The ragtag group ends up at prison camp Aschendorfermoor ... a camp containing German deserters and looters. Herold has convinced those in charge that he has direct orders from Hitler to take command of the camp, and a horrific massacre of prisoners takes place over the next few days.While this is a stunning story ripped from historical documents, the film works even better as a psychological character study. Herold first employs his newfound power as a survival strategy, but he is soon corrupted by the power of his assumed position. We witness as some blindly follow orders, and we watch (dumbfounded) as Herold's thirst for power overtakes whatever integrity he might have had prior to the desperation injected by war. The film moves at a meticulous pace and at times feels redundant. It could have been a stellar short film, but director Schwentke uses the slow pace to allow our shock to grow as Herold evolves into a coy monster (with a fine performance from Mr. Hubacher). Filmed in stark black and white, it offers some beautiful shots from cinematographer Florian Ballhaus (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA), the son of famed cinematographer and 3 time Oscar nominee Michael Ballhaus (GANGS OF NEW YORK). The elder Ballhaus passed away in 2017, and the son continues to build his own legacy. Set in Germany during April 1945, this blend of docudrama and black comedy is a collaboration of German, Poland and France, and as a true story, packs quite a punch.",The Captain
4,deloudelouvain,The hunted becoming the hunter.,7,7 February 2019,"The most interesting and crazy part of Der Hauptmann is that it is based on a true story. Crazy as you can witness how quickly the hunted can be come the hunter. You could say he only tried to survive but the truth is that Willi Herold quickly became the person he was fleeing from and that he took some sadistic pleasure in it. Max Hubacher did a great job playing Willi Herold. Black and white movies are normally not really my thing but in this case it perfectly worked. Only one color shot was made towards the end. There are some disturbing scenes in The Captain but then again it's a war movie about Nazis so no surprise there. All the actors did a great job playing their characters, from victims to butchers. There are some satirical moments that did work in this context. An interesting but most of the time cruel story well shot.",The Captain
5,MOscarbradley,Genuinely disturbing.,8,10 April 2020,"The story told in ""The Captain"" really stretches credulity and yet it's true. A young deserter from the German army in the closing days of the War finds a captain's uniform and when he puts it on isn't just mistaken for a captain but becomes, in his own mind, a figure of great power; in fact, he becomes a mass murderer yet amazingly no-one in authority, or even the grunts he comes across, think to question his age. We are told at the end of the film that when he was charged with war crimes he was only 21 years old.This German made film looks at a shocking event in their recent history and it shows, without apology, the terrible things the Nazis did but, significantly, it doesn't condemn the German people; there are 'good' Germans here, too or rather Germans so sickened with what is happening they rebel in what little way they can. Things happen here that happen in many war films if perhaps in a more surreal fashion but fundamentally the real theme of Robert Schwentke's film is how, once an idea is planted in the mind, it ceases to be an idea and becomes a reality.Surely there must have been evidence that our young deserter, (Max Hubacher, terrific), was always a monster and putting on the uniform only gave credence to this but more significantly the uniform itself becomes a symbol of power to others. It's like those psychological experiments where simply saying something is fact makes it so, particularly if you have a prop, only in this case it was no experiment but quite possibly the very personification of evil. ""The Captain"" will chill you to the bone.",The Captain
6,westsideschl,DVD Subtitles?,8,23 January 2019,"Subtitles are important for several reasons - viewers w/hearing issues; poor English enunciation; poor audio. Some of the low ratings come from either viewer's DVD players failing to load the subtitles or they just don't like the distraction. My copy autoloaded subtitles just fine.
As to the film itself:
Humorously it seems in movies of someone being pursued through a forest that they almost always find a tree root or log to hide under at the last moment & pursuers always seem to stop atop the log. Now I know the next time I'm pursued.
Interesting film statement on human behavior that perhaps within all humans (well, males at least) that when conditions arise the innermost beast (sorry beasts) in them comes forth to show how inhumane we are meant to be. So, our once escaping deserter finds himself suddenly in the role of the pursuer.",The Captain
7,ops-52535,"raw,raw,raw.....",8,10 January 2019,"What i most of all liked in this historical war drama,was the brilliantly used black and white production, this really touched several strings of feelings when watching this film, like schindlers list, very well done by the director,and production team, particularly the light crew,that seems like having great experience on b/w productions.its a raw film, and the two main themes are authority and desertations, soldiers returning alone or in small groups from the front,are picked up and merely shuffled into soldier prison camp, awaiting the military tribunal to decide wether or not they are kujons . its the bitter flavour of war,being british,american,german,russian or japanese, they all punished the war tired young men and woman, momentarily with quick executions,or with imprisonment.the acting are very good,the characters are put on the edge, i especially liked ''herr freitag'' who expresses his fears and disbelief with high standard.
in the beginning i started to wonder if this was some kind of comedy flick,but i soon found out what a harsh hell of a life described in the film. the story is said to be a true story, and that makes it even worse to imagine. what i miss in the plot is where and when things happens,that wouldve brought the message of the story even further ahead. i loved the use of original language with english subtitles.( i wish norwegian filmmakers had done the same,like in netflix's u-22 of july, where norwegian actors stumbles away with 6th grade school english.)but its a good film, believe me, it is not for everyone though,and if youre fainthearted,or have a vivid ability to glue vision to your memory,then do make a ''halt'' when its discomforting you,because its not getting better.i watched with 3 long breaks ,just to devour.",The Captain
8,Thanos_Alfie,Nice movie...,7,3 January 2019,"""The Captain"" is a History - War movie in which we are two weeks before the end of World War II and we watch a young German soldier trying to survive when he finds a Nazi captain's uniform. He pretends to be a captain and his behavior changes very much making the same monstrous mistakes that his perpetrators did before him and he was trying to escape from.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot and many good scenes. I liked the direction which was made by Robert Schwentke who is also the writer and I believe he did a great job on it. He combined very some historical events with his story and also showed us the cruelty of Nazi and what they did or what they were capable of doing. Another thing that I believe it's very important is the evolve of his main character, he started as a young frightened boy and in the end, he had courage, pride, and honor. It reminded me of the movie ""Das Experiment"" which was also presented very well what can happen if power is given to the wrong people. Regarding the interpretations, I liked the interpretation of Max Hubacher who played as Willi Herold and he was very good at his role, Frederick Lau who played as Kipinski and Milan Peschel who played as Freytag.In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Captain"" is a nice movie with an interesting plot, some very good interpretations, and a very good direction. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and I also believe that if you are a fan of war movies then you really have to watch this movie since it presents the true face of war.",The Captain
9,Tweetienator,Of the Beast in Man,8,8 February 2019,"A friend recommended this one to me and I was not disappointed - Der Hauptmann (The Captain) is a fine little movie about the last days of the 3rd Reich in Germany. Shot in black and white it tells us a true story - about a deserter, who finds a captain's uniform, takes on the role and the commanding power of a captain - and commits some terrible war crimes.The movie captures good the final mad days in war destroyed Germany, and we watch some very disturbing, grotesque and thought provoking scenes of mass hysteria and psychosis. Der Hauptmann got not the biggest production, but for sure more interesting and ""entertaining"" as to watch some ""schrott"" like the last Oscar-burdened Dunkirk.A German contribution to the WWII genre with some real quality like Untergang/Downfall (2004), with a far smaller budget/production of course.",The Captain
10,Turfseer,"No ""Good Germans"" populate above average tale of Wehrmacht Imposter captain in waning days of World World II",8,15 October 2021,"Der Hauptmann (or The Captain in English), released in 2018, was written and directed by Robert Schwentke, a German-born, American trained filmmaker. Because of his training, he doesn't bring an exclusively German sensibility to his treatment of the Nazi era which is what this film is about.Schwentke makes it clear in an interview featured as part of the DVD bonus tracks, that historically speaking, unlike most German films about the Nazis, he was determined to make a film focusing mainly about the perpetrators. Schwentke argues there's usually a ""good German"" inserted into most films of German cinema as a counterbalance to the dastardly Nazis. In Der Hauptmann, to his credit, Schwentke offers no such counterbalance.The film begins with 19 year old Luftwaffe paratrooper, Willi Herold (Max Hubacher), who appears to be a deserter in the last few weeks of World War II, being chased by military police commandoes in a truck in the area of Lower Saxony, Germany. Schwentke cleverly creates a scenario in which we (the filmgoer) initially sympathize with the beleaguered Herold who manages to escape the MPs and avoid being captured and shot as a deserter.Fortune smiles on Herold who finds a German captain's uniform inside a trunk on the back seat of an abandoned car. When a soldier, Freytag (Milan Peschel), shows up claiming he's separated from his unit but now pledges allegiance to Herold and offering to act as his driver, the recently hunted paratrooper suddenly gets the idea that he will pretend to be a real Wehrmacht (German army) captain.As things progress, stragglers attach themselves to Herold's newly proclaimed unit named Kampfgruppe Herold. In contrast to the quiet and seemingly decent Freytag, Kapinski (Frederick Lau) is a sadistic drunk, who Herold must prove he's even more capable of extreme violence in a game of one upmanship. After Herold outwits an MP on a muddy road by claiming he was acting under direct orders of ""The Fuhrer,"" Herold proves his true Nazi credentials by murdering a deserter held captive by townspeople in a nearby town.Note that even the civilians here are a nasty bunch and Schwentke begins to make good on his promise that there will be no ""good Germans"" in his film this time around. Meanwhile, we were expecting to identify with Herold in the beginning of the film, believing that he would use his phony position to do some good. Quite the opposite-Herold gradually turns into a true monster of a Nazi. It's not important what his motives are-it's just we become mesmerized by how Herold pulls his ruse off-which of course is unexpected, especially given his youth.The main part of the film brings Herold to a prison camp for German Army deserters where the bulk of the action takes place. Schwentke does a great job in showing how the Nazis played off various bureaucratic departments against one another. Some of the officers there actually suspect that Herold is a fake but they soon realize that he'll ""do the dirty work"" and take complete responsibility for actions they consider distasteful and beneath them.It's Herold who arranges for the execution of many prisoners in the camp with Kapinski primarily carrying out his orders. The decent Freytag backs down after Herold orders him to finish off one of the prisoners who's dying in one of the recently dug killing pits. Schwentke wisely deals with the violence by showing one short scene involving Kapinski beating a prisoner inside the camp barracks but mostly utilizes long shots to convey the atrocities (corpses in the pits following the massacre are not shown!).The only other person who objects to Herold's brutal actions is the camp commandant who is overruled by an official at the Justice Department. He doesn't really object to the fact that all the deserters were executed but rather that the approval did not go through the chain of command.After the massacre, Herold and the other soldiers have a party which Schwentke remarks was designed for the men to reduce the psychological stress of participating in such brutal activities. There are two effective scenes here: the first features two former actors (now prisoners) performing an antisemitic skit which the soldiers find extremely amusing; and the second in which Herold ties four prisoners together and has the actors shoot them one by one (one of the actors chooses to commit suicide). Even the wife of an SA officer gets in the act along with Herold himself in finishing off the tied together prisoners.The level of sadism is hard to watch and underscores Schwentke's point that the ""dignity"" of the Wehrmacht during World War II was a myth-along with the civilian population who also often joined in all the sadistic activities.The climax involves Herold and his group engaging in debauchery in a local hotel-some of these scenes go on for a bit too long but we get to see a new side of Herold as he drops his usual sadistic demeanor and acts more like a young child enjoying himself at a party.Toward the climax we also find out that all this was based on a true story-a fact which Schwentke keeps hidden from us since the beginning. Herold's fate is revealed in his court martial in which he avoids summary execution and is eventually sent back to the front until later being captured and executed by the British.Hubacher does a marvelous job conveying his infatuation with his newfound power. Schwentke's direction is spot on as he exposes the ""dirty secret"" of much of prior German cinema.",The Captain
11,RodrigAndrisan,Absolutely worth seeing!,7,22 June 2020,"A disturbing film for sensitive people. Some actors are very good, others less good. The story is true.

12,billcr12,Brutal,5,17 January 2019,"The Captain is based on a true story taking place near the end of WWII. A deserter comes upon a car with a captain's uniform and assumes the role of the officer. He hoodwinks his fellow Nazi's at a camp and orders the executions of them without any trial. The film is in black and white and reminded me of the TV series ""Hogan's Heroes."" It is dark and depressing film with good acting but I just could not get into it. I am surprised at the high numerical rating. The two hour running time certainly feels long and unending. I was relieved when it finally ended.",The Captain

That's a movie that has ""leaders"" in its stellar acting, brilliant flow & development, meticulous attention to all aspects of their lives, the brutal & honest depiction of those harrowing times from their perspective together with the clarified ending.That's as honest and gripping as you get, with most seriousness and a gem from Germany.I'm so glad that the movie was made in Europe; Germany WWII storyline, German actors and German movie. A truly unique film, not for the faint-hearted.",The Captain
14,AudioFileZ,In War Power & Evil Walk Hand In Hand Feeding Both,7,13 January 2019,"The Captain is a stark look into the human elements of self-preservation, power, and greed as it morphed a German Wehrmacht private into a monster. The use of a private is of course to say you are at the bottom of an organization sworn to to serve his country. The fact he is a deserter makes him even lower than the common criminal as he is betraying his oath to put his fellow man and country first. He, is hunted for immediate execution. Narrowly escaping he is still in an extremely dire situation. In this darkness a serrendipitous situation arises he feels may be a way out. Finding a captains deserted car with the captain's suitcase provides the captain's uniform. For survival he decides he must become the captain who must be deceased. What follows is a kind of keeping one's wits in perpetuating a huge bluff. Facing constant danger the private turned captain morphs into a kind of monster himself. As his moral compass sinks lower he becomes all of the evil he was surely sick of when he chose desertion. The deeper into his ruse the more murderous he becomes until you wonder if he ever had a conscience at all. He seems to bring out the worst in others as he quite by chance seems to sideline those who would reveal him. When he finally is caught in his evil morass it seems the jig is up and he will be held accountable...or will he as the lack of bonafide morals once more arises.The Captain is expert in slow character revealing in the chaos and immoral waging of war. It takes a powerless character from sympathy to a evil peak where he lords over life and death only for his own ego and survival. The questions are many such as if life depends on the death of innocents is that something a very average man would choose? In all wars we know this is called acceptable collateral damage to which, perhaps, this film may give one pause.I think the black and white cinematography fits this story so well it's like an enveloping huge disaster looming itself. Much like a train wreck you watch while not turning away we see the evil of a man develop. It's fascinating and horrible at the same time. I think this film is well worth the watch. As the ending credits begin we get the film's only comedic relief in which we see the players in character and in the period Nazi wagon drive through modern Berlin interacting with confused locals. As absurd as this is what plays out in the previous hour and a half is of a higher level with deranged evil.",The Captain
15,RatedVforVinny,"Out of Germany, a freaking awesome War movie!",9,28 August 2020,"Based on a true and rather bizarre tale, of a deserter in the dying weeks of WW2, who finds an officers (Luftwaffe) uniform and takes control of his own special unit. Whether the character is already half crazed, or has just suddenly gained a power lust; he goes on to commit a series of the most horrific war crimes.

20,bastos,A tale of power during WWII,7,30 April 2021,"There's nothing like a good old Nazi WWII movie to cheer you up... Robert Schwentke was an odd choice to direct such a movie, as his previous works were more style than substance and this seemed to require a more grounded director. But he surprised me here with a very dark story that holds no punches. And he sure can shoot a movie and this one is no exception with a gorgeous B/W cinematography that grabs you from the start. I often say that it's very hard to do a bad WWII movie, because it is such a powerful and visceral time in history with so many incredible tales that there always seems to be an angle from which to tell a good story. This one is no different, with the novelty here being that it is told by Germans and doesn't hold back on the atrocities. It is a hard movie to watch about power and how it affects people when they're not prepared on how to handle it. My only complaint is that tonally the movie is all over the place, going from dead serious to satire sprinkled with some tasteless and grotesque scenes that may throw some people off and that's where a more grounded director might have helped. But it's still such a powerful story and it's so well shot that I have no problems recommending it.",The Captain

You will find people killing other people for no reason. You will find people blindly obeying opaque, senseless and inhumane orders. In a word: war, and all that leads up to it, and all that lingers long afterwards and stains everyone touched by it.
It should also serve as a reminder that anyone is potentially capable of becoming a monster, given the right set of circumstances and given the right drive. People always have a choice.

I just saw it for the first time yesterday and the film I saw was completely in color not B&W as many reviewers have mentioned and is listed as such on IMDb.Still it was a powerful piece of cinema, based on a true story showing how easy it is to slip into committing atrocities as this one time deserter does here. Max Haubacher was very convincing but I thought Milan Peschel as Freytag stole the show, I would have liked to know what happened to his character in the end.The one thing that didn't really ring true for me was that it takes places two weeks before the end of the war yet all the towns they go through are completely untouched by it.I understand he went on to commit war crimes in the Netherlands but this wasn't shown.I have found Germany to make some of the best WW2 films, like Das Boot and Der Untergang and this is one of them.",The Captain

While the actual historic criminal acts of murder are depicted in the movie, the graphic nature of it is not really thrown in your face. You can fill in the blanks.
In authenticity, this movie is way up there. Uniforms, weapons and vehicles are all in line with the era.When you see artillery and aerial bomb explosions in this movie, what is depicted is the same as actual artillery and aerial bombing of that time. They did a fine job replicating it..The movie draws you in and it is gripping to say the least. I give it a solid 8 stars.",The Captain
29,Bachfeuer,"Timely for Germany, alas",8,24 August 2018,My compliments to sfviewer123 for picking up on the Captain from Köpenick lineage. Phony nostalgia for the 3rd Reich is one of the strands of present-day populist agitation in Germany. What a fine antidote for that this film is!,The Captain
30,dukeb0y,Too realistic for me,8,31 August 2019,"I rented this movie on a trip to the library. I like World War II movies. It's a very dark story, and as another reviewer said, filmed in black and which adds to the dark theme. I didn't know it was based on a true story, till after the movie was over!I thought it would be a story of how a deserter, who gathered other deserters and made it back to the Allied lines. Was I wrong!The heart is deceitful wicked and it certainly comes out in the story. After finding a uniform and making up a false story, he takes over a prison camp and...kills other deserters!And I thought he would have some sympathy, since HE was a deserter.Well, glad I watched it. I looked it up on Wikipedia, and the guy ends up paying for his crimes after the war. Only a one-time view for me, it was a strong of a movie.(Minor nit picking, the street lights are on at night, I'm sure that stage of the war they would have been off.)Bottom line, if you like true war stories, watch this one, no no happy endings.",The Captain
31,BestBenedikt,Very inconsistent,5,19 October 2018,"Considering Robert Schwentke's previous movies, I don't think he was the right director for this film. I didn't particularly like his past work, and DER HAUPTMANN makes no difference. It is obviously a story worth being told, since the script is based on true events and Willi Herold did in fact exist and commit all those crimes depicted here, but the movie is extremely inconsistent and doesn't know what it wants to be.The first scene right away felt very odd, with the ""Feldgendarmerie"" (basically military police) chasing Herold, simultaneously shooting, shouting and playing a trumpet. The depiction of events continues like that, in some scenes deadly serious and in others very grotesque and satirical, and it doesn't match well. Schwentke should have just sticked to one tone and went with it. Especially in the last act, when the main event is already over, the story goes completely nuts, with the main characters partying and apparently forgetting the war surrounding them.You also never get an authentic feeling of World War II being in its last phase. I can't even specify what exactly I felt offputting, but the film just doesn't convey an authentic atmosphere. Especially the first part of the movie felt quite cheap and ""acted"".This leads me to my biggest problem, which was the depiction of Herold's character, whose motivation remained very unclear and whose decisions just didn't make a whole lot of sense. I know that the core story here actually happened, but the portrayal of the main character's actions in the film just isn't consequent. At first he obviously just wants to escape death when dressing up as a captain, then he suddenly turns into a complete psychopath within a day or so. At least that's what his horrific actions are depicted as: the actions of a psychopath, who suddenly has full command. But Max Hubacher's acting just doesn't convey that. I don't know if the problem lies in the script or in his acting to be honest, probably a little of both.To sum it up, this film was a mess tonally as well as story-wise. I know what Schwentke was trying to do, showing the problematic nature of power relations and the exploitation of those. But the result just felt weird and, most importantly for a story like that, it just didn't feel authentic and hence doesn't do the real victims of Herold justice.",The Captain
32,brockfal,Could have been better,6,12 December 2020,"An interesting visceral and vivid film examining nazism and its evil effects, though not wholly successfully. The first hour or so is excellent and feels authentic and convincing, however, the movie then gets bogged down into excessive and unnecessarily long winded and outlandish scenes which, frankly, get rather boring. A pity, as it's beautifully filmed in black and white and well acted throughout. It could have been much much better as the true story it's based on if it had been used could have made it a great rather than partially successful film.",The Captain
33,House-of_cards,Could have been much better!,5,27 September 2018,"The film had all the makings of a story that is not the standard WW2 style, It started with tension, fear and expectation but sadly descended in to a comedic series of events. Some of the events at the camp were gritty but the descended into farce and the latter part of the staff car driving around with his crew of criminals was rather silly. What this could have have. Disappointing.",The Captain
34,lacatusalexandru,Der Hauptmann(The Captain)-one of the best german movies ever,10,11 January 2020,"The Captain is,in my opinion,one of the best german movies ever made and it sure is in top 10 best war movies.
The movie is based on the astonishing true story of Pvt. Willi Herold, a teenage deserter from the German army whose sadism would eventually earn him the nickname of the Executioner of Emsland, The Captain picks up two weeks before the end of the war.
Herold finds a Nazi captain's uniform to wear and avoid execution. Thus disguised, he soon rallies a ragtag band of brothers whose unquestioning acceptance of his command emboldens him. High on the terrifying charisma of his clothing, he invents a secret mission from the Führer and embarks on a brutal odyssey of torture and slaughter.
From the beggining of the movie right to the end of it,I was amazed by the things Willi Herold needed to do to keep his appereance and the movie also kept me in suspense and I was kinda afraid for Herold's life almost all the time.
Another great thing that I found interesting about the movie,besides the cast and the story, is the choice of Robert Schwentke to make the movie in black and white. It make me feel like I'm watching an old war movie.
Overall,""The Captain"" is an amazing war movie that is based on the astonishing real story of Willi Herold-The Executioner of Emsland.",The Captain
35,mikavir,Brutal captain,10,28 May 2020,"The Captain is very brutal story of a German deserter Willi Herold. It's the spring of 1945 and the last days of the Third Reich. Germany is losing WW2 and the whole country is in chaos. Herold finds the captain's uniform which changes his life by many ways. His position as captain makes him a war criminal after many situations. The movie contains for example German labor camp and the brutal massacre that happened there. The story of the movie is also symbolic.The most important symbol is that the wartime German society is collapsing and desperate people want a leader. That leader isn't always the good choise. On the other hand war can make anyone very brutal person. The main character of the movie Willi Herold (played by Max Hubacher) is nearly disturbingly cold and cruel character. His assistant Freytag (Milan Peschel) and other soldiers of the Captain are very believable as subordinates of Herold.
This movie is very good WW2 movie. If you are interested in movies that are believable and exciting watch this. 10/10",The Captain

37,ilikeweirdstuffs,Some stories don't need to be told,2,29 March 2019,"Psychopaths that also happen to be surrounded by nazis are bad. That is what the real life story and this movie are both about.Nothing surprising, nothing interesting, no lesson or insight.It's also not entirely historically accurate, has no positive characters, and just focuses on the worst of the worst in spite of not really caring about accuracy, with awful pacing, amateurish acting.I guess if you really like to watch long drawn out warcrime committing with a sickening context this movie at least wont get you convicted at den Haag.The german word ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"" is about the 3rd reich and dealing with that past. Maybe if we're scraping the bottom of the barrel this bad for stories that means that the past will soon be dealt with and with the lessons learned can be condemned to the past.A continuous assault on the viewer for no reason with no merits apart from some poignant cinematography.",The Captain
38,micz81,"Not like ANY OTHER WWII movie. Dark, grotesque vision of real-life events.",7,18 November 2020,"It's beautifully lit and shot movie. Greatly edited. Boldly directed. Yet somehow empty. Brings to my mind great ""Ravenous"" by Katherine Bigelow - the same, bit weird, grotesque, satirical tone of the story, the same kind of director's interest in evil within any of us. But - from staging and casting, trough costumes, props, locations, acting, cinematography, to editing, and the role of music and color - ""The Captain"" is much much much better, more consistent and more determined in terms of aesthetics than Bigelow's vision. And, in the same time, much much much more misleading in terms of its identity. You really can't tell WHAT kind of movie this is exactly - a bit thriller, a bit war cinema, a bit western, a bit drama, a bit dark comedy, a bit fairy-tale, a bit noir, even a bit horror and poetry.... It's refreshing to see WWII topic being treated with such a nonchalant attitude (Tarantino does not count - he is just a separate ligue of his own, and his aims with ""Glorious Bestards"" are just completely different in my opinion), but on the other hand ""The Captain"" seems bit immature, bit comic-like, bit 'form-over-substance' kind of thing. But... on the other hand again - the grotesque immaturity of depiction corresponds with grotesque immaturity of the very young main character who's real-life doings were the core of the story. On the other hand though... end credits add another layer of interpretation to the mix. And so on, and so on.Very thought provoking movie - if you like to think about cinema's language and purpose, or the reasons behind every evil (or even about a role of ego in those two areas respectively). Not so much if you want to explore REAL dilemmas and REAL tragedies of WWII - here, those are SURREAL rather.Summing up - definitely worth watching, as a somehow different approach to an already very well covered subject.",The Captain

41,cheeftanz,Welcome to Germany!,8,17 May 2019,"This film was beautifully photographed, wonderfully acted, excruciatingly detailed. And it was also a brutally honest look at the human being during a time of war. While watching this I wondered what my friends and I would be like if we had been fighting for our lives for years. Would we still be 'noble'? Would be still be reasonable? Would be still be human? Or something else ...The only main fault I could find was in editing, there were a few scenes that were simply far too long, this detracted from the film.Other than that, this was refreshingly not not a typical Hollywood romp.

44,edwardlovette,Engrossing Drama,10,3 February 2019,"This movie is up there with Paths of Glory and All Quiet on the Western Front because it's not really a war movie but rather a movie about the damage that wars inflict upon a society. This entire picture is engrossing and I definitely wanted to see it a second time to better absorb all the powerful scenes.It's basically a study in the herd mentality of human beings. The nail that sticks out gets hammered as the Japanese proverb says. This movie is a fascinating study in the German tendency pre-1945 to obey authority.There was a very popular book that came out before WW1 in 1906 about and it even amused the Kaiser because it was a true story about a vagabond who put on a homemade German officer's uniform and managed to recruit soldiers to help him rob a city's treasury in a town called Kopernick. It was later made into a book and play called the ""captain of Kopernick"".That is what this movie reminded me of and I very much enjoyed this fascinating study in human psychology. This movie is based upon true events.",The Captain
45,kryptonarie,Not what I expected.,8,3 May 2019,"I think the preview for The Captain is misleading, because I believed this film to be more of a dark comedy. Well there wasn't anything funny about WWII, and this film definitely shows more of what was so horrific in those dark times, so comedy, there's none. It's all about the evil brutality, that the damaged men of Nazi Germany, with too much power, unjustly delivered unto even their own people, but not until after they were made weak and defenseless first.",The Captain
46,highnemonkey,Tries to be deep but lacks seriousness,5,4 April 2018,"Halfway through I was thinking about leaving the cinema, which I never do. The sheer brutality of the images is unbearable at times and I consider it reassuring to my mental condition that it is. But what was more unsettling is this feeling that the movie chose this serious setting simply to get away with disgusting violence. Of course this is not a new discussion, Inglorious Basterds, which I loved, comes to mind. But while IB did not pretend to be serious, this one seemingly does. It takes the absurdly-cruel parts of other great films (think of the jammed executioners gun in Schindlers List and others) and throws them together, making you think of these great movie-moments and forgiving that this one actually is not very good.
The first act was great, threw us into the story right away, it catches the viewer. But then? It pretends to be a study on the brutality of men but is it? What we see are not men. These are monsters. Everything that would link their behaviour to that of normal people is gone. No backstory, no motivations explained. Anything that would make the viewer go ""shit, that could be me!"" is taken out in favour of evil monsters from planet Nazi in a galaxy far far away raging around. This depiction of fascism as a mere costume of evil has always bugged me. And while Inglorious Basterds or even the Indiana Jones movies with their Nazis do not try to be serious I could enjoy the stereotypical bad guys portrait in them. This movie on the other hand pretends it has something important to tell about human psyche. But it does not, there is better ones that actually tell you WHY people get brutal and don't just show images that make you go: ""Wow. That was cruel"". The images are moving but only in a way that ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" are moving. If you make a movie set in Nazi-Germany be aware of the seriousness of the topic and dont let viewers get away with the sheer impression that the Nazis were unmotivated, alien monsters with just an inherent evilness.Surprisingly the credits rocked me. They made me perplexed, they made me laugh, they gave me a real feeling of absurdity but as they continued, they made me scared, they left me thinking. Everything I was lacking before - it was in the credits.",The Captain

Watching, the young paratrooper Wili Herold get in over his head and essentially begin BSing his way to the top was as an entertaining watch for me as it was disturbing.Though the film is incredible in its presentation and acting, it still has its flaws. Upon finishing the film packed full of war crimes and human disparity, I left it feeling like I had taken nothing from it after its shocking scenes. The Captain has essentially no moral or messages to showcase beyond just telling a story of a power-hungry monster and the overtones of Nazi cruelty. It didn't feel like there was any methodology to the madness. If thats what people are looking for when watching this movie then by all means. However for me, I feel like there are plenty more substantial films that do what The Captain sets out to and better, with some greater substance.",The Captain

Because I thought initially they were attempting a Tarrantino or at least one of those confusing Coen Bros epics - that always profess to be true - but aren't. Who was this little dittie made for? Its not in Brazilian - so not for escaped Nazis - so must be some kind of farce-entertainment like the Irish do - but at least the bog wogs are articulate and even funny. This has one or two redeeming features - shot in B&W and the Freytag character could act...just...BEAT... It might have been bearable if it wasn't the usual hierarchical set up. I suggest shoot a few in charge for a change storyline - might solve the penchant of the seemingly anti-war brigade who arent anti-war they've justice seen a good moral loophole to make war movies.

52,DIEU_ET_MAITRE,Why?,3,27 January 2021,"Although this is based on a true story it doesn't seem believable on screen. A bit more self-awareness about how ridiculous the whole thing is (a 19 year old assuming the rank of captain without being found out) would have helped the film I guess. And even though I'm not a fan of this: it would have helped putting the ""based on a true story""-thing at the beginning of the movie.The Acting: All the actors are overacting (very typical for contemporary German movies). Cinema isn't filming actors playing theatre in ""cinematic"" shots. It's conveying information by cinematic means, an artistry obviously not present here (but then again, a rare sight in culture industry movies anyway, so why even bother bringing it up).The ""absurd""/""surreal"" scenes in the movie are just stupid, nothing else. It seems like the director wanted to make a Nazi version of ""Hard to be a God"". Well...it didn't work.The last fourth is where everything takes a turn for the even worse. Pointless ""stylish"" depictions of decadence and ridiculous tarantino-esque splatter. The end credits sequence because of it's pointlessness drags everything down as well.Why was this movie made? There is no good reason why this movie was made. And with these kind of movies exploiting real acts of murderous violence shouldn't there be a good reason for doing so? Don't get me wrong, I'm not coming at this from a moralistic standpoint, I'm just asking the question ""Why?"". Why did you make this movie Robert Schwentke? I doubt there's an honourable answer to this question.",The Captain

But it is more a subtle play on how every member of the social constuct that they are part of relies on just keeping up a facade in the face of annhiliation due to the uncertainty of the world they are living in. All the while being underlined with the very basic values of german culture. ""There must be Ordnung"", ""very efficient solution"" etc. etc.The demons of rationalization do not come from within, they are suggested by the party, and the only thing stopping most people from applying the methods they have been so frequently presented, is their own conscience. However in dire straights, for instance when faced with certain death, some develop the strength to ignore these fetters.After that there is no way back - or is there? The german authority actually gives him an additional chance and he can escape to freedom.

The movie doesn't want to be a hollywood blazing brainless action movie, but wants to portrait the germans on an individual level. 
Like @barta-46978 says, the movie is about authority and gives yourself an insight in what it must have been at the time, and even how you would react in the given circumstances.
The movie is explicit and kind of shocking. It really intrigued me, we need more movies like this.",The Captain
76,brunomantunes,Not brilliant but it's ok,6,24 April 2019,"A black and white movie is always intended to be deepest than the others. This one is not an exception.
In fact, it explores the final days of the Nazi regime and shows its last breath of darkness.
Although, I believe the movie fails a bit because it is slow and some scenes take too much time.",The Captain
77,songjingjin,"Watch it, even just for the last few minutes",10,1 December 2020,"At the end of the movie, it shows the characters raided a shopping aread in probably the present day Germany. The reaction from the unknowing crowds is astonishing and intrguing.",The Captain
78,steve_qo,Draws you in and lays it all bare..,10,11 September 2019,"The story for Willi (MAx Hubacher) starts so well. Grateful for his find of the Catains uniform, he celebrates his luck. You are drawn in. I laughed when he began his roleplay, taking some names, using his sham to command. I thought Willi had taken to it well and, in doing what he could to survive, find a way out of the war.
In this story, this Captain though is a bit phoney. The innkeeper is dubious, but goes along with it, finding his thief and using 'The Captain' to stamp his 'authority'. When that bullet went into the head of the thief, The Captain was suddenly real and I was astonished. I didn't know the real story behind this film. I didn't know how this went and I was in. Absolutely drawn in. The stark reality of Germany at this time is laid bare for the viewer and Hubacher portrays his man with absolute perfection.",The Captain
79,denisekelsey,A too-artsy take of a very sobering subject,5,6 April 2021,"This could have been a deeply compelling, introspective look at the moral failings of Willi Herold and the corrupting influence of power, but instead the director seems more interested in trying to be Germany's Quentin Tarantino, taking an artsy, surrealist approach to the subject matter. Not only is this disrespectful to those killed, it misses the opportunity for an excellent historical drama delving into what made Willi Herold tick and the corrosive influence of war on human nature. This film tells me nothing about who Herold was as a person or why he behaved as he did, or the reality of the final days of the war. Instead it's all artsy camera angles, surrealist party scenes, and an overall feeling of a self-important director saying ""look how avant-garde I can be"".",The Captain
80,tjeltsema,historically not satisfying,4,5 March 2020,"This is a movie about a war criminal who really existed. Not in the film, but April 25th 1945 Herold killed 5 resistance men from Holland at my chosen hometown Leer in Germany. I can understand that one cannot show every kill he and his men did, but I'm disappointed about the Romanisation of those cruel crimes.
If you want to see the true story ( and understand German) watch "" Der Hauptmann Von Mufrika"" a documentary with interviews from victims and the British prosecutor",The Captain
81,cheskaa,Brilliant,9,12 November 2020,"Many war films portray the Nazi German soldiers as cruel, heartless, blind individuals with no backstory or substance. This film goes deep into the mind of a man terrified of what is going to happen to him and forces us to watch as he makes numerous awful decisions to try and save his own life. It also have a wonderful way off fleshing out the Jewish characters which other films tend to skim over. This film doesn't make it feel like the Jews are a different species, like many other films in this genre. They are simply Jewish people and the Captain understands this, however he still choses his own life instead of others. The use of black and white is fantastic. It brings home the sense that the situation the Captain is in is bleak, cold and hopeless. It also helps to transport the reviewer back in time, and concentrate on the character's struggle with his own humanity rather than the surroundings. All in all, a brilliant film with far too little hype!",The Captain
82,naraleprajwal,Wrong description by producers,1,2 March 2021,"Movie is not about the survival of captain, it is about the death of german soldiers. Why the hell he is killing the the tired soldiers who had seen soo much for nearly six years.",The Captain
83,lichthagen,One of the best film ever I saw about Nazi time in Germany.,10,24 May 2021,"And the only film that so subtle and artistically impactful captures the murderous grotesqueness of dictatorship with its peculiar kind of ""democratism of downfall"" , which with the same inevital randomness morally devoured the wise and the stupid, the good and the bad , the loyal and the disobedient. I always was sure that only Germans could make a real movie about Nazism, not Hollywood, because only then will it be possible at least to try to feel impossible, namely what this collective madness was all about somewhat from inside.",The Captain
84,pettil,Masterpiece of self-irony and madness of war.,9,22 January 2019,"A fresh story about what war can make to a man. And the possibilities of it.

85,notetoself066-202-418622,Solid film,9,12 January 2019,"All around this film holds up. The (true) story is interesting, it's well told, the characters are compelling, and the cinematography is fantastic. It's gruesome and can be difficult to watch but well worth it. It feel authentic with moments of dark humor thrown in from time to time. This film makes you think while packing a punch.",The Captain
86,moebetoblame,A bizarre depiction of a disgusting story,3,30 August 2019,"""The Captain"" tells the story of Willy Herold, a deserting German Airborne Private, using an abandoned Captain's uniform and staff car together with an officer's tone to move freely behind the German main line.
The film starts with Herold being hunted and starving and peaks with him commanding a squad of violent soldiers and performing atrocities on German prisoners and civilians.
With these nauseating characters and more than enough of senseless brutality, this movie is very unpleasant to watch. Furthermore, there are no inspiring moments. At best there is one prisoner who, when when fored by Herold to shoot another inmate, refuses to do so and rather shoots himself.
Do not expect any light though this movie of darkness.",The Captain
87,thiettan,Surprisingly good and different than other WWII movies,8,10 April 2019,"This title is not like any other typical WWII film. There are no epic battles to witness and no glory for the viewer to hope for. Instead, the film takes a dark humanistic approach to explore the dynamics of power and authority. The quote ""Power attracts the worst and worst, it corrupts the best"" comes to mind when watching events unfold through many dialogue intensive scenes of the film. Others may see the movie dragging because of all the dialogue but for me, it's a chance to explore in depth the characters and their realistic reaction/behavior in the story. Although certain points of the plot can seem over dramatize which reminds me that the notion of this being based on a true story should be taken with a grain of salt. But overall, it feels authentic for the most part and it's refreshing.",The Captain
88,reliczoran,One of the best movies i have seen,10,9 December 2018,"At first i thought oh another ww2 movie from the perspective of one individual that will show the last year of the german nazi regime. But then as the movie started i got into captains head. It was like a clear presentation of an very inteligent pragmatic that at firat tried to survive as an deserter, but got into a role of someone else. His determination, inteligence, leadership, authority and discipline in playing his new role impacted on every other character through out the film. After a while i was shocked that this movie was based on real events. From survival to horror, despair and even theater and hedonism. Back and forth. Trully a remarkable movie.",The Captain
89,delmen123,"Good film, but historical correct?",5,9 August 2018,"In the film Willi Herold is shown as a man that was forced into his actions to save his own life, like everyone human would do and that thereby he even saved the lifes of others... and I think its important to be very carefull with this information.",The Captain
90,barta-46978,The beast within,9,17 March 2018,"The film revolves around authority, the trust we tend to have towards a person we endow with authority, official ranks, hierarchy, ""Kameradschaft"", the sense of belonging to a group, and (for me at least), egoism in general. It is also quite brutal and sadistic. The story itself, with the most improbable twists, is taken from a real life story at the end of the war.
 It is rare in war films to have the perspective of the criminal. We do not sympathise with him, but rather he impersonates the beast in every one of us. 
Another merit of the film is quite natural: German actors can of course impersonate German soldiers better than for example US ones, it also gives a realistic touch to the film as opposed to US war movies featuring evil nazis.
The message of the film was for me clear and delivered with a great impression - I will not write it here as it would be flat in my words.",The Captain
91,samuliloov,Anti-German Movie,3,26 January 2019,"This movie is typical anti-german propaganda. German soldiers are depicted as animals, like allways. War propaganda never stopped.",The Captain
