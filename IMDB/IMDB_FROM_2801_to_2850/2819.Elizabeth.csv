0,MartinHafer,Well made though not exactly great history.,7,11 December 2013,"Making a historical biopic like ""Elizabeth"" is a very, very difficult thing--something many viewers would not expect. Although Elizabeth I of England was an incredibly important figure, there are two HUGE problems with a film about her. First, although she had LOTS of folks executed for treason, we really have no idea if many of these folks were actually guilty of anything. Executing potential threats and rivals back then was like eating potato chips--you can't stop with just one! Untangling this mess of intrigues is impossible today, so many of the plots you see in this film might not have even existed or occurred later in her reign (the executions in the film actually occurred over a very long period of time--not all at once). Second, there is scant little written from the time about the character and personalities of the major characters you see in the film. So, the film makers either inferred or simply made up stuff for the sake of cinematic style and intrigue. For example, Sir Francis Wallsingham was a man of intrigues and operated a personal spy network--so the inferences about him in this sense in the movie are reasonable. BUT, showing him with the young man who he then viciously kills at the beginning of the film is completely fictional. There is no evidence he murdered people with his own hands and I think the scene STRONGLY implies that he's either gay or bisexual--something that is made up for the movie. Another example is Elizabeth's sex life. This is NOT something they kept records of (for obvious reasons) and there has been MUCH conjecture that she was gay, asexual or carried on affairs behind the scenes with men. No one really knows the truth. So, my advice for the film is to take it all with a grain of salt--the main points are accurate but so many of the details are fabricated in order to create a neat sort of fictional non-fiction.As fictional non-fiction, the film looks great. The costumes and sets are wonderful. The acting is also quite good. And, the film is rather interesting and gives a good GENERAL overview of the early years of Elizabeth's reign. However, be forewarned: the film is NOT for the squeamish, prudish or easily offended. It is very bloody (beginning with an incredibly vivid opening execution scene) and there is a lot of nudity. In many ways, this film helped set the template for later historical mini series which are much like history, a soap opera and a bit of skin combined. Well made but like most biopics, short on historical accuracy.",Elizabeth
1,TheLittleSongbird,"The three Ss- sumptuous, superb and stunning!",10,28 September 2009,"This superb period drama has everything going for it, and I am saddened that it didn't get more awards.For one thing, the whole film is splendid for the eyes. A lot of care went into the scenery, cinematography and costumes and it showed. The music score was absolutely beautiful, dramatic in some parts and poignant in others. The screenplay is quite extraordinary, and the story while perhaps historically inaccurate, is still intriguing. The direction, while the least impressive element of the film, was still solid. The performances were flawless; Cate Blanchett was above mesmerising as Elizabeth, and she is supported by an outstanding cast that include Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Christopher Ecceleston and Richard Attenborough. All in all, sumptuously filmed, and pretty darn good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Elizabeth
2,SnoopyStyle,brilliant Cate Blanchett,8,21 February 2016,"It's 1554 England. Henry VIII is dead. The Catholic Queen Mary is burning Protestants. Her half-sister Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is a threat to her crown and is imprisoned. Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) is the heavy-handed henchman desperate to get the dying Queen to sign Elizabeth's death warrant. Elizabeth is in love with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes). After gaining the throne, she faces challenges from Norfolk, Mary Queen of the Scots and others from outside the country. Her main counsel William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Richard Attenborough) urges her to marry well to protect the throne. Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) returns from exile to be her adviser. After a defeat to Mary of Guise, she must consider Mary's wild nephew Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel). This is more than a costume drama. Director Shekhar Kapur brings an urgency to the proceedings. The deadly politics is more thrilling than a massive battle. Cate Blanchett is beyond brilliant. It's her first breakout role. She fits the role perfectly as a princess working her way to becoming a great queen.",Elizabeth
3,classicsoncall,"""The Queen is dead. Long live the Queen!""",8,21 May 2018,"Murder, corruption and intrigue take center stage in this story of Queen Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Feared by Catholics who resent her rising to the throne, the film follows the many machinations to have her denounce her own religion and in failing to do so, to remove her via an ultimate solution. I have to admit I'm not familiar with this era of British history, so view the story as Hollywood's take on a significant era that eventually succeeded, but started out under very questionable circumstances. What seems almost inconceivable today is the way the story bears out how royal families of different countries asserted their power and influence by marrying among themselves without regard to love or fidelity. In that regard, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) stealthily avoids commitment to any one individual, while being pulled in all directions by her staff, English bishops, and fellow monarchs who would deign to consolidate their own bases of power. The period costuming is lavish and the sets are given the royal treatment in accord with the subject matter. Elizabeth's own decision to have her loyal guard defend her throne takes on the aspect of Michael Corleone's method of cleaning house in ""The Godfather"". Blanchett's performance was deserving of a Best Actress Oscar, and she WAS nominated, but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow in what might be considered the Academy's version of highway robbery. One must see her performance to truly appreciate Blanchett's sublime take on the English Queen.",Elizabeth
4,gavin6942,Historically Epic,8,30 March 2015,"A film of the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I of England (Cate Blanchett) and her difficult task of learning what is necessary to be a monarch.Although I know relatively little about Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and just as little about Elizabeth I, their stories tend to make good film. Shakespeare knew royal lives made good plays and the tradition continues still in the 21st century. We may focus less on Henry VIII and more on modern figures (see ""The King's Speech""), but the lives of royalty always fascinate.Is this an accurate portrayal? Well, no, of course not. We could never truly know the personality of Elizabeth or the conversations she had, especially behind closed doors. But in a general sense this is the case. She inherited a mighty throne, and not at the best possible time.",Elizabeth
5,lee_eisenberg,My friend and I discussed a joke version.,7,18 April 2006,"Cate Blanchett had only recently entered our vocabulary when ""Elizabeth"" came out, but she did a good job playing the Virgin Queen and showing her various struggles (as it was, this was all pretty new to me) and the vicissitudes of ruling a country. Most people probably never would have imagined an East Indian person directing a movie about an English monarch, but he did a good job too. Still, I have to wonder how many movies there can be about European monarchs. The obvious surprising thing is that co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes starred in ""Shakespeare in Love"", for which Judi Dench won an Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth. The things that we see in life. Also starring Christopher Eccleston, Richard Attenborough and John Gielgud (in his final role).My friend and I once discussed a joke version. As an example of how silly it would be: Dan Aykroyd, Jim Carrey, Mike Myers and Will Smith would play the bishops; Whoopi Goldberg would play the maid; and the credits would feature Jackie Chan yelling ""Wah-tah!""",Elizabeth
6,jboothmillard,Elizabeth,6,16 November 2007,"I saw quite a few clips of this film on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, where the leading actress was number 37, and I'm quite glad I gave it a go. Basically Britain is being divided by faith, Protestant vs. Catholic, and the current Queen Mary Tudor (an unusual choice in Kathy Burke) has no heir, and the only person that could take over, her half-sister Elizabeth (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Cate Blanchett) is arrested, but not long after Mary has died of a tumour (which they thought was a pregnancy), without signing her death warrant, Elizabeth is chosen to take over, obviously becoming Elizabeth I. Her first few years are shaky, mostly because she ""rules from the heart, not the head"", there is also concern, particularly from her adviser Sir William Cecil (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) that she should marry. But she refuses to do so, even with seeing many suitors, most likely because she has a short (sexless) relationship with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes). It is towards the end, with help from Sir Francis Walsingham (BAFTA winning Geoffrey Rush) that she has killed all enemies, and recreates herself, with the white make up and new robes as ""The Virgin Queen"". Also starring John Gielgud as The Pope, Fanny Ardant as Mary of Guise, Terence Rigby as Bishop Gardiner, Christopher Eccleston as Duke of Norfolk, Amanda Ryan as Lettice Howard, James Frain as Alvaro De La Quadra, Jamie Foreman as Earl of Sussex, Edward Hardwicke as Earl of Arundel, Trainspotting's Kelly Macdonald as Isabel Knollys, Wayne Sleep as Dance Tutor, Emily Mortimer as Kat Ashley, Angus Deayton as Woad, Chancellor of the Eschequer, Eric Cantona as Monsieur De Foix, Vincent Cassel as Duc d'Anjou, Casino Royale's Daniel Craig as John Ballard and pop star Lily Allen as a Lady in Waiting. It was pretty dark in places, particularly at the beginning, and it is a good film with some good performances. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for David Hirschfelder and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction for Shekhar Kepur and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Good!",Elizabeth
7,rmax304823,Lonely at the Top.,6,21 February 2006,"Elizabeth starts out as a gay young girl and winds up alone on a throne, painted like a corpse, omnipotent, friendless, full of tragic grandeur like Al Pacino at the end of The Godfather II. ""The Godmother""? No -- hardly that.This is the most complex of the few movies I've seen that deal with the reign of Elizabeth I. John Ford's ""Mary of Scotland"" was really about Mary and its message was simple-minded: the Catholics were good and the Calvinists bad. In ""The Sea Hawk,"" we learned that it was an almighty good thing for Flora Robson to have Errol Flynn on her side. Vanessa Redgrave, in ""Mary, Queen of Scots"", taught us that the queen who leads with her head and not with her heart wins.""Elizabeth"" doesn't have such an easily stated message. It's an expensive costume romantic drama that has dozens of characters and at least twice that many intrigues.As for the religious part of the conflict, the Catholics come off the worst, although the Protestants don't exactly shine either. A priest comes from France, murders people, and tries more than once to assassinate Elizabeth -- once by ""poisoning her dress."" (How do you do that?) And it's amazing, really, how many of the people Elizabeth has known all her life turn out to be secret Catholic traitors, hiding in holes and whatnot. The headsman is kept busy and the climax contrasts the executions and the lopped-off heads with the ritual purity of Elizabeth's coronation, again vide ""The Godfather."" Thinking it over, I'm not sure there is a moral behind this epic at all. Maybe, like ""The Godfather"", it is meant to show us that it's powerful lonely at the top. It also twigs us to the fact that when Elizabeth is referred to as a ""virgin queen,"" the term is used figuratively. I think, if I had been her counselor, I'd have had the answer to all the religious troubles and the competition with France, Scotland, and Spain and all that dreary stuff.I'd have made sure she married the incestuous, foolish Duc d'Anjou. Okay, he was a cross-dressing pouf, but so what? Elizabeth already spoke French, so the language wouldn't have been a problem. The Duc could have handled the money, and he would know where the best restaurants were hidden. And besides, in addition to getting an amusing sometime-lover, she would have had access to a region that cultivates fine pears and produces a respectable rosé.Pshaw, you say. The marriage wouldn't have worked out. I reply: how many marriages do you know that DO work out? And there is always divorce, isn't there? After all, Elizabeth's Old Man invented it. Oh -- and another thing. If we're all going to conspire against one another and go about chopping off heads because of religious differences, let's get rid of religions. We could all become serious Pantheists. That would satisfy everybody, from the rabid Evangelicals to the Green Party.Some advice: After watching this movie, for a good tickle, go to some of the news boards and read all the venomous comments about how the Moslems keep fighting each other.But, all seriousness aside, the movie's worth seeing. The locations and production design are splendid. The music opulent. The acting just fine on everyone's part, including John Gielgud in a tiny unsympathetic role as the Pope. Cate Blanchett is luminously beautiful but not in a typical Hollywood way. She has a pale elongated face and an anole's eyes that are expressive slits. At its best, the film is an elaborate panorama and at it's least, an amuse-bouche.",Elizabeth
8,Tweekums,The early years of Queen Elizabeth I,8,30 September 2016,"This film tells the story of Queen Elizabeth I's ascension to the throne and the beginning of her reign as she learns what it means to be queen as rivals manoeuvre around her. As the film starts Elizabeth's older sister, the Catholic Mary I, is on the throne and her ministers are counselling her to execute the Protestant Elizabeth to prevent her from becoming queen and England becoming protestant again. Mary dies before producing an heir and Elizabeth becomes Queen. Once on the throne she learns the England is in a very weak; the army is run down, the treasury is empty and French troops are garrisoned in Scotland. It is suggested that she forms an alliance with either France or Spain by marrying either the Spanish king or a French duke; neither option appeals to her as she is clearly keen on Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. It isn't long before her various enemies, backed by the Vatican, are moving against her; if she is to survive she will have to strike back.Cate Blanchett carries the film as the young Elizabeth making us believe in this woman leading in a very male world. She is ably supported by the likes of Christopher Eccleston, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough and even French footballer Eric Cantona! Even minor roles are filled by fairly familiar faces. All the court intrigue and plotting is like something out of 'Game of Thrones' but with somewhat less sex and violence at least on screen. Even though we know Elizabeth will survive there are plenty of tense moments and other characters are far from safe. It isn't all plotting though; there are plenty of funny moments such as when Elizabeth discovers one of her suitors wearing a dress! Director Shekhar Kapur has given the film a great look with lots of impressive colours, especially in the many court scenes. Overall I'd highly recommend this film; you don't have to be interested in the history of the time to enjoy this.",Elizabeth

10,CinemaSerf,Historical pinches of salt required...,7,4 March 2020,"A very good looking depiction of the early reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I with Oscar-nominated Cate Blanchett in the title role. Initially, she struggles to stay alive during the reign of her devoutly Catholic (a superbly cast Kathy Burke) half-sister Mary, with the help of her childhood friend Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). These risks do not diminish at all once she succeeds to the throne and faces conspiracies and plots from all around. It's not the most historically accurate version of her early reign, but Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and a devious, unscrupulous schemer in Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk keep this intrigue of treachery, betrayal and power moving along tautly. Michael Hirst has a definite penchant for writing of the Tudor times and Shekhar Kapur brings the costumes and palaces alive with some creative direction.",Elizabeth
11,grantss,Superb,9,26 May 2018,"The ascension to the throne of England of Queen Elizabeth I and the aftermath. Shows the against-the-odds struggles she had to endure to obtain the throne and her almost-as-difficult defence of it.Superb. Reasonably accurate, historically, and very interesting. Could easily have ended as a dry docudrama but director Shekhar Kapur ensures the film is engaging, intriguing and edifying. Allied with this is a superb performance from Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth, a performance that earned her her first Oscar nomination. Throw in some fantastic sets and costumes and this is a lavish, entertaining and edifying drama.",Elizabeth
12,Calicodreamin,"Great setting, lacks chemistry",5,20 February 2020,"The costuming and set departments knocked it out of the park on this one, truly beautiful.

13,evanston_dad,All Hail Queen Blanchett!,7,21 June 2010,"1998 was the year Hollywood made Elizabethan England sexy. ""Elizabeth"" was one of two (the other being ""Shakespeare in Love"") films released that year to feature the famed Virgin Queen in a prominent role, and both actresses to play her (Cate Blanchett here and Judi Dench in ""Shakespeare"") received Oscar nominations (and in Dench's case the win) for their efforts.""Elizabeth"" is by far the more serious of the two, but take that for whatever it's worth. This ""historical"" rendering of the young Elizabeth's rise to power is full of enough heavy breathing, whispered intrigues and catty spats to fill hours of reality T.V. The film looks lovely, and director Shekar Kapur keeps things moving briskly (even if I did wish that he'd stop moving his camera around quite so much). This was the movie that made me fall in love with Blanchett, a love that has not abated to this day.Interestingly, and weirdly, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush both appear in this film and ""Shakespeare in Love."" Between Queen Elizabeth and World War II, what would Hollywood have used for material otherwise that year? Grade: B+",Elizabeth
14,AlsExGal,What does this film and Yankee Doodle Dandy have in common?,8,28 February 2017,"They are both great films that take so much liberty with the truth that I doubt the real people upon which they are based would recognize their own lives! We'll never know about Queen Elizabeth I who died 400 years before the motion picture was born, but George M. Cohen, whose life is on display in Yankee Doodle Dandy, did screen the picture before release and his comment was - ""Great film, who is it about?"". But I digress.Cate Blanchett is every inch a queen in this film. Elizabeth surely was in danger during her half sister Mary's rule who wasn't called ""Bloody Mary"" for nothing. Robert Dudley was the love of Elizabeth's life, and she likely didn't marry for good reason, especially if you look at what happened to her cousin Mary Queen of Scots, who lost her throne by becoming vulnerable through affairs and marriages of the heart. Dudley's first wife did die conveniently in 1560, leaving him free to marry Elizabeth if she had so wanted. But tongues wagged about the suspicious manner of Robert's first wife's death, as she died by falling down a flight of stairs. Dudley did remain a loyal friend to Elizabeth throughout the rest of his life, angering the queen when he married a second time in secret after waiting twenty years for Elizabeth. But life must go on right? But this last paragraph is largely the truth, now for the movie. In this film Robert Dudley is still first in Elizabeth's heart, and he is shown to be a two faced horndog unworthy of that affection. Her biggest threat is shown to be Mary of Guise, French born and Catholic ruler of Scotland who plays this role completely over the top, but is delightful nonetheless. She is taken down in a James Bond style operation by Walsingham, trusted adviser and head of a network of international spies who is not against getting his hands dirty himself. Walsingham was indeed a trusted adviser, although years later than shown, and Geoffrey Rush plays this part to perfection, although the actual Walsingham was not nearly as interesting as the character shown here. In fact Walsingham was only a year older than Elizabeth, and a happily married homebody. I think they gave the part to an actor in middle age so that he looked as experienced as he seemed. The cross dressing Duke of Anjou never came to England and never sought Elizabeth's hand, but it makes for a great theater.Then there is William Cecil, played by Richard Attenborough, whose heart is in the right place - as in for England and for Elizabeth - but has ideas that constrain England as a second hand power looking to France or Spain for protection. Elizabeth retires him with honors in the film and looks more and more to Walsingham. In fact, Cecil was only 13 years Elizabeth's senior, not a very old man as shown here. Elizabeth never retired him. Only death did that, and then only less than five years before her own.So enjoy the great acting, the perfect art direction and cinematography, the intrigue and the plots, and a...poisoned dress? But most of all enjoy Cate Blanchett's performance as she portrays Elizabeth as she evolves from a young girl uncertain of what to say before parliament to the point where she practices her speeches haltingly in private, into an iron maiden who shears her hair, wears a wig, and paints herself with lead in an attempt to become a symbol of power, not the woman who has been looked upon as vulnerable to plots both at home and abroad. She gives up all hopes of personal happiness to be secure on her throne to tend to her first love, England, with all of this happening in a very compressed time period compared to what really happened, if it happened at all.",Elizabeth
15,HotToastyRag,Queen Elizabeth come to life,7,9 February 2021,"I can only imagine how upset Cate Blanchett was by the results of the 1998 Academy Awards. An elaborate period piece in Elizabethan England with fantastic sets and costumes, featuring Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush, won Best Actress - but it was Gwyneth Paltrow instead! And to add insult to injury, Judi Dench took home Best Supporting Actress for a brief appearance as Queen Elizabeth. Shakespeare in Love was a delightful movie, but my sympathy certainly lies with Miss Blanchett. She practically came out of nowhere, and this was her first lead in a major motion picture. Her unadorned face and flawless, translucent skin made it easy to believe she was, in fact, young Elizabeth come to life and set before a camera.In this very authentic looking period piece, the filmmakers spare no detail for their potentially squeamish viewers. People in the 1500s had rotted teeth, greasy hair, and looked like they hadn't bathed in a year. Remember Queen Elizabeth was considered excessive for taking a bath once a month ""whether or not (she) needed it""? This movie looks like you snuck a camera into a time machine and filmed those filthy people. My hat goes off to the dim candlelight, the exquisite sets and costumes, and the cold weather that seeps out of the screen.Now that I've complemented it, here are my words of warning: Those who suffer from vertigo cannot watch this movie. In nearly every scene, director Shekhar Kapur swirls the camera around in a circle. Whether he adopted that tactic to convey what a whirlwind Elizabeth found herself in, or to add a touch of modernity to the period piece, it's quite excessive and will give some viewers cause to turn the movie off. Also, it's very violent. Extremely violent. The opening scene shows women being prepared to be burned at the stake; their heads are shaved and cut by the razor, they scream and scream and scream, and finally, they're shown gasping out their last as the fire and smoke kills them. This movie shows beheadings and the prizes mounted on stakes. If you're squeamish, either watch it from behind a pillow or pick something else tonight.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. In nearly every scene the camera swirls in a circle, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Elizabeth
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Elizabeth,9,20 November 2010,"Elizabeth was one of Cate Blanchett's earlier films that had propelled her to stardom given that it won her a couple of major acting awards in her role as the titular Queen who ushered in what was the Golden Age in English history. I had seen the sequel Elizabeth The Golden Age some three years ago also directed by Shekhar Kapur, and this film dealt with Elizabeth's rise to power and ascension to the throne, ending with her consolidating her influence and having that grip on her court and kingdom.Period films about the English monarchy has always been rich material for filmmakers to dwell into, such as Justin Chadwick with his The Other Boleyn Girl which featured one generation earlier with Elizabeth's mother Anne Boleyn. This film skips everything then and jumps in at the point where Queen Mary I decided to imprison her half sister Elizabeth into the Tower of London for treason and for her Protestant faith, before illness and a whole host of politicking that didn't succeed meant Elizabeth succeeded Mary as ruler of England when the latter passes away.Michael Hirst's story deals with the rise of Elizabeth to power, and how she develops from girly girl, into the powerful yet lonely woman at the apex of her kingdom. Cate Blanchett brings a sense of vulnerability in her performance early in the film as the girl thrust into the hot seat where her innocence makes her instant fodder for conspirators to pounce upon and usurp the throne for herself. Being ruler of the land means a certain steely determination required, and charm to ensure policies get pushed through, and the episodes selected and highlighted in the film goes about doing just that. Not only that, the film has this constant sense of fear going on, of not knowing what to do, and who exactly to trust, and Blanchett brings about this quality, and other qualities associated with the role in flawless terms.The pressures of course come from all quarters, where even allies consistently tells upon her to fulfill certain conditions for power consolidation, where as a woman she's quite expected to marry and to produce an heir under a political marriage either with the Spanish or the French, since she had inherited what's essentially a bankrupt country. Danger lurks primarily from the Catholics, who deem her position in the country inappropriate, calling her a heretic spreading heresy with her faith. Yes, there's this constant subtext and battle between religions here, with even Daniel Craig starring as a priest on the orders of the Pope at the Vatican to do what's necessary to rid England of her.Then there's always the danger from affairs of the heart, where her relationship with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes) is out in the open and in a scene probably will raise some eyebrows since Elizabeth is much touted as the Virgin Queen. But hey, with every film biopic, artistic and dramatic license is always taken, and this serves but one angle of how the director wants to portray this concept. The main suitor comes in the form of Vincent Cassel's cross dressing Duc d'Anjou, who is quite the comical farce, in a relationship desired to be brokered by Monsieur de Foix played by Eric Cantona. You read that right, the football star in what's probably his earliest major film role in English.Unlike the sequel, there's no major action sequence here, not only because of the smaller budget. But that doesn't mean that it's less engaging, because what will hook you in is the political intrigue and conspiracy brewing at every corner of the Elizabeth rulership, where allies can become hidden enemies, and political survival is of the utmost concern. Both Richard Attenborough and Geoffrey Rush shine in their role as stoic advisors to the Queen, especially Rush's Sir Francis Walsingham who also commands the clandestine spy operations to ensure the eradication of the Queen's enemies. In some ways I thought the finale had resembled very closely to The Godfather's, with an opera soundtrack playing over a montage of assassinations being carried out simultaneously.If you, like me, have an insatiable appetite for period movies about Kings and Queens in their darkest days, then give Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, probably the most definitive film out there, a go, and not to forget the sequel as well. Recommended.",Elizabeth
17,Vincentiu,History of England,10,24 December 2006,"A movie is a tale. Strong, soft, ugly, great, insignificant, but a tale. ""Elizabeth"" is a special tale about power and sacrifice. About an era and about his symbol. The biographic film must have a slice of truth. The inspiration of director, the cast, the sound or the lights, the sound or the script are relevant but never enough. Or the importance of this film consist in a special art to discover the essence of a world with respect and precision. And Cate Blanchette, a great actress, with a powerful art, knows to discover the force of a victim and the vulnerability of a queen, the sign of lie and politics in a life who exist only like part of his country's destiny. A rare case in which the nationality of director is relevant. Why? Because this movie reflect the history of England in his precious beauty, in his real fear.",Elizabeth
18,JamesHitchcock,Stylised Historical Pageant,7,13 November 2007,"""Elizabeth"" deals with the early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. We first see her as a frightened young princess learning to survive at the court of her dangerously unpredictable sister Mary, who comes close to having Elizabeth executed because of her supposed involvement in the Wyatt Rebellion and because of her ambivalent religious loyalties. Even when Mary dies and Elizabeth succeeds her on the throne, her position seems hardly easier. At the age of 25, Elizabeth has inherited a near-bankrupt kingdom, threatened from outside by powerful foreign rivals and from within by religious dissensions between Catholics and Protestants. The Duke of Norfolk, a powerful Catholic nobleman, threatens Elizabeth with open rebellion. The film tells the story of how she overcame all these challenges to make herself the unchallenged ruler of England.Elizabeth is often regarded as a Protestant ruler, but this is perhaps an oversimplification of her religious position, which was closer to that of the Vicar of Bray. Under her Protestant brother Edward VI, she was a Protestant. Under Mary she was, at least outwardly, a Catholic. When she inherited the throne herself, she formulated the concept of a single Church of England, independent of the Papacy, to act as a broad church for all English Christians. (The Anglican Church has never declared itself to be exclusively Protestant, and since 1559 no English ruler, except Cromwell, has tried to make it so). In this she had the inadvertent support of Pope Pius V, whose bull ""Regnans in Excelsis"", declaring Elizabeth a heretic and calling on her Catholic subjects to assassinate her or rise up against her, had the unintended consequence of driving into the Church of England all those who were in their hearts loyal to the Old Faith but who had no wish to see their Queen dead and their country racked by religious warfare.The film explores the way in which Elizabeth created a ruling ideology for herself and her kingdom, an ideology of which the Elizabethan Religious Settlement was only one element. Apart from Mary, who only reigned for five years, no woman had previously succeeded in establishing herself as Queen Regnant of England. The advice from all her male counsellors was to marry as soon as possible, preferably to a powerful foreign prince, just as Mary had allied herself to Philip of Spain. Elizabeth, however, realised that such a marriage would be unpopular with her subjects as it could have made England subordinate to a foreign power (the Wyatt Rebellion was inspired more by fear of Spanish domination than by objections to Mary's Catholicism). The alternative of marriage to an English husband was rejected because Elizabeth did not want to surrender her power to any man, who would have become king in all but name. Historians have differed over whether Elizabeth was literally a virgin (the film takes the view that Robert Dudley was her lover physically as well as emotionally), but her solution was to reinvent herself as the Virgin Queen, married to her country rather than any earthly husband, and began a brilliant propaganda campaign to promote herself as such. (The only male European monarch who managed to create such a brilliant persona for himself was Louis XIV, ""Le Roi Soleil"").Cate Blanchett gives a superb portrayal of Elizabeth, and was unlucky to be overlooked for the ""Best Actress"" Oscar which eventually went to Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Shakespeare in Love"". (An entertaining film, but hardly a great performance). The other performances which stood out were those of Geoffrey Rush as Elizabeth's devious, Machiavellian adviser Walsingham and Christopher Eccleston as the arrogant, treacherous Norfolk. I did not, however, like the portrayal of Elizabeth's sister Mary; she may have been cruel and callous (her nickname of ""Bloody Mary"" was well-deserved) but she was the daughter of Henry VIII and doubtless far more regal and dignified than the demented fishwife played here by Kathy Burke.The film is not altogether historically accurate. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (who crushed Wyatt's Rebellion and died of natural causes shortly afterwards) is conflated with his grandson, the 4th Duke, also named Thomas, who was executed by Elizabeth for treason. The Scottish Regent Mary of Guise was not poisoned by Elizabeth's agents. (She had many enemies, but none of her contemporaries regarded her death as anything but natural). Lord Burghley, a much younger man than the character played by Richard Attenborough, was not dismissed by Elizabeth early in her reign; he remained a trusted adviser until his death in 1598. Henri d'Anjou never visited England. Events are not shown in the sequence in which they occurred in history.None of this, however, matters. The film was not conceived as a strictly accurate period drama but rather as a highly stylised historic pageant about the life of one of England's greatest monarchs. This stylisation is emphasised by the locations; mediaeval cathedrals such as Durham and York Minster stand in for Tudor palaces. The use of these buildings is hardly naturalistic, but it adds to the film's sense of grandeur and majesty. We hear music by Mozart and Elgar, neither of whom would be born until many years after Elizabeth's death. Cate Blanchett's costumes and appearance are modelled upon portraits of Elizabeth which were never meant to be realistic, but rather iconic propaganda images. As a historical textbook of Tudor England, the film is of little use, but it succeeds well in conveying Elizabeth's personality and her central importance in English history. 7/10",Elizabeth
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A movie standing on it's own was great, but historically...",7,29 December 2004,"I am a huge history freak. In fact that's why I saw this movie. In my sophomore year of high school in 2000, we were learning about the Prodescents vs. the Catholics. It was extremely interesting. We started watching ""Elizabeth"" to get an idea of what it was like for the war. We never finished, but the movie had been stuck in my head ever since. When I went to Blockbuster and saw the movie, I grabbed it remembering how interesting it was.The movie ""Elizabeth"" is very remarkable. The directing is perfection, the sets are imacculate, Cate is without a doubt very wonderful and capturing in her role, and the whole movie is very good. The supporting cast adds to the movie as well. Geoffrey Rush and Joesph Fiennes really add a lot to their roles. Even though their characters are quit typical, it seems that they are very typecast. Geoffrey Rush is kind of this bad British guy who is very controlling. Joesph is always the hopeless romantic. You know how it goes.The history however is... sorely inaccurate. I wasn't pleased on how they presented the history of Mary, the Protestants, the Catholics, Robert, and Elizabeth. The list could go on, but this is a movie comment, not a history essay.So as a movie, I will say that it was great.7/10",Elizabeth
20,=G=,The making of a queen,8,6 December 2003,"""Elizabeth"" is a ravishing, sumptuous, and very Hollywoodish telling of the early years of Elizabeth I who inherited a broken England at age 25, secured her tenuous grasp on the throne amidst treachery from all corners, consolidated her monarchy to become one of history's most notable rulers, and sowed the seeds which sprouted into a prosperous global empire. Praised by public and critics alike with a brace of awards as testament to its value, ""Elizabeth: The Virgin Queen"" sports a fine cast, offers high end production value, and has little to fault for those who don't mind an infusion of creativity with their history. Good stuff for fans of the players and those interested in the history of the British monarchy. (B+)",Elizabeth
21,sddavis63,"Marginally Better Than ""The Golden Age""",6,24 August 2010,"I've watched the two ""Elizabeth"" movies out of order, having seen the sequel ""The Golden Age"" a couple of years ago, and only now the original ""Elizabeth."" ""The Golden Age"" came across to me as too romanticized. This one was definitely (if only marginally) better. Beginning with the Roman Catholic Queen Mary (Elizabeth's half-sister) on the throne, and the Protestant Princess Elizabeth being a rallying point for English Protestants, the movie offers a very good portrayal of the religious fervour of the age, as we see Protestants being burned at the stake almost from the opening scene, and it accurately notes that Elizabeth was in many ways a moderate in the debate: Protestant, but not too Protestant; quite willing to let Catholics (and also Protestant non-conformists) alone as long as they attended Church of England services as well as their own. There was a lot of intrigue portrayed as Elizabeth comes to power after Mary's death and as she begins to consolidate her hold on power, which was at first quite shaky and uncertain. There was also a lot of attention to a pre-eminent diplomatic issue of the day: who should Elizabeth marry? There were candidates from both France and Spain (and England for that matter.) The issue of her marriage did lead to one of the funniest scenes in the movie, when Elizabeth walks in unexpectedly on one of her suitors (the French Duc d'Anjou) and discovers him - shall we say - dressed as a woman in the company of men at what appeared to be a rather raunchy party. All that was well done.The same weaknesses that held back ""The Golden Age"" in my view are still here, though. The flow was missing; the movie seemed to jump around too much, and the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley depicted more of the unsubstantiated gossip about how intimate their relationship was, when, in fact, many suspect that stories of their intimacy were quite exaggerated.Still, this is not a bad movie. It's a great period piece; authentically 16th century in look and feel, and Cate Blanchett is fantastic as Elizabeth - her appearance at the end of the movie is the spitting image of the typical Elizabethan portraits.",Elizabeth
22,ElMaruecan82,From the rise to Power to the conquest of Authority ...,9,2 November 2011,"Period films have always been unfairly underrated. My guess is that because of the profusion of historical movies from Hollywood's Golden Age, we've grown with the idea that they were more an excuse for displays of flamboyance, thrilling sword fights and epic battle sequences or exhilarating ""Technicolorgies"" than true character studies or introspective examinations into the notions of corruption, integrity, or more generally power: whether it's about a rise, a downfall, or both. Thankfully, the injustice has been fixed, and despite a few exceptions, all the recent period dramas have been a triumph on the field of intelligent storytelling, highlighting the intimate correlation between History and Story (the same word in some languages) something that mirrors our Human condition and raises the notion of knowledge to a universal level. And the power of ""Elizabeth"" is to tackle contemporary issues hidden in the austere and dark walls of splendid castles, carrying all the paranoid atmosphere of these plotting times. This is the greatest interest of period movies: their appeal comes from both the lack of visual modernity and the inner modernity of the topics they deal with. In Shekhar Kapur's ""Elizabeth"", it's simply about the rise to power.""Elizabeth"" invites us to comprehend how a young woman, Protestant in an England, not only Catholic but also intolerant toward those who rejected the Pope, as firmly illustrated in a gut- wrenching bonfire burning scene, how this person, outcast in so many levels, took over the power, and begun a reign that would last 40 years, and turns England, the prey of Europe's most powerful monarchies, into the dominant Nation in Europe. It's not just a woman in a world of men, but also a woman in probably the most vulnerable and fragile moment of England's history. She would take the power after the death of her stepsister, daughter of Henry VIII, but the point was to keep this power, and this was indeed a life and death situation for both Elizabeth, and England. In a way, Elizabeth embodied the situation of England in an ironic but inspirational symbiosis. The most relevant example is the invasion of Scotland by Mary of Guise' French troops coinciding with a proposal to marry the Duke of Anjou, the nephew of the same Mary. Elizabeth would be less married than raped in her honor and she's aware of her dilemma and how it echoes the situation of her beloved people. But the key of this torment is to conquer, before the power, the certitude that she IS the one who rules the country, and the game isn't won yet. As it's said before, all she has are ""enemies"", she has a lover too, but the line between the sincerity of his love and his secret ambition are thin to the limit of imperceptibility.Elizabeth's other dilemma is with the bishops, a powerful Catholic congregation refusing to pay allegiance to the queen who dared to deny the Pope's influence. Probably the first turning point of Elizabeth's rise to power is her first confrontation with the bishops, where she explains the reasons of her attitude toward the Pope, how can one be faithful to two countries in the same time. As she said, not without a delighted irony, it's all a matter of 'common sense'. Whether she gained the sympathy of her audience is not the point, at least, she's assessing her independence as a religious person, a first step, before assessing her independence as a woman-to-marry, then a woman, and final step: a Head of State, from Elizabeth to the Virgin Queen, a long process occupying the first two thirds of the film.And the force of the film is to never detach itself from the plot's basis, which is to understand the progressive domestication of a throne, of a country, which is like a savage horse that refuses to be ridden. And never falling into simplification, it takes its time to depict all the interactions and influences that would forge the growing authority of Elizabeth. It's about succession and conquest of authority, which is the cement that builds the durability of power. And when we consider how both Elizabeth and England were when the film begun, it becomes one of the most interesting character studies and evolutions in cinema's recent history.It would even remind of another classic: ""The Godfather"". Both movies are about a character so underestimated because of an outcast status and apparent weakness (being a civilian/ being a woman) that the conquest of authority is even more captivating. As viewers, watching these films where an underdog becomes a ruthless but charismatic powerful figure is as delightful as reading some pages of Machiavelli's ""Prince"". And this is not a fortuitous comparison: when in the last chapters, you read how some cruel acts can help to consolidate a power, you can't help but think of ""Elizabeth""'s climax that resonates like the ""Godfather""'s Baptism Massacre sequence.And after the climax, the movie takes a new dimension, as we don't just understand the nature of power, but of monarchy. Why this appeal for kings and queens? Because God is so untouchable that we need human figures that incarnate this power in the face of Earth. It almost sounds heretic but if you read the Constitution of most monarchies, you're always to find the mark of religion, and whether this representative power has declined, kings and queens have always been a model of metaphysical fascination. And when they commit cruel acts, the veneration is so strong and the adoration so sincere that we would all find convenient alibis, for people allowed to act as a God-like figure.This is what being a Queen is about and probably the words implicitly written by the last scene where Elizabeth sits in the throne. And Cate Blanchett, 'Blanche' as the impressive whiteness that painted the Queen's new 'virginity' is simply perfect in this powerful examination of the roots of power.",Elizabeth
23,kenjha,Royal Failure,4,3 May 2009,"Given that the filmmakers have taken liberties with historical facts in this account of the rise to power in England of Elizabeth I, it is surprising how dull the script is. It's also quite muddled, making it a chore to figure out who's doing what to whom. Blanchett is fine in the title role and is ably supported by Rush. Fiennes is underwhelming as the queen's lover. Kapur's amateurish camera work, particularly the overuse of overhead shots, doesn't help matters. Despite his indulgent attempts to call attention to himself, he remains one of only a handful of directors of Best Picture Oscar nominees not to be nominated for Best Director. At least the costumes are colorful.",Elizabeth
24,sol-,The Queen,6,3 April 2016,"Loosely based on the life of Queen Elizabeth I, this historical drama examines her ascent to throne following the death of her sister and the hardships she faced as an illegitimate woman wanting to make her own decisions. The film is slow to warm up with a lot of time spent on Elizabeth frolicking about as a youth before taking the crown. The second half of the film flows better with a constant sense of imminent danger and unease. Much of Cate Blanchett's transformation in the title role also comes in the second half as she goes from nervously practicing a speech again and again to confidently telling all her advisors what to do. Highly praised as Blanchett's performance often it is, it is the cinematography that stands out the most here. 'Match Point' cinematographer Remi Adefarasin does a magnificent job shooting the film with spinning shots from extreme high and extreme low angles and lots of gliding shots throughout. The film's next best asset is the performances of Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and Fanny Ardant, but not everyone is well cast. Joseph Fiennes is only adequate as Elizabeth's controversial love interest while Vincent Cassel plays his role as a cross-dressing suitor with such an inappropriately comic edge that he feels like part of an entirely different film. The casting is generally good though, and the costumes and sets are as detailed as one would expect. This might not be the most accurate or enticing screen depiction of Elizabeth I, but for its insight into the fragile mentality of the monarch during the first few years of her reign, it is a hard film to pass up.",Elizabeth
25,didi-5,"Historically shaky, visually stunning",9,11 November 1998,"Having heard a lot of negative comments about this film, I went along purely on the strength of the largely British cast and what I knew of their previous work.  I wasn't disappointed.  Kapur's direction is a little irritating at times (a few too many overhead shots), but the film looks fantastic and the music, although perhaps not always from the right period, fits the visuals perfectly.  Cate Blanchett is a stunning Elizabeth, although I feel the insistence of the film to focus on the early part of her reign is a little disappointing.  And why no mention of Essex, Drake, or even Mary Queen of Scots, except in passing?  Best performances come from Chris Eccleston, Geoffrey Rush, and Richard Attenborough, but everyone has their moments and no one lets the cast down.  Well worth seeing.",Elizabeth
26,Red-125,She was meant to be queen!,10,5 January 2008,"Elizabeth (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur, was the film that made Cate Blanchett a star. Elizabeth I has been portrayed by many fine actors, and, of course, Blanchett has portrayed her again in a newly released film. Whether Blanchett is or isn't the best movie Elizabeth is not the point. The point is that she fully inhabits the character, so that it requires no suspension of disbelief to accept Blanchett as the young queen, fighting for her crown and fighting for her life. I can't pretend to know whether the costumes and sets are accurate reflections of Elizabethan England. However, they certainly appear realistic, as do the (very unpleasant) scenes of martyrdom and torture. Unlike ""Shakespeare in Love,"" this movie doesn't give us endless glimpses of dogs, pigs, street entertainers, etc. (In our family, we say ""Cue the jugglers."") The film deals with nobility, and their lives were lived in their castles or at the royal court, not on the streets.The supporting actors are outstanding--especially Fanny Ardant as Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, Christopher Eccleston as the powerful and ambitious Duke of Norfolk, and Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, who will stop at nothing to serve his queen. I was less impressed by Joseph Fiennes as Elizabeth's love interest, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. I don't know how the historical Dudley looked and acted, but Fiennes looked both hostile and tentative throughout the film.The core of the drama is, of course, Elizabeth, and Cate Blanchett performs the role to perfection. We can believe her as a frivolous adolescent, as a ruler finding her way, and as the more mature historical Elizabeth, who created a role and then played that role for the rest of her reign. Even if you don't like historical dramas, it's worth seeing this film just to watch Cate Blanchett act. You can ignore Leicester, Norfolk, and the Duke of Anjou. Just look at Elizabeth!",Elizabeth
27,filipemanuelneto,"A good historical drama, a little under-appreciated.",7,3 October 2016,"This is an good historical film, which depicts the initial period of Elizabeth I of England's reign, and how she tried to hold on to power before her enemies. Historically, appears to be quite close to reality, despite the existence of some discrepancies. Its the first of three films (the third is in development) that depict the reign of this monarch, embodied by Cate Blanchett, a remarkable actress who achieve, in these three works, her magnum opus.And no less. Blanchett has managed to capture the physical aspect and most likely personality characteristics of this queen. A true chameleon work, which earned the actress a Golden Globe for ""Best Actress Drama"" (would have won the Oscar for Best Actress that year but, sometimes, the heads of the Hollywood Academy does not seem to know to see something good when they have it in front of their noses). Another actor who deserves congratulations is Geoffrey Rush, who gave life to Sir Francis Walsingham. Sir Richard Attenborough also participated in this movie (I think it must have been one of his last films) in the role of Lord Burleigh, with great talent. However, the male role that stands out in this film is Robert Dudley, played by Joseph Fiennes. This character was the true (probably the only) love of the young queen and is very important in the plot. Fiennes managed to capture his essence, opportunistic and somewhat hypocritical.The sets and costumes are absolutely rigorous, depict pleasant rigor clothing and environments of the Elizabethan era. The colors are very good, nice to look at the movement of the camera is excellent, the dialogues are memorable and worthy of quotation.

Joseph Fiennes was probably asked to play William Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love because of his excellent performance in Elizabeth, and he was only one among a great many actors who gave incredible performances in this spectacular historical drama, in which the 16th century is flawlessly created and presented. There are many things that make Elizabeth a great film. For example, not only is it amazingly realistic, but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen. The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader, and her potent and strong-willed personality is captured very well in this film. She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life, and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film.

When decisions had to made, decisions on which the survival of her country depended, she made these decisions ... and her decisions were RIGHT! Elizabeth was never prepared or trained to rule a country. But she did the job and did it so well that to this day her name has become synonymous with leadership, accomplishment and service. Queen Elizabeth was a hero; Queen Elizabeth was great. Under her outstanding leadership Britain defeated the Spanish Armada, then the biggest naval force ever assembled. That alone warrants a movie.

34,MaxBorg89,Queen Blanchett,9,13 January 2008,"The Academy Awards ceremony of 1999 angered many people: Shakespeare in Love, albeit a very smart and funny film, robbed the superior Saving Private Ryan of the Best Picture Oscar; Roberto Benigni beat Edward Norton in the Best Actor category (though it was the Italian star's behavior, rather than his performance, that irritated those attending the event); and Gwyneth Paltrow, who wasn't actually bad in Shakespeare, walked away with the Best Actress award, depriving Cate Blanchett of the recognition she should have received for her revelatory work in Elizabeth.This film, the first in what the director hopes will be a trilogy (the second installment was released in 2007), covers the early years of Elizabeth I's reign, from her harsh upbringing to the decision to call herself ""the Virgin Queen"". To describe her situation as tough is an understatement: she was a Protestant monarch in a largely Catholic kingdom, several covert groups wanted her dead and foreign sovereigns kept asking for her hand in marriage, without ever succeeding, for the only man she loved was also the only one she couldn't have.Conspiracies and unhappy romances: two unusual ingredients for a period drama. And that is exactly why the film succeeds: in the mind of director Shekhar Kapur, this is not the usual costume film where events are observed with a static eye and what might be perceived by some as excessive slowness (Quentin Tarantino's infamous rant about ""Merchant-Ivory sh*t"" is aimed at those productions); instead, we get a lively, vibrant piece of work, with the camera sweeping through the gorgeous sets and leering at the exquisite costumes while recounting the grand story. And what a story: the thriller aspect aims to please viewers who find the genre a bit lacking in the tension department, whereas the Queen's doomed love affair with Joseph Fiennes' Earl of Leicester (a plot element to which the BBC miniseries from 2005, starring Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons, is a sort of sequel) is the polar opposite of the sanitized, passionless romantic tales that tend to feature in other period films.Good-looking technique and strong storytelling would, however, be useless if the title role wasn't played by an equally great actress, and Pakur found the perfect Elizabeth in Blanchett: an odd choice she may have seemed (she was a complete unknown in Hollywood prior to being cast in this movie), but the performance she delivers is nothing short of astonishing. Doubtful, determined, passionate, naive, heartbroken, firm and charismatic - she is quite simply the best on-screen incarnation of Elizabeth in the long history of biopics. The supporting cast (Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Richard Attenborough) is also excellent, as expected from British and Australian thespians, but it is Blanchett who dominates the entire picture.

The sexual stuff in particular is obnoxious (like Elizabeth's maids peeping on her copulating with Robert Dudley-- what was that?). What they did to the Duke of Anjou, Mary Tudor, and Mary de Guise is just so far into the realm of dumb, turning actual people into caricatures.And that's the problem: the whole thing feels juvenile.

The middle part of the movie may have some viewers drifting, since it is slightly slow moving, but the ending is worth staying around for in my opinion. This film is not in the greatest movies of all time category, and it shouldn't be. It's not amazing, but it is well made, and really does the source material justice, and if you are a student studying this time period, or just really interested in history, then I suggest it. 7/10.",Elizabeth
38,triple8,"An interesting, sometimes intense movie.",7,22 March 2004,"I had been wanting to see the movie ""Elizabeth"" for quite awhile. I had heard such good things about it, from friends and reviews on here. I had that chance recently, and have to admit it was a pretty good movie. Cate Blanchett plays a wonderful Elizabeth, the character development is rich and interesting to watch. This movie has a somewhat long running time but the time passes quickly and that's a plus. Your also drawn in from the beginning, to the duplicity, deception and numerous motivations of the many around her. One thing ""Elizabeth"" certainly isn't is boring.If one has always been fascinated by royalty, this movie is just about the perfect choice. I was and am,one who does have a strong interest in that, growing up I read many a book about kings and queens etc etc. ""Elizabeth"" creates the feeling of the royal court wonderfully. And I mustn't forget to mention the cinematography either which is wonderful.Elizabeth is a movie I liked a whole lot while never actually loving. I think that's because of the Amount of characters and the ambiguity of virtually all of them. So many characters are introduced, many peoples' motives are never revealed fully, it's absolutely,a movie, where if your distracted for a second or two you lose a great deal. While the character development for Elizabeth is darn near perfect it's not there as much in anybody else. Still, The story of Elizabeth is a fascinating one and this is an absorbing and good movie. My vote is 7.5 out of 10.",Elizabeth
39,nycritic,Her Majesty the Queen,10,27 February 2006,"A lush, textured biopic which brings to life Elizabeth's inexorable conversion from a bohemian, art-loving girl to an implacable icon who brought England from obscurity into the age of Enlightment.Shemar Kapur elevates ELIZABETH from what could have been yet the umpteenth Masterpiece Theater production full of lush costumes, elaborate set pieces, verbose speeches, and by-the-numbers story. His vision of the England at the cusp of Elizabeth's ascent to the throne is striking, dark, and menacing -- this is a country without a leader, being sold to the highest bidder. You feel the dangers at every corner. There is no guarantee that Elizabeth the Queen will survive her first years as such, unscathed. There is too much anger and hatred against her as in the way Kapur introduces every male character who in seeing her natural power recoil from it as if they had received a slap square in the face. Even when we know the eventual outcome and Kapur doesn't always present the events as they actually occurred (as when Walsingham kills Marie de Guise after a night of pleasure), Kapur is excellent in establishing a sense of wonder at just how Elizabeth opens up like a flower and outshines her competition. In having Cate Blanchett portray her in a very regal yet modern way we cease to look at Elizabeth as a painting. Watch her practice her speech in a rapid succession of scenes: this is a vulnerable woman thrown in a den of lions having to prove herself. And to think this woman, who would have preferred dancing and living a life of artistic pleasures, turned England into a powerful monarchy.A wonderful supporting cast of who's-who in British television and film, ELIZABETH the movie which brought Blanchett's talents to the forefront and established her power as an actress of her generation.",Elizabeth
40,eric262003,Good Film With Its Fair Share of Flaws,6,27 January 2014,"I have been fascinated with Tudor history, but I when watching a film about the Tudor era, I was not expecting an accurate historical account. When I saw ""Elizabeth"" in 1998, I came to see some riveting performances, beautiful costumes gorgeous settings and stunning direction. I never let historical inaccuracies get in the way, because from my experience I know perfectly well that entertainment and historical facts don't collide very well in the Hollywood vacuum.Cate Blanchett was spectacular as the titular character. She just seemed natural for the role, both physically and mentally in character. However, I found the portrayal to be at times a bit uptight at times when it would have been more stimulating if she was more stone-cold. But I guess the Hollywood community wanted to emphasis on the uptight psyche that shines upon Elizabeth's inner struggles. I guess it's more complex to play a laid-back stone-faced queen while being manifested with inner anxiety.I was turned off the scene where Elizabeth was engaged in coitus with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) while her ladies catch them in the act. I might assume this is a hook by Hollywood to include a romantic entanglement in this Tudor film. However, I found the scene to be grotesque because for the sake of decency, they should have made their sexual entanglement to be a little more private.The scene where Elizabeth comes together as a monarch and uses low-key manipulative tactics towards her Parliament was executed to absolute perfection. Blanchett adds just the right touch of diffidence and nobleness along with subliminal humour to make this scene all the more effective. Elizabeth's shrugging over marriage is quite vocal and very determined fearing that if she should tie the knot, she will lose her powers as the top of the monarchy. The various scenes where our pale-faced majesty starts losing her grip on reality towards her power by consorting towards unremorseful and emotionally distant are brilliantly exhibited.My main desire was to have Elizabeth deliver a more devilish charm while at the same time keeping if more subtle. On a historical basis, she did treat her suitors like puppets as she solely structured her country's defenses in order to gain her independence, but the low-key elements were not properly exhibited here. On a regular basis, she barks out that she will never wed and there was very little in terms of the Spanish suitor who's infamous Armada did not fare very well against Elizabeth's powerful Navy. I was disappointed this chain of events never materialized in the script.Sure I may have done a rant a bit here, but overall the movie was not entirely terrible. It was entertainingly satisfying with plenty of historical references to please people who are aficionados of the Tudor Era period pieces. I guess this movie to me would be a onetime deal for me because there were several flaws about it.",Elizabeth
41,lewiskendell,The early years of the Virgin Queen.,7,29 July 2010,"""I am my father's daughter. I am not afraid of anything.""I'll admit that I enjoyed recent historical dramas like The Duchess and The Young Victoria. But sometimes, pardon my language, I want to see a historical drama with some balls. And I don't mean the kind with dancing and fancy dresses. Elizabeth fits that descriptor admirably.The movie opens with a chilling scene precluding the execution of some Protestant rebels, which does an effective job of setting the tone for one of the central conflicts of that time and the move; the conflict between the supporters of the Catholic church and the Protestants (of which Elizabeth was a steadfast member, to the dismay of many).Elizabeth covers the time period stretching from the early dangers she faced at the hands of her suspicious half-sister, Queen Mary I, to the political and personal successes and failures of the early part of her 44 year reign. We watch as she faces rebellion and betrayal, and gradually sheds her inexperience to become a forceful, capable, and independent ruler.  Cate Blanchett is a fantastic actress. That should be a surprise to no one. And she certainly looks the part. She makes for a fine Queen Elizabeth. As for the rest of the cast (sans one person, in particular), I found them all to be suitable. Blanchett is clearly the focus of the movie, though, and the film works because it rests so well on her queenly shoulders. As for the settings, costumes, etc., they're less opulent than those that I've seen in some more recent movies of this type, but they serve their purpose within the story well.  My only real problem with the movie (besides how comically evil some members of the Roman Catholic church were portrayed to be) was Robert Fiennes in the role of Lord Robert. His character seemed like he would be right at home in a bad romance novel, and I found myself rolling my eyes or losing interest nearly every time he was on screen. He was the wrong actor for the part, too much of the movie was unwisely (and unnecessarily) focused on him, and his interactions with Elizabeth were handled atrociously. Those were the only weak scenes in a very strong movie, but they did force me to drop my score. Other than that, though, I highly recommend Elizabeth.",Elizabeth
42,valadas,The building of a Queen,7,2 January 2012,"A historic fiction work (a novel, a play or a film) doesn't need to respect historic true in every detail to be of great value. Some narrative freedom may be allowed in order to promote aesthetic values or beauty providing the true essence of historic facts is not altered. This movie abides entirely by these rules and gives us a story of what in its essence might have been the ascent of Queen Elizabeth I of England to the throne and the intrigues, enmities and hardships she had to fight in that ascent and on the first days of her reign to impose herself in the end as the Queen who made England the first power of the time. Cate Blanchett does a reasonable and rather acceptable role as the Queen, passing from a somewhat childish behaviour in the beginning (very understandable allowing for her youth) to a progressively more serious and stern one as far as she went on imposing herself to friends and foes. The images and scenes show adequately an accurate and even beautiful reconstitution of that historic epoch. However I think that some scenes and dialogues are too ""modern"" for the epoch in terms of values as well as of some liberties Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) takes with the Queen in the presence of other people namely the court, which I don't think would be admitted at the time. Not a masterpiece but just a rather good historic movie anyway.",Elizabeth
43,MartianOctocretr5,Ambitious biography,7,25 September 2007,"Queen Elizabeth I, the ""Virgin Queen,"" was monarch at a pivotal time in England's history, and one of the longest reigning monarchs (over 40 years). This biopic studies her early years, starting in her teens at a time when her infamous father had decreed she should not be in the line of succession to the throne, through the years of court intrigue she endured, into her ascension to the throne, and the early years of her reign.The focus is on the struggles of the daughter of the ill-fated and disgraced Anne Boleyn to establish her birthright, and then to hold on to it once achieved. Although there are some aberrations to true historical fact, good insight into Elizabeth's challenges are given. One example of historical liberties taken is the portrayal of her half-sister Mary considering murdering her. Most historians agree the Mary and Elizabeth were very close sisters. Cate Blanchett resembles (paintings of) the long reigning queen, and her performance is of a strong and confident woman, a leader not just by blood line, but possessing the unique qualities that make for an effective leader.Of note is the superior cinematography and lighting tecniques to establish mood. Deep hues for troublesome times, bright exuberant colors for lighter moments. For example, Mary, depicted as evil and a danger to Elizabeth, was always shrouded in dark, poorly lit rooms.Successes and failures of Elizabeth's later years will be documented in the sequel coming out this year, while this first installment leaves off after the first few years of her reign. They were difficult years, to say the least. A cheating lover, traitors, despisers, pretenders to the throne, an oddball suitor, dangers from France and Spain, etc.A worth while film, which, in spite of some inaccuracies, brings the famous queen to life.",Elizabeth
44,DeeNine-2,Superb,10,2 February 2000,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)I wonder if the feminists have discovered this movie and if so, what they think of it. How could they not discover it since it has won a number of awards, including seven Academy Award nominations? Yet, I wonder, because the movie is deeper than might be thought on first blush, and it reverberates, but not with any simplistic sexist answers to the human struggle, but with uncomfortable questions, disturbing allegations.Allegation number one: a woman can rule and be the equal of a man, but she must suppress her feminine instincts. Uncomfortable question number one: are women as vicious and murderous as our ""demonic males""?What makes Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of power. Notice that she does NOT become a man, nor take on bogus or pseudo masculine traits to achieve her ends. She remains a woman to the core, yet acts with the kind of aggressive, decisive, brutal intelligence usually assigned to men.Next question: Is this good to know?A great work of art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer them.Cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes. Shekhar Kapur's direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to moral or spiritual wisdom. There is no preaching or taking sides. The script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic development, climax and resolution. The editing is almost invisible yet we can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved; viz., it is remarkable how we are led to experience the political growth of the young queen and see her take on the attributes of her father, as necessary, and then see her seek refuge in the church and a kind of piety as ""the Virgin Queen"" in such a short period of elapsed screen time. THAT is film making of the highest quality.Not enough can be said about the subtle, charming, expansive, vivid and veracious performance of Blanchett, yet Joseph Fiennes is to be commended for achieving success in a difficult and unsympathetic role. Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed strongly to the success of the film.This is not to say that the film is without flaws. The scene where Elizabeth discovers the French duke's homosexuality is unlikely as staged, and her risqué behavior with Leicester not in character. Better, I think, would have been to keep him frustrated and allow him only to play at love; however, today's audiences seem to demand coitus always. Leicester's dalliance with one of her ladies was extremely stupid, but in character. The co-incidence of her wearing the acid dress as she betrayed her queen was a delicious if implausible irony. Further it was not made clear how the queen's commands through Walsingham are made viable so that they must be carried out; indeed the under struggle among the ministers was glossed over, although her dismissal of the no longer effective Sir William Cecil was aptly done.(Of course I can presume to answer my queries.) I think allegation number one, that a woman as a ruler must abandon her normal sexual drive is true, but the argument is too long for this space. Are women as vicious as men? They don't take the foolish chances that men take, since they can be reproductively rewarded only by staying alive and securing a stable future, whereas men can reproduce prodigiously for a while and then die successfully. But when necessary, women can be as brutal as Genghis Khan, as Elizabeth demonstrates.Is it good to know that women are also vicious animals, when all the time we would prefer to think of them as fairy tale princesses? Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up; but, yes, it's important to always keep that in mind when out there in the big world. I might add that it is sobering to realize that women as reproductive animals was not even addressed in this film. Therein lies another dimension of femininity that needs exploration...",Elizabeth

47,mentalcritic,Drier than oatbran,1,22 November 2004,"The story of Queen Elizabeth I is one as mired in controversy and speculation as President Dubya's terms. Some say that she was the best thing to ever happen to England. Others say that she was a manic warmonger devoted only to causing bloodshed. Indeed, the mentality of everyone living in England or Europe at this time is apparently quite bizarre, but then, so too is that of the director of this film.The story of anyone involved with government in the Middle Ages is a goldmine for entertaining material. It is therefore a real mystery how Shekhar Kapur and Michael Hirst managed to make something so dull. Each scene seems so flat and underacted that it tends to resemble a daytime television show. Maybe it is just my flat affect talking, but moments when characters are meant to be at each others' throats simply failed to register for me.Indeed, it is a sad indictment upon this exercise in the pedestrian that one starts to wish that Miranda Richardson, arguably the best actor to ever impersonate Queen Elizabeth I, had been cast instead. Her little ""First I'm going to have a little drinky... and then I'm going to execute the whole bally lot of you"" speech would have worked wonders here. Elizabeth I was, like her predecessors, a violent tyrant who would not think twice about removing her own daughter's head if it meant protecting her position of power.One big problem here is that the film tries to cover almost the entire reign of Queen Elizabeth. Such a subject simply cannot be compressed into two hours and remain interesting. Indeed, one constantly asks themselves who she is meant to be fighting and avoiding from one scene to the next. There is little transition from moment to moment. Characters with little or no introduction are killed off in montage scenes that make their deaths seem of little importance or consequence. Given that these are members of Elizabeth's court, I don't think Kapur meant this to be a commentary on people's places within the Kingdom.I gave this dull and monotonous film a two out of ten. I wasn't even going to give it the satisfaction of a one. Only films that are so bad they're amusing deserve a one, and Elizabeth is so dry and by the numbers that amusement is virtually impossible during its running time.",Elizabeth
48,jaredmobarak,The Virgin QueenElizabeth,8,15 October 2007,"With outstanding performances, lush settings and costumes, as well as a well-crafted story, this film does exactly what is needed for a biography to succeedand it sticks to a specific period of a legend's life, without trying to tell eighty years in two hours. Hers is a tale that many know, at least a trifle bit, about. From our introduction, writer Michael Hirst tells us exactly what is necessary to gage all our principal players. Elizabeth is a Protestant, thus a heretic to those in power. Her being an illegitimate heir, daughter of Ann Boleyn, those with aspirations to the crown, the Duke of Norfolk at the forefront, look to do all they can in order to remove her. Elizabeth is at first a child in love, given an opportunity to rule yet without the strength needed to make decisions based on her own sound judgment rather than those around her. While she is a woman, and even those who call themselves friends and allies can't shake that fact, in order to rule, she must be sure her mind is ruling and not her heart. Thus, we are shown the rise of a woman, whom no one thought able to survive a day on the job, who would soon vault her nation to be the wealthiest and most powerful in the world.Shekhar Kapur is blessed with a script from Hirst that gets everything right. We are taken through the journey of betrayals with little doubt or vagueness. All crossovers of allegiances, all attempts at deception in order to use her as a pawn for more power, and each action that slowly shows her what it means to be human and how even the most trusted of her peers can be bought and sold, are portrayed to the point. Everything in the world was stacked against the Queen whether it politics, religion, or love. While the script is devoid of excess, it is the direction that flourishes with style and radiance. From the castle interiors to the period dress, the film is precise in its recreation of the time. The words are perfect and the plot fast paced and exciting, but without the artistry to deliver it as such, no one would be talking about the end result nearly as much as they do. A good story may be enough for me, but it is the spectacle that allows it to succeed across the board.Besides the visuals, the main driving force at play is the career-defining performance from Cate Blanchett. It is this role that will always be synonymous with her name. To be able to show off the smile of a young woman attempting to keep her life together while it is swept away in the storm of responsibility for a nation is an amazing feat. Her virtue and faith in her own beliefs showed early on during her subjection to treason charges and almost execution at the hands of her half-sister, but they only fully show themselves at the end when she has finally excepted her duty above any earthly gains she might have otherwise. Only by secluding herself from the temptations of the flesh, or the heart of a woman, as some characters here would say, can she be strong enough to survive and protect her ward of England. The power that exudes from her being during the final chapter is immense. Some may say she became cold-hearted, but if you watch her performance carefully, you'll see that it is her love and that alone which enables her to do the things she does. Only love and faith could allow her to acquiesce to the deeds she knows must occur for her land to be safe from harm. I can't wait to see this strength of character throughout an entire film, as I can only imagine Elizabeth: The Golden Age will see her reign with that power prominently thrust forward.One can't stop with just Blanchett when speaking of the acting on display here. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely brilliant portraying the one man truly working on the Queen's side. It is his role as Sir Francis Walsingham that reminds Elizabeth of who she is. He speaks of what Princes must do to succeed and what dark deeds are necessary for the good of the whole. He treats the Queen as an intelligent being and not a woman in a man's job. Without his dedication and willingness to do the dirty work in order to propel her reputation as one to not take lightly, her reign would have been very short lived. Stoic throughout, besides a few gentle moments where the appearance of a smile can be seen, Rush is the epitome of a man taking his career seriously and the well being of those in his duty to protect ahead of any other.The rest of the cast is a who's who of European greats. Christopher Eccleston is spot-on as the villainous Norfolk just doing what he believes is best for his nation; Joseph Fiennes is good as Lord Robert, however at times seems a bit too theatric; Richard Attenborough brings a nice turn as the Queen's closest adviser, wrestling with his belief in her at the expense of his thoughts that she is just a woman; and then we have the numerous cameos from the likes of Emily Mortimer, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, James Frain (also starring in the Tudors), and a gem of comedy to lighten the mood from Vincent Cassel. It is these small roles that show the true strength of the film. By reining in the scope of a story about Elizabeth to that crucial time of her ascension to power, it allows for the filmmakers to make sure every detail is perfect. Credit to Hirst and Kapur for getting it all right.",Elizabeth
49,hall895,The muddled monarchy,6,13 August 2009,"There's a lot going on in this movie. Perhaps there's a bit too much going on. There's so much plotting and scheming that it's hard to keep track of who exactly is plotting with whom. The gist of it is that the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth finds her hold on the throne, and indeed her life, in rather constant danger. Who can she trust? Who is really on her side? Of all the men who vie for her affections is there one who actually loves her? Or is love out of the question, her potential marriage destined to be just part of the political game? A lot of questions and not all of them will be answered in satisfying fashion. The plot of this film is rather untidy and it never seems to quite tie itself together.As a 16th-century English drama this is a film which is obviously going to have a very specific look to it. And the filmmakers capture the period beautifully, the film really does look fantastic. Fabulous sets and costumes bring the period alive. Elizabeth's coronation stands out as one scene which looks particularly magnificent. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth is terrific but not everything which surrounds her works. There are some other excellent performances, most notably from Geoffrey Rush as a man who clearly is on Elizabeth's side and Christopher Eccleston as a man who clearly is not. While those important roles are performed well Joseph Fiennes never entirely convinces in playing Robert Dudley, the one man Elizabeth seems to truly love. And while many more characters, and potential conspirators, wander through the movie few make much of a positive impression and a couple of characters really don't work at all.The movie plays fast and loose with historical facts in an attempt to ratchet up the drama. But the story as presented has much of the drama drained from it by the end. Things get rather muddled and at times hard to follow. By the time the director tries to tidy things up with a Godfather homage (or Godfather ripoff if you're inclined to be less charitable) the film seems to have gotten away from him a bit. Elizabeth has so many potential enemies it's hard to keep track. As the film nears its end the key questions are who is ultimately conspiring with whom and why? As you watch the film you may have a hard time figuring those answers out. The film starts with great promise but as it moves towards its finale rather than building momentum the story seems to fizzle out. At its heart the movie has a wonderful, captivating performance from Blanchett. And the look of the film is wonderful. But there are problems with the story. While certainly intriguing the plot in the end becomes a little too involved for its own good. All in all it's a movie which definitely has some things going for it but which ultimately falls just a touch short of being completely satisfying.",Elizabeth
50,vip_ebriega,ELIZABETH reigns high.,10,29 April 2008,"My Take: Less a biopic and more of a daring GODFATHER-styled story elevated by Cate Blanchett's unforgettable performance.The year: 1554. Faith has been divided into two: Christianity and Protestant. The zealous Queen Mary of Scots rules England, but has no heir to take over her reign, since she bares no son. The only one next in line for the throne is her sister, Elizabeth, a protestant. When she fails the attempt to execute her for treason, Mary closely falls to her deathbed, and Elizabeth, closer to sit in her throne and rule over England. All these and later events are portrayed perfectly in ELIZABETH, a bold, daring and visually stunning excursion into a dark realm of history and the life of the known Virgin Queen.Firstly, the stunning look of ELIZABETH is clearly worth mentioning. The sets and especially the costumes by Alexander Byrne are spectacular. Credit also goes to director Shekhar Kapur. A brilliant visionary, Kapur fills the screen with inspired beauty, easily seen in the film's design and stunning elaborate use of color. The shots of the palace and dungeons are dark and gloomy, as are the scenes showing great battle and fear. While the depressing scenes show real grief, scenes of joy, and most especially are scenes with Elizabeth (played by Cate Blanchett) are always associated with bright light. Director Kapur thinks the character specifically needs the brightness to associate with her radiance. He was most precise and correct.But the film isn't all style, it's also good with the actors and the script. The best performance, and perhaps the best thing about the film, is the stunning performance by Cate Blanchett as the Virgin Queen herself. Perhaps, when accepting the role of the Queen, Ms. Blanchett didn't just read the script, she must have also gotten herself in the character, saying ""I can do this!"", and she does, most deserving of her Oscar nomination. In fact, I'll go as far as to say she would have won it. Supporting performances by Geoffrey Rush (as Sir Francis Walsingham), Richard Attenborough (as Sir William Cecil), Joseph Fiennes (as Sir Robert Dudley) and Christopher Eccleston (as the Duke of Norfolk) are all superb.Joined with the superb cinematography, brilliant score and excellent screen play written by Michael Hirst, giving breath of beauty and courage especially to the title character, all add up to the overall magnificence of this dark and stunning thriller. ELIZABETH is terrific entertainment.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Elizabeth
51,johno-21,The Virgin Queen,8,28 February 2007,"A film by a director from India staring an actress from Australia in a story about one of Britain's most well-known monarchs. But hey, it works. This is a lavish costume drama of a semi-historical account of the Ascension to the thrown and the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I. Henry VIII is the second Tudor king and after his death his son the Protestant Edward VI becomes a boy king but dies as a teenager. Edward's cousin, the Catholic Jane Grey becomes the regent queen for nine days and is executed and the Catholic Mary I who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon becomes Queen. Mary in the five years of her reign earns the title of Bloody Mary for executing more people than had been executed in the previous century and a half. Childless, she dies of ovarian cancer and her half sister, the Protestant Elizabeth who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, becomes Queen Elizabeth I also known as Gloriana, Good Queen Bess and the Virgin Queen. Elizabeth is also the sixth and last Tudor monarch. This film is filled with castle intrigue, the fight for power, and the religious clash between Protestants and Catholics in a post Henry VIII and post Reformation world. Cate Blanchette who had only appeared in a handful of films won acclaim for her staring role in the film Oscar & Lucinda is cast in the title role of Elizabeth which earned her her first Academy Award nomination. This film has a great ensemble cast. Joseph Fiennes is Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester and Eliabeth's true love interest. Geoffry Rush is Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spy master and adviser. Christopher Eccleston is Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the most powerful men in England. Richard Attenborough is Sir William Cecil, Scretary of State and Elizabeth's chief adviser. Fanny Ardant is Mary of Guise the Queen Consort of Scotland who also seeks the throne of England. Vincent Cassel is Duc d'Anjou who is being considered as a possible husband for Elizabeth. Kathy Burke is Queen Mary Tudor who hates her half sister Elizabeth and once had Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower. John Gielgud, in his final film, has a very brief on screen role as The Pope. The film can be a little confusing as it takes a dramatic license with history and tries to fit too much into a two hour run time. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Makeup winning only the Oscar for makeup. Shekhar Kapur directs a script by Michael Hirst with beautiful cinematography by Remi Adelfarasin. John Myhre and Peter Howitt create stunning sets in art and set decoration and Alexandra Byrne designs elaborate period piece costumes. Jenny Shircore wins the film's only Oscar for makeup but had this not been up against some other particularly strong films for 1998 it would have won more. Director Kapur, cinematographer Adelfarasin and writer Michael Hirst have reunited for the sequel The Golden Age with Blanchette reprising her role as Elizabeth and Rush back as Walsingham. I would give this an 8.0 out of 10 and will look forward to it's sequel in which Sir Walter Raliegh will be a principal character.",Elizabeth

53,gbheron,Good Historical Drama,8,19 June 1999,"The opening scene is dark and horrific, and sets the tone for the remaining story.  That story is a behind-the-scenes look at the English monarchy during the final days of the Catholic and childless Queen Mary, and the ascendancy of the Protestant and unmarried Elizabeth.Dark and brooding with deep colors, smoke and shadow, Elizabeth is not a light Renaissance romp.  Bodies do pile up, and cross and double-cross abound as Elizabeth gropes her way to power. And that's about it as far as the story goes...Queen Mary's dying, the Earl of Norfolk and his friends try to kill Elizabeth and fail, Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes queen, Norfolk and friends try again and fail again, then its payback time for Elizabeth.One of my few complaints about the movie is the lack of character development outside of Elizabeth.  The motivations of the surrounding characters is only superficially addressed.  The movie's success rests on two pillars, Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting, and the beautiful cinematography and sets.  Blanchett (and Geoffrey Rush) carry the acting chores, and they are remarkable.  The remainder seem to go a little overboard, like they're doing a 1550s England bit for MTV.The movie certainly entertains and makes for a good viewing.  My only regret is that I saw it on the small screen, and wished I'd seen it in a theater.",Elizabeth
54,TheNorthernMonkee,Decent historical film,7,14 February 2005,"SPOILERS In the history of these British Isles, there are few figures as well known and adored as the legendary Queen Elizabeth I. As Queen, Elizabeth took England from a self imploding nation to a major European superpower. Portraying herself as an untouchable figure of stone, Elizabeth began her reign much differently. In Shekhar Kapur's wonderful film ""Elizabeth"" we witness her ascension to the throne and the birth of the legend.In 1554, Mary I of England (Kathy Burke) is on the throne. Married to Philip of Spain, Mary is a staunch Catholic and is worried about Protestant ascension to the throne through Elizabeth. She therefore locks the young princess in the Tower of London with views to an execution. Elizabeth need not worry too much however as Mary is far from well.As a naturally beautiful redhead, Cate Blanchett is the perfect choice to play Queen Bess. Starting as a young girl, Blanchett's performance is powerful as the monarch grows through disappointments and early failures.Blanchett is also helped by some fine performances by actors such as Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Joseph Fiennes. Rush in particular as the cunning Sir Francis Walsingham is exemplary as he slowly gains the trust and respect of the young Queen.Kapur's film does at times feel like a BBC Sunday Night production. Reminiscent of the recent drama about Charles II, it is a lavish film full of a star studded cast. Ultimately though, feeling like one of these productions is not a bad thing. The film is detailed, powerful and wonderfully directed. It never stops moving and it teaches us throughout (although a slightly corrupt history). Historical dramas may not be suited to everyone, but those who do like this genre, will love this film.",Elizabeth
55,gelman@attglobal.net,Fully Deserves the Honors It Received,9,17 September 2007,"Over the past several years, we've enjoyed a veritable avalanche of Elizabeths -- this one with Cate Blanchett, the HBO film with Helen Mirren and a PBS Masterpiece Theatre version with Anne-Marie Duff. While all three are splendid, each in its own way, this one has the strongest cast and Cate Blanchett is a beautiful and imposing Elizabeth. I have no doubt that it reached the widest audience and with such other players as Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud and Richard Attenborough, it depended less than did the other two versions on the actress playing the queen. This is one is, by a considerable margin, the shortest of the three. It fully deserved the honors it received. But truth be told, I thought the other two versions superior: the HBO film because Helen Mirren is unequalled (though Cate Blanchett may one day reach her level) and the PBS version because it does the best job of recreating the era and Anne-Marie Duff is quite good, though not as powerful in the role as Mirren and Blanchett.",Elizabeth

It could have happened like this, no one knows for sure.As a movie alone, if you're a fan of the king and queen times, then this is a must see. The character development of Queen Elizabeth was amazing to watch. The story intracate and entertaining with romance, desire, power, twists and turns that make it a fun ride of a movie. The acting was amazing as well as the filming and directing. Cate Blanchett truely embodied the role of Elizabeth giving you a performance to remember. The movie gives you a great insight of what it would have been like for Queen Elizabeth in her time of rule with all the struggles and choices at hand. If you love films in this genre then definitely give this one a go!",Elizabeth
57,rebeljenn,"great performances, picture",7,28 May 2006,"'Elizabeth' is a historical documentary film about Queen Elizabeth I's early years on the throne. This is a story of the queen coping with relationships among a lover, the religious groups, and countries (France and Spain). This film combines excellent acting performances, cinematography, and an interesting story that can appeal to a wide audience.The acting performances were done well throughout the film, and this was especially an important aspect because this is a film about people. Blanchett played an excellent queen, humanising her in her relationships and weaknesses as well as creating a strong-willed and determined leader at the same time.The cinematography also played an important part in this historical film; much care is given to detail. Although most of the film takes part in the palace, colour is used to provide a sense of the times in flashy costumes and events. The contrast helps to portray the historical significance of the film in that throughout the dark times, the Elizabethans loved their entertainment.The story was focused primarily on Elizabeth and her relationships, and it kept the focus on these aspects and did not get too detailed in the overall picture. The story was interesting with a variety of different scenes, and it did not get too involved with fancy dialogue. There was also a sense of humor in the film through the foreign suitor character who was flashy in his emotions and who enjoyed dressing up in a dress. This showed that although the film was a historical one, it was able to find some humor with the characters that is believable and that did not spoil the serious essence of the film.Overall, this is a great film and I'd recommend it. Students in history classes must watch this film but realise that it is only a small aspect of Elizabeth I's life. However, it is a good documentary of the queen and the general historical time.",Elizabeth
58,RonellSowes,Fails to escape the stagyness of such films,6,7 December 2020,"It is common for films about royalty and this time period to be stagey and melodramatic. And while it contains fewer of these attributes than other similar films,Elizabeth still has that stodgy feel to it. It really isn't something to blame on the cast who give authentic performances. Cate Blanchett is a convincing Queen Elizabeth and was nominated for her performance in the film but the one who really makes his part count is Geoffery Rush. Though his role is contained Rush's performance is striking and in my humble opinion the best part of the film. Another first rate actor with an even smaller role is Sir John Gielgud-who for years coruled over the British stage alongside Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier. He was ninety four years old upon this film's release,which was his last.Elizabeth is a film that has no real structured plot or story and is more of a vague survey of events that transitioned Elizabeth from a vulnerable young monarch to one of the most recognized rulers in history.",Elizabeth
59,petarmatic,Excellent!,8,15 March 2014,"This is an extraordinary portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in her early years of reign. I really like films dealing about British monarchy because it is great source of films, series and theater. Many historians thought that British monarch was going to survive, but in the end it did. Hence, we have all these films and series dealing on the subject.First about the film, naturally plot had to be this way, we know a lot about QEI and her life. Acting is fantastic, no wonder Kate Blanchett received Oscar for her role. Costimography is excellent and choice of the sets also. All in all it is a must see, especially for those buffs of the royals.A little bit about the history. I was always wondering how did she manage to stay afloat, everything was against her. She succeeded in defeating Spain and the poor Phillip II did not manage to bring back Roman Cathoicism to Britain. It was a really an outstanding miracle of her times. Many historian can not explain all of that yet, but explanation is rather simple. They did not have weather man during those times.",Elizabeth
60,perfectbond,Very good historical drama,8,15 February 2003,"First I want to say I know this film slightly deviates from or speculates upon actual historical events, but it nonetheless stays close enough to the historical record so as not to offend sensibility. On the filmmaking aspect, Elizabeth is a triumph. Outstanding location shooting, costumes, and cinematography are evident. Director Kapur is blessed with a fantastic cast and he utilizes each of its members wonderfully. In my opinion, Cate Blanchett should definitely won the Oscar over Gwenyth Paltrow for her portrayal of Elizabeth. A great film, 9/10.",Elizabeth

62,jdkraus,One of 1998's best Pictures,9,19 July 2008,"After seeing how bad ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" was, I did not bother to see this movie. However, my cousin saw it and told me it was pretty good. Now that I have seen ""Elizabeth: The Virgin Queen"" twice, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I was never much of a Cate Blanchett fan, in fact I find her to be very overrated, but her performance in this is absolutely mesmerizing. Throughout the film, she has four men in her life. Her lover (Fiennes). Her defender (Rush). Her adviser (Eccleston). And her guardian (Attenborough).Each plays their part well and ultimately changes her character from start to finish as a naive, innocent princess to a ruthless and determined leader. She not only has the appearance of Queen Elizabeth, but also delivers her lines with emotion and intelligence, gradually showing these changes. How she did not get the Oscar for this is beyond my understanding. Then again, she was an unknown in 1998 versus Paltrow (who won that year). Nevertheless, I will always remember this movie as her best work.The accomplishments of the costume designs make up, and art direction doesn't just make the time period of the 1500s look realistic, but it also adds to the creativity of the film as well as an unforgettable time in Europe. I also enjoyed Remi Adefarasin's sweeping cinematography and David Hirschfelder's haunting yet beautiful score.Shekhar Kapur's direction is breathtaking. One of the most amazing scenes in the film is in the beginning where three so-called ""heretics"" are burned. Rather than focusing it blatantly on the victims or on the shocked crowd, it shows the whole scene through an aerial view with slow 360 degree twirls. It may sound like it would make you dizzy but the camera is steady and captures the whole thing marvelously.The only thing I have against this movie is that some of the plots and conspiracies get confusing and hard to follow. Some of the character motives I felt were not broadened enough nor had enough time to be built up. Other than that, I really liked this prequel. 9/10I'm disappointed that this only got on Oscar in 1998, since this is one of two movies that were nominated for Picture I liked that year.",Elizabeth
63,TheOtherFool,Only for fans of the genre,5,26 May 2004,"Costume drama about queen Elizabeth, who reigned England for a period of over 40 years. We follow her during her first years in power as she is supposed to marry, but ultimately doesn't, giving her the 'title' The Virgin Queen.Two stories are in the central. First of all, it's the Queens (a part by Cate Blanchett) lovelife. Three parties desperately want to marry her: the royal families of France and Spain and long time friend and lover Lord Robert (a great Joseph Fiennes, who also starred in (the much better (IMO)) Shakespeare In Love).Then there's the issue of religion. At the time Elizabeth comes to power England is a catholic country, but Elizabeth is protestant. Both sides 'meet' each other in what apparently became the Anglican church. That's a thing I didn't know yet. You see, you *can* learn things from the movies.The acting is impecable and it all looks great, but like other costume drama's it just won't stick with me. At the time of the last (great!) scene I was a bit bored ... is it just me?Strong performances make it a 5/10, but I'm sure fans of the genre (that includes the members of the Academy) will strongly disagree with me.",Elizabeth
64,the red duchess,Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Woman (spoilers),8,2 April 2001,"Like Sirk's Nazi-era 'Final Accord', 'Elizabeth' ends with a familiar image from totalitarian propagandist iconography - in this case, the Virgin Queen, divinely majestic and aloof from her subjects - having previously revealed the processes that have led to this image's construction.  The gulf between serene image and brutal reality, between Elizabeth's powdered ascetisism and the cynical bloodletting, is all the more grotesque in its distasteful sublimation as religious metamorphosis - as Catholic England becomes Protestant, so Elizabeth replaces the Virgin Mary, like Madonna in 'Like a Virgin' re-chastening herself, in a paradoxically Catholic ritual of renunciation, mortification and abstinence - when she has her hair lopped off, like a young woman entering a nunnery, the fallen locks on her thighs suggest that it is more than hair she is losing.  This sequence completes a dialectic (which very much concerned  Elizabethan England) in the film between the human body and the body politic Elizabeth is a symbol of.This is a historical epic you think Foucault might have approved of - indeed, 'Surveiller et Punir' wouldn't be a bad subtitle.  There is a Foucauldian cynicism about the machinations of State here, where religious ideals are only so much murderous politicking (the scenes with the Pope and his envoy are frighteningly convincing), where a church is seen as a perfect setting for regicide.  Kapur impresses on us the monumentality of the world against which Elizabeth struggles, male power figured in forbidding stone buildings and huge, shadowy chambers, where human activity is obscured by the decor or veils, framed by crucifix crosses that have nothing to do with religious trauma. The film opens with Catholics burning Protestant 'heretics' in front of a mob; and ends with a 'Godfather'-like massacring of Protestant Elizabeth's Catholic enemies, whose threat is not religious, but one of power. 
The most repeated visual motif in the film is an unmotivated long shot from deep above a building's rafters looking down on the dotted political players, a terrifying reminder of surveillance and omnipotence, an expression of power that doesn't depend on its human agents, that will always be there to circumscribe human endeavour.  Is it the perenially observing Walsingham, Elizabeth's darkly charismatic advisor-cum-secret-police-henchman, given one of the great entrances in modern cinema?  Or is it the God so godlessly invoked by these monsters?Pedants have complained that 'Elizabeth' is historically inaccurate, as if cinema was a medium for plodding out facts.  'Elizabeth' is not a recreation of Elizabethan England and its modes of cultural expression - the film would be more formalised, ritualised, set as a masque rather than just featuring some.  Kapur's modern techniques, his psychologising, his narrative pace, his restless camera, his (often over-egged) visual effects, all capture the instability of a period that tried to cover it up with pomp and ceremony. 
This does not mean that the historical colour - the music, the pantomimes, the boat rides, the dances aren't in themselves delightful; it's just that they're imbued with narrative and character value (19th and 20th century values) rather than symbolic ones.  This can be seen in the anachronistic use of Elgar and Mozart towards the end, the latter's Requiem especially, as Elizabeth becomes the Virgin Queen, in effect killing herself as a woman. 
In the most bizarrely eclectic cast ever assembled in movies, mixing comedians, footballers, TV quiz-show hosts with 'proper' actors,  Vincent Cassel is hilarious, and Geoffrey Rush is outstanding, proving after the false-start of 'Shine' that he is truly one of the most remarkable figures in film.",Elizabeth
65,gigan-92,It captures many emotions,9,22 August 2017,"Elizabeth is a 1998 'historical' drama portraying the rise of one of history's most notable women, Queen Elizabeth of England. The film first portrays her as a princess who lives out on the countryside before delving into the first few years as the new queen after the death of Mary. It focuses primarily on the perils she faced, both at home and abroad. Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring the likes of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, and Joseph Fiennes, the movie was a huge success at the box office as well as with the critics. It was not only nominated, but also won, several Oscars. After watching it myself, I can see why it was as lauded as it was since it was a very well done film. However, how does it fair in historical accuracy? Wellyes and no. Elizabeth's portrayal as a foil to her half-sister's religious authoritarian-style rule is spot on, especially when recounting the film's gruesome opening. The large-scale opposition of opposition from the Pope is also fairly accurate. The film even mentions England's poor fiscal and military status at the beginning of her reign, nicely done. In spite of all this, the film takes several liberties, both large and small. The death of Mary of Guise at the hand of Walsingham is one such instance, but by far the biggest is the portrayal of Robert Dudley. The move opens with a seemingly accurate depiction of just how close he was to the Queen. The cracks begin to show when Elizabeth discovers Dudley is married, which is a shock to her. In reality she knew of the marriage before she was even Queen. The film takes it even further by having Dudley become involved in a plot to betray Elizabeth. This is quite literally the exact opposite of how their relationship actually was. It is a well-known historical fact that the two remained close friends until his death which devastated her. To go over all of them would be an essay in itself, but simply put the film clearly had no intention of sticking to what actually happened. It is almost insulting to call it a 'historical biography' since it is more of a historical fantasy. All that being said, the movie is still spectacular in all other regards. The acting and cinematography are breath taking, and the score by David Hirschfelder is just timeless. It captures many emotions, from terror to pure magnificence.",Elizabeth
66,moviesleuth2,Stunning historical drama,8,19 March 2010,"Some movies will be remembered for their legacies. ""Elizabeth"" is such a film; it brought one of the finest modern day actresses to the world's attention. Inexplicably she didn't win an Oscar for her electrifying performance here, and time has shown that mistake to be one of the biggest blunders in the history of the Oscars (once again calling into question the dubious publicity campaigns of Harvey Weinstein...). Nevertheless, while the film is good enough in its own right, the lasting legacy of this film is the debut performance of Cate Blanchett.England, mid-1500s. Henry VIII is dead, his daughter Mary has no heir, and Protestants are being burned at the stake by the Catholics. However, the power of the Catholics comes to an end, however, with the crowning of Mary's Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth. Just because she is queen doesn't guarantee her safety, however.The film is a showcase of stellar acting and spectacular visuals. We are literally transported back to regal Europe and the journey is arresting. It wouldn't be possible without some stellar performances.Cate Blanchett is dynamite as the eponymous character. She is so good that even 12 years later, it is unthinkable that she lost the Oscar for her performance (to ""Shakespeare in Love?"" PLEASE!). She's a lightning rod, and sets herself up as a talent to match Meryl Streep, a challenge which she has continuously met again and again. It may have been her breakout performance, but she is so comfortable on the center stage that you'd never in a million years believe that it was her first shot at the big time.Blanchett is helped by a number of other stellar performances. Geoffrey Rush is delicious as the shadowy Walsingham. He's like a spider, spinning his web from the dark corners of the room, pulling his strings so that events are silently manipulated under his control. Christopher Eccelston is excellent as the unspeakably evil Duke of Norfolk. Cinema hasn't seen a villain this vicious in a long while. Joseph Fiennes surprised everyone into thinking he could act as Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's lover (history has proved this to be a fluke, rather than the rule). Richard Attenborough is solid as Elizabeth's desperate adviser, Sir William Cecil. Terence Rigby is frightening as Bishop Gardiner, the Catholic bishop who is calling for Elizabeth's assassination. Brief appearances by Fanny Ardant, Vincent Cassel (in an purposefully over-the-top performance), John Gielgud, Emily Mortimer, an unrecognizable James Frain, and Daniel Craig (who has one of the most frightening scenes in the history of film) are all solid.Director Shekhar Kapur has an eye for period detail and directing actors. His storytelling abilities, however, leave something to be desired. The machinations of the twisty plot can be confusing, although the film is never boring, and it always retains a generous level of coherence.Be warned about venturing into this movie, however. This is a very violent film, and the way it is made makes the bloodshed (of which there is plenty) shocking, brutal, and highly disturbing. I have never seen violence in a film that is more unsettling than in ""Elizabeth.""""Elizabeth"" is a good film, but it will always be remembered for introducing audiences to one of cinema's brightest stars.My Rating: Rated R for Strong, Explicit Graphic Violence, Disturbing Images, and Some Brief Sexuality.",Elizabeth

Galvanized by a star-making performance from Cate Blanchett as the young Queen, and interesting direction from Kapur, who seems to be channeling ""The Godfather"" trilogy more so than any Masterpiece Theater or Merchant-Ivory production. Elizabeth's transformation from naive princess to threatened and inexperienced monarch to absolute power is exquisitely handled by Blanchett. The only story arch that falls flat is the love story between Blanchett's ""Elizabeth"" and Joseph Fiennes' weaselly nobleman. The ending sequence of Blanchett commanding the throne and taking her vow of virginity and marriage to England itself in full Elizabethean regalia is one of the most classic scenes of recent times. A terrific production all around (it won an Oscar for costume design).",Elizabeth
70,dr_foreman,"so close to great, but falls far short",5,17 January 2005,"Queen Elizabeth was perhaps the most powerful woman in history, so I find it hard to accept this film's portrayal of her as hesitant, dithering, and totally indebted to her advisers for her success. Even as a fledging queen, I think she was probably tougher than she is shown to be here. The way this film tells it, she wouldn't have lasted a week without the help of Geoffrey Rush - he orchestrates her every victory.So it's not really a tale of female empowerment, is it? Granted, the movie isn't necessarily obliged to be feminist in its outlook. But I still find it disappointing on several levels. Elizabeth only becomes the formidable figure of history in the very last - and admittedly great - scene. So we never get to witness her oversee the defeat of the Spanish Armada, or commission Shakespeare to write the Merry Wives of Windsor, or anything like that. We merely get to see her order Rush to ""whack"" various spies, foreigners, and rivals. It's like an Elizabethan mobster movie - and it's clearly trying too hard to be sexy and violent to work.I wanted more boring stuff - more religion, more politics, and definitely more character development. The whole point of the movie is that Elizabeth rejects her suitors and becomes a self-governing ""virgin queen,"" but her suitors are such cardboard characters that her choice seems preordained. Joseph Fiennes is okay as Sir Robert, but his supposedly wonderful relationship with Elizabeth is already established at the beginning of the film - we don't see it grow, we don't really know its foundations, and I, for one, didn't care about it. And Elizabeth's French suitor, Anjou, is such an idiot that of course she can't help but turn him down. I hate conflicts like that - since Anjou is a flighty pervert, it's a forgone conclusion that Elizabeth will reject him, so all that remains is for the viewer to watch her patience with his antics slowly diminish. Yawn.I also could've used more characterization of Christopher Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk, who basically just spends the movie stalking up and down corridors and looking surly. And was it necessary to make Queen Mary look like some weird creature of the darkness? I felt manipulated into seeing every character and situation in a particular way - Attenborough's character is obviously meant to be misguided, Queen Mary is crazy, everything Geoffrey Rush says is right, etc. All of the active, interpretative sectors of my brain simply shut down and went along for the ride.And that's a shame, really, because this is a well-produced and superbly acted movie. But it's so fundamentally thoughtless that I ultimately can't recommend it. I wonder if they'll ever make a sequel in which Elizabeth actually accomplishes something on her own...",Elizabeth
71,oOoBarracuda,Elizabeth,8,28 April 2016,"A reunion, of sorts, for Shakespeare in Love actors Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes, Shekhar Kapur's 1998 epic combines their talents along with Cate Blanchett's in the film Elizabeth. Telling the story of the turbulent events leading to Queen Elizabeth's rise to power and outlining the origin of the Catholic against Protestant war in Europe, Kapur's film brings to life the beginning of the Golden Age of England. Highlighting the magnitude of internal struggle one person undertakes to lead a nation, Elizabeth is a captivating story of struggle and triumph. Being born out of wedlock to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) never expected to rise to power, but the reality of her childless sister Mary I (Fanny Ardant) dying with no heir made Elizabeth's rise the only possibility. Crippled with fear that Protestant Elizabeth would un-do Catholic reign and bring Protestantism to England. While trying to learn about and establish her monarchy, Elizabeth is aided, sometimes, by a team of advisers. Where many of the advisers have good intentions, some are there plotting to restore the Catholic line, refusing to pledge allegiance to the new queen. Another difficulty for Elizabeth is the immense pressure on her to marry and produce an heir. Her longtime lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) is not viewed as an acceptable choice, and once Elizabeth learns that he has been carrying on an affair with her against his wife, she never speaks to him again. Elizabeth traverses the difficulties of her new reign with grace while she decides which of her advisers to keep and which to ignore all the while building an empire. Cate Blanchett is exceptional as ever playing the meek turned mighty Queen Elizabeth. She handles the difficulties of playing a woman thrust into power no one wants her to have, yet still trying to do the best for England phenomenally. She also switches from love to scorn for Robert Dudley in a believable way. The production design on this film was fantastic, so intricate and detailed one feels as though they are truly watching the royals interact. The costuming was also beautiful in this film. I greatly admire period pieces that don't take the easy/cheap way out with simple costuming. For instance, the bird's eye view shot of Queen Elizabeth's first appearance from the throne was brilliantly overtaken by her gorgeous red velvet dress. A wonderful directorial choice made by Shekhar Kapur was to show Elizabeth's transfer to power with bright white flashes of light, illustrating the drastic transformation she, and the rest of England were about to endure. Another directorial choice that added to the depth of the film was the flashback of Elizabeth's trials and troubles near the ending scene. While the film loses some of its luster and struggles with pacing in the middle of the movie, it rebounds with a strong enough beginning that one doesn't mind waiting to get re-engaged into the story. Class and sexuality are huge focal points in this film. Sexuality is under the microscope when many men doubt Elizabeth's abilities to govern as a woman. Sexuality is also an overarching issue when it comes to marrying off Elizabeth and producing an heir, as that is the primary focus of women in the 16th century. Class and nobility are central issues as well, with Elizabeth's longtime lover not being seen as regal enough to marry a queen. There is also a certain expectation of forthcoming change Elizabeth is expected to make once she takes the throne; she must be viewed as a royal and forgo peon activities. Elizabeth is a wonderful period piece and a display of directorial force from Shekhar Kapur, whose work I have not familiarized myself with.",Elizabeth
72,SKG-2,Great actress highlight of great movie,10,2 February 1999,"I knew Cate Blanchett had talent after OSCAR AND LUCINDA, but even I was blown away by her performance here.  Only Billy Bob Thornton in A SIMPLE PLAN, Gwyneth Paltrow in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come close.  She captures the heart, drive, intelligence, vulnerability, and ruthlessness of the ""Virgin Queen.""  I think my favorite scene is early on when she is summoned by her sister, leaves, and is afraid she's going to be executed by the soldiers around her, but instead bluffs her way past, overhears Norfolk chewing the soldiers out for letting her bluff her way through, and then laughs.  She deserved the Golden Globe, and I hope she wins the Oscar.The rest of the film is excellent as well.  I think some people were looking for a stuffy costume drama, but I liked how modern the technique was; all those dark rooms and moving camera shots added to the intrigue.  Geoffrey Rush may get a nomination for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but he's much better here, trully Machieavellian as her closest and most ruthless ally.

I cannot vouch for the veracity of the story line in all its details but of the history that I do know I believe that it is accurate, varying only in slight creative manipulations.  In my opinion, beyond the wonderful work of Blanchett and Rush, the extraordinary visual pallet of the Director, Shekhar Kapur, puts Elizabeth into another realm of movie enjoyment.  People should see the film just to see the directorial brilliance of the way in which Kapur literally ""paints"" the screen, allowing the main characters to move within a visual richness that is truly a feast for the eye of the soul.",Elizabeth
74,AKS-6,Quite good,8,3 January 2000,"Now I have finally seen ""Elizabeth"" and in many ways it was better than I had expected. It has gotten pretty good reviews everywhere, but I had nevertheless expected a rather boring film. It was not boring at all, even if Elizabeth is so well-known that I knew what was going to happen (and *not* happen) most of the time. So, okay, that means it wasn't that suspenseful for me, but I still enjoyed it. Cate Blanchett was great as Elizabeth. While Joseph Fiennes has enough charisma for a hundred men, I still think that he could have done a better job. This is the second time that he has disappointed me since I don't think he was all that great as Shakespeare in ""Shakespeare in Love"". He wasn't *bad* in ""Elizabeth"", though, I have to say, just not good enough.If you liked this,  I recommend the French film ""La Reine Margot""/""Queen Margot"" which is a very similar film only better. It's also based upon historical facts and portrays a very violent time in French history.",Elizabeth
75,bat-5,Most impressive.,7,11 August 1999,"There are scenes in Elizabeth that strike you with the most beautiful imagery that has only been seen before in tapestries.  The coronation scene is absolutely stunning, with those high reaching walls and those massive arches.  Visually, Elizabeth is a triumph of art direction and costuming. The story is quite good too.  Treachery, deceit, and plenty of scheming make for dangerous times in England.  As the young queen, Cate Blanchett runs a full course of emotions.  She is young and naieve, but once she ascends to the throne of England, she is thrust upon the world stage as a ruler of a soon to be great nation.  She must first deal with the machinations of her own court.  She then learns how to deal with her new found title, and she begins to take care of all of her enemies.  The climax of the film reminded me of The Godfather, as one by one, Elizabeth's enemies are dealt with. Geoffrey Rush is scheming and devious as Elizabeth's main protector.  He's cunning, ruthless, and he knows how to play sides.  In the end, even he is floored by the transformation that Elizabeth takes upon herself.  She truly becomes The Virgin Queen.",Elizabeth
76,rowmorg,Official propaganda movie,5,21 July 2009,"""Elizabeth"" reserves its longest, most tedious and elaborately produced scene for the Coronation, which betrays the picture as thinly-veiled official propaganda. The history it deploys belongs in the fascistic Arthur Bryant schoolboy textbooks of the early 20th century. What was really happening during her reign was less the internecine plotting over the succession than the birth of brutal capitalism, corporate plunder and enslavement, all with royal court's approval. Elizabeth was the bastard daughter of Henry VIII, who saw her innocent mother beheaded before her eyes on the orders of her deranged father. The ""virgin queen"" promotion that has endured for four and a half centuries, probably stems from Elizabeth Tudor-Boleyn inheriting syphilis from her mad father and infected mother, and refusing male relations because of the fear of infecting her own child. You may be sure such a story would never come out, particularly after such a long reign enabled its complete suppression. On the other hand, the Queen's letters record the incredibly detailed care she took over her own and other aristocrats' courts and retainers. Well educated, she seems to have been a person of outstanding qualities trapped in a historic maelstrom. This puerile film only scratches the surface of what was going on in our UK past and is little more than a chocolate box version of history.",Elizabeth
77,LCShackley,A thing of beauty,8,12 February 2008,"Besides the wonderful acting by all the leading players, what struck me about this film on a recent re-viewing was the director's love for space and architecture. There are many majestic shots filmed from high in cathedrals and castles that show the beauty of Gothic and Norman craftsmanship. Colorful costumes and set dressing make ELIZABETH a feast for the eye from start to finish.Also to note are the bookending shots of long red hair being cut off: first of the female martyr, and finally of Elizabeth herself. A nice touch.Besides, I'll always support a queen who can defeat Dr. Who (Eccleston) and James Bond (Craig) in the same film.",Elizabeth
78,tankace,Becoming one of the most historic women in the global history,8,4 April 2017,"Elisabeth is the biography of Elisabeth the first of England who is credited often of starting the process of making Britain one of the strongest biggest and most advanced empires of the whole time, so the film had a lot to do. The final result is a well made depiction of the early days of our protagonist from a seclusive girl to the monarch of a renaissance kingdom.The idea to so the process of this transformation was a quit smart one as the majority of history buffs know what took place during her reign from the built up of the navy, to the final establishment of the English Church and the explosion of art in the Fair Isles but few have a good knowledge of the person behind all that. And the film does portrait the political game of the fifteenth century very well, with some dramatization and simplification here and there in order for the common viewer to keep track of the event ,but with out losing the essence of the story.As for the queen herself, Cate Blanchett gave a great performance of the character and she showed very well how difficult and at times heartbreaking was for her to adapt to a court divided in which who you like and who you trust doesn't always mean the same person. Also thankfully she didn't become a cry-baby during all the events of the film, rather her pain was shown much more esoteric and damaging her psychology than her in a psychical term.To the setting ,costume and personalities we have excellent to the first two and a little mixed of dramatization ,but not to a point that was more fiction than fact like some else, (Brave-heart, The Patriot, Apocalypto ).In the end a good historical film ,if you are a history buff go watch you will like it ,for the rest ,just give it a try.",Elizabeth
79,dr_clarke_2,"Sumptuous to watch, if somewhat flawed",7,23 February 2021,"Shekhar Kapur's 1998 multi-award winning film Elizabeth is notable for catapulting Cate Blanchett to stardom for her performance in the eponymous role. Expensive, lavish and beautifully acted, it remains visually impressive, but it isn't without its detractors.
Elizabeth charts the rise to power of Elizabeth I, from shortly before the death of her half-sister Queen Mary to just after the defeat of the Ridolfi plot. The Ridolfi plot is not actually mentioned as such on screen and Ridolfi doesn't appear, since the film mangles together the details of the plot with the Babington plot, which also isn't named thus. This is a symptom of the fact that Michael Hirst's screenplay is notoriously liberal with the historical record, in the sense that the film is woefully inaccurate and drew considerable ire from academics both at the time and subsequently. Various historical details - including the actions, fates and ages of various characters - are simply wrong, many of the events happen at the wrong time, and certain aspects of the plot are pure fabrication.
But then, that is rather beside the point. Elizabeth doesn't set out to be a documentary; this is history as entertainment, a work of fiction loosely inspired by real life events in much that the same way that Mel Gibson's Braveheart is. And on that basis, it works brilliantly. This is history Game of Thrones style, with scheming, devious courtiers who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. The plot is littered with assassination attempts, including a poisoned dress intended for Elizabeth, and punctuated by death, from the opening scene of three heretics being burned alive to the beheading of the Duke of Norfolk at the end. There is a sex aplenty too, as Elizabeth frolics with the Earl of Leicester and vulgar transvestite Duke Francis of Anjou takes centre stage in an orgy whilst wearing a dress.
It's all rather compelling and hugely entertaining, even if the characterisation isn't always entirely believable (virtually everyone has an agenda, whilst both the aforementioned Duke Francis and Mary of Guise are largely ciphers). The exception is Elizabeth herself: in keeping with Hirst's apparent disregard for history, he is more concerned with portraying her as a young woman rather than an historical monarch, and for the most part he succeeds admirably. The casting certainly helps: Blanchett immerses herself convincingly in the role, making Elizabeth a believable, sympathetic figure, and she gets support from a cast largely consisting of British thespians such as Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, and Daniel Craig, plus John Gielgud (in his final feature film role) as Pope Pius V. She is also joined by fellow Australian Geoffrey Rush, who gives the best performance in the film, exercising great restraint as the quiet but lethal Walsingham. Eccleston, incidentally, gets very little to actually do, but he prowls and glowers his way through the film surprisingly memorably as the Duke of Norfolk. Vincent Cassel meanwhile has great fun as Duke Francis of Anjou, positively oozing charisma. On the other hand, Eric Cantona's wooden acting stands out like a sore thumb in the midst of such august company, and however legendary Gielgud was, allowing him to play the Pope with an English accent was a mistake.
The real star of Elizabeth however, is Shekhar Kapur. Already a successfully film director, his first English-language brought him to the attention of western audiences in considerable style. The word lavish is entirely apt: if the story isn't historically accurate, the sets and costumes certainly give the impression of being so, providing one believes that everyone wore sumptuous outfits most of the time in the sixteenth century and managed to keep them spotless. Kapur's mise-en-scéne is sufficiently convincing that anyone unfamiliar with the real history of the reign is likely to find the film entirely believable, and the gorgeous location filming (at various places in England including Alnwick Castle and Durham cathedral) helps. Remi Adefarasin's almost painterly cinematography (the coronation scene was inspired by Elizabeth's coronation portrait) complements Kapur's vision; the result is a visually outstanding film.
Anyone with a keen interest of the history of Elizabeth I's reign will undoubtedly struggle to enjoy Elizabeth, unless they can divorce the fact and the fiction whilst watching the film. Everyone else however should be able to enjoy it as the entertaining romp that all concerned surely wanted it to be.",Elizabeth
80,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Marvelously acted and staged.,7,11 February 2012,"Yesterday I wrote a review of Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, where I talked about how biopics are instantly met with the mountain of having to condense the life of a historical figure into a two hour film. I posited that they should instead focus on an important part of their life and work it as a character study around that, rather than trying to produce a history lesson of their birth to death. It's a strange coincidence that today I was finally struck with the proper motivation to sit down and watch Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, because this is the rare biopic that does exactly that.The film focuses on Queen Elizabeth I of England, but instead of trying to detail her entire life, Michael Hirst's script centers on when Elizabeth first takes the throne and the tribulations that she encountered upon coming into power; tribulations seems far too meager a word though, for what she had to face. Elizabeth was faced with threats from all angles, political, romantic and life-threatening and the film does an excellent job of making you feel as though the walls are closing in on Elizabeth from every side. Slowly everything becomes more intimate and intense, culminating in a rush of drama during the climax where every facet of her life hangs in the balance.Kapur took a gamble by placing the film on the shoulders of the mostly untested Cate Blanchett, who hadn't even done a handful of film roles at the time, and it's one that pays off miraculously. Blanchett gives us one of our first tastes of the mastery of her skill that we would later come to expect practically once a year, and it might just be her finest performance to date. She fully disappears into this role, allowing us to sink in with her to the paranoia and high drama of this woman's world. This is one of those rare gems of a performance that goes through such an extensive evolution, but does it all in a way so natural and effortless that you don't even notice it unless you're paying attention. When you get to the final scene and you look back at the woman who we began the film with, it is absolutely astonishing the transformation that has occurred, and this is all thanks to Blanchett's seamless portrayal. She takes us on this journey from frightened and unsure young lady into a fierce and strong-willed queen.The supporting cast all delivers as well, with a great ensemble including Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough and Christopher Eccleston, but the standout for me was Geoffrey Rush. As Elizabeth's closest protector, he gives a subtle yet incredibly commanding performance that meshes moments of intimidation, seduction and the strangest sense of grace at times. It's a marvelous cast in a film that is quite the treat itself. I'll be curious to see what they do with Golden Age, since this one closes with the standard, ""...and these are the things that happened until she died...,"" texts.",Elizabeth
81,ozthegreatat42330,A magnificent retelling of the early reign of a Magnificent Monarch,10,14 October 2007,"This film is simply superb, and Cate Blanchette is truly both vulnerable and formidable as the virgin queen. With an outstanding supporting cast including Geoffrey Rush, John Gielgud and Edward Hardwicke among others this film shines as both pageant and as pure drama. In a period of uncertainty, after the death of her brother Edward VI and the coming to the throne of her much older and vindictive Catholic sister Mary, the young princess's life hangs in a precarious balance. After Mary;s death Elizabeth becomes the target of numerous plots by the Catholic forces in England and from abroad including the Pope(Guielgud).

I have seen Shakespeare In Love, and Gwyneth had nothing on Cate, once again an Oscar overlooked. Fortunately, Cate has received many awards for this performance.

The film, clearly the best picture of 1998, is a unique epic of its kind.  It's not overlong, nor is it presumptuous.  The film has a wonderfully dark atmosphere that is rarely seen in this kind of picture. Although the film is dark, you never get the idea that it is trying too hard -- like a Tim Burton film would.Cate Blanchett is unforgettable as Elizabeth, but the real treat of the film is the marvelous Geoffrey Rush -- as her evil man servant who will do anything to protect her.A truly great film -- one of my all time favorites.",Elizabeth

Never has such a fascinating time in history with rich diverse personalities been reduced to frivolous garbage. Made up garbage which makes it even worse since the facts are so compelling. Some powerful imagery especially the start of the film but deteriorated rapidly. Not worth a bucket of warm spit. When Anjou arrived and gave that horrendous and disrespectful greeting to the Queen all credibility was lost beyond retrieval. Only halfway decent performance by G Rush.

87,FountainPen,Oh Dear ! Hollywood's idea of British history again !,6,17 February 2018,"Yes, here we go again ! Hollywood hard at work putting its skew on British history. You can hear the American accents in this effort. Overall, the film is quite good, but it is NOT true to history, which MUST be taken into account. Children in particular (and viewers looking for a history lesson), need to be aware that this is a kind of partial-imaginary, made up, fictional version of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the First. It is a great shame that movie-makers, in particular those in Hollywood, will not stay with the known FACTS. 
I prefer Cate Blanchett as QE, rather than the vastly over-used and over-rated Helen Mirren (who apparently was given a Damehood for portraying both Elizabeths: silly). 
In my book, this flick rates 6/10, and while it is NOT ""film perfection"", I can recommend it ~ but ralways bear in mind that it is NOT true history and the script should have been so much better.",Elizabeth
88,pawebster,Elizabeth the Great -- pity about the story,7,31 October 2005,"Contains minor spoiler(s) Cate Blanchett is wonderful in this film. The title is simply Elizabeth, she IS Elizabeth and she carries the whole thing with great assurance and skill. It is very believable that Elizabeth was like this.The Elizabethan era is a fascinating one, with wonderful stories and also great visual appeal. What I can't understand is why the film makers cast all that aside -- seemingly in the belief that they could do better.Visually, the film seems to be set in the deepest Middle Ages and not in Tudor Times. Tudor aristocrats did not live among bare stone walls, or in Queen Mary's case, what looks rather like the Batcave. I suppose Tudor colourfulness had been 'done' too often before, and the urge to be original and different took over.It's a shame that the story is mainly nonsense and events and personalities from Elizabeth's long reign are just jumbled together and scandalously travestied in some cases. There would be plenty to go on in the real events, e.g. the mysterious death of Dudley's wife (whom Elizabeth knew about all along, having been a guest at the wedding).It's true there was plenty of fornication in Tudor times, but this particular fornication is more than doubtful. It seems quite likely that Elizabeth really was the Virgin Queen. However, this would never do for a modern version, where sex scenes are a must. The Zeitgeist of the 1990s was clearly far more powerful in the film makers' imaginations than the 16th century. Pity.",Elizabeth

He looked terribly out of place for some reason.One VERY annoying feature of the film was the constant shifting from VERY dark to VERY bright fades.  Also the fading not to a soft haze but just BLURRY.  The person sitting next to me took off his glasses to see if they were dirty or if it was his eyes.It was extremely distracting and added nothing.Also everyone looked just too darn clean.

90,JurijFedorov,It's definitely overrated,7,30 September 2021,"The historical accuracy in this movie is minimal. You have real characters, but why they do something and why it happens is completely changed. Mary of Guise in this movie gets, supposedly, murdered. That's not what really happened. Elizabeth decides to play virgin just sorta randomly. It's never explained and we only see her talk about it in the scene prior. Instead smallpox would explain why she wanted to color over her face and cut off hair she was losing. But no, here it's just some weird random choice. Robert Dudley plans a plot against her, but of course is magically spared by her as this didn't happen so he couldn't die in the movie. Duke of Anjou visits England and then Scotland of course this didn't happen in real life either.It's A LOT of historical liberty taken. A lot of the events are true to real life, but everything is changed for some weird reason. Why? Ask the writers and producers.Then there is the acting which is frankly so over the top at times that you cringe in many of the scenes. It's weird to see certain actors overdo everything on screen as if it was a theater play. In some scenes it makes no sense whatsoever. Why would someone make unnatural weird faces and body movements when he is captured?Then of course the scenes are disconnected. We see single events, but the movie just jumps from place to place and much is never explained. This feels like a TV show made into a shorter movie.But of course I love historical movies so hell... I can look past much of this. It's still history and I still love history. So yeah, it should have been better, but I understand why they wanted to create murder plots where there were none. It does make some sense. It's just all jarring. It's hard to understand the plot here. If they wanted to present history with no plot they could have done that too. But they picked a weird way to tell this story.",Elizabeth
91,arthera09,Great period piece anchored by a career defining performance by Cate Blanchett,9,30 May 2011,"I remember watching Elizabeth in high school and remember how this was the first period piece that completely drew me in. I remember the costumes being the main thing that drew me in, but revisiting it as a slightly more mature adult I realize that a great period piece like this is much more than costumes. Anchored by a career defining performance by Cate Blanchett the viewer is swept into England at a time of turmoil and uncertainty and are given a unique perspective as one of the most powerful people in history comes to power.I really love how the writers chose to spend most of the movie showing Elizabeth as being human being with frailties and insecurities. I also enjoyed seeing her in love, but this ends up being the only weak point in the movie for me. It is mainly because I am cynical and do not buy into that type of undying love that Lord Robert and Elizabeth share with each other. That might just be me being cynical or that love at the time meant something complete different and I just cannot relate to it. It is probably because I am cynical. Other than this there are almost no faults with the movie.One could spend pages talking about how good Blanchett is in this, but she gives us a remarkable transformation of a doe-eyed love struck girl to one of the most powerful and formidable images of power ever caught on film. Watching her psyching her self up in the mirror and then go out in Parliament and getting what she wanted was a fantastic one-two combination that really captures the transition that Elizabeth had to go through to become the leader of an entire country. Together with an impressive supporting cast we get to see Attenborough play a role that he almost always seems to play, but plays it so well. He plays a man with nothing but good intentions in his heart while being misguided at times. Eccleston does a fantastic job of being a villain while doing almost nothing villainous. We honestly believe that he is doing everything for the good of his country, while never losing his villainous streak. Rush does a good job as her mysterious adviser and at the end I love how his intentions are made clear, but you are still not sure if you should trust him. I also loved seeing Cassel playing a character so far from what I have seen him in before. I loved picking out various actors and actress that I recognized from all over the place in small roles. One of the most impressive parts for me was the sets. I honestly could not tell you if there were actually sets or castles that they shot on. Either way they are impressive and I was truly awestruck at some massiveness of some of the sets. As mentioned before the costumes were especially effective. I loved seeing Elizabeth going from simple dresses to some of the more impressive costumes I have ever seen, while never being out of character. In the end this movie is one of the most impressive period pieces I have ever seen while at the same time being one of the most interesting character studies of a historical figure I have ever seen. With a timeless performance by Blanchett this movie is really a treat for any fan of film.",Elizabeth

94,basilisksamuk,Good drama but with some distractions,7,1 March 2013,"""Elizabeth"" is a frock movie but, thinking about it, I usually only hate frock movies set later than the sixteenth century so it was quite cool for me to see this one. Long gone are the days when we used to associate Queen Elizabeth 1st with the saintly Glenda Jackson or followed that train of thought that lead inexorably to the picture of her writhing naked on the floor of a train in Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"". For now Glenda Jackson is just another sad member of that Stalinist revisionist party, otherwise known as New Labour and it is time for a new face to play Queen E_1.Cate Blanchett is an excellent choice for the role and in many ways she has similar facial characteristics to the young Glenda Jackson in that she can look quite beautiful in one shot but play plain or downright ugly in another. She can act too, so no problems in that department. Geoffrey Rush is excellent in the part of Walsingham as is Christopher Ecclestone as Norfolk. Elsewhere a cameo by Angus Deayton is disastrously naff and although Kathy Burke is good as Queen Mary, it is difficult to disassociate her from the character of Waynetta Slob. I'm sure that Richard Attenborough is a kindly old gent who does charitable works but I've never liked him as an actor and he has too big a part here. Using John Gielguid to play the pope was also completely unnecessary and distracting. So a mixed bag as far as casting is concerned; what about the film itself? The director Shekhar Kapur said something to the effect that he is an outsider to British culture and therefore he was looking at 16th Century England as a strange and exotic foreign land. This vision comes through very clearly in the film and is both a strength and a weakness. You get a good sense of how alien these strutting peacocks and bizarre high-ceilinged drafty buildings are to the modern mind. At times it gets rather irritating too as he seems determined to film part of every scene through gauze or knobbly glass, or else he is perversely dedicated to showing everything from a high vantage point or from the vantage point of someone lying flat on their back in a medieval gutter. Mostly it is beautiful but with sufficient gimmickry to be distracting.The story is an interesting one, with Queen E_1 being depicted as having a young lover and how, through the dirty business of becoming a politician, she loses her humanity and becomes the Virgin Queen. The central section in particular is very enjoyable but the director failed to observe one of my Rules of Modern Cinema i.e. make the film and then cut at least half an hour out of the finished product. The half hour that should go here consists of most parts of the first 20 minutes which leave you thinking they'll never get to her coronation, let alone the rest of the story, and the last 10 minutes when the transformation from warm-blooded woman to cold Virgin Queen was done far too quickly to carry conviction.As for the feminist aspects I just don't remember enough from my school history lessons to say whether they are justified. Queen E_1 is usually seen as a very strong and effective ruler and I therefore think it is believable that she really did kick ass as depicted here, at least within the constraints of what was possible for a female monarch of the time. And probably male monarchs were equally constrained. Whether she really had a lover I don't know but it does make for an interesting film.A good historical drama let down by weird visuals and weird casting decisions.",Elizabeth

Some people can say that Cate Blanchett is better than Gwyneth Paltrow or some other people can say it's the other way around. They're both great. Cate Blanchett should have been happy and proud of herself because she was an academy award nominee for best actress, even though she didn't win it it means she is a wonderful actress.

Although the film was completely a masterpiece of film art, it misses the mark slightly with it's obvious anti-catholic bias and it's habit of ignoring historical fact. Although many films such as this do use a good deal of artistic license, it would be just as interesting - perhaps more so, to portray the events that shaped a future world accurately.If one remembers the makers have played havoc with history, it surpasses mere entertainment.

98,Captain Ed,"Terrific piece of melodramatic fiction, gets Elizabeth wrong on almost all counts (spoilers)",7,22 January 2003,"First off, I must say that 'Elizabeth' is very entertaining.  I own the DVD and have watched it several times.  The dialogue and the characterizations are done very well -- as long as it's understood that this is a complete work of fiction.Cate Blanchett does great work as Elizabeth I in what must be Bizarro World: this Elizabeth doesn't want power, refuses to go against her scruples and attend Catholic Mass on her sister's orders, gets played by the men around her, falls onto the throne almost accidentally, and (sort of) fires Cecil. She is betrayed by Lord Dudley and humiliated by an effeminate Duke of Anjou.  What a load of manure, although it is interesting to see that the British can butcher their history almost as badly as we Americans do ours (and theirs, too, for that matter).In reality, Elizabeth's true story is more compelling, in that she suffered no one to pull strings except her, unless it became mortally dangerous to do so.  Elizabeth had a marvelous political instinct, one borne out of sheer necessity, and one her sister never had.  She carefully acquired estates during both her brother's and sister's reigns, leveraging them to cement loyal support from powerful families.  She played a highly dangerous game with her sister, keeping her mollified just enough with showy attendance at Chapel Royal Mass and parrying Mary's attempt to marry her off later in Mary's reign to a Habsburg.  On the verge of losing her head for treason more than once, she showed a remarkable talent for prevarication and obfuscation, all the while preparing in real terms for her own rule as Queen.From the historical record, we know that Robert Dudley had been a serious suitor for Elizabeth, who at one point -- well after she was Queen -- had made it clear that she intended to marry him.  As shown in the movie, this scandalized the nobility, not because of some treason on Dudley's part, but just because there were already many rumors about their (supposedly) disreputable behavior together.  For political reasons, she scotched the courtship, but Dudley remained a close confidant at court.  Her romance with the Duke of Anjou came much later, when Elizabeth was in her late thirties or early forties, and she was as determined to marry Anjou as she once was to marry Dudley.  However, her Council was violently torn on the question, which infuriated Elizabeth, but as always she bowed to political reality and sent Anjou home with some lovely parting gifts.  And the part about Cecil is just remarkably silly.  Cecil was her life-long partner in ruling England, and while I'm sure their relationship had its ups and downs, there is no doubt that he was not only devoted to her, he was one of Elizabeth's main props for power.Anyway, apart from a few other minor issues, such as Mary Tudor's portrayal (think Snidely Whiplash, no subtlety whatsoever), the movie is pretty entertaining, a good costume drama.

Or is it their intention to promote historical illiteracy?",Elizabeth
99,imdb-19548,Enjoyable but lacking sufficient depth.,6,27 October 2007,"This is a complex topic to try and do in a film and it shows.We are taken through all the main points of Elizabeth's rise to power but there simply isn't enough time to explain the character's actions, particularly those that oppose her, and this leaves certain scenes seeming pointless even though they probably had huge significance, the biggest instance of this is when she wins a vote and we aren't really told why we should care.The performances are good, Blanchett is superb, but few characters are given a chance to perform. Eccleston is particularly wasted as her main opponent, the Duke of Norfolk, he delivers some menace while on screen but has so few lines it is hard to know, or care, what his motivation really is.I suppose the slight writing for the other characters can be forgiven to some extent since the film is about Elizabeth and focuses on her love life and it's impact on politics and vice versa but as Queen her actions were driven by the powerful people around her and by not giving them a voice the film seems pointless and shallow.It is supposed to be an historical film and the lack of detail leaves you confused as to the significance of events and people and that in turns leaves you feeling a little cheated, it's as if there is a great film there somewhere but you aren't being shown it. As a TV series it could have been great as a film it's just watchable.",Elizabeth

101,westpenn49,A woman's descent into power,8,26 June 2000,"What struck me most about the film was the way Cate Blanchett goes from a girl dancing in the fields to Queen and the enormous toll that such a journey takes upon the soul of the person. I suppose that we are to be proud of her accomplishment in a very dangerous and fragile world and yet we wonder, was it worth it?We can easily contrast Mary Of Guise (Fanny Ardant- we need more of her in movies in America she is one of France's most enduring and talented actors) for whom the role of Queen is fitted like a glove, but Elizabeth wasn't supposed to be queen although she was a fast learner.Was this one of the greater films of all time? Perhaps, but it was definitely an acting tour de force for Blanchett who seemed to grow more regal and more distant in every scene. I especially liked the two dance scenes with Lord Robert. In the first she is still the girl being courted, in the second she is the queen on the edge of really beginning to lead her country. She is mature, she has been hurt and threatened and knows that the only person that she can truly trust is herself. In the end when she takes the throne it is a bittersweet victory, the woman is dead, long live the Queen.",Elizabeth
102,dwr246,Historically inaccurate portrait of the early reign of Elizabeth I of England,5,24 February 2005,"I was a big fan of the BBC series, ""Elizabeth R,"" starring Glenda Jackson, so I was intrigued to see how this movie was going to portray Elizabeth's reign. What I found was a dark, violent, and ultimately inaccurate portrayal of one of my favorite periods of history.The movie covers Elizabeth's treatment under her half-sister, Mary's reign, her subsequent ascension to the throne upon Mary's death, and the early years of her reign. Information about these people and events is readily available from a number of sources, so one wonders how Michael Hirst managed to put together such an inaccurate portrait of this period. Mary Tudor was not the doddering old fool she is portrayed as here, even though most of her actions as queen were misguided. Neither was Elizabeth as uneducated in the ways of court as she is presented to be. And while Dudley was certainly a favorite of Elizabeth's she never slept with him (there is a reason she was called ""the Virgin Queen"" after all). Also, she knew him well when they were in the tower together during Mary's reign. She knew he was married. It was what saved his life. Her ""discovery"" of this fact wouldn't have been a shocking betrayal because there was nothing to discover. Likewise, he would never have plotted against her. He knew where his bread was buttered. Walsingham was a trusted adviser, but not the only one Elizabeth could turn to, nor was he the murderer he is made out to be in this film. And Cecil left her service for his own reasons, not because she tired of him and banished him.Visually, the film is quite dark. Many scenes take place at night, or in secluded places shut away from the light. Even those in the daylight have a furtiveness about them that gives the whole film an element of paranoia which is quite distracting. While the violence is true to the times, it is excessive, and we could live without seeing the beheading.The cast does a good job with the material they are given. Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth is a bit naive, but still charming. Joseph Fiennes' Dudley is charismatic. Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham is a cipher, as though Rush were unsure whether to portray Walsingham as trustworthy or menacing, and ended up doing neither very well. Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk bristles with evil and menace. Lewis Jones' murderous priest is so over the top that you can't wait for him to get his. Also over the top, although far more entertaining, is Vincent Cassel's Duc d'Anjou. Fanny Ardant strikes the right balance with her portrayal of Mary of Guise. Richard Attenborough's Cecil is quite noble.Clearly Hirst sacrificed accuracy for entertainment's sake. He did have some success in this, as it is an entertaining film. But if you really want to learn about this period, get the first two episodes of the BBC series ""Elizabeth R,"" and watch those. They present a far more accurate picture of the beginning of the Elizabethan period.",Elizabeth

104,MickeyTo,"A beautifully filmed tale of treachery, deceit and religion.",10,6 November 1999,"This adaptation of the life and times of Elizabeth I is a tale of a woman who one day decides she can't take anymore of the nonsense all the men in her life have been dishing out.  And so, she does something about it!Director Shekhar Kapur's film focuses on one of history's most important leaders.  Queen Elizabeth made her mark for several reasons, not the least of which was for firmly establishing the Church of England.  In this film, Elizabeth is portrayed as a complicated woman, bitter, passionate, and politically charged.The story unfolds with Queen Mary Tudor on the throne.  She thinks she is pregnant, yet in fact she is dying (she has a tumor in her stomach).  She despises her half sister, Elizabeth, and as Queen, Mary has restored the Catholic church in England.  Upon her death, Elizabeth is charged with taking on the throne.  She is the natural successor, but still a controversial choice, in light of the fact that she, herself has converted to the protestant religion.  Elizabeth's new empire is crawling with bishops and priests, lords and dukes, all desperate to keep their power, which is tied firmly to the Catholic faith. 
Cate Blanchett is fabulous as Elizabeth I.  The character is portrayed in a passionate light.  Blanchett is a natural beauty, with strong looks that compliment this bold character.  Through Blanchett we are allowed to see a vulnerable side to this remarkable woman, without feeling that she is also weak.  I am not an expert on this subject, however I wonder if this film did take some liberties with the character.  Throughout the film she seems to be the only proponent of peace.  When her court urges her to bear arms against Mary of Guise, Elizabeth would prefer to talk it out.  Elizabeth is sympathetic to the little people, even to those who may have betrayed her.  She is passionate and playful with the man she loves, Robert Dudley, played by Joseph Fiennes.  We are used to seeing a stoic, iron-clad monarch in film portrayals of this character.  This new, 90's kind of gal, is at times a bit hard to believe, if not merely unique(?).
Geoffrey Rush offers a standout performance playing Sir Francis Walsingham. He was nominated in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love, a film which he was also great in, however I do think that this was a better role.  Walsingham is the cool, calculating right hand man to Elizabeth.  He takes on the nasty deeds that her character dare not even think.  In his opening scene he chastises a young man who attempts to slash his throat.  When the man finally sees reason, Walsingham calmly turns the razor on the young man.Elizabeth is a beautiful film to watch.  The sets are magnificent.  Castles, battlegrounds and thrones all come to life.  The costumes are also great. There are scenes where Elizabeth is being dressed by her ladies-in-waiting and I, for one, could not wait to see what they were going to outfit her with next.  Hands down! this was defineatly the best film of 1998.  I found the storyline to be mesmerizing.  Well drawn out characters, proper pacing and enchanting scenery, made this a film that I could not take my eyes off of. Kapur's film captures well, an interesting time in history, and brings to new life, one of history's favorite Queens.  I recommend this as a companion piece to A Man for All Seasons.  Watch that film to fully understand why Elizabeth's reign began in such turmoil.",Elizabeth
105,Ripe Peach,Frozen Concentrated Acting Talent,10,5 February 2001,"A plethora of breathtakingly well judged performances raise Elizabeth from the ranks of the good to the great.  Even the comedy actress Cathy Burke as the mad Queen Mary is not as out of place as she first appears; this is a part that is supposed to be unexpected, jarring and uncomfortable.What can be said about Cate Blanchett's acting ability?  She is quite simply a revelation.  Contrast the conviction and range of Cate with her contemporary Gwyneth Paltrow, who steadfastly plays one part regardless of the film, scene or script.But one great actress does not make for a great film.  Fortunately, the support in Elizabeth is also top notch.  Every performance is believable and engaging.  Geoffrey Rush is particularly engrossing, but the revelation of the piece has to be Eric Cantona.  Eric is best known in the UK and Europe as a mercurial French soccer player given to bouts of obscure poetic commentary; however In Elizabeth, he gives an impressive and truly dignified performance as the embarrased French Ambassador.  It was a courageous decision to cast him, but Elizabeth is a film that was clearly made with the courage of its convictions.",Elizabeth

So many things are incorrect in this movie. This is such a pity because the real story of Elizabeth's rise to power is much more compelling. Make no mistake, Elizabeth understood realpolitik from childhood, she did not have to learn on the job. Sometimes it is more stupid than inaccurate. There is no way English courtiers would argue with their monarch in front of the French Ambassador. I would be prepared to forgive some of this, if the movie were not so long and confused but after two hours I really was not sure when it would end.

Cate Blanchett's performance is spectacular. It is a truly enjoyable film to watch. Just don't expect to learn any real history from it. Many of the historical characters have been altered in their relative ages and arrival on the scene. Walsingham was not around in her early reign, Cecil was in his thirties at the time of coronation and counseled Elizabeth for most of her reign. If she had gotten pregnant by Dudley in her early reign, when she had very little support, do you think she would have survived? Would she be so foolish to risk it? There was never any 'Godfather' quality to her reign, where on a given day numerous enemies were executed Don Corleone style. That is ridiculous. The Scottish French queen resembles her historical figure in name only. On the other hand, the film captures the brutal power-grabbing nature of European politics of the day, the degenerate state of religion. Her early years were treacherous and she almost lost her head. Her rise to power and real control surprised the hell out of a lot of people. Since that is the focus of the movie I can buy off the revisionist stuff and enjoy the movie!",Elizabeth

112,EThompsonUMD,One of the finest historical dramas in years.,9,29 August 2001,"As far as Academy Award recognition is concerned, 'Elizabeth' was unfortunately released in the same year (1998) as the much slicker, more crowd-pleasing 'Shakespeare in Love,' a fine comic film but as much over-praised as 'Elizabeth' was overlooked. It certainly borders on the absurd, if not the criminal, that Gwyneth Paltrow's simpering, one-note performance as Viola was handed the Best Actress Award over Cate Blanchett's truly magnificent performance in the title role of 'Elizabeth,' a film whose tracing of Elizabeth's transformation from teenage frolicker to commanding 'Virgin Queen' presented an enormous challenge of acting range that Blanchett met with aplomb. Curiously, 'Shakespeare in Love' and 'Elizabeth' not only share the presence of Elizabeth I as an historical character, albeit at opposite ends of her nearly 50 year reign, but also two prominent cast members: Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush. Although Fiennes' role as the Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth's lover prior to her Virgin Queen persona days, is smaller (and far less winning) than his lead role in 'Shakespeare in Love,' he again cuts a convincing figure in 16th century costume. On the other hand, Geoffrey Rush's performance as Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's utterly ruthless yet completely loyal bodyguard and Machiavellian tutor, is endlessly and hypnotically fascinating – a performance that steals movies in movies whose leads are less arresting than Ms. Blanchett. Yet, in an ironic reversal of Hollywood's usual denigration of comedy in favor of 'serious' drama, it was Rush's much smaller comic performance in 'Shakespeare' that secured him the 1998 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ordinarily, I'd applaud such recognition of comic art and talent, but in this instance it represents another miscarriage of justice. Rush's tone and bearing as he delivers line after line of blood-chilling dialog make Walsingham a character I expect never to forget. 'You were Norfolk,' he responds to the protests of the insufferably arrogant Duke of Norfolk, Elizabeth's chief nemesis, as he leads him away to the Tower, 'the dead have no titles.' Of course, Elizabeth gets off many a great line of her own, as in her unforgettable final rejection of Leicester: 'I am not your Elizabeth. I am no man's Elizabeth. I shall have one mistress here. And no master!' A little later she gives license to Walsingham to proceed with the political cleansing of the realm with a laconic transcendence of her 'womanly' emotions: 'let it all be done.' Still another memorable line marks the final stage of her political education and her departure from the wishy-washy diplomacy represented by Lord Burleigh (her former chief minister, finely played by Sir Richard Attenborough in his final film role): 'Observe, Lord Burleigh, I am married  to England.' Elizabeth ultimately forges a political philosophy that combines elements of Walsingham's cynical wariness with an ideal of self-abnegating service to England ('my people'). She envisions a strong, secular England capable of rising above the internecine religious strife initiated by her father's departure from the Roman Catholic Church and depicted in graphic horror in the film's opening sequence. In so doing she succeeds in mapping out England's course toward a stable, advanced society whose history would include a lengthy period of world domination. This film does full justice to the dilemmas of church-state conflict, to the complex character of the queen herself, and to the rich historical milieu that produced her. It is one of the finest historical dramas to have appeared in decades.",Elizabeth
113,Niv-1,The performance by Cate Blanchett was remarkable,10,6 June 2000,"""Elizabeth"" was one of the best movies of 1998. From the first scene to the last this is one of the most memorable movies ever made. Cate Blanchett is astonishing as Queen Elizabeth the first. There are many performances that are considered great, but hers was the best performance given by a woman in a movie released in the 90's. The scene where she talks to the parliament is one of the best of the 1990's. She's smart, she's assertive, she's manipulative and when the scene nearly ends her impassioned plea on behalf of the bill she has sent to them is  extraordinary. Almost every scene with her is worth mentioning.Besides Blanchett's performance there are others that are very good. Fanny Ardant is brilliant as Mary of Guise. The scene where she comes upon the very young injured English soldier is mesmerising. She looks at him with pity and hate at the same time. Her other scene near the end of the movie in which she complains about her nephew evokes the scene in ""The Godfather"" where Marlon Brando complains about Sonny. Kathy Burke is stunning as Mary I. The scene with her and Princess Elizabeth (Blanchett) is astounding. Burke is excellent in her role. Both Ardant and Burke deserved oscar nominations for best supporting actress. Both Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborough are amazing in their roles as well. I think that Rush should have been nominated for his role in this rather than for ""Shakespeare in Love."" The script was one of the best of 1998. ""Elizabeth"" was written by Michael Hirst, a catholic historian! Besides the performances and the script the technical aspects of this movie are phenomenal. The direction by Shekhar Kapur was amazing. He deserved to be nominated for best director, but amazingly wasn't. The costumes were the best of 1998 as was the stunning cinematography. The scene where Elizabeth gets the Queens ring is one of the best looking scenes ever shot. The editing by Jill Bilcock is astounding. Everything about this movie is superlative. It may be one of the best historical dramas ever filmed.",Elizabeth

Again like so many good films I wish it could have gone longer. It is relativly short only about two hours and covers only the initial years of Elizabeth's reign where she is consolidat- ing power against the will of the Pope and his followers. The characters from the lead, Ms. Blanchett, to Mr. Rush (Walsing- ham), her ruthless advisor, to Mr. Eccleston (Norfolk), her court adversary, to Mr. Fiennes (her lover), to Mr.Cassel (her roy al suitor), to Mr. de la Quadro (the Spani sh ambassador, to Ms. Burke (Mary, her sister) were all excellent playing well written interesting characters.  The film sets the Medieval mood well with great cin ematography and costuming but we feel a certain connection to all the characters----good and bad.  Could it be that human nature has not changed much in the last four centuries, although I would like to think that we are less ruthless? The movie has love, passion, hate, fear, loyalty, deceit, and laughter.

115,wilsr,Almost Bollywood.,3,4 February 2011,"Why this movie should have had nominations escapes me.Let me tell you where I am coming from. I have just finished watching the full day-and-a-half series ""The Tudors"" on DVD - which ends as Bloody Mary becomes queen. So it was logical to watch ""Elizabeth"" on DVD as a follow-on.Others have commented on the historical inaccuracies (which were also evident to some extent in The Tudors) so I won't labour the point. It does, however, make me just a little leery when films use history as narrative as opposed to merely a period backdrop and present scenes of historical significance as fact. I can accept liberties taken with unimportant scenes but there's enough drama in the known facts to make a gripping movie without embellishment.Now to the film. There is some fine acting here, especially Rush. Queen Anne is in my opinion miscast. Ms Winslet, although looking the part, just doesn't cut it though: she projects as if she is on a West End stage production. Much more subtlety needed.My biggest criticism lies with the director, Kapur. There are one or two visually stunning sequences - the water party comes to mind. The cinematography is excellent throughout, the sound better than seems to be the norm nowadays (with the exception of using Elgar in one sequence, at funereal speed) and the sets and locations believable. But unfortunately the whole is spoiled by the director's constant infusion of ""Art"" with a capital ""A"".Fades to overexposed white. Soft focus. Incessant slow pans and zooms. Very few of these cinematic tricks are necessary in such a story, and neither are many of the dancing scenes. The overall effect, for me, is of a Bollywood extravaganza transposed into a 16th Century setting. It is almost comical, and reminiscent of those TV take-offs of blockbuster movies, with everything exaggerated to extremes.One particular sequence, with Ms Winslet overacting her way through a staccato series of practices of her forthcoming speech, made me check that the DVD hadn't inadvertently switched to the ""Out-takes"" extra.Shame: a period of English history that perhaps more than any other shaped the path to modern society could, and should, have been better presented.

First, among the numerous films about the Queen it is the first that takes her EARLY years as a topic, constructing the 'strengthening' as a kind of 'death' of her own humanity - pretty didactic, but with a convincing application of Mozart's Requiem. The life that is supposed to be buried, instead, is painted with colourful pictures and with the help of magnificent actors, above all the amazing Cate Blanchett. Some features of the story seem to remain fragmentary, p.e. Walsingham's character (has this man any conviction? what is the relationship to his young servants? is the murder night also a kind of personal revenge? etc.), but this doesn't put in danger the effectivity of the drama. Apparently, we cannot let history just ""in peace"" and confer the characters the ""eternal rest"" they deserve. Well, who cares...",Elizabeth
129,lazyaceuk,A mix of the old and the new,7,19 April 2003,"I've had this sat on the shelf waiting to be watched for months, and finally got around to it this evening.  It was one of those that just kept on getting put back down the list, in favour of a blockbuster.  How stupid I was.Some have compared this with Shakespeare in Love which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year.  Both are good films, but whereas SIL plays generally for laughs, Elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously.  There are historical plot holes - but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film.  In fact it seems that Hollywood encourages this type of approach these days.Blanchett and Rush - Aussies playing Brits !! - are excellent.    Likewise Ecclestone as Norfolk is a good cinema baddie.  Sadly Fiennes is Shakespeare playing Dudley.  He, and Dickie Attenborough, are the films biggest let down.The approach that Kapur has taken with this film is refreshing.  It makes a change to find a costume drama that isn't wrapped up in itself.  The camera work and editing are first rate and the whole effect kept me enthralled throughout.Definitely worth a look in my opinion.",Elizabeth
130,Theoriginaltruebrit,Brilliant,8,4 July 2002,"While obviously not completely historically accurate (and after all what is none of us was there so we have no clue)... this film is a brilliant depiction of the rise of a girl to a queen.  My mother loved this movie, and she is a major history buff (who hates any reference to Richard the Lionheart cause in reality he never visited England and couldn't speak a word of English).  Anyhoo, Cate Blanchett is a revelation in the role of Elizabeth...beautiful, believable, and solidly cast.  I agree with many other reviewers here that she was robbed of the Oscar when it was given to ""Hollywood's little girl"" Paltrow (not that she didn't do a good job but compared to Blanchett puhlease.)  The remainder of the cast were equally perfect, and I am a little unsure as to why the criticism of Joseph (why does everyone keep referring to him as Ralph's brother?)... as Dudley... I thought he was perfect.   I have not lived in England for 11 years and therefore was totally unaware that the French Ambassador was being played by a football player, personally I thought he did a nice understated job of the role.  Of course Rush, Geilgud and Attenborough are utterly brilliant as usual and are a joy to watch. The supporting cast were equally stellar and fleshed out the entire movie and made every second worth watching... (especially Norfolk's ""wife"" ""female"" her expressions and inflections were wonderful).  While I have to admit that a couple of the camera tricks had my head in a mess, the overall look of the film was rich and voluptuous...  I adored every minute and the final scene where Elizabeth announces that she is ""married to England"" is perfect.  My husband (not one for costume dramas unless there is a great deal of killing ie Braveheart...) absolutely loved this film and demanded that we buy it.  One of the reviewers further down made a comment (and I paraphrase)  ""this is why the United States became a greater power than England we know better than to put teenage girl anywhere other than high school ruling a country?"" (or something like that).   For that reviewer I have two comments 1) where the hell do you think that all the people that made the United States great came from?

131,StoryCharts,Monarchy requires total devotion,1,19 July 2013,"The plots were picked well to illustrate the Controlling Idea, that Monarchy requires total devotion, such that Queen Elizabeth would give up marriage and love to be devoted to England and be known by history as the Virgin Queen. But, the plots don't really grind against each other, the turning points are not natural progressions of each other and the story limps along without being driven by Elizabeth. For example, most of the Monarchy plot turning points are not effected by Elizabeth herself, instead they are by luck (Queen Mary dies, she is declared queen) and by others (Walsingham captures the priest and all the traitors). The Controlling Idea does not feel proved, it does not feel that she HAD to become the Virgin Queen to save her Monarchy and England. The sequel is much tighter in driving home its idea. Given this story, I'm surprised a sequel was given a chance to see the light of day.",Elizabeth
132,dear_prudence,Cate is captivating,10,31 July 2001,"There are a number of laudable performances in this movie, but Cate Blanchett's is truly outstanding.  It is worth viewing just to have her captivate your attention through Queen Elizabeth's story.One of the most interesting things I found about this film is how a woman in that time period was able to attain, and ultimately succeed using the kind of power that would never be connected with a woman.  Elizabeth's struggles, betrayals, and conquests are elegantly shown through poignant direction, and tender execution by Ms. Blanchett.This is a satisfying, powerful film that is enjoyable to experience (even more than once!).",Elizabeth

Cate Blanchett even looks like Elizabeth I, but if you know even the most rudimentary history of the time, the glaring inaccuracy makes you want to puke.This is the kind of film that if you try to watch it instead of read the book and then pass a history test, you are going to fail big time.Skip this and rent the Six part BBC miniseries ""Elizabeth R"" starring the wonderful Glenda Jackson.Robin Dudley was an egotistical striver with a lot of political ambition but he would never betray Elizabeth I (well if you leave out taking a governorship without her consent and marrying without her consent, minor squabbles). And don't even get me started about Rush's performance as Walsingham. Oh my God, He was a PURITAN and they portray him as some bright colored clothes wearing bi-sexual bon vivant!! The real Walsingham would barely crack a smile for fear of offending God with his frivolity.Just stay away from this stinker unless you want some pretty people prancing about with no resemblance to the well documented facts of her reign.",Elizabeth
134,vinnieboards,Movie Makers & the Great Elizabethan Tampering Scandal,6,20 May 2011,"What is a really good film could have been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the poetic licence used by the makers of this movie.Why on earth a movie studio wants to tamper with historical facts when the real story is perfectly fine and intriguing in its own right is beyond me. Take the assassination of Mary of Guise – there is no evidence that she was assassinated by Francis Walsingham. In fact by most accounts she died of natural causes. Walsingham was not an assassin or a murderer. He was the Queen's Protector or 'Spymaster' as he was known. In essence, the Elizabethan version of MI5. There is no account either of a 'poisoned dress' –security at court was very tight in such times and guards were constantly on the lookout for potential threats.The fact is that the story of Elizabeth I is so compelling without this embroidery – none of this salad dressing is really necessary. One of the best abuses of artistic licence is in the film U-571 – the Americans never captured an Enigma coding machine and yet the British captured two. What's the point in making the film then?The fact is that movie studios produce films for entertainment and think that historical works need to be embellished to make them more watchable. Yet this is nonsense – in Elizabeth's case the history is fascinating and with great actors such as Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Ecclestone and Sir Richard Attenborough, a true and accurate film about Elizabeth's reign would have been quite enough.Having said this, if you can ignore the multitude of historical inaccuracies and take the film on its own merits, the movie is well produced with great acting performances. Cate Blanchett is fabulous as Elizabeth and Joseph Fiennes is equally good as Dudley. Geoffrey Rush's portrayal as Francis Walsingham, however, is the stand out performance for me.The film is actually a doomed love story surrounding the friendship between Dudley and the Queen. This is quite true - in fact, the King of Spain was even quoted as saying that 'Elizabeth would never marry or will marry Robert Dudley because she loves him'. An interesting fact – Dudley played host to the Queen at Kenilworth Castle where, as part of the pomp, fireworks were used for the very first time in England.So to sum up, Elizabeth is a great film but chunks of it are not true. The sad part is that people watch films like this and believe everything they see. If historical inaccuracies bug you then this one may not be for you.Wake up movie makers - the truth is so much better than fiction.",Elizabeth
135,aussiebrisguy,Wonderful yet disappointing,5,26 July 2006,"Cate Blanchett is very good in the role of Elizabeth I. I think it is a crying shame that the script was so bad. It is so wrong about the demise of Mary of Guise. I wish that with such a lot of time and expense going into this film that the history had been accurate. Sir John Gielgud is very good as the Pope. What a brilliant actor he was. Richard Attenborough is also well cast as Sir William Cecil. One of my least favourite actors, Geoffrey Rush is not bad as Walsingham. Joseph Fiennes is also good as the Earl of Leicester. A real surprise is Eric Cantona as Monsieur de Foix. This film could have been a great one but really only had some moments.",Elizabeth

I was a bit distracted by the constantly-moving cameras at first, though the many aerial shots are quite stylish.  Within a few minutes, however, I was so pulled in by the story and the whole set-up that I completely lost track of time, and no longer noticed the swirling cameras.  I reckon this is the best film I've seen this year.  Two thumbs up.Oh yes, and having recently seen Ever After, I was struck by the contrast between fairy tale and reality.  In a fairy tale the girl gets the guy and the throne and she's happy about it.  In reality she trades her youthful freedom and innocence to hold the throne, and loses the guy to fulfill her responsibilities as a just ruler.

But please don't say the film was 'inaccurate' or 'not historically correct.' Were you there? History is rewritten the moment it first appears on the page, or is told orally. It's not relevant to film as a medium, or to storytelling in general.
I thought Cate Blanchett was inspirational and played the role like she was born to it. Her strength and ruthlessness was learned, not present at birth. She had to grow and find her way in the dangerous times she lived in. This is a version of how she may have done it. Her character is very complex and gives an insight of what it meant to be a woman in a powerful position during those times.Costuming and cinematography are fabulous, although I wish at times they had bowed to modern lighting techniques so we could see more in those dim corridors. Joseph Fiennes is gorgeous and just sulky enough to make you think he got what he deserved. I loved Richard Attenborough as Cecil and even Eric Cantona got it right in the right places. Good casting, solid acting and wonderful photography and a touching and thought-provoking script. What more can you ask?One of the best.",Elizabeth

She is supposed to portray a sweet girl who grows into a merciless queen, but she just walks around looking like she's having a toothache.

From the very beginning, when the opening titles run over a psychedelic montage of religious iconography, you know that something different is happening here.and it isn't Masterpiece Theater.  Dark and brutal, lurid and violent, this film unfolds like bloody flower.  Religious intrigue, political machinations, sexual scheming--it's like an Umberto Eco novel.  Cate Blanchett is an astonishing actress, a truly startling screen presence.  She inhabits the body, mind and soul of the Virgin Queen with an ethereal grace underlain by steely resolve.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth's inevitable transformation from a clear-eyed, idealistic girl with love in her heart to a coldly practical monarch who will be married always and only to England is heart-breaking--all the more so as the practicality is born only out of absolute necessity.  Joseph Fiennes is dark and brooding, smolderingly sexual as the poor, sincere, doomed Lord Robert, who does all the wrong things for the right reason: his love for a girl who has become a woman.  But that love is returned to him by a woman who has become a queen, and, as Robert himself says, ""That love could corrupt the soul of any man.""  In the end, Robert's corrupted soul undoes them all.",Elizabeth

Both Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are nothing short of chameleons. Dazzled though I was by the performances by all concerned, there was a nagging feeling that the film as a whole could have been better. It was overall an interesting study of a queen and the political turmoil which surrounded the early part of her reign. But not a great film.Oh, it's not that I'm offended by the ahistorical enterprise. No one seriously believes that film makers are really that concerned with what actually happened. Oh no, it's not that at all. The problem seems to be that the makers are so caught up the ""sexiness"" of what might have been that what was probable about the woman herself became subverted.

143,rassezeus,"Very good idea, mediocre execution",8,15 June 2020,"""The Virgin Queen"" has been subjected to many different art forms over the centuries. Great acts, songs and paintings have been made in honor of the greatest woman monarch ever lived. As a massive history-nerd, I was pleased to came across this movie and was super excited to watch it.The movie starts with a scene, where three protestant are brought to executing. It's the year 1554 and soon the Wyatt's rebellion breaks out. It seems to be spring or early summer, which is not particularly historically accurate, because the rebellion started around the late winter months. But by far the most annoying thing about this movie was its ending. The movie ends on a scene where Elizabeth announces her marriage to the people of England, symbolizing her loyalty to the throne. It's around the year 1571. After that, starts the ""golden age"" of England. The British Empire becomes the powerhouse of Europe, dominating their neighbors economically, militarily and Elizabethan theatre becomes world famous. Elizabeth defeats the ""undefeatable"" Spanish Armada and secures her position as a reputable world leader, while ending Spanish world domination. NONE of these events are even mentioned in this movie, which is very boring and disappointing.Overall, the movie is pretty decent, but too focused on the insides of the English court.",Elizabeth
144,love_for_nails,Don't know what to say honestly.,8,12 December 2012,"I like the history of Britain. I should thank first of all to this movie that it made me search and learn more about the famous Golden Age, the most promising Queen that Britan ever had that brought them not only an economical strenght but also led Britan to have one of the most powerful battle navy in history at that time. It was very entertaining for me to learn about those things giving the fact that we didn't learn about this in school yet and I don't think we will learn very soon.But what I have to criticize about this movie it's it lack of showing those important things, concentrating the plot more on silly events that probably didn't even occurred, transforming all what would have been a good movie in a pathetic, dull at some points story. They focused the story on Elizabeth's feelings and how she manages to exceed in becoming a good queen. That's a very fine thing for sure, because everybody wonders sometimes how those people lived. But again, we can never be sure that the queen really had an affair with Robert Dudley and didn't die a virgin as she pretends. Remember that she was the most successful monarch that Britain ever had in that century that gossips couldn't have missed. Showing the affair in the movie didn't bother me, though.Another thing that bothered me it's the constant idea that it's implemented from time to time, that Walsingham helped Elizabeth in almost 80% of her reign to succeed, otherwise she would have been destroyed. I have a history book, and when I read about Elizabeth's reign I was completely shocked that it didn't even mentioned Walsingham at least once. From that and from what I have further read and searched it seemed Walsingham's role was over shown in this movie only for Geoffrey Rush. I don't want to be misunderstood for this. Walsingham, had of course a lot of influence and helped Elizabeth a lot granted for his experience in politics, but I think that he had a much larger role in the movie thanks to Mr. Rush. Elizabeth was a strong woman that fought for Britain's reputations and for her people, and I think that, while she sure received some help from Walsingham, she wasn't that helpless and not aware of the danger that surrounded her.Anyway, those are my opinions regarding the history. Not necessary about how the movie really is. It was a good movie, with a good cast, a bit dark but that's what makes it good. But, again, something to say against, I don't think that Cate Blanchett was a good choice. I like how she expresses her authority in some scenes, I really like that side of her Elizabeth, but most of the movie, until she realizes the gravity of the situation, she acts a bit childish. Maybe it's not Cate's fault it's the plot. But she acted great nonetheless. Geoffrey Rush is great as Walsingham, he delivered a great performance. As for Joseph Fiennes, well, he seems like he has only a way of acting. The way he acted in ""Shakespeare in love"" he acted here as well. With some differences of course, but he didn't impressed me.All in all it's a good movie. Not as ""wow"" as everyone else praise, but still very good and worth watching.8/10",Elizabeth

148,QueenMag,"Some Good Acting, Weak Script and Lovely Visuals",6,25 November 1998,"The main reason I wanted to see this film was for Cate Blanchett, who blew me away with her performance in ""Oscar & Lucinda.""  She acted well in this movie, depicting a vulnerable Queen who doesn't (at first) fully realize the dangers of her position, but Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush impressed me the most.Eccleston is extremely versatile; he is like a creature unrelated to his ""Jude"" from a few years ago.  Geoffrey Rush was strong and enigmatic as Walsingham, Elizabeth's ""protector."" I half wish the movie had been more about HIM.  I am not familiar with the actual history; did either of these men exist?  I would have liked to have seen more about them; I liked the glimpses we were given into their dealings with others.  Fascinating characters.In any case, these were the major stand out performances.  John Gielgud (as the Pope) was not memorable because he was on screen for no more than a few minutes and his lines were hardly quotable.  Eric Cantona as the French Ambassador had an amazing sort of presence; I remember him quite clearly ... and I had no idea he was a soccer player til I read it here on IMDb.  Also, the woman who played Elizabeth's first handmaiden (or whatever they are called) was very expressive and is worth mentioning.Joseph Fiennes' character was irritating beyond belief.  I consider myself to be a person of reasonable intelligence, but I could not figure out whose side he was on or why by the time the end credits appeared. The writers (or editors) really screwed up with this character; a lot of his behavior was not clarified.  I believed him when he told Elizabeth that he loved her, but then ... why was he having sex with one of her maids?  What did he have to do with the poison dress?  Why did he seem shocked to see her writhing in agony if he knew nothing of the poisoned dress?  Why would he want to see Elizabeth assassinated if he loved her?  He made no sense to me.  Not to mention I could not understand why she adored him so much; he struck me as being a fop.  Leonardo DiCaprio would have been just as suitable for this role (probably more so, since he's played the type before) ... this character was listless, lolling, lazy, and a priss.  It lowered Elizabeth to even be attracted to this man.  I found myself wondering, ""Where is that fiercely handsome Duke of Norfolk?"" every time ""Lord Roberts"" showed up on screen with his puppydog eyes.On the positive side, the film is quite lush and colorful.  Visually, it's stunning and deserves some sort of award for that.  But, as others have mentioned, the use of music was atrocious.  The music didn't always match the mood of the scene, and sometimes it would actually detract from the scene.I think this movie is supposed to be about how a woman sacrifices her own happiness and personal convictions for the good of her people and the stability of her position.  Nice attempt, but it doesn't quite pan out.  In the end, Elizabeth comes off as a freak of nature - how exactly does caking your face with white powder make you like the Virgin Mary?  That was never explained.In any case, the music in the final scene was so obnoxious that I couldn't even reflect on the poor Queen's hideous transformation.  I just wanted to cut out of the auditorium as quickly as possible.I think I'll be checking out that ""Elizabeth R"" series that everyone keeps talking about.",Elizabeth

The scenes of sex were among the most lovely I have ever witnessed on screen.Although there were some grizzled scenes of torture and beheading, the scenes of beauty and monarchy were far more lasting in my mind.The story is confusing and the more one studies the actual history the more confusing the story becomes.

Cate Blanchett was good as the young queen who suddenly finds herself under a lot of pressure, but that's it.  Had this movie been a mini-series on PBS, I probably would've liked it more.

151,Gudhjem,Costume drama or political thriller? I don't know.,6,9 June 1999,One part of this movie is really good while another part of it is rather boring and uninteresting.It looks like a typical British costume drama and as such it is very beautiful and equally boring. It seems as if the director was afraid to make a movie that might actually be exciting all the way through.During the parts of the movie where focus is on the political situation in Britain during Elizabeth's reign it gains a lot and becomes one of the best historical dramas of the nineties. During these sequences the film gains strength and tells us that political back stabbing is not a modern tool.The film's real gem is Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth. Every time she enters the screen she owns it. Her acting is reason enough to see the film. And she is not the only one. Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush have supporting roles which bring something to the movie. Eccleston's character is a primary player in the political part of the movie. That is why I like it so much. Because the political battle is what makes this film interesting.,Elizabeth

However, I think that the movie is an accurate portrayal of the character of Elizabeth. She was a strong woman, but as likely to make mistakes because of her youth and relative inexperience with statecraft. The movie captures this perfectly and her character is brought brilliantly to light by Cate Blanchett, who was robbed of the 1998 Oscar. Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attneborough bring a seasoned hand to the production and Joseph Fiennes and James Frain offer new talents in the English acting world. I also enjoyed the use of music especially the anachronistic use of Elgar and Mozart, mainly because I think that the pieces are a perfect fit.

156,Tom-But,Thank God WE Met Lizzie!,8,7 September 2010,"To start with, very few actresses could have successfully delivered such a performance as Cate Blanchett's as Elizabeth I and driven it with, at times, such charismatic playfulness and, conversely, such avid passion and cold seriousness. Blanchett makes for an excellent Queen Elizabeth I, with perhaps her most astonishing achievement being her ability to portray the unrelenting and often overwhelming insecurity that inundated the young ruler which, instead of becoming annoyingly dreary, hits the right note and makes the audience sympathetic towards her plight, justifying her nomination for Best Actress, the very first of many Oscar nods.Balanced against Blanchett is Geoffrey Rush as the mysterious and daring figure Walsingham, a somewhat villain that the audience instantly can get behind as the philosophical anti-hero, eventually arising to the esteemed position of the Queen's personal assassin and adviser. His pivotal role and performance is undermined by a severe lack of presence, though he does a damn good job with what he's given.Joseph Fiennes is charming and sexily poetic as Elizabeth's illegitimate lover Robert Dudley. Whether portraying the Queen's lover or playwright (as he did in the 1998 Best Picture Shakespeare In Love, also starring Geoffrey Rush oddly enough) Fiennes has a remarkable quality to make every line demand the viewer's attention simply because his words can cause the most rigid person to melt before him.Christopher Eccleston, a man perhaps best (or most vaguely) described as a subtler John Malkovich, has few true moments of his own, but his restraint and silently calculating demeanour produce a constantly scheming Duke of Norfolk. His many attempts to orchestrate Elizabeth's death for the entirety of the film ultimately result in his execution, due to the betrayal of his servant/lover. Eccleston has created such an airtight antagonist that, even at this, his most pitiable, the audience finds it impossible to pity him.Kathy Burke's unfortunately small interjection as the eerily desperate Mary I also deserved far more recognition than it received.Finally, silver-screen veteran Richard Attenborough as Sir William, one of Elizabeth's closest advisers, is gently touching as the under-appreciated voice of reason. In one scene, Elizabeth declares that she will now follow only her own opinion and rebukes William for stating that she is only a woman, saying that she has the heart of a man, she is her father's daughter and she is not afraid of anything. William asks contritely for forgiveness and assures Elizabeth that his advice has always been in her best interests, struggling with tears concurrently with the viewer. It is revitalizing to see that true icons never really lose the power to move their audiences in such a way.The script's course (which focuses heavily on the brutal conflict between the Catholics and Protestants in England, squabbles that seem ridiculous now but echo the current religious biases in the world to a tee) unfolds with the unraveling of a mass conspiracy against the titled hero, as well as her efforts to do what is necessary in order to reign as Queen: discard her childish naivety and fear of the unknown and become a ruthless, impersonally merciless and dedicated woman. This route is defined and traveled quite comfortably with all the information of a documentary/biography and all the appeal of a splendid drama/epic tale.The score, composed by David Hirschfelder, is mostly a mixture of string-oriented melodies, fiddle and pipe jigs and church-choir accompaniments. The beauty of many of Hirschfelder's pieces is complemented by Alexandra Byrne's dedicated costumes and Remi Adefarasin's intimate scenery shots as photography director, though there is some clunky and irreverent editing on Jill Bilcock's behalf (witness Cate Blanchett's miraculous movement from the chair to the mirror, in mid-sentence, without taking a breath!)Director Shekhar Kapur has an apt eye for the continuation of scenes that sometimes are too long but remain of interest because of his considerate touch. If he has committed any true misstep in the making of Elizabeth, it is his constant focus on the affair between Elizabeth and Dudley, which seems adequate enough we realise that it's more fun to watch them quarrel. Still, Kapur has some especially triumphant moments in this film, from the immediately compelling opening, in which three Protestant martyrs are burned alive, to what is a moving, albeit brief, love scene between Elizabeth and Dudley, and of course the powerful 20 second homage to the entire film just before the conclusion.Elizabeth, while promising, is not a perfect film, which is a genuine shame as period pieces have become such common ground these days that it would be nice to find one that attains such status. It is worth noting that Michael Hirst's semi-faithful screenplay is, if you reduce Elizabeth's script down to its very base, often concerned with tedious yet necessary and, at times, uninteresting plot devices required to keep the film moving. While much of the dialog is crisp and well thought out, there are occasional instances when the film's momentum has slowed and all that is left are two people on screen speaking tired recycled lines, in particular the conversations between Dudley and Alvaro de la Quadra (James Frain), a Spanish ambassador, whom talk of nothing but Dudley's allegiance to England and love for Elizabeth twice for two full minutes when once for 20 seconds would have sufficed. Times like this make Elizabeth, a moderate 110 minutes, seem slightly overlong. Also, does anyone really follow Dudley's logic for ultimately betraying Elizabeth? Does he?!However, this is ultimately a sincerely masterful film, particularly its closing scenes, in which Elizabeth decides to take on the façade of the Virgin Queen, inspired by the likewise Mary, by cutting her hair to the length of a boys, adopting a wig, paling her face and sauntering proudly through her royal chambers claiming that she shall never marry or love again, as she is already to and with, respectfully, her great country of England and its people. Powerful stuff.",Elizabeth
157,keznik,How did this film get into Oscar contention anyway???,5,29 April 1999,"The director of this film didn't know how to tell a story.  The average viewer (I'm below average) desperately needed a narrator to fill them in on the English, French, and Spanish history, politics, and religion of those fascinating and turbulent times. What kind of claim did Mary Queen of Scots have to the English throne:  blood, politics, or religion???  Too many DARKLY LIGHTED scenes.  How did this film get into Oscar contention??? I noted that Joseph Fiennes was a busy boy what with roles in Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth in roughly the same time period.",Elizabeth
158,BBD-3,Doesn't Hold A Candle To Elizabeth R,5,23 January 2000,"Whereas Bette Davis (Elizabeth & Essex) makes Elizabeth out to be a cold, mannish, megalomaniacal ruler, in this movie Cate Blanchett portrays her as a weak, vascillating woman.  Frankly, Elizabeth I was more a combination of the two and perhaps the best portrayal was Glenda Jackson's in ""Elizabeth R"".  A bit of liberty seems to have been taken, in that this movie clearly asserts that Elizabeth had sexual relations with Dudley--a controversy that has never been resolved by historians.  She was after all, called ""The Virgin Queen"" and nobody has yet disproved that moniker.Perhaps my favorite scene in this movie is when Sir Francis Walsingham kills the boy who is his would-be assassin.  Took me completely by surprise.  I wonder if this is all artistic license, this writer knows of no such incident in history.  Still it was in keeping with the character of the times and of Elizabeth's ""Moor"", her great spymaster, Walsingham.This movie is more accurate in some ways than either ""Elizabeth and Essex"" or ""Elizabeth R"" for it makes clear the lack of warmth, cleanliness and privacy that characterized 16th century England.  It very clearly emphasizes the treachery that Elizabeth faced daily during her reign. 
Worth watching, but I still prefer Elizabeth R when it comes to telling this story.",Elizabeth

In the past couple years, I've been interested in history. Not so much for dates and all of that but what were the motivations of these real people. Of course we can't know every detail of what happened in the past. Not like today where we have to tell everybody every single thing we do on Twitter Facebook email Skype etc. They had letters and diaries and that's pretty much it. So we have to kind of fill in what we think people might have gone through along with what was written. I think they did a pretty good job. I mean let's face it in real life many of us change once we have been hurt and devastated by those we care about. Power, greed and lust sadly prevail. I don't think that has changed at all in history. Ha! Look at our politicians of today!!! I think we also begin to learn to see what is necessary and what is not necessary and who we can trust as we age. How is she or any other mom are different? The only problem I have with the movie was the overt sex scene close to the end if the movie; I don't think it was necessary to the movie at all.",Elizabeth

162,cho cho,One Virgin Replaces Another,9,21 August 1999,"`She had such power over men's hearts,' a young Elizabeth I tells her remaining true adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, nodding toward a statue of the Virgin Mary at whose feet she kneels, and wondering aloud why her own heart has ceased to be touched. Though it is late in the movie `Elizabeth' with Cate Blanchett in the title role, it is early in what would be the monarch's long reign to come.`They have found nothing to replace her,' Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) replies, nothing to connect their worldly hopes to the sphere of the divine since the English Reformation ended Catholicism as the dominant faith in the realm. Despite the success of a bloody Catholic reaction under Elizabeth's half-sister and predecessor as monarch, Mary Tudor, with hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake, Elizabeth in conscience will sever the whole Church of England from papal authority yet again. But what will take its place, not in canon or conscience, but in the depths of men's hearts?It is now when Elizabeth realizes it must be she. `I have become a virgin,' she announces not long after. She paints her face white and embarks on her long career as the icon an appreciative history would come to call the Virgin Queen.The movie, taking many liberties from the true text of history, chronicles Elizabeth's passage from the uncrowned, gamboling romantic who encouraged the repeated embraces of Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes), to the severe, chaste monarch revered eternally by English people. During this period in her mid- to late twenties she authorizes much spillage of blood as she gathers authority to her and deals mercilessly with those who would dispute it. The dirty work is Walsingham's; the onus is hers.When it is done, she knows she will never marry for geopolitics, as at first she was pressed to do. More sadly, nor will she do so for love, for her heart is dead, ground away in the forward lurch of history. She will instead sit resignedly and heroically, proxy in heaven for the hearts of her folk.",Elizabeth

Nominated for numerous Oscars, it deserved all of them (especially Best Actress, though I won't dwell on that) The story moves along at a pace which is neither too fast nor too slow, and the result is a well-acted, understandable yet subtle film about one of the most dramatic periods in world history.",Elizabeth

As far as this type of drama is concerned it has some superficial charm in respect to location, costumes and casting but the hideous distortions of fact are so blatant and so pervasive that the film becomes almost satirical. William Cecil cast as an ancient white-bearded dotard for example - Cecil was actually a mere 38 years old during the period portrayed. Why Hollywood feels obliged to revise history so often (shades of 'Braveheart' and 'The Patriot') is a mystery. Usually the real history is far more dramatic than anything the Hollywood hacks can dream up. Probably the only character who was reasonably treated in this particular film was Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham.",Elizabeth

However, I don't think that is the purpose of this movie.  The story of this movie is about the transformation of a free-spirited girl into cold and ruthless yet capable monarch.

The 27 year old main character conveys a great presence, as do Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Unfortunately, we did not get to see enough of Elizabeth and her advisors in the ""war room"" preparing to plot strategy, and I'm convinced that had I not taught this age many times, I would have been thoroughly lost.

Unnecessary sex-scenes, modern-day views and biases and too many scenery and overviews shots slow down the movie and make it hard to watch. Fantasy is one thing, good film-making another.

Costumes, equally, and the sets/locations were quite good. Direction was a tad heavy-handed, as though the director was still learning a lot about his craft -- a lot of imitation of other films -- and the lighting sometimes undermined the message by some heavy-handed effects more appropriate to teenagers' TV shows.

Enter a simple woman, a distant relative to the ill fated queen, yet next in line to her throne. She's a commoner that creates much concern amongst the politically ambitious and sets the stage for a story of lies, deceit, love and tragedy.The film stars the beautifully talented Cate Blanchette as Elizabeth. She must prove to England, the world, even herself, that Great Britain should be ruled not only by blood, but also by authority and compassion. The afore mentioned lacking and the latter in abundance.Look for the subtle yet striking performance of Geoffrey Rush. His character adds a strong scenes of mystery and intrigue to the story. We are unsure if he covets the life of a king or of a loyal servant.Although the love story dampens the legends of the ""Virgin Queen"" makes her vow of chastity almost laughable, I will still give this movie a better then average review because of its gorgeous production style, beautiful costumes and well researched locations and talent.6 bucks. out of 8.",Elizabeth

187,annabrownie,"Flawed, yet still wonderful",8,27 August 2008,"When watching this film, as with many historical dramas, I have to 'turn off the historian part of my brain', which would rather like to scream at times. Although I love this movie, and have since I first saw it, I must agree with a number of the reviewers on this site who have pointed out the numerous historical inaccuracies.Elizabeth I herself is superbly portrayed by the truly marvellous Cate Blanchett, who totally inhabits the role. However, the real-life Elizabeth was far more politically savvy and personally dominant than the somewhat easily-influenced queen of this film. The awarding of 1999's Best Actress Oscar was a crime against Blanchett, whose work in this film far surpassed Gwyneth Paltrow in the much lighter Shakespeare in Love.Her supporting cast are almost uniformly superb, from Joseph Fiennes to Christopher Eccleston to the almost-movie-stealing Geoffrey Rush. The latter turns in a truly wonderful, Machiavellian turn as Francis Walsingham; had he not also richly deserved his Oscar nod for Shakespeare in Love, this performance would have been worthy of a nomination. Allowed off his leash by Elizabeth towards the end of the film, he faces off against Eccleston as the treacherous Duke of Norfolk: ""I must do nothing by your orders. I am Norfolk."" ""You were Norfolk. The dead have no titles...You were the most powerful man in England. You could have been greater still, but you had not the courage to be loyal."" ""So cut off my head, and make me a martyr. The people will always remember it."" ""No. They will forget."" Absolutely brilliant.The cinematography and set pieces are glorious, bright, colourful. In this respect, the filmmakers capture the essence of the Tudor court, its pomp and ceremony.However, if it is historical accuracy you look for in a film, do not look for it here. The film conflates certain characters, meaning that they behave totally differently from their real historical counterparts. For simplicity's sake, it seems, the Duke of Norfolk who lived in Mary's reign and put down the Wyatt rebellion (dying shortly after) is mixed with the character of his grandson, who conspired with Mary Queen of Scots to depose Elizabeth, marry Mary and ascend the throne as her consort. Additionally, Elizabeth's first real love, Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, seems to have been confused with a later favourite, his stepson Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. While Leicester was indeed beloved by the queen, both of them were well aware that nothing could come of it. Elizabeth knew of his wife (in the film she finds out from Cecil) from the date of his wedding, and although historians will never agree on whether their relationship was ever physical, the mysterious death of Amy Dudley meant that there was never the slimmest chance of them being anything more than the lifelong friends they were. In the film Leicester conspires against the Queen, while in life he remained faithful unto death, forming part of her group of staunchest male supporters, along with Cecil, Walsingham and Hatton. It was Devereux who plotted against Elizabeth, and he was beheaded for it. The other major discrepancy is the character of Cecil. Although extremely well played by Attenborough, he is far too old in the film. Cecil was Elizabeth's greatest adviser until his death in 1598, when his equally brilliant son took over his role. He is sidelined too early in the reign according to the film, as well as appearing far more feeble in comparison to Elizabeth than he really was.In fairness to the filmmakers, they do not claim that this is a true historical account of the early years of Elizabeth's reign, and as I said above, I cannot help but enjoy the film, as long as I do not focus on the errors! Great camera work, wonderful acting, brilliant dialogue - everything else you could need for a great film are here, so perhaps in the scheme of things historical accuracy is not the be all and end all...",Elizabeth

192,Jurado,Flawed beauty,5,21 July 2000,"First off to get that out of the way, this film is widely inaccurate in historical terms. The events that take place in this film span about 30 years in history but you get the feeling all this happens in a  year. Let alone the fact that some of the  events and allegiances of characters are plain fabricated in order to tell a story. Here lies the biggest problem in this film. Changing history is not a problem, but coming up with a muddled storyline in the consequence is. The film is beautifully shot and acted but you get the feeling this was supposed to be a 3 hour movie which got killed in the editing room. Characters are never properly introduced and so come off one-dimensional up to and including miss Blanchett herself who has a real presence and is obviously a talented actress but never gets room (as the rest of the cast) to actually act. It's like the actors started a war against the cameraman and lost. The film therefore looks like a collection of beautifully framed pictures looking for a story to tell.  If you don't have any interest in or knowledge of the period, I don't see how you can make heads or tails of it. A lot of the relations between characters are only implied or hinted at so some actions the characters take seem bewildering. Lots of cameos (Fanny Ardant as Marie de Guise is wonderful but what she actually wants is unclear as with her cross-dressing nephew de Duke of Anjou) The ending is preposterous and then you suddenly see why everything in this film is as it is. It is all to drive home a point so lame the writer should be burnt at the stake like the peasants at the start of the film.

So much of the real action happenes behind the scenes, and we, the audience, are just shown the result. I'm not sure if this was deliberate, or if the makers were simply challenged with showing the interaction between so many characters in a 2 hour film.Vaguely speaking, the situations and characters aren't really directly explained(in a traditional fashion), but the audience is left to sort out who everyone is.

Well, this film is made for the Americans, and they know nothing about English history, and come to think of it, neither do most English people. I shall simply take the story (well, the bloody bits; don't want to get caught with plagiarism problems) and dump it in England. Now Elizabeth's reign was wonderful and exciting but there were not a lot of massacres and assassinations going on: Ah, who cares? Let's have lots of blood and gore. Hmm, and while I am at it, would it not be brilliant if Elizabeth resides in 11th century Durham Cathedral (bit draughty but lovely columns!) instead of in a comfortable 16th century palace? Throw in a few reference to the Virgin Mary and hey presto, film with lots of action and philosophy and I only need wait for the plaudits. Phew, that was easier than I thought! I just hope nobody asks me why I called the film ""Elizabeth""? Hope nobody knows anything about her reign; if they do, they're in for a shock ....",Elizabeth
195,maryfabuk,Well worth watching,10,21 January 2013,"Elizabeth is one of my favourite films. Being an avid Tudor 'fan' I couldn't wait to see this when it first came out. Cate Blanchett gives a fantastic performance as the young Elizabeth who slowly evolves from an innocent girl to the Virgin Queen while also trying to keep Lord Robert happy. Obviously this film has changed some events to fit the story so don't watch it thinking it is historically accurate, as it isn't, but then it doesn't pretend to be. It isn't a documentary, it's a Hollywood film so of course things aren't to the letter. If they were the film would be around 8 hours long! i cant believe people have rated this film so low as I found it piqued my interest even further to learn more about this Queen and it had genuinely great moments provided by the great cast. Really well worth a watch.",Elizabeth

197,harry-m,"A purported ""historical"" movie that would earn a grade of ""F"" in school.",6,6 July 1999,"The movie ""ELIZABETH"" is a decent movie based on acting, direction, and cinematography (although too gory for my tastes). But it is a nearly complete failure as history--especially for a movie which claims to be ""historical."" The writer takes a few undisputed facts a builds a wholly concocted story around them. He invents entirely false stories, distorts others, and even takes events that occurred 20 years later and attributes them to Elizabeth's first year. Along the way, he deflowers ""the virgin queen,"" and makes a traitor out of her one true love, Robert Dudley, who never would betray her. In short, for lovers of history like me, the movie is sanctimonious drivel.",Elizabeth
198,AlexV-4,Bit of a doughnut,9,10 June 1999,"I thought the middle section of the film was a let-down. The opening (Mary's death, Norfolk's attempts to have E killed) was strong, as was the closing third, but the entire ""who-shall-she-marry"" sub-plot was badly handled and slipped into farce. The costumes and scenery were terrific, and the acting (the leading parts) was excellent, but Cantona was out of his depth and Vincent Cassel as Anjou was a joke. Fanny Ardant as Marie de Guise was splendid and they should have made more of her role.",Elizabeth
199,hosr1,"Great acting by Blanchett, but historical hogwash ...",5,6 January 2004,"Saw this film for the second time the other night. There's some great acting by Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Jo Fiennes and Christopher Eccleston. The atmosphere is terrific & it's been well edited to produce something taut and compelling.Unfortunately, however, it is absolute historical hogwash. Does this matter? Well, of course we are all involved in interpretation, and there is no such thing as a pure fact, least of all in history. But to ride quite so roughshod over events in a film that purports to portray history is poor. There is interpretation ... and then there is complete alteration, and I'm afraid this film is the latter. Rather than shed light on 'truth' by giving a different angle it simply bastardizes what really happened. This is a far cry from films such as Shakespeare in Love or The English Patient, which creatively tell something important by setting them in a familiar landscape. This is distortion.",Elizabeth
200,ewa-12,Fantastic thriller,10,27 September 2003,"""Elizabeth"" is a great film. OK, it does not stick to the history and how it really happened but that's not an issue here. It does give a astonishing portrait of a young woman being confronted with responsibility of running an empire.The film hasn't got one boring or over-blown moment. There are so many classic lines in this film delivered with such a power that it touches you as if you were involved yourself. The fantastic cinematography is complementing amazing costumes and abeautiful English landscape and original locations. I have it on video and see it every couple of months to give myself that great experience of  being in the Golden Age England once again.",Elizabeth
201,robert_johnston,A truly great film,10,16 October 2005,"I am biased but the fact that Elizabeth lost out Oscar-wise to Shakespeare in Love is one of the greatest Academy Award travesties of recent years. I'm pretty sure that Shakespeare himself would have voted for this film! It's greatness first is in the performances of Blanchett, Eccleston, Rush, Fiennes, Ardant... the list goes on. But just as importantly it shows that atmosphere and dramatic tension are far more effective than special effects in transporting an audience. And then, like a Shakespeare tragedy, historical verisimilitude rightly takes a back seat to the investigation of eternal themes - love, jealousy, hunger for power, weakness, mercy - and perhaps most relevantly how - in politics - appearance counts more than reality. This universality is brilliantly revealed in the choice of music - Elgar and Mozart seamlessly heighten the drama. And the script is wonderful - effortlessly turning what in less sure hands would be trite asides into profundity. OK, I'm gushing, but (but for my money at least) with Elizabeth, director Kapoor shows that cinema can be truly dramatic. It's definitely in my top ten and I don't see its position being threatened any time soon.",Elizabeth
202,Babs-6,A fascinating transformation,8,28 November 1998,"""Elizabeth"" reminded me of what's really the best way, in my opinion, to watch a movie:  don't analyze it too closely, but be sure and pay very close attention to the characters and the story.  Follow this advice and you will thoroughly enjoy this film.  It follows a young queen -- vibrantly portrayed by Cate Blanchett, who was so wonderful in ""Oscar and Lucinda"" -- as she matures from an impulsive young girl who wants to follow her heart into a strong, charismatic ruler with the courage to kill her enemies.  Joseph Fiennes smolders prettily as her only true love (don't all costume dramas require a good smolderer?); once she realizes that she can't have him, and that any other marriage she might undertake would only be for political gain, she chooses to reinvent herself as the ""Virgin Queen.""  Lots of brutal executions, torture, battle scenes, and lots of palace intrigue, religious persecution, and debauchery... all in all, a most entertaining film centered around a riveting actress playing a fascinating woman.  Don't think too hard about whether the historical details or costumes or music are perfectly accurate... just pay attention to the story and you'll have a great time.",Elizabeth
203,Vince-6,an excellent film with terrific performances,9,25 October 1998,"From the moment this film starts you know you are in for a treat. You can sense the director's total confidence in his work and this shines through from beginning to end.The performances are all outstanding and Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Elizabeth and is surely certain to get an Oscar nomination .  Geoffrey Rush is never less than totally captivating as the devious Sir Walsingham, and gives a quietly sinister performance which constantly keeps you guessing as to whose side he is really on. Kathy Burke is only on screen for a short time but creates a big impression as Queen Mary.For me though, the most enjoyable performance in the film is given by Vincent Cassel (La Haine) as a French duke. He only appears in a handful of scenes but his performance bursts with life and humour and had me laughing out loud. Probably the best line in the film is delivered by him, when he says to Elizabeth, ""What ! What ! Wha - t! "" - you'll have to see the film to understand why this line is so funny.",Elizabeth
204,Chezo,Stunning Cate Blanchett,9,4 March 2001,"I resisted to watch this film for nearly two years. Altough the scenes that I had watched particularly between Rush and Blanchett struck me as really good. My descision to not watch the film was based in my truly dislike of the ""costume film"" genre, wich I find 98% of the movies boring and uninteristing, disguised by costumes and set decorations as true art. But I shall also comment that I have seen very good period films like ""Quills"" to mention a recent example, that have a story and are interesting in all their aspects wether they are based on historical facts or fictional,so I always try to leave a tiny door open to see some period films.I recently saw Cate Blanchett in ""The Gift"" and was amazed at her performance. I saw her before in supporting roles in ""Talented Mr. Ripley""and ""Pushing Tin"", and tought she was great. So I decided to rent some of her other films to look at her work. I rent ""An Ideal Husband"" and this film,the oscar nominee ""Elizabeth"". Blanchett was robbed the academy award for her performance. She is a delight, a powerful force. Even if she is not in the screen, you FEEL her presence She has the demanding task of portraying Elizabeth I through her many changes, from a young naive girl learning to be a queen to a secure woman in total charge of a country. Through all of the changes Blanchett is completely believable. Apart from her perfect english accent(she is australian)and body language, she uses in her performance something that is almost dissapeared in film acting today. Her face, through her face she conveys so many emotions from sweetness to anguish and really express the feelings of Elizabeth. There is a point in her performance that only by seeing her face, you KNEW what Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen was feeling at that moment. In a year that also saw nominations to Emily Watson and Fernanda Montenegro for their powerful performances. Is was Blanchett who should have taken the statuette insetead of Gwyneth Paltrow for her insipid performance (but she was the only hollywood actress of the lot,so the academy again kept the award between their own comunnity)Geoffrey Rush was nominated in supporting actor category for ""Shakespeare in Love"" but is in ""Elizabeth"" that he shines as  Elizabeth´s slightly malicious principal advisor. Joseph Fiennes, the lead man in ""Shakespeare""is also better here as Robert Dudley, Elizabeth´s lover Apart from those performances the movie is really, really good. Shekar Kapur did a great directing job, using close ups and monologues to explore more the internal lives of the caracters, the cinematography is a very interesting palette of dark and bright colors. The story does take some historic liberties, but in compensation reveals the internal battles and conflicts of it´s principal character more profoundly that any historic film will do. But the film becomes weak in it´s last half hour. It seems like Kapur and crew became tired in the making of the film and decided to give it a rapid ending without any construction and even coherence. Kapuer direction, so interesting and distinctive in the first hour and half becomes conventional and melodramatic and nearly ruins the picture.On the other hand that ""unconventional"" half of the picture may have been why Elizabeth lost all the 7 academy awards nomination it had,deserving much of them (certainly along with The Thin Red Line it was the best picture in that year´s best picture race)and going instead with the conventional costume picture that ""Shakespeare"" was, however the only unforgivable thing about the academy and Elizabeth is Paltrow winning over Blanchett (I would keep repeating that, im offended!!)  Is for that weakness in the conclusion of the film that I rate ""Elizabeth""a 9, if the movie would have kept it´s style, It would had become one of my favorite ""costume films"" of all time. Still I strongly reccomend it for the first 90 minutes and the stunning work of Blanchett.",Elizabeth
205,catwoman-9,History taken differently,10,20 March 1999,"At first  take Carl Theodor Dreyers movie ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" (1928). Then take  ""La Reine Margot"". Put both by the side of ""Elizabeth"". They all in spite of different origin talk about heroines in the same excellent (or maybe just the only right) way.  ""Elizabeth"" especially. We cut down the richness of  styling and we have a pleasure to peek into the big dilemma of women in the mens world.  We can understand the difference between the human being as a public figure (a symbol of divinity) and human being as a person. There is no room for love, personal wishes, anxiety when one is responsible for so many huge goals.",Elizabeth
206,redodson,definitely not Elizabeth R,8,8 July 1999,"This film makes a good attempt at portraying the Machiavellian intrigue and reign of terror that dominated so much of sixteenth English politics and religion, but in my opinion, it grossly oversimplifies the character of one of the most brilliant and complex women (or men either, for that matter) in English history.  The fault definitely does not lie with Cate Blanchett, whose portrayal of the young Elizabeth is just as memorable as that of Bette Davis as the older monarch.  Rather, I think that the problem lies with the attempt to depict such a confusingly dynamic historical period in a couple of hours. The BBC production of ""Elizabeth R"" (almost 30 years old now) did not suffer the same time restrictions, and did a much better job with considerably more historical accuracy. In my opinion, Glenda Jackson's Elizabeth R will long endure as the definitive portrayal of that greatest and most glorious of English monarchs.

209,slvrquee,Brilliance!,10,21 May 1999,To be critical of the brilliant film making that went in to this movie is to show that one is a stereotypical filmwatcher and not a film lover.

Why waste money on I KNow What You Did Last Whenever and crap like GO when you can make something as brilliant as Elizabeth!!  ONWARD HOLLYWOOD!!,Elizabeth
210,Seven-6,Worthy of the Praise!!,10,26 February 1999,"This movie took my breathe away.Elizabeth is a grandiose movie, made the way all historical pictures should be.  It has a great gothic feel to it, which only serves to height it over-all impact.  The opening scene is very powerful, as is all the visual links with religion to Elizabeth, like when she is first imprisoned and she is shown through the crossed window with her ladies-in-waiting.  I have been told that a number of other actresses were asked to play this role, but I do not think anyone of them could have pulled this role off as well as Cate Blanchett, with exception being Kate Winslet.I applaud the Academy for giving a nomination to Elizabeth, but I find it rather unsettling that the director received no nomination of his own.The one big problem I did find with this movie is that it plays out, especially towards the end, like a bit of a Mafia film or a Godfather movie, with all the evil enemies of England being killed for the safety of the monarch.  Walsingham seems to me to be a bit too Machiavellian in his methods as does the last half hour of the film.I did enjoy this film thoroughly as a experience in the way I would want to view a film, but I do not see the reason for all the historical license the filmmakers took.  Oh well.",Elizabeth
211,Mr. Snow,Was there a better film here?,5,9 February 1999,"I got the impression watching Elizabeth that, in order to make the running time audience-friendly, huge chunks of this film were lost to the editor's knife.  I can't help but think that there must have been a lot more to this movie.  So many scenes appear only loosely attached to those before them; so many characters appear out of nowhere and disappear just as easily.  As a result, some great performances seem to get lost in a quagmire of choppy storytelling.  There has been a huge glut of three-hour-plus movies recently, many of which are audience killers (The Thin Red Line, Beloved, etc.), but a truly good film will hold people's attention as long as it has to.  Studios shouldn't try to present an epic at breakneck speed.  It's more than likely not going to work.  I would love to see a director's cut of Elizabeth -- I think it would be a much better film.",Elizabeth
212,lulia,Who can tell for sure how it really was?,9,3 May 1999,"I just watched Elizabeth, for the second time and once again I was ...what would be the word...moved? Not in the teary-eyed sense, but in a way that makes you want to read more about Elizabeth I.However, I have read other comments and  two things occurred to me. First, that many people (brilliant scholars or erudite people whom I respect) pretend that ""it did not look that way"" or "" it did not happen that way"", such and such. Who are you to tell? History is not an exact science, it is a HUMAN way to try and keep in touch with the events that shaped the world we live in. Being interested in history and costume history myself, nothing STRIKE me as BLATANTLY  anachronistic. I think that Mr. Kapur primarily wanted to illustrate Elizabeth's rise to power, not her entire reign, which would take several films. His film is an account of an episode of English history, not a chronic on life in Tudor England, hence the lack of filth and lice, as someone mentioned... The second element is a more personal one, that in fact came to my mind while watching the film: how could Cate Blanchett lose the Oscar to Gwyneth Paltrow, of all people?! Her performance in Shakespeare in Love was charming, no less but no more. I think that trying to catch the conscience of a queen, to make an illustrious historic figure come to life is far more difficult than playing William Shakespeare's (fictitious) love interest.It was my humble opinion, and I wanted to share it with other IMDB users.",Elizabeth
213,Tina-37,Brilliant--a movie worthy of a great woman!,10,9 May 1999,"As a history buff who has been studying Elizabeth I since I was in elementary school, it was such a thrill to learn that a movie on her life--or even part of it was being made. And although this movie has compressed numerous events of her life into a few short years, and some liberties have been taken, this film is more akin to ""The Godfather"" saga than an episode of ""Masterpiece Theater"". Cate Blanchett-who should have won the Best Actress Oscar-is incredible as the woman I consider the Woman of the Millennium: intelligent, brilliant, sometimes uncertain, and offering herself as sacrifice to her nation. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Francis Walsingham, one of her ministers, who will offer life and limb to protect his Queen. And the underrated Joseph Fiennes again wins us over as Elizabeth's lover, Robert Dudley, who loves her in his own peculiar way, but nearly does a Judas on her. If you didn't love English history before, you will after seeing this. It's only hoped that one day, Elizabeth's great father, Henry VIII, will receive a movie as deserving.",Elizabeth
214,Tokarski,Why did this film get nominated for an Oscar???,6,15 May 1999,"Even before this film was realised, I wanted to see it.  After it was nominated for the Oscar, I REALLY wanted to see it...then I saw it.... This film is one of the worse things I have ever seen.  I spent half of the movie trying to figure out who the characters were (such as who Sir Robert and Sir William were in real life) and then the rest of it trying to believe why the film got nomintated.  The acting was good, but this film to so many poetic liberties that it became horridly disgusting save for most of the acting.  The plot became confusing for even me, who, I have to add, has read up on this period.  I fail to see how this film did so well.",Elizabeth
215,sweet_em_sexy,A Masterpiece,10,17 February 2000,"This movie got completely buried under all of the Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love hype, but every person who I know who has seen all 3 films has agrees with me that this film is the best of all the rest. Cate Blanchett hauntingly portrays The Virgin Queen who is attacked by men from every part of her life and conquers them all with the aid of the evil but powerful Geoffrey Rush. Joseph Fiennes finest scene is at the very end when Elizabeth confronts him and makes him an example of her growing power. The script is wonderfully written, showing Elizabeth as a flawed woman who loves and is rebuked and gains all of her strength.When she is shoved into a corner she comes out fighting and you want her to succeed. Blanchett was completely robbed of the Academy Award,as much as I like Shakespeare in love and Gwyneth Paltrow it is not even half as wonderful and artistic as this movie.

217,salsoulscomedy,Great Performance,7,8 July 2017,"The performance in this movie is really the big reason to watch it because she does a great job portraying a younger Queen Elizabeth. I was fascinated by that if not by the story going on around her, or other characters involved in her life. This performance was well deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress in that year but the movie itself was nothing to write home about, aside from that phenomenal acting job. Just a basic historical drama.That said there's nothing wrong with it and I would recommend watching it. It's just not the kind of movie where all the pieces are great and add up to an ""epic"" film. It's all well done and the acting is fine, it's just that the titular performance makes this movie rise up above what it would have been without her, which would have been just another average historical drama.",Elizabeth

Quickly paced, deftly directed and entertaining. Some terrific performances by a well-rounded talented cast, capped off by the incredible performance by Cate Blanchett. One of her many stellar acting performances. Certainly the script takes great liberties and makes sweeping generalizations out of the historical events, and often reshuffles them to fit the script, but for the most part it works.I would highly recommend this movie, it's in my library of go to classics.",Elizabeth
219,Chrissy-4,"Beautiful, but...",6,16 October 1998,"Elizabeth  traces the development of Queen Elizabeth I of England from a carefree and innocent princess fully enjoying the company of the handsome Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes brother of Ralph), to a ruthless monarch who is forced to renounce her lover and bury her sexuality under the image of the `Virgin Queen.' It raises some interesting questions about women holding power in male-dominated societies and the sacrifices of personality and sexuality, involved in retaining that power. This is particularly interesting in Britain which has something of a tradition of female rulers presiding over `glorious' (I use the word advisedly) periods in its history, e.g. Elizabeth, Victoria, Margaret Thatcher, all of whom were pretty sexless.The story of Elizabeth as a person is played out against the wider drama of the religious crisis gripping Europe as a result of the Reformation. The most horrific consequences of the conflict between Catholic and Protestant are graphically portrayed throughout the film starting right at the beginning with three Protestants agonisingly burning to death, but then we would expect nothing less from the director of Bandit Queen. Elizabeth's vain (and probably anachronistic) plea that religion shouldn't be an issue are eventually overwhelmed by the horrible realities created religious intolerance. And just as issues about women in power have contemporary echoes, so do those concerning religion.However, despite lovely photography and some great performances (particularly from Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth and Christopher Ecclestone as Norfolk), I was slightly disappointed. Despite all the gore and periodic melodrama, this seemed a very slow paced film with a rather confusing plot  unfortunately often consequences of attempts to keep, however vaguely, to historical facts. Often, it ended up as just a series of tableaux of beautifully shot scenes in large churches, in this respect reminiscent of La Reine Margot (also a film about a queen in Renaissance Europe).And finally for any football fans out there  Eric Cantona is surprisingly good as the French Ambassador.",Elizabeth

If only they had underplayed it, or shown a degree of subtlety, then this might have been so much better.  Such a shame to see great old actors like Richard Attenborough embarrassing himself, and great younger ones like Christopher Ecclestone so over the top.  Joseph Fiennes is just bad!The most serious problem is that this movie is just tediously boring.  No plot, and nothing to hold my interest for so long.I can't see what the fuss is about this one, and think that the makers must consider themselves very lucky they got away with some acclaim out of this one - let alone their careers!",Elizabeth
221,John-144,Wish there was more,6,29 November 1998,"There is much to recommend this film, but when it ends, one has the feeling one wanted much more.  First, there is the gratuitous charge one character levels that Elizabeth is really a man.  That was an historical charge.  One would wish the producers had done something more than merely bring it up. Second, we are left wondering about Mary of Scotland.  That was certainly a dramatic time in Elizabeth's reign.  The catholic question was dealt with politically only.  There were people of faith who rebelled against Elizabeth's insistence on having only the Church of England be recognized. Yet the acting, sets, costumes and cinematography were excellent.",Elizabeth

Went in expecting a ""Masterpiece Theatre"" type of movie--historical and somewhat distant emotionally but found myself involved and intrigued all the way through.",Elizabeth
223,Cicero-6,Disappointing,1,25 December 1998,"The lavish costuming and sets and good performance by Cate Blanchett could not overcome the grossly inaccurate depiction of history.First, the Catholics were all uniformly depicted as sexual libertines, murderers, and/or hypocrites.  The portrayal of the Jesuit priest as a murderous 16th century commando was especially disgusting.  St. Edmund Campion, one of those Jesuits, was martyred by Elizabeth for ministering to the faithful in England and refusing to renounce the Catholic Church for Elizabeth and the Church of England.Second, William Cecil - Lord Burghley, was also seriously misportrayed. Cecil, in fact, was Elizabeth's closest advisor for a lengthy period of time; Sir Francis Walsingham was a subordinate to Cecil.  Cecil was not the milksop portrayed in the movie.Third, many of the cast looked like members of a 1990's Los Angeles street gang instead of characters from 16th century England.I believe the high overall ratings given the film are a result of ignorance of history.",Elizabeth

Mr. Hirst has shown us how a young girl, in a world where women were considered the property of their husbands (and not existing in a legal sense otherwise), came into her own and changed the world.Important point to remember: England was broke when Elizabeth came to power, and was the richest nation in the world at her death.The story of Elizabeth surviving an overwhelming sense of powerlessness to become absolute in her power was brilliantly portrayed.  Most of the time people remember great opening lines.  This movie has one of the greatest closing lines.  Was Elizabeth the first type-A personality to set on the throne?  Ms. Blanchett's portrayal was certainly among the best, maybe the best since Bette Davies.",Elizabeth

Why did the writers of this film think that their very inaccurate script would be more interesting and exciting than events as they actually happened?It could have been so much better.",Elizabeth
227,LeTiss,A very good try,6,3 June 1999,"As soccer legend Eric Cantona's former colleagues might say this is a film of two halves. Despite an intimidating opening scene, the first half soon settles down to establishing who everyone is - the bad guys drip malevolence, while the good guys dance in gay meadows. It is not until the second half that the politics and intrigue really get going.The film opens in England, circa 1550s. The country is divided, half of the population pledging allegiance to the childless catholic Queen Mary who is dying, while the other half attempt to place their protestant liege, Elizabeth, on the throne.Mary dies before providing an heir so the monarchy automatically passes to Elizabeth. However, she inherits a rebellious court keen to see her removed and a catholic monarch installed. Fortunately for Elizabeth, there are not enough candidates for the job. While, the evil Duke of Norfolk plots to put himself and Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne, Elizabeth's supporters rush around trying to find her a suitable international king.The crux comes when she declares she is only interested in her English lover, Lord Robert Dudley. When her enemies learn of this, they try to drive a wedge between them. And from this premise the real intrigue flows.In terms of characterisation, the film scores some hits and some misses. Some curious casting decisions undermine a few of the characters - working class mainstay Kathy Burke moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum to play Queen Mary, Brit comic Angus Deayton has an unnecessary cameo, while Eric Cantona seems an odd choice, although his performance seems adequate.As to the main characters, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is well charted from gamboling youth to ice-hard queen. The black loyalty of Sir Francis Wolsingham (Geoffrey Rush) is tested time and again and never found wanting, allowing him to grow from mistrusted bodyguard to Queen's adviser.Unfortunately the Queen's enemies are so numerous it is difficult to focus on one. Michael Hirst, the writer, chooses the Duke of Norfolk as the chief villain but we never really learn why,  or what his plans, beyond unseating Elizabeth, are. Christopher Ecclestone plays the Duke with the right amount of menace but we are never truly intimidated by his smouldering glare. Lord Robert (Joseph Fiennes) is an equally confused character. Is he guilty of the crimes he is accused of? Does he love the queen? Some of his behaviour suggests he does not, yet he constantly returns to her claiming he does. The uncertainty generated by Lord Robert is compounded by the fact that Joseph Fiennes does not belong in this film.Beyond the characters, many of the films finest moments come in the form of the brightly coloured set pieces - when the court takes to the boat lake, the arrival of the french prince and the coronation. Some of the blacker scenes also serve very well - the aftermath of the battle, the plotting in the Vatican.Despite the fine art direction, what we are eventually left with is a sumptuous, well made film let down by a slow start and a few undefined characters.",Elizabeth

229,prem13,the head that wears the crown,7,20 May 2005,"Elizabeth is, as the name promises, the story of the Queen Elizabeth, but with one difference - it is the psychological story of Elizabeth. I saw this movie for a piece of history, and as anyone who has even a passing acquaintance with the era would be, I was curious about one of the primary forces behind it. Well, I got something else. I got a little psychological tale set inside the head of a major political figure.The film can possibly be analysed and revealed to have several layers and sub-texts, but I found it to be essentially the story of a woman coming to terms with being Queen. A tad obvious as analyses go, I know, but really that's what this movie is. And it is terrific just for that.Cate Blanchett romps through this film. She seems to go under the skin of the character and come out on the other side, as she oscillates from vulnerable maiden to monarch, from soft beauty to ice maiden, from girl to monarch, from uncertain to ruthless. It's pretty much a blast watching her as she slowly but steadily comes to terms with the nasty little job she has inherited.And no, it's not that she is in any way uncertain about wanting the job. That's what I loved about the movie - Elizabeth clearly loves her job, she wants it, and is never coy about that. But she must pay the required price and she does in terms of the life she eventually has to live. She inherits her power but eventually also earns it. She probably succeeded as a Queen because she was a real pro about it.Shekhar Kapur does a good job - his style is a sort of invisible one. He is almost not there, he seems to have put it all together and then nimbly jumped off the set. Half his work is done in his casting decisions as it should be in a 'dramatic' film - the biggest one of all being Blanchett. What's more he doesn't seem loathe to add a little extra drama to the film, and that really works. The acting, the camera work and the staging of the movie have just a bit of an excessive quality about, but it never goes wrong a) because, this is after all a story about royalty, about powerful people taking decisions that affect entire nations, and these are after all very grave matters and b) because of the stellar cast involved.-----Possible spoilers ahead---- The settings and costumes also help, of course, and the camera work seems to have a fly on the wall quality about it as it wanders through the somehow forbidden private world of England's royalty. But this film is finally about the performances. Geoffrey Rush is subtle, classy and slimy all at the same time. Joseph Fiennes is the nice lover to the point where you start hating him for his 'niceness', and his character is always an echo of what Elizabeth feels for him at that particular point in time, and an echo too, of the love she must give up to be strong enough to rule. Richard Attenborough I loved in the scene when the power game comes full circle. Norfolk is all huff and yes a little dramatic but he's a great foil to Elizabeth herself and one somehow tends to see his point of view at times, which is a terrific thing. And not one of the supporting cast is wasted - every face is brilliantly lit, and intensely shot. And Cate Blanchett is a goddess and the film simply belongs to her.Initially two things rankled. One was the lack of English scenery - what did the people of England at the time do, how did they live, what was life like in England at that time? But Elizabeth is a psychological drama, it is about power and about the rarified atmosphere that monarchs, kings and even modern day rulers must live in. In that sense the director's choice to rarify the world of this movie makes complete sense, as does the quick pacing - something you'd expect more from a thriller than a historical.The other was the fact that Elizabeth seems to depend a lot on the help of Walsingham in her success. I debated this for a while thinking 'Doesn't it undermine her as a woman?' and came to the conclusion that it doesn't. My rationale was this: If Elizabeth was a man, we would never have, in any way, seen her need for help as a sign of weakness, after all no seat of power (even in a small office with a hundred people I assure you) is won and retained without genuine support from the middle ranks. The only possible reason we could see Elizabeth as weak is perhaps because of our own conditioning making us believe that if a woman needs help, it must be 'because she is a woman'. Hell, everyone needs help, and I have a strong feeling anyway that by the time Elizabeth got good at being Queen, she needed absolutely no help from anyone. By then she was a great Queen and a brilliant pro, and not a conflicted soul (as the film admittedly 'hypothesises') in fact she was probably so good a queen, she was probably boring as a 'character'.",Elizabeth

232,pkv,My intelligence and knowledge was insulted and disrespected.,1,16 January 1999,"Elizabeth, a film of historical dramatization, not historical fiction, appears to have been written, directed, and produced by people who have but poor knowledge and true comprehension for either their subject, Elizabeth I of England, or of the period, Renaissance Europe in the 16th Century.  Even more grievous, in my view, is the makers' apparent assumption that their audience would know no better.The film's conclusion that ER I devoted herself to the rule of England only after she had been betrayed by her lover, Essex, was both a disgusting stereotype of women (that they abandon sex and men after men behave as they will) and gross distortion through oversimplification of the immensely complex political, social, and religious on domestic and international levels that Elizabeth found herself thrust into.In truth, ER was an adept student and observer of her father, Henry VIII, and, in that respect, a more than worthy successor to the transformation of the political map of Europe from the quasi-theocracy of the Middle Ages to secular government by sovereigns that understood that they had obligations to the land and people over whom they ruled.  It is in this context that ER said ""I am married to England.""  In so saying, she rejected the subjugation of England to either France or Spain that would have necessarily resulted from marriage to either the Duke of Anjou or the King Philipp of Spain.  By rejecting an English consort, she kept herself out of the snake pit of scheming self-serving aristocrats that England had the misfortune to suffer under.Yet, I have to believe that Elizabeth remained a vital woman.  Her self-sacrifice to the land and people that were England  were all the more remarkable because of the strength and vigor of her person.  ""Elizabeth"" missed this point entirely and in so doing, dishonored one of the truly great people of world history and insulted and disserved movie audiences at the moment of embarking on a new millennium, when we need all of the insights and perspective that we can get.",Elizabeth
233,Rick-107,OUTSTANDING MOVIE!!!!!!,10,5 January 1999,"When I went to see ELIZABETH this past weekend, it was because a friend of mine desperately wanted to see it.  Frankly, I am not a history buff and expected to be completely bored.  Boy, was I wrong.  The movie was tremendously engaging and the time flew by.  In fact it reminded me of how TITANIC didn't seem to be 3 hours and 15 minutes because of the action. Well ELIZABETH didn't seem like a two hour movie, and I was truly disappointed when it ended. And on top of that, I learned something about history in the process.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!",Elizabeth
234,Kimball,All together a very good film,8,27 January 1999,"I was only disappointed with the erratic editing sequence with Elizabeth prior to her addressing the bishops.  It's resemblance to Woody Allen film techniques was not very Victorian at all, and it was extremely jarring. Dissolves might have been better or even just voice-overs of broken attempts to formulate the sentences, while fluid motion on screen of her getting ready might have accomplished an underlying theme of the film.  It would have lent more to the idea of people in high authority positions, as Elizabeth was have a tremendous amount of conflict and confusion going on inside of them, but do not, or attempt to not let other people ""see them sweat.""  Probably would've been more fitting.I really enjoyed the whole ""cleaning house sequence in the end of the film. Really reminded me of, but not near the caliber of the end of The Godfather, in which Michael Corleone rids himself of the obstacles, people though they may have been, that pose threats to his rule.  I say obstacles because their deaths were as cold as they come- with no room for negotiation; ""offers they couldn't refuse.""The sequence at the end of the film with the whiteness, I saw as less of a virginity/purity thing and more as her emulation of a white male (the whiteness coupled with the cutting of the hair) so as to illicit the maximum amount of respect.  Perhaps this is way off, especially considering the working title of the film was ""The Virgin Queen,"" I just found it interesting that in cutting her hair, she looked less feminine and perhaps, in the eyes of Victorian England, more masculine, and appropriate to rule the country.All together a very good film, with solid acting performances from Geoffrey Rush and especially Cate Blanchette, who with her Golden Globe nod, probably (and I believe, rightfully) forged her way to the front of the pack for the Oscar race.  And finally, not to spend too much time on the apparent, the costume, set direction, and score were extremely well done.",Elizabeth

I do not know if the director intended his film to be an exposition of the extremes of religious intolerance (still rife in India and other areas of fundamentalism as well as in Northern Ireland)but this film was a timely reminder that  our own history (I speak as an Englishmen) is littered with the corpses of those slain (sometimes horribly) because of their beliefs or those of their neighbours.  Kate Blanchett as Elizabeth was compelling, Geoffrey Rush was a chilling Walsingham (Peter Mandelson eat your heart out) and Joseph Fiennes was good as Leicester both cutting a dash and defeated at the end. Christopher Eccleston burned throughout the film as the driven but evil Norfolk and Amanda Ryan as Lettice Howard aka Lady Macbeth was also memorable in a relatively minor part.  See it.",Elizabeth

Cate Blanchett gave a perfect performance in her transition from young Queen to a ruler of steel. Richard Attenborough and Geoffrey Rush were also splendid. Joseph Fiennes lit up the screen lusciously. The costumes were exquisite. This is NOT a boring movie, as the suspense was interspersed with light moments and comic relief.

240,melfreya,Excellent performances,7,16 July 2001,"Elizabeth is an ambitious film that relies mostly on the performances of a great cast. Though visually superb, it never quite reaches a satisfactory climax except for the emotionally strong final scenes. The standout actor in this fine cast is of course, Cate Blanchett who portrays Elizabeth with the suitable depth, vulnerability and subsequent strength without failing. She was robbed of the Oscar in a sense, not so much because she was the best but because Gwyneth Paltrow just didn't deserve it compared to her. The other excellent performance is delivered by the ever-great Geoffrey Rush as Elizabeth's cunning but loyal counselor. The final shot of him crying when he first sees the Virgin Queen proves what a range of emotions he can portray and how many dimensions he can bring to a character. Kathy Burke as Queen Mary and Christopher Eccleston as Norfolk are equally great, and Joseph Fiennes proves that he is much more than Ralph's brother with his subtle portrayal of a somewhat controversial and of uncertain integrity character. Shekhar Kapur's direction is certainly elegant but also repeats some motifs without adding anything new. Overall, it's an interesting and superbly acted British production. 7/10",Elizabeth

I think he gives one of the best performances in the film, alongside Cate Blanchett who is excellent as usual. And for those of us who expected Eric Cantona to be terrible.. I thought he was pretty good! Everyone in this film is great, full stop, and it's a film that looks fantastic too, but with substance.

243,senechs,Poorly Done,4,8 November 2013,"I have had a hard time understanding why this film is so critically acclaimed. The writing is poor, it is historically inaccurate, and makes little sense. I can deal with some artistic license for historic films, but this one is so far divorced from the truth that I had trouble sitting through it. Several significant characters are not properly introduced, despite the fact that they appear in several scenes. The script was a complete mess from beginning to end. Characters are extremely melodramatic, many of the scenes that we see do not makes sense. For example (spoilers):A dress kills one person who touches it, but not the other person who does so? (This is also an example of an extreme historical inaccuracy). When Elizabeth looks at herself with her hair cut, she proclaims herself a virgin. This makes exactly no sense. This has no basis in how people felt back then, as young unmarried virgins wore their hair down their backs, as she was featured in the beginning of the film when she was young. It doesn't even work as symbolism for other parts of the film. I found this line to be baffling. Basically, the film is one long irrelevant mess that relies on Hollywood's idea of what Elizabethan England is, with little substance or plot.",Elizabeth

Where were the physical and mental handicaps so common during the period.  What happened to the filth, garbage and rats.  Why weren't the characters infested by fleas and lice?

Very compelling and interesting as the new queen, who is thrust, almost against her wish, into power, learns the nature of the beast she must tame and then rule.  It may not be a blockbuster of an event, but you just don't find this level of acting in Hollywood.

248,adent-2,Remarkable...but leave the history books at home,9,9 December 1998,"I know only enough of the history of this particular period of English History to be dangerous to myself when trying to sound intelligent about it, but I am fairly certain of my conviction that the film isn't terribly accurate in a historical sense. In that way I imagine that, for lack of a better education in English History, I would have to agree with many of the previous remarks about the historical innaccuracies of this film. I bow to the superior period knowledge of others.But I am very certain of something else: this movie isn't ABOUT history, not really, and to focus on the historical innaccuracies is to rob yourself of a marvelous experience. This film is about the remarkable transformation of a remarkable woman who was in so many ways vastly and incredibly ahead of her time.Elizabeth is first introduced to us as a playful idealistic young girl, naive in the realities of religious persecution and the remarkable fragility of the office she ascends to after the death of her half sister Queen Mary. Her idealism and, dare I say it, feminism (""I don't see the need of a Husband at all"" she says after her coronation) make her a target in a sense she only barely comprehends. Through the very act of survival, she becomes a cunning and ruthless ruler who overcomes, overtakes, and finally leads an England that is not yet the world power it is to become by the end of her Reign.Cate Blanchette's remarkable on-screen transformation leads us from a giggly, free-spirited lover to a terrified new queen to a resigned and betrayed leader (""Must I make Stone of myself?"" she asks Francis Walsingham, very aptly played by Geoffrey Rush) to a rock of regality (""to rule absolutely, yes"" replies Walsingham). It is easy to understand why many do not fear her when she first ascends to the throne, and easy to understand why, in the last scene of the film, even her long time lover falls to his knees in astonishment and subjection to the Virgin Queen. She is, indeed, ""Married to England"".For a time I thought I may be a bit offended by the graphic-ness of the film...it is quite surprisingly sexual and bloody. But not in an exploitative way. Much as ""Saving Private Ryan"" suggested (or rather, shouted) that to portray war in any less than it's ultimate and final gore and violent reality is to pay less than complete and faithful homage to the participants, the portrayal of sex and violence in ""Elizabeth"" is to flesh out the era's people in their full, honest and genuine reality, which is ultimately the only way to be faithful to the characters of the film and to the period itself. To omit those details is to be less than honest.It simply cannot be said that Cate Blanchette's performance is anything less than Oscar-caliber, and I have my favorite in that particular category come early next year (assuming I stay awake long enough to root her on...and too bad she's got a boyfriend, from what I understand..oh well).",Elizabeth

254,Methos-7,"A Prison for Actors is created in ""Elizabeth""",1,18 May 1999,"Elizabeth is an exceedingly poor movie, and this is coming from someone who always watches a movie with an open mind and almost always has something good to say about a movie.  The basic intention of any movie is to tell a story, and the story that is told in Elizabeth is not only inaccurate, it is also dull and boring.  Historical accuracy means little to me when watching a film, as long as it can be comprehended.  But this movie is not, and too many times fails in telling the story of the ""Virgin Queen"".  I felt like reaching into the screen and asking why certain scenes were portrayed in the fashion that they were, the disconnected plot and movable characters defeat the purpose of telling a story about perhaps the most formidable monarch in English history.Cate Blanchett is an exceptional young actress, who can be appreciated for her portrayal of Elizabeth, a woman who was confronted with suitors and questions regarding her faith.  But in my opinion, continuity in the film was completely missing, and limited Cate's ability to bring her character to life.  The lack of intensity in the film is startling when considering the subject matter and how important it was at the time.  Many times it seemed as if the actors were begging to be allowed to act to their full capacity, while the script dictated that they could not.With all the above said, it remains a fact that all of the actors in the film are exceptional and make the best of what they are given. Geoffrey Rush steals the show as Walsingham, who seeks to do all he can to protect his Queen.  Joseph Fiennes as Dudley shows a man who loves Elizabeth but cannot ever marry her.  As told in the movie, we learn that Elizabeth never knew he was already married.  While in reality she did know, this fact does not harm the intrigue the two of them have while Elizabeth tries to secure her throne while loving Dudley at the same time. Kathy Burke does a great job as Mary Tudor, the miserable Queen who sought to convert her half-sister Elizabeth before she could ascend to the throne to replace her and her religion.  Richard Attenborough as Cecil is limited by the character he is given, but stresses the reality of the time, once you become King or Queen, you are bound to your state.  In the end, when Elizabeth declares herself the ""Virgin Queen"", and her service to England, Cecil's once trivial line becomes reality.  The Duke of Norfolk's service to Mary Tudor and intrigues to overthrow Elizabeth are well portrayed by the commanding presence of Christopher Eccleston, who in the end signs away his life trying to take Elizabeth's.After reading all of the praises I have for the acting in the movie, we must return to the reality that the film could have been better if told by a different director and with a different script.  There is no denying the costume design, setting, and music are all well crafted and help to tell the intended story.  But too many times the audience is left to imagine what could have been, and this is what I feel makes many label Elizabeth as a great movie.  Too much is forced into this telling of the legendary Queen of England, and many people see it for what it could have been, not what it is: actors without direction or a well-crafted story to tell.",Elizabeth

Cate was, in my opinion, truly the more deserving candidate for the Best Actress Oscar.All of the cast of this film make it a sweeping, engrossing tale, the cinematography and costumes are beautiful.

257,Eacutler10-1,Fantastic Film! A Must-See!,10,13 June 2007,"I had been reading other comments that others made and many people did not seem impressed with this film at all. However, I thought it was brilliant! Many people are saying that what upset them is that it was not historically accurate. In the special features on the DVD, the director expresses that it was not meant to be a completely accurate portrayal of Elizabeth's early life. It was supposed to be one person's take on her life.Another thing that I found interesting was that many people have been saying that there was poor acting in this film. I would definitely have to disagree. Before seeing this film, I had only ever seen Cate Blanchett in one film (Notes on a Scandal) and I had thought she was fantastic in it. I love Shakespeare in Love and I love Gwyneth Paltrow and everything, but I think Cate Blanchett should have won best actress in the Academy Awards for 1998 because her role was very complex and difficult and she appeared to master it. Geoffrey Rush was amazing (as usual). There were moments where I couldn't help but picture Captain Barbosa from Pirates of the Caribbeam while he was speaking. One of the things that shocked me was how many people have been saying Joseph Fiennes was not good in the movie. I thought he was absolutely perfect. I saw Shakespeare in Love and was amazed by him and then heard about Elizabeth from a friend and decided to watch it. Before watching the film, I came on here and was reading comments about Elizabeth and was a little skeptical when I started watching it. I was afraid that my good opinion of Joseph Fiennes' acting would be dampened. However, it was quite the opposite. I thought his portrayal of Lord Robert Dudley was amazing and no one could have done it better. Fiennes does not receive the credit he deserves for the role he plays. I thought his portrayal in this movie was absolutely heartbreaking (considering what his character went through). It was an all-around great film and I believe it is a must-see!",Elizabeth

Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth was perfect, and Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham was excellent. That being said, it's time for the negative.This movie is not for the person with a short attention span (like myself). If you miss a line, you'll be lost for sure. A lot of the dialog was quiet so it was also hard to hear. I was pretty confused at the end of the movie about what happened in a couple of events, and I had to go look up some information on Queen Elizabeth.If you're a fan of period films or any of the actors, see this movie.

The costumes are perfect. Cate Blanchett looked the part wonderfully. Much of the characterisation is convincing too. And the end comes to roughly the right conclusion for completely the wrong reasons. Though the casting of Attenborough as Cecil is ludicrous. Cecil would have been late 30s at the time. BUT the plotlines along the way are infuriatingly silly and historically rubbish...  Elizabeth knew Dudley was married: she attended the wedding. It was the scandalous death of Amy - widely believed to be for the purpose of marrying the Queen - that ruled out any closer relationship. Elizabeth was never going to risk her crown for love.  The only time she and Dudley were anywhere near each other in Mary's reign was when both were imprisoned in the Tower. The Duke of Norfolk was protestant and his plot was to free Mary Queen of Scots twenty odd years later. ETC ETC",Elizabeth

The actors are very good, the directing and camera work brilliant as well and the historical setting seems to be realistic and correct. Definately one of the best movies, I have seen. Shekhar Kapur showed himself as a very good director, but then disappointed with the recent Four Feathers, which is everything, that Elizabeth is not, and that is full of poor acting, bad storyline and bad directing!

Cate Blanchett was stunning as Elizabeth, and Walsingham was played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush. i cannot believe that Cate was robbed of the Oscar, instead given to Gwyneth Paltrow! i also thought that the score was great as well as the cinematography and art direction. the screenplay and story were well written and the direction by Shekhar Kapur should have been nominated. i really thought that Elizabeth should have won more Oscars, this is one of the best films i have ever seen and i urge all of you who have not watched it to do so!

262,osiyo1954,"visually wonderful, historically--not so much!!",5,15 September 2005,"I have to say first that while I loved this movie for Cate Blanchett's great acting,for the visuals and even the soundtrack, I can't help but wonder how filmmakers can so blatantly reinvent history! I saw this movie in the theater,and had to literally bite my tongue all through it not to shout out loud at the totally fictive events, strangely telescoped time line, and juggling of names and characters.It's not like Elizabeth I is some obscure figure in English or world history. You would think SOMEONE involved in the production of this movie might have bothered to look something (anything!!)up!I can only conclude that the makers of this film had NO intention of portraying Elizabeth's personality, intelligence, forcefulness, and political acumen accurately, let alone the events of her life and reign.The portrayal of her as faltering and weak in the beginning is hard to swallow, as she was politically subtle and well versed in the arts of intrigue from the cradle.Although so many so-called historical films are not accurate, or portray history through a particular bias, this one must be called total fiction. It's much quicker to name the parts that ARE correct. Let's see, there was this Queen of England named Elizabeth--and..well, that's pretty much it!They did sprinkle a lot of her famous quotes throughout, though at completely the wrong times and in the wrong situations. Alas!And did anyone realize that the filmmakers had the wrong Duc D'Anjou? The Duc who liked to cross-dress was the older brother of the Duc who was proposed as her suitor. He had previously held that title, but was King of France at the time of his younger brother's (and present Duc D'Anjou's) suit for Elizabeth.Close, but no cigar.I found especially ridiculous the implication at the end of the story that she was through with Robert Dudley, after his (fictional)betrayal of her. Any biography of Elizabeth is replete with references to the huge part he played in her life, both politically and personally.I needn't go on-- I can't go on! The inaccuracies are legion, and have been mentioned in other reviews. If you don't give a tinker's damn about even approaching anything like historical accuracy, this is the movie for you. Otherwise see Elizabeth R or better yet--read a book about her.",Elizabeth
263,Simon-16,"Nice costumes, weak plot",4,1 March 1999,"I was extremely disappointed after watching Elizabeth. Guess I expected some action in it, from what the trailers showed.The film's plot almost didn't exist, basically it seemed to be based on the Encyclopaedia Brittanica section for Queen Elizabeth and as I have read that section and other historical books I already knew what was going to happen all throughout the film. It's sad that the film is clinically free from surprises and thrills, actually I think it's quite predictable even for those who don't know anything about the plot.So, if you're not into fancy costume movies, avoid this simplified pop-culture historical love-drama and stay at home reading a good book and drink a cup of tea!",Elizabeth

It has turned out to be one of the best Tuesday nights of my life.  This movie is elegantly filmed, beautifully acted and historically accurate.  It is dark when the mood is dark, and light and lively when it is supposed to be such.Cate Blanchette is a new actress to me, but I am certain that she will be a household name in short measure.  Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes are equally enchanting, as are all of the other supporting actors.  Remarkably, both Fiennes and Rush are featured in another Academy nominated best picture.  Rush is nominated for his supporting role in ""Shakespeare in Love.""  How did the academy choose which one for which to nominate him?The real Elizabeth was a domineering woman.  This we know from history.  But this film accurately portrays how she became that; both by her wise choice of advisors and her own strong will.  Had it not been for Elizabeth, England may not have become the world power that it was and is.  And this movie shows why that fact exists.The movie concentrates on history, drama and charm.  It does not need blatant sexual scenes (although there is brief nudity and suggested sex) to enhance its beauty and marvel that is accomplished through the directing, acting and cinematography.  I cast my vote now for ""Elizabeth"" as best picture for 1999  Bravo!!!",Elizabeth

Don't be surprised if the Academy nominates them, in fact they deserve it. I think we found a new talented director also: Shekhar Kapur knows his job, combines love story and thriller to an exciting movie.

This is mostly credited to Cate Blanchett's spectacular performance in her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth 1. Cate does a notable job creating how we picture the image of the Virgin Queen, strong but weak, innocent but not to be overlooked. Also, the spectacular setting and costume designs aid to Elizabeth as being one of the greatest movies of all time.

The life of Elizabeth I was extremely fascinating and learning about all the people around her and everything was great. Then I rented the movie and watched it all the way through and was pretty disappointed. There were some characters who were featured prominently that were not actually that prominent in her life and some that were left out that would have been more interesting to see. I loved the acting, but in many parts it seemed confusing trying to keep track of who the people were. If you are doing a report on Queen Elizabeth then this isn't what you should watch.

280,Johnmitchell007,"An interesting, if flawed, interpretation",7,28 August 2005,"The film focuses upon the life of Elizabeth I during the reign of Mary and the subsequent early months of her own reign.Any film which tells a series of historical events is a mix of interpretation and embellishment of recorded events as well as strands which are made up and make a good story (To Kill a King being a fine example of this last point!). Elizabeth is no exception here although it does veer away from interpretation and more towards making it up! However, the opening sequence is stunning. The burning of so-called Protestant heretics is brutal and horribly realistic. Mary is vividly portrayed by Kathy Burke who gives an interesting performance of the character of Mary. What follows is a part thriller and part romance with Elizabeth facing numerous threats to her position as monarch. I feel that the romance thread slows the story down and at times is tedious. It would have been more interesting to focus upon the threat from Mary, Queen of Scots.The film contains numerous cameos, from the expertly understated Edward Hardwick as Arundel and the almost regal Sir John Gielgud as the Pope to the unlikely Eric Cantona, who just make the mark. Cate Blanchet plays Elizabeth well and she certainly looks the part. However, the outstanding performance comes from Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham who is not only the image of Walsingham but gives a chilling and calm authority to the role.Overall, the film certainly looks good and the story is reasonably well told despite its historical inaccuracy in places.",Elizabeth

The cineamatography was so incredibly creative, very Hitchcockian.  One need not possess any knowledge of history to make sense of the plot and story.   Like a good mystery there were subtle nuances. Glances between characters that foreshadowed events and interactions to come, such as the woman that betrays Norfolk, and the child that inadvertently reveals his father's hiding place.  The story wasn't exactly historically accurate, but it got my 15-year-old interested in Elizabethen England.  Call it artistic license.

284,PJ-26,An excellent conspiracy thriller,10,3 November 1998,"""Elizabeth"" has just the right running time for a film of this genre. When Compared to ""Nixon"", ""JFK"" and other reasonably historically based conspiracy films, ""Elizabeth"" emerges as easily the most watchable, in one sitting. Clever use of editing during the scene in which Elizabeth is working out how to address parliament, alludes to a ""Taxi Driver"" style insight into another's mind.The whole story draws interesting parallels with ""The Godfather, Part II"", as a ruler wanting to emulate his/her father's successes, slowly destroys all those around him/her. The film concludes showing how lonely such an achievement can be in reality, leaving Elizabeth as the ""Virgin Queen"" and Don Michael Corleone isolated from the remainder of his family, sitting on his throne, by Lake Tahoe.",Elizabeth
285,agm,Particularly bad music.,1,26 October 1998,"This film, posted as a ""bodice ripper"", was in fact tame to the point of dullness. Even worse, I felt that details of the plot and action were sometimes hopelessly absurd: for example can you imagine the Queen fornicating in view of her ladies in waiting? or a priest committing violent murder even in England of the 1550s? or that Queen Mary Tudor really was so ugly? To make a film of this sort dramatically effective, it must be convincing in its detail, and this ""Elizabeth"" was not.However my major grievance is the music. We are long accustomed to lush string tone attempting to summon up the atmosphere of Olde Worlde Englande, but Walton did it so much better (""Touch her sweet lips and part"" - this was real music). Here we have a pastiche of a pastiche, with all the lumbering dullness of so many bad period costume dramas of the past. For example, the ""Volta"" was a dance thought lascivious at the time - not a hint of this from the music here! The quotation from Elgar's ""Enigma"" (with a wordless female chorus - bless us) seemed hopelessly inappropriate and the pseudo-Handelian chorus at the end nearly had me falling out of my seat.Film music CAN be good - for example, that of Prokofiev and Walton, good enough to stand alone - but so rarely is.",Elizabeth
286,BenT-2,World of Symbols,9,5 November 1998,"Many words are said to particular historical inaccuracies.Well, I think Elizabeth never took boat trips like those in the film - But hey, that's not the point. It's not a documentation, it's an emotional picture with lots of ideas and allusions. Hmmm ... has anybody seen one or two of the large amount of symbols in this film? Not at all? Then let me explain, what I have seen. The film starts in the very first beginning with a view from above. And who is linked with such a view from above? Right. So at this very special moment you can see through His eyes on the scene. But not with pleasure, I suppose. So, the sky is almost coloured dark in the first 15 minutes. The nights seems to be longer then usual as well as the shadows. This symbolism is used throughout the film. At any time when the evil reigns - there rule darkness and thunder as well and the omnipotent rain maker sends conditions of meteorological exceptions to the island. On the other side white fade outs are used to emphasize Elizabeths greatest moments. I don't know why, but obviously Shekhar Kapur (director) gave the Queen (always?) a strong ally to her side.Everything in the film seems a bit too large. The cathedral of Durham, the flower decorated suit of Elizabeth (which she took off as Queen, symbolically for her separation from the nature) and at the end her virginity.Just look twice. In my humble opinion, this film is worth 9 out of 10 points.",Elizabeth

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film, but I have a hard time believing that it was one of the five best movies of the year.  Or even close.  There was beautiful cinematography, and some fine performances, especially from Cate Blanchett, who probably deserves her nomination.  Joseph Fiennes was much better in Shakespeare in Love (a movie truly deserving of its nomination), but he is still adequate here.  The plot, though, suffers the same fate as many other historical dramas:  There is no real dramatic arc.  When writing historical fiction, screenwriters should be more careful to ensure the story still contains the ""normal"" plot elements:  climax, falling action, etc., especially when the facts are distorted as much as is the case with this movie.  I felt very unfulfilled at the end of the movie.  I think the ending, while it could have worked very nicely if it had been set up earlier, was uninspired and pretentious.

However, almost everything else seems wrong about this movie. Most obtrusive is the soundtrack with its extreme examples of ugly singing.  The choice of the music, for example Mozart's famous Requiem, composed at least 250 years later, is also very unfortunate.The storytelling does not make sense either. The movie starts as abruptly as it ends, and despite Cate Blanchett's great performance, one cannot feel involved with her or anyone else.At the end of the movie most of Elizabeth's impressive career has yet to come. As the movie ends when there's no more blood to show, one is left puzzled about the intentions of the director. Can anyone imagine a movie about Churchill which ends in 1939?",Elizabeth

This story bore absolutely no resemblance to what actually happened during Elizabeth Tudor's reign. The costuming was a travesty of what it could have been. It was a wonderful Victorian fantasy of what they thought Elizabethan clothing might have looked like. The writer took 45 years of her reign and compressed it into a 2 1/2 hour movie that bore no resemblance to the truth. I'm certain Elizabeth is flipping in her grave at the slander of her person, reign, friends and country. What is worse is that this has a study guide that is being used in junior high and high school history classes as true history. Do not waste your money or time on this waste of film.

This is not only one of the best dramas of the year, but also, it is the best thriller, the best romance, and it harbors some of the year's best performances.Cate Blanchet leads this stellar cast with an Oscar worthy performance.  She is elegant, fragile, sophisticated, and transparent--she produces the best performance by a lead actress this year.  Geoffrey Rush and Chistopher Ecleston are excellent supporting characters and deserve nods of their own.Appart from the acting the best thing ""Elizabeth"" does for the audience is create a horrifying sense of fear, danger, and solitude.  With enormous empty rooms, assassination attempts, blood red costuming, and characters ducking in and out of the shadows, the audience is treated to the feeling of the violent uncertainty so appropiate to the time.Many critics and viewers have disagreed with my consensus, but nevertheless, this is a film worth seeing twice.  It is biting at the heels of the exhalted ""Saving Private Ryan"" and surpasses the likes of ""The Truman Show.""  Indeed this is one of the year's best pictures, and certainly one of the year's best performances. See ""Elizabeth,"" even if you hate costume dramas, this isn't your ordinary period piece.

294,jules-67,Worth watching despite historical errors.,10,26 January 1999,"Elizabeth captured my attention--and my thoughts for weeks afterward--as no other movie has since Shine.  Although the movie takes liberties with history, those liberties were guided by the hand of an able dramatist, one who tried to capture the spirit of a 45-year reign in two hours.The timing is compressed and rearranged, but only to reinforce the film's major themes:  a woman's maturity as monarch, the political chaos of Renaissance Europe,  and the religious fervor that fueled such chaos.Only one oversight bothered me a bit:  While Elizabeth is portrayed as an able diplomat, she had many more intellectual talents and accomplishments than the film suggests, and it was this stunning combination of gifts--not just her courage (""heart"") and marital independence--that allowed her to rule successfully.Aside from the script, the movie was visually rich; I appreciated the use of lighting and music to establish the tone and texture of each scene.The acting was also superb, although I believe Lord Burleigh was a bit more fierce than was indicated by Attenborough's gentle portrayal.  Cate Blanchett was riveting, as was Kathy Burke (in a pathetic way, of course). And Christopher Eccleston showed me, for the first time, how viscerally magnetic and sensual a powerful,  ambitious man can be. (Is this how Clinton affected Monica?  Yikes!)I do think Elizabeth fared better with viewers who already knew something of the characters involved.  More effort could have been made to clarify the story line and its participants' roles for those who didn't.But back to accuracy.  As with the movie Amadeus, I simply don't expect a good movie to be historically perfect.  That's the job of a documentary. What I do expect is that the movie be faithful to events in general and be written and produced well enough to interest viewers in the subject. Ideally, they would do exactly what two of my friends did after they saw Elizabeth:  they hit the nearest bookstore and learned more about this incredible woman and her times.As for me, I'm taking my husband to the next Saturday matinee.

I read the books of Jean Plaidy, they are pretty old, but very good.he wrote three books about Henry V111 and his six wives and one about Elizabeth.They are really nice.I did some research and I discovered some mistakes in the film. For example : Elizabeth always knew that Robert Dudley was married and the film says not. 2.The book says that Elizabeth was in the tower when Mary was still alive and Lord Dudley was there too, before she was there. 3.She had a special room in the Tower and no cold and dirty room.Just a couple of examples, I think the director could do this better. is there any better movie about Elizabeth and still available in Holland(subtitled) ?",Elizabeth

302,gringo_loco812,Disappointing Hollywood Fluff,4,11 August 2000,"As the post movie text explains, Queen Elizabeth's reign is often referred to as the Golden Age for England.  She helped establish the a power structure that continued for centuries after her death.The acting may have been okay, but I couldn't get past how this movie wastes such a rich story and character.  Her life was filled with grand struggles and intrigues, yet this movie spends endless scene after endless scene showing her dancing in court and fawning after Sir Robert.  We are led to believe that she ascended to the throne as a simple naive girl and fortunately was transformed into a powerful queen.Give me a break.  I can't stand that kind of Hollywood crap.  Her political skill and cunning were forged long before the crown was placed on her head. She didn't dance around the may pole far off in the country, oblivious to the court and politics.  Her father was Henry the VIII.  Portray her with the obvious metal she had from a very early age.I had difficulty not fast forwarding through the whole movie. Fortunately, the movie gets a little better in the last 30 minutes (why I rated it a 4). Watch in on TV during the Summer sometime.",Elizabeth
303,dan_nw,mediochre,5,10 November 2000,"Although I actually enjoyed the movie, I found the liberties taken with the history very frustrating.  Especially since it was billed as an historical film!The other problem I had with the film was the women's clothes.  The costuming was atrocious!  Most of the garments seemed to be based on popular fictionalized views of the 16th century.  I mean, I even noticed someone wearing the Disney's Snow White dress all in blue!  With so much information available on 16th century clothing there is no excuse.I think the designer's claim that she wanted to do a ""jeans & t-shirt"" approach to the 16th century was a sign of laziness and silly (they had their own types of relaxed clothes - she didn't have to make it up).
When all is said and done, I did enjoy the film but, don't use it as a base for either history or costumes.  In other words, enjoy the fairy tale but, don't use it for a refernce film.",Elizabeth

For anyone who thinks history is boring - have them watch this movie and they'll understand the depth of man's pettiness and depravity as well ability to rise to imitate the divine.

Her fears, her strenght, her fight for her believes. How the men try'd to control her and how she fought back. How she got her heart broken and became the ""Virgin Queen"". The cast of the movie is good. They have found a group of people who complimate each other in a good way. Geoffrey Rush plays Walsingham to the fullest, Christopher Eccleston is great as Norfolk and you get a few laughter from Vincent Cassel. Shekhar Kapur get all my love for making this movie.

No British Empire, no USA, Australia,... as we know it. Anyone's guess how the world would be now in the third millennium. If you like any one of the following: history, costume drama, cut throat politics, double dealing, fornication, and bloody brutal murder, this film is for you! To make this film a 9/10, do some homework and study a short synopsis of the history and characters.

The sex dosen't go the further and involves no private parts. It will tell great things about the historical language and problems of the day in Queen Elizabeth I's time. The only part that would make the movie R is the scene where some plotters are hanged, drawn, beheaded and cut in four or described as hanging, drawing and quartering which all people under 17 should have their eyes closed as well as people who form the great majority who would be scared. The rest should be rated PG - 13 and maybe kids could see it if you talk about and the PG - 13 is because of sexual things that may be bad for viewers under 13.From Noah",Elizabeth
309,satuit59,highly disappointing,1,21 July 2007,"To say that this movie takes liberty with historical fact is a gross understatement. I like Blanchett as an actress, but this movie was so far from accurate as to fall in the category of fiction. About the only thing it got right was the names of key figures. One fact regarding Elizabeth and Dudley was glaring in its omission. If this movie renders anyone with a desire to read historical information on this much celebrated queen, excellent. Hers is a story worth learning. I have read a few books on Her Majesty, and much enjoyed Glenda Jackson's portrayal in the BBC mini series. That is why I checked this movie out, certainly withholding any expectation of quality and accuracy as presented by the BBC. I am so glad I saw this fairy tale before I actually paid money for it. It was a pretty film, but seeing how it was so far off the mark historically, I can't even say that the acting was exceptional. Oscar worthy? Perhaps if it had any basis in historical reality it may have been.",Elizabeth
310,kingarthur55,Well Done,8,22 October 2005,"Much is commented on due to the movie's historical inaccuracy, and while these comments are correct for the most part, as a work of cinema, the movie is excellent on all counts. The cinematography, sets and costuming are wonderful, and the performances of the leads, especially Cate Blanchett are excellent. There some supporting players that deserve special recognition. Two stand out for me.English actress Kathy Burke (probably best known to Americans as Patsy's hyper-yuppie magazine editor on Absolutely Fabulous) is terrific as Queen Mary. Burke could have played her as history dictates, dour, stiff and unfeeling. Burke instead portrays her as manic, highly emotional and slightly psychotic, which is probably more accurate. She makes the most of her short time on screen, and if anyone ever decided to make a movie on Bloody Mary, I'd hope they would give Burke first shot at the role.French actress Fanny Ardant is major fun as Mary of Guise, who ruled Scotland during the minority of her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots. Ardant is a radiant presence (that smile!) and it should be lamented she wasn't on screen in this film more often. She imbued her character with sexiness and playfulness, and she truly lit up the screen in her all too short scenes.",Elizabeth

Of course, as with any historical drama, liberties may have to be taken occasionally with the facts for clarity and the necessity to fit the film into it's allotted running time. Sadly it seems there was no attempt to portray any kind of realism or accuracy at all - in fact, in this case, history has been butchered, but to what end? High tension drama? Bodice-ripping romance? On every level this film failed to deliver, but what's worse is that I am not clear as to what the film makers were trying to deliver in the first place. We are all here because we appreciate film and have a longing to be entertained. Nobody expects to spend two hours plus of their lives to end up feeling bored and frustrated which is how I feel right now. A tedious and bland portrayal of one of our greatest monarchs and an ill-befitting testament to one of the most exciting periods of English history.",Elizabeth

313,strefanash,grossly inaccurate,5,12 April 2009,"Grossly inaccurate. Her dealings with Anjou were from 1577 onwards after she had reigned for 20 years and was 20 years older than the Frenchman. Thus Mary of Guise, ""aunt of Anjou"", mother of Mary Queen of Scots, was long dead (1560) before it happened and the courtship was thus not a condition of an anglo scots armistice. William Cecil was not a much older man, he was also a loyal servant, her ""spirit"" (she was fond of nicknames)who served her until the 1590's. Norfolk rebelled circa 1572, not in the first 5 years of her reign. The pope excommunicated her in 1570 after she had reigned 12 years, not within months of her coronation. Thus events in the movie did not happen in the first five years of her reign. And as for the claim that the Queen invented her virginity as an image, a false one, only a generation as sex crazed as ours could find lifetime chastity unthinkable. This is projection on a past age of modern sensibilities. Moreover Kat Ashley was her nurse, a grown woman when Elizabeth was a baby, and therefore not one of her young ladiesI am incensed with the laziness and arrogance of script writers who will NOT do some research AND GET IT RIGHT. This work is a historical fantasy, and little more",Elizabeth

I thought the acting in this movie was second to none (I'm a massive fan of Cate Blanchett anyway), the costumes, dialogues etc.. were great.. Nevertheless, Historically speaking what a load of nonsense (to be polite. First of all the way the Spanish were portrayed was ridiculous ..and stupidity really..especially considering that Spain was THE most powerful Nation of its time..so portraying the King of Spain as a pale feeble little weird man was frankly laughable..anyway.. Besides this, I'd like to stress that the only reason why Spain did not manage to invade Britain had more to do with pure luck frankly and to the fact that the winds were blowing so hard at the time that they destroyed half of the Spanish Fleet (Armada)..In fact, had it not been for said winds (and for the fact that the Spanish Armada had already been weakened/tired from fighting with the French) Spain would have surely succeeded, Queen Elizabeth or not!!I was actually discussing this with an English colleague of mine ( I live in the UK) who totally agreed with me! So even if the English do.... Anyhow, can't really expect much from a movie made for and by Anglos Saxons can we? I guess their vision had to be pretty bias..

A mastery with which the director succeded to immense you in the Elizabethan atmosphere is amazing. Cate is superb and unrivalled compared to others nominated that year. I think the reputation of the Academy was considerably undermined due to Gwyneth's winning. I doubt the acting skills of Gwyneth - watching her in the movies - I do not believe her images. Gwyneth's acting leaves much to be desired - I guess she was more natural and organic when crying at the ceremony rather than in her movies. I would personally have boycotted the stupidiest ceremony of all times. Those of my acquaintances who watched both ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Elizabeth"" would agree with me - Cate is one of the greatest actress and a living example for hundreds of mediocre hollywood babes.",Elizabeth
317,Shakespearejr,I liked it but it is not historically accurate,7,1 June 2005,"The writer took a lot of liberties when he wrote the screenplay for this movie. I liked it because generally it gave the overall feeling about how difficult Elizabeth I's reign was. Cate Blanchett was brilliant in this role - but the writer did leave some things unclear with no background touched upon. I could write 2 pages to right the wrongs stated as history but probably the best way to understand Elizabeth's reign is to read a really good book by Jane Dunn called ""Elizabeth and Mary, Rivals. Cousins, Queens."" Jane Dunn has done a brilliant job of research through English State Papers (290 volumes worth) and other books historically correct. The writer made the movie work but really shouldn't have stated a time frame because he hardly ever stayed in it. This movie brought Elizabeth I to light for many people who now think they know about her, but really they don't. I hope no one quotes things that happened in this film as accurate because they will be laughed at by people who know the real story. Still all in all I enjoyed it for what it was.",Elizabeth
318,demas-hosni,Great film,7,20 March 2012,"In a year overwhelmed with reminiscent films, Elizabeth rises above the rest to become one of few stunning manifestations of the Hollywood Renaissance. Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations, Shekhar Kapur's intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.Presented here by a superb cast led by Golden-Globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean era turmoil and upheaval are captured brilliantly. The lush set itself is a feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young Elizabeth's path. Against the dark setting of medieval stone castles, a blooming Golden Age approaches as England expands to take control in a world of great unrest after Catholic Queen Mary's death. Her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth daughter of Anne Bolyne is placed on a throne of a kingdom torn between religion. Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless reality of queenhood--surrounded by enemies such as Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Constantly by her side is her reverent adviser Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) who advises Elizabeth to marry for convenience choosing from a ""pool"" of ready political candidates--while Elizabeth herself is long set on her lover from the past Sir Robert Dudley (a charming Joseph Fiennes). Yet just as England learns to wake up from the medieval dream, Elizabeth learns the bitterness of betrayal as she looks to Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush)'s counsel.Focusing on Elizabeth's subtle changes of phase from fire to ice at a distant in the midst of a grander panorama beautifully shot, the audience gradually distinguishes her footsteps from the shedding of innocence to a tough ruler that dares to strike first against her enemies, to ultimately become the Virgin Queen to reign above all men.",Elizabeth

Whether you are familiar with Queen Elizabeth I or not, it is definitely worth your while.Cate Blanchett's performance is riveting! I believed that she was Elizabeth every step of the way.I was very surprised that Geoffrey Rush was nominated for the Oscar for his ordinary performance in Shakespeare in Love instead of his amazing and cunning performance it this film.The mystery, drama, love, and passion of this film leave you begging for more. Sheker Kapur directs flawlessly and the music and cinematography are inspired as well. Costumes by Alexandra Byrne (The Phantom of the Opera), Academy Award winning makeup by Jenny Shircore (The Phantom of the Opera) and Anita Burger (Vanity Fair and Alexander), production design by John Myhre (Chicago), art direction by Lucy Richardson (Chocolat), and set decoration by Peter Howitt (The Four Feathers) make for a beautiful film to be eternally loved.",Elizabeth
320,cesium14,Not enjoying this,3,2 September 2014,"I'm usually discreet when giving bad reviews for a film, because in front of a work of joint collaboration by many professionals I should learn to understand and appreciate. But this one, really? Frankly I can hardly think of any film that's worse than this, and I've even watched Movie 43. After the beginning of the film my mind already began to drift: as an empress well celebrated as ""the Virgin Queen"", why would a film dedicate as much as 30 minutes on her love life? Surely she had quite some suitors, but that's not what made people interested in her. The whole Robert Dudley line is completely inconsistent and mostly unnecessary. Am I suppose to buy the theory that when someone is loved by the Queen, he's risking himself being torn apart inside and forced by his shredded heart to plot her assassination, especially when just 5 minutes ago on the screen he tried to marry her to the King of Spain? This being my first Joseph Finnes film, I might never be able to like him anymore, thank you very much. Besides, judging by what I learned from this film, all Elizabeth can do is to dance, to lie back laughing like drunk, and rely on Walsingham for everything, and her hair seems to contain some active components of onion. She lacked the resolution for a Queen, and the history of England would hardly have changed without her. And that's far from the truth. The details are no more well-organized than the plot. 1. When Monsieur de Foix delivered the marriage proposal to the Queen for the second time and she said she would meed the Duke of Anjou in person, Dudley stormed away angrily, and the Queen went off to chase him immediately. Is that at all appropriate? Will a Queen of England be chasing the first Earl of Leicester during a conversation with the Ambassador of France? If that's the English way, I accept it with deepest respect. 2. The speech by the Queen in the church debate might be the worst speech ever displayed on screen. You can't just introduce a solemn background music and say the speech is convincing (which really happened in the film, and I'm offended). 3. The Daniel Craig part killed me a bit inside. How on earth would the director think that will fit in the film? 4. If the film was overall better in quality, the character of the Duke of Anjou might be fun/funny. But in crappy film like this it just sinks it deeper. 5. The intelligence department of the Elizabethan government seems to be desperately in need of hands, because Walsingham had to act as counselor, muscle, detective and assassin all by himself. I would have thought that you don't have to grope on the wall for a secret door when you are a Sir. 6. Is the Duke of Norfolk being killed right after sex supposed to be artistic? Besides, as an unessential role the Countess of Norfolk got too much screen time. Is she a niece of the director or something? If I were to watch the film again I would be able to find more weird stuff like this, but I always try to avoid such traumatic experience. I'm fairly disappointed that actors as brilliant as Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush themselves would appear in such low-quality film. I think Cate Blanchett(or Naomi Watts perhaps?) said in an interview that one has to be lucky to get good roles, but that's hardly any consolation.",Elizabeth

Robert Dudley's wife (played by Kelly Macdonald) is named Isabel Knollys in this movie. In ""real life"" Dudley's (second wife) was named Lettice Knolly. We see her half way through the movie dying (murdered) by a ""poisoned dress"". In actuality ""Lettice Knolly Dudley"" died of a ripe old age. She was married once before Dudley and again after Dudley passed. We are further confused by an insignificant character named Lettice Howard, (played by Amanda Ryan)who has no historical significance. In the movie the Earl of Arundel (played by Edward Hardwicke) was beheaded, with head then mounted on a pike. History tells us he died at home along ""The Strand"" in his own bed and being quite aged. The movie would have us believe the suggested betrothal to the Duc d'Anjou (full name was actually Francois, Duc d'Alencon and Anjou)was called off because ""the duke"" was a cross-dresser (like lady's clothes) and perhaps bi-sexual. In reality, Elizabeth and Francois became great friends and spent much time conversing and writing letters to one another for over four years. Francois, the poor soul was deformed from an early illness and certainly ""not a catch"". Elizabeth had committed herself to being married to England and did not marry anyone.

Most of the movie revolves around the first few months or years of her reign and it is not even that good. There is a love interest and love story throughout the plot which I found rather dull after a while. Some actors were decent, while some of them were not that good. The writing is not bad, I especially liked the first 45 minutes of the movie, because it was captivating and interesting. After that 45 minutes, movie fell apart for me, I was not really interested until the end.What I liked about this movie was the detail of the scenes, the clothing and acting in a few places and the first hour's story.

But after Mary's death, Elizabeth is freed and crowned queen of England.As queen, Elizabeth is faced with the responsibility of settling the country's religious disputes, her goal being to return England to its former Protestant state.
