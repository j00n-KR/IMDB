0,nogodnomasters,How am I supposed to work?,10,22 March 2021,"This is a biopic of Billie Holiday. It starts shortly before her arrest for singing ""Strange Fruit"" and also that heroin thing. The government attempts to keep her in line after she spends a year in jail. Her life has mountainous highs and valley lows. It was a sad story but very timely in the opening of the George Floyd civil rights era. Worth the Oscar nomination.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Andra Day + extras)",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
1,lee_eisenberg,"the ""war on drugs"" is murder",10,7 April 2021,"Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers of all time. But many people don't know that she had a heroin problem, and that the US government targeted her. ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" focuses on this. As made clear, the government's persecution of Holiday was not about drugs; it was because she sang ""Strange Fruit"", about a lynching.Andra Day - nominated for an Academy Award - really gets into the role of Holiday, belting out the songs with full vigor, as well as showing Holiday's personal life. She gets ample support from the rest of the cast. But in the end, the important thing to take from the movie is the US government's persecution of Holiday for daring to expose the treatment of blacks in the US. Everyone needs to know this story.I hope to eventually see ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (also about Holiday).",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
2,evanston_dad,Did Learn Some Things,6,3 May 2021,"I did actually learn some things about Billie Holiday that I didn't know, namely that her song ""Strange Fruit"" was an anthem for racial injustice and that the FBI used drugs as an excuse to relentlessly pursue her so that they could arrest her and keep her from performing, thereby depriving her the opportunity to incite black audiences. That is the actually very intriguing kernel around which this biopic is structured, but it's diluted by the hot mess of this film's screenplay, that spends far too much time on Holiday's tumultuous relationships with various men in her life.One of those men is FBI agent Jimmy Fletcher, who's assigned the task of following Holiday around and catching her out. He's black himself, and is subjected to the racial hierarchy within the department, so over time his allegiances switch to Holiday and he becomes her ally. Again, this is actually an interesting parallel story. But again, it's also diluted by everything else going on in this muddled movie.Why, for example, is the character of Talullah Bankhead and the possible lesbian relationship she had with Holiday even in the film? That story is introduced and literally goes nowhere, as if whole sections of the movie were edited out at the last minute. And why do all the white FBI agents have to be played as caricature villains, as if we won't sympathize enough with the black people unless the white people are as cartoonishly awful as possible. And why does the screenplay feel the need to have characters just tell us what the movie's themes are without allowing us to come to conclusions ourselves? At one point, a black character tells the worst of the FBI agents that the department hates Holiday because she's black and beautiful and threatening (or words to that affect), to which my response was, ""well duh.""And there are ridiculous sex scenes and lots of scenes of people using drugs and getting beat up and yelling and fighting. None of this bothered me because of the content, but rather because it all just becomes monotonous and traffics in the most tired of biopic tropes.Andra Day gives an impressive performance that stands as probably the film's biggest asset. The Academy got it right when they nominated her for an Oscar but chose not to reward anything else about the movie.Grade: B-",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
3,blanbrn,Raw and bold music bio of a singing talent.,8,3 April 2021,"""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" is one historical and informative music bio in depth type look at a music legend that many did not remember and have forgot and that being one Billie Holiday(in a talented turn from Andra Day ""Rise Up""). The sounds and voice and message of Billie is well on display during the film all while she was to be tried and arrested for singing her signature song. Despite the voice, music, and talented messages Mrs. Holiday endured pain and pressure thru life. The time period spotlighted is Billie's fame height of the 1940's, who at the time was a target of the federal government for the performance of her song ""Strange Fruit"", a song that condemned lynching. Watching the film you feel the emotions and pressure while possible riots loam, and it's like one rides the journey of a civil rights march. All of this while Holiday battles her own demons of dismay while dealing with addiction as she gives the federal drug agents ammo against her before her early exit at age 44. Overall watch this historical music bio film as the work and talent of Andra Day is well on display.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
4,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021) 6.7/10,7,16 October 2021,"""It is inconceivable how evil FBI is depicted here, colluding with almost every man Billie goes to bed with to frame her for drug possession, the bureau, represented by Harry J. Anslinger (Hedlund, looking out of sorts), is an unbendingly racist entity defined only by this jejunely manifested evilness, which offsets any conviction in condemning drug abuse, in fact, when Jimmy turns his back on the bureau, the test of his loyalty to Holiday is to jack up himself. FBI may trail her every step of the way to lock her up, but it is undeniable the bane of her shortened life is narcotics, a point TUSvsBH doesn't care to state.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
5,Cineanalyst,Day Brightens Dull Biopic,4,26 February 2021,"The costumes and overall historical production design looks good, and Andra Day is great playing Billie Holiday, but otherwise ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" is a meandering, poorly-constructed biopic. That despite the reflexive framing of the story as a recorded interview that should've focused the narrative besides reflecting the audial sensation of Holiday's singing.Instead, we get a plot that often doesn't seem to be going anywhere besides from scene to scene of shooting up heroin, from concert to concert and abuse or sex scenes from man to man, with a hint of bisexuality. A wallowing, hot-mess portrait of Lady Day. All the while, cut occasionally to narcs planting evidence or saying something racist and inevitably being told off to presumed audience cheering. Even if the remembered scenes of Holiday's past as the black FBI agent follows her from a lynching through her upbringing in a brothel is almost effective, the montage covering again the aforementioned sort of scenes we've already seen several times in slight variations, plus some fight between two guys, certainly isn't. And to top it off there's that atonal, fourth-wall-breaking mid-credits scene after the requisite biopic text at the end to give us the Wikipedia headlines of what happened to the characters after the movie.Yet, Day is great, an actual singer who sings the part and in the imitated style of the character she's performing. Her reported weight loss and picking up of smoking and drinking for the part is some impressive dedication, too, even if she wisely didn't go to Nick Nolte levels of method acting in using heroin as he did for ""The Good Thief"" (2002). Day deserved better direction, the social commentary on civil rights deserved more than simplistic tropes, ""Strange Fruit"" better than ""Tigress and Tweed,"" and Holiday a more focused biographical picture.I'll have to check out ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (1972), which stars Diana Ross and also received awards attention, someday for comparison.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
6,cruise01,Uneven direction and very boring,4,2 March 2021,2 out of 5 stars.The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a bad biographical drama film about Billie Holiday (Andra Day) singing a song that was controversial towards the government about lynching. As she continues to rise with fame and battling through drug addiction.Boring direction. The script makes the characters feel uninspired. Especially Billie Holiday and her heroin addiction. Movie made her to be unlikable.Andra Day did decent with the character. But it is a slow moving direction that was all over the place. The rest of the cast is forgettable. It is brutal trying to sit through the film.,The United States vs. Billie Holiday

8,imseeg,A bit disappointing movie about one of the greatest ever female black singers.,6,5 May 2021,"Billie Holiday's voice was (and still is) unique. Her music was so sad and daunting, yet so beautiful.UNFORTUNATELY this movie about her life is lacking brilliance. It is not a bad movie, not at all, but it never delivers any real intense drama. This movie just meanders a bit without ever really shining bright.I would therefore not recommend this movie. Better put on an old record of Billie Holiday because her voice still is unsurpassed and magnificently chilling and SO gorgeous!The story: Billie Holiday is a black female blues singer who is targeted by the police for daring to expose racism in her popular songs.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
9,jtindahouse,Day shines in an otherwise flat and at times unpleasant film,5,29 March 2021,"Every year I watch all the Oscar contenders, including films which contain a nominated acting performance. I looked at the list this year and 'The United States vs. Billie Holiday' stood out clearly as being the one that interested me the least. I have never heard a Billie Holiday song before, the plot didn't sound very interesting and the IMDb rating was significantly lower than all the other films. Sometimes those films that you least expect to like are the ones that blow you away. Sadly that was not the case on this occasion. I didn't have much fun with this one at all.Andra Day has been nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards and it couldn't be more deserved. The fact she shines so brightly in a film that is so messy and dull only makes it that much better. I'm loving this trend lately of singers taking on acting roles and knocking it out of the park. Her singing was beautiful and she played the part perfectly, never skipping a scene. It wasn't a glamorous role, but she was willing to get dirty and gritty and I respect that.The films biggest problem is that it is just so dull. There is no tension or drama created. We are basically just told that this woman is a train-wreck - now watch her for two hours. That's not much fun. Also I understand that she was far from a perfect person, but when she's our lead character and she's this selfish and self-destructive it is almost impossible to side with her. I'm not sure what the better way would have been to go about making a film like this, but all I know is this version was pretty unpleasant to watch.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
10,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The United States v. Billie Holiday,7,7 March 2021,"7/10 - thanks in large part to an outstanding performance from Andra Day as Billie Holiday, this story that needs to be shared with the masses should receive lots of awards consideration",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
11,masonfisk,A WOMAN & HER SAD SONG...!,8,5 April 2021,"The latest from Lee Daniels (Precious/The Butler), a Hulu original, focuses on the trials & tribulations of legendary singer Billie Holiday. Her song 'Strange Fruit' (a song about lynching) becomes the lightning rod for the FBI's interest, seen in the guise of a leading agent, played by Garrett Hedlund, to keep pressure on her (busting her for drug use or not allowing her proper artist credentials so she couldn't perform in certain venues), meanwhile not being the most savvy of bedfellows she would shack up w/men who would invariably take advantage of her (some even setting her up w/the authorities) or causing controversy when she pursued a same sex affair w/actress Tallulah Bankhead, played by Natasha Lyonne. Focusing on one undercover agent's, played by Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes, efforts to trip her up, he eventually sees the investigation for what it is & even ends up falling in love w/her. Played by Andra Day, in a remarkable performance (I believe she did all her own singing), Holiday is every bit of diva she makes herself out to be but also just as vulnerable, not knowing where a paycheck would be coming from even though she was always constantly in demand all around the world. For me this is probably Daniels best effort (I haven't warmed up to his output as of late) where his concerns & potent subject matter become a winning combination. Partnered w/the recent Billie documentary, both of these efforts give us a solid foundation of a woman most would consider the greatest R & B artist who ever lived. Also starring Tyler James Williams (from Everybody Hates Chris) as a member of Holiday's band, Rob Morgan as one of Holiday's husbands, Leslie Jordan (from Will & Grace) as an interviewer & surprisingly good is Miss Lawrence (from the Real Housewives of Atlanta) as a member of Holiday's entourage.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
12,aidanratesmovies,Tonal misfire,5,15 March 2021,"Flashy with no brains, this overlong biopic about legendary singer Billie Holiday hardly has any of the sophistication or charm that her music is full of. It's beautiful to look at, and Andra Day gives a decent performance, but besides that the film is empty, dry, and predictable. Such a bland direction this film chose to go with for such an extraordinary story, plus the tone seems to be all over the place, never deciding what it wants to be or say.My Rating: 5/10",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
13,questl-18592,The US vs Pandering,3,31 March 2021,"Andra Day is solid in what is ultimately a wildly underwhelming story that should really be far more moving than it is. The United States vs Billie Holiday is a biopic that feels so recycled and stale it's hard to believe. Swap a few details around and you basically have ""Judy"" all over again, an underwhelming film about a misunderstood and victimized female musician with the only saving grace being in the performance of the titular lead. Judy is an underwhelming film and so was this. Where the US vs BH really falters though is in how aggressively it hammers away at all the same old points again and again.Throw in the constant blacksploitation thing, which is likely 100% accurate for the story and a subject that still deserves to be discussed but is delivered with all the emotional potency of of stale bread, makes this feel like such a try hard for Oscar season. I mean, it follows the recipe well enough of a period piece about a misunderstood genius struggling with substance abuse while delivering a movie carrying performance. It's the exact same thing that will give Gary Oldman attention in Mank, it's a formula that has worked it's just dull and overplayed. I want a Billie Holiday story with some soul, some fire, some passion and this is so not it.If you're looking for a generic, by the numbers, cookie cutter biopic that's clearly aiming for awards rather than actual quality then viola! There are a bunch of other options out there that are better, but I suppose this works for what it wants. There are so many better films though worth your time. Unless you're striving to watch the Oscar nom movies, give this one a pass because it's not worth the time.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
14,valleyjohn,A Brilliant leading performance,7,31 March 2021,"Up until now I'd never heard of Andra Day but I watched this because she has been nominated for an Oscar for her performance and I can say it's totally justified. It's a fantastic portrayal of Billie Holiday , it's just a shame that the film itself doesn't live up to her billing .This follows Billie Holiday's during her career as she is targeted by the Federal Department of Narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by black Federal Agent Jimmy Fletcher, with whom she had a an affair.I have a few problems with this film . Firstly it feels that Andra Days performance is a little wasted in movie that is so misguided.It feels like a stage play at times and that it's formulaic process where we go from singing , to drug taking to FBI involvement over and over again gets extremely boring .The acting around Andes Day is average at best . Travante Rhodes who plays Jimmy Fletcher is unconvincing and Garrett Hedlund who plays Harry Anslinger is even less so . His mumbling would put Tom Hardy to shame and because of its problems it's feels way too long yet it's only just over two hours .It's good to learn about Billie Holiday and how badly she was treated by the US and to listen to her music but while the actual portrayal does her justice , sadly the film doesn't.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

16,jadepietro,Day Break,8,28 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: A commanding Andra Day brings her star power to this good but flawed bio-pic.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Lee Daniel's The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a very flawed film that boast a very good performance in the title role. So let's start on a positive note with the magnificent film debut of singer Andra Day. It is phenomenal. Her bold and memorable turn as this talented vocalist conveys her tortured soul and her ability to self-destruct with agonizing details of physical abuse and graphic close-ups of injections. Booze and heroin are her downfall, and so is the willful mission by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to destroy this musical icon. It is indeed a story worth telling, but it is the telling of the story that becomes the film's downfall.Targeted by the government for promoting dissent with her signature song, Strange Fruit, a song that decries lynching, FBI agent Harry J. Anslinger (Garett Hedlund) wields his power to arrest Billie with trumped-up charges. He hires a Black agent, Jimmy Fletcher (Trevante Rhodes), to act as an informant and cozy up to the singer. The government's crusade against her prevents the singer from performing in various venues around the country and affects her livelihood.The screenplay by the gifted playwright Suzan-Lori Parks never gels, with some powerful scenes that linger and others that confuse. Too much dramatic license is used in the film's narrative. Characters are sketchy and so are many of the facts to this biography. Timelines are jumbled and motives and actions are vague at best. The non-linear storytelling needs better focus, not to mention, a more positive image for men's rights. Every male in this movie is evil or toxic.Mr. Daniel's direction remains solid, although he gives in to his own excesses too often. He successfully captures the period details of this era. The camera movement flows and transitions quite well, but every scene seems to be filmed with an exclamation point when a period would do fine. The quiet moments are few in this crushed life.However, whenever Ms. Day is onscreen, which is often, she shines. Her concert scenes provide enough of the heartbreak. Ms. Day's singing inflections and vocal range mimic the legendary Lady D to a T. It is a magnificent performance to behold. And her acting proves to be on that same par. Giving her fine support is Da'Vine Joy Randolph as her best girlfriend, but the actress is given little to do. Casting by other cast members is uneven, mostly due to the underdeveloped characters that surround the singer's orbit. As her (fictional) lover, Mr. Rhodes is never convincing in his role and Mr. Hedlund, while good, is given a racist and one-note villain to play. Even more off are the campy interpretations of real life figures Tallulah Bankhead and a Quentin Crisp wannabe called Reginald Lord Divine that seriously hinder the authenticity of the movie. Natasha Lyonne downplays her role into nothingness while Leslie Jordan overplays his dance card here. Both actors have done better work.The United States vs. Billie Holiday is another flawed opportunity to do justice to its legendary performer. Though earnest in its intentions, and finding the perfect actress for this breakout role, the film never makes a totally compelling case. It's good, with many riveting scenes, the sum of its parts don't make a sustainable whole. With a more concise narrative, this movie could have been great. Nevertheless, moviegoers should take in the both Ms. Days, the tragic Lady Day and the glorious Ms. Andra Day. (GRADE: B)",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
17,Terryfan,A movie where seeing isBelieving,7,14 October 2021,"I had first heard of Billie Holiday when I was in school General Music and we learn about ""Strange Fruit"" her controversial song. Needless to say I never forgotten my experience listening to the song
Also a friend got to be a extra in the movie so he told me what it was like on set of the movie
The United States Vs. Billie Holiday is a movie biography on Billie Holiday's battle to get her song out there only for a team of agents to try and stop her.Andra Day delivered a strong performance as Billie Holiday each time she is on the screen she don't have nothing holding her back.However one thing that I feel the overdue of sex scenes really does take away the movie as there are too many sex scenes.The movie also shows how drugs and personal demons are dangerous as the movie shows Billie's drug addiction was strong. There is a lot of drug use in the movie.But that can't stop you from watching the movie as it is emotional driven with a lot of sad moments and moments where you have to hold back with some of the most depressing scenes in the history of
Motion Pictures.If you like to watch a movie about Billie Holiday then this one is going to keep your attention.I give The United States Vs. Billie Holiday a 7 out of 10.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
18,bankofmarquis,Great Central Performance...Scattered Mess of a Movie,6,17 April 2021,"Lee Daniels is a passionate filmmaker and his passion for bringing the story of Billie Holiday to the screen as the embodiment of the African American struggle against White Officials who are trying to mute her is evident in every frame of THE UNITED STATES VS. BILLIE HOLIDAY.Unfortunately, he tries to do so much with this film, that he accomplishes very little.Let's start with what works in this film: the TERRIFIC performance of Andra Day as the titular character. Day embodies the troubled artist strongly and she does all of the singing of this world renowned performer. It is a superb performance and she rightfully deserves her Oscar nomination.What doesn't work? Pretty much the rest of the film.Daniels has so much material to work with - and a terrific actress at the center of it - that he tried to cram EVERYTHING into this film, consequently, the film is scattered and doesn't know what it wants to be.Is it a biopic? A look at an artist who overcame a horrific childhood? A look at an artist that is battling demons? A look at an artist that has toxic relationships with men? Or...is it about the United States Government trying to suppress free speech in order to keep the African American from rising up in the 1950's?The answer is...it is all of that...and none of that. Just when you think the film has it's footing in one direction, it pivots in another and rarely gets back to tie off the other.For example, look at the title of the film - THE UNITED STATES VS. BILLIE HOLIDAY. So, it must be about the United States (in this instance, the Federal Drug Agents) trying to bring Billie Holiday to justice. And...at the beginning it IS about that...namely in the guise of stopping her from singing STRANGE FRUIT and trying to frame her for her drug use. So...you would think that the film will, eventually, get Holiday on stage to sing a triumphant FULL version of Strange Fruit.You would think that, wouldn't you.Now...to be fair to Daniels and this film, there is about a 15 minute portion of this film in the middle that shows Holiday's heartbreaking childhood, followed by a haunting song sung by Day. It is a very effective portion of the film, and that (and Day's performance) are worth wading through the ""highlights and lowlights"" of Holiday's life that is the rest of this film.I have not seen the lauded 1972 LADY SINGS THE BLUES that is a more straightforward Bio-pic of the singer (starring Diana Ross), after watching this film, I think I will.Letter Grade: B- (because of Day's performance and that 15 minute segment)6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
19,tm-sheehan,Worthy of an Academy Award for Andra Davis,8,21 March 2021,"My Review - The United States vs Billie Holiday
My Rating - 8/10There are some fantastic Academy Award performances this year 5 great Actresses and I've now seen four of them Frances McDormand in Nomadland , Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman , Viola Davis in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and now Andra Davis in The United States vs Billie Holliday . I've yet to see Vanessa Kirby in Pieces of a Woman but intend to watch her movie today.
I must say up until today my favourite nominated performance by an Actress in a film is Carey Mulligan but today I've changed my mind because Andra Davis is mesmerising as Billie Holiday.
Almost 50 years after Diana Ross earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Billie Holiday in 1972's ""Lady Sings the Blues"" this new film that centres around the origin of the song that Billie Holiday sang titled ""Strange Fruit."" which is now included in the Top 100 American songs list.
Harry Anslinger a known racist ,played in the movie so well by Garrett Hedland forbids Billie Holiday to perform ""Strange Fruit,"" because he didn't want it's painful message of racial hate to be heard by Billie's audiences.
Of course Billie refuses causing him to devise a plan to destroy her. Knowing that Holiday was a drug user. He assigns Federal Bureau of Narcotics, federal agent Jimmy Fletcher ( Trevante Rhodes) to bust her for heroin possession and he ends up falling for her.
Billie Holiday popularised the song ""Strange Fruit"" and turned it into a work of art, but it was a Jewish communist teacher and civil rights activist from the Bronx, Abel Meeropol, who wrote it, first as a poem, then later as a song.
Abel Meeropol's inspiration for the song from a 1930 photo that captured the lynching of two Black men in Indiana. The visceral image haunted him for days and prompted him to put pen to paper.
The Star of the 1972 movie about Billie Holliday ""Lady Sings the Blues ""Diana Ross's son Evan Ross plays a federal agent in Lee Daniels' new movie about the late singer. his mom, Diana Ross, earned an Oscar nom for her portrayal of Billie Holiday she lost that year to Liza Minneli in Cabaret.
Now, Evan says his mother approves of the latest telling of the Holiday story.
""She loves Lee, and she thought it was cinematically amazing. She thought the performances were amazing.""
Everything you see and hear in the movie is 100% Andra Davis who sings many Billie's classic songs herself . The closing song a full performance of ""Strange Fruit"" is one of those moments like Barbra Streisand singing My Man in ""Funny Girl ""that I thought ,yes ! that is a performance that could win you an Oscar ,so much feeling and emotional output.
Andra's preparation for this taxing role including smoking, drinking, and screaming which gave her voice the ""gravel and grit"" that the blues singer was known for. ""Anything I'd do to take care of my voice as a singer, I did the opposite,"" she said.
One of the most interesting plot lines concerning Billie Holliday that I wasn't aware of in ""Lady Sings the Blues ""was Billie's bi sexuality and her long affair with Tallulah Bankhead played in this film by Natasha Leon.
My film companion and I discussed the similarities between Bessie Smith . Ma Rainey , Billie and also Judy Garland.
All these great singers had violent and abusive relationships with men that held power over ""their""women and used them as a meal ticket and to boost their ego.
So why wouldn't they look for affection and gentleness in their women friends who just valued them for themselves.
The second great similarity was that all these women were addicts and died in their 40's except Ma Rainey who lived a little longer at 53 years old , they all burnt out far too early leaving their legacy of music behind them for audiences to enjoy.
The intimate friendship between dissolute husky-voiced first lady of the American stage Tallulah Bankhead (1902-1968) and the great doomed jazz chanteuse Billie Holiday (1915-1959) spanned at least two decades - from the golden age of 1930s Harlem cafe society until the mid-1950. In 1948, Tallulah Bankhead used to watch Holiday's closing set every night of her run performing with Count Basie. She also accompanied Holiday on her own tours whenever she could.
""Tally and Lady were like sisters,"" as one observer put it. Fierce, stylish sisters with a tinge of incest, apparently.
Stories of Judy Garland frequenting female partners are perhaps more than fanciful Hollywood recitals; most famously, she was linked to Betty Asher, an MGM publicity worker and close friend of the starlet.
Betty Asher, to become Judy's confidante, her bosom buddy, and to steer her away from Artie Shaw. Betty did much more than that. She became Judy's lover as well (and Shaw's, too, for that matter).
I love both the Billy Holiday films Lady Sings the Blues and The United States vs Billie Holliday but I think if I was awarding an Oscar for the most honest and convincing portrayal of who many still say was the Worlds greatest jazz artist I would pick Andre Davis and I wish her luck this year ,I'd be also very happy to see Carey Mulligan win for Promising Young Woman.
The great costumes by Paolo Nieddu make up ,set decoration and production excellence in The United States vs Billie Holliday are obvious from the opening titles Lee Daniels has directed a fine film.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
20,Alexander_Blanchett,A dry Loveletter to Billie Holiday,6,2 March 2021,"The film was solid at best. It is very inconsistent and often dry. The directional skills of Lee Daniels are definitely visible because there were some great creative ways he put scenes or mid-scenes in place but the film lacks on the storyteller side. I am not sure if it was the screenplay or that Daniels was more intersted in style. What stands out is without any doubt the performance of Andra Day. And that is also where Lee Daniels triumphs - in his loveletter to Billie Holiday because there is no doubt he perfectly put the character and Andra Day in scene. Day's (basically) debut performance is really astonishing. She puts a lot of strenghts and emotion into that role. Making it raw but loveable. Making it real. The film kind of reminds me on Le Vie en Rose when a solid - to weak - film showcasts a fantastic performance.
Besides Day there is also Trevante Rhodes who finally gets ar role again. A very underrated actor who deserves much more roles and acclaim.
The soundtrack is great and the cinematography beautiful. Its sad because the film surely had a great story to tell, but didnt really know how to tell it, to make it constantly intersting for the viewer. Watch it for Day.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

It's not a terrible screenplay as I've heard from some critics and didn't bore me for even a minute.

Director: Lee Daniels
Starring: Andra Day, Trevante Rhodes, Garrett Hedlund, Natasha Lyonne, Leslie Jordan, Miss Lawrence, etcOverall rating 67/100The united states vs Billie Holliday is about the legendary singer Billie Holliday (Andra Day), as we follow her career as she is targeted by the federal department of narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by black federal agent Jimmy Fletcher (Trevante Rhodes), with whom she has a tumultuous affair with. I have very mixed feeling on this film, there was some excellent moments but also an equal amount of frustratingly poor moments. Let's get started.My first few positives would be the powerful beginning, how likeable Billie was and the fantastic performances, the conflict being well set up with the government, as well as the great soundtrack. I thought that the beginning was really powerful and linked well with the message of the film and connected with billie really well, it was heart-breaking to see the poor judgement of people with colour and the barbaric behaviour of lynching's was awful, but it set up the tone and themes of the film really well and signified the importance of Billie as a person with her song strange fruit. I also thought that Billie Holliday was a very likeable person, despite being very flawed to the point of over dramatization in places (more on that in a future paragraph) Billie was unapolagetically herself, didn't take no crap from anyone and was an important symbol in the fight for racial equality, and when she was told to keep her mouth shut she did the complete opposite. I also have to praise Andra Day for her absolutely incredible performance, she was the best part of the film and completely deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was powerful, moving and charming and she bought Billie Holliday to life in such an incredible way and she stole every scene she was in I honestly couldn't keep my eyes off her. I also thought the conflict between Billie and the government was excellently done. When Billie was in her prime in the 40's and 50's there was unfortunately a lot of racial inequality still so therefore the government wanted her gone as she represented a change that they didn't want to see, It was horrifying to see them do everything in their power to get Billie arrested and target her, effecting her mental health in a very negative way, which also triggered some good conflict with Billie and her friends as she began to spiral out of control, you couldn't help but sympathise with her in parts. Finally, I also thought the soundtrack was excellent, Billie was an incredible artist, her voice was haunting, and her songs had so much power and meaning and represented a change in racial equality with strange fruit being a powerful song that was sung beautifully.My next few positives would be the strong dialogue, fantastic cinematography. As well as great character development and depth. I thought that the movie did an absolutely excellent job with its dialogue, it had some very moving lines that bought the character of Billie to life so well conveying her snappy and care free attitude well, as well as building tension and conflict effectively highlighting how white people talked down to and treated black people in the 40's. I also thought the cinematography was excellent, there was some really great set pieces and creative shots. I also really liked the creative blending of the black and white and found footage of Billie with the film I thought that was a really nice creative touch. I thought that the movie also had excellent character depth, Billie was a troubled soul and the more you learned about the more you understood why she turned to alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism, her disturbing childhood, not feeling good enough or welcome anywhere, and her being constantly targeted by the government took a really negative toll on her and she used alcohol and drugs to take the pain and negative thoughts away, this was really moving especially in the second half of the move and as her character developed we began to understand her and her struggles.My first few negatives would be the lack of set up or explanation to certain characters, some unneeded scenes, an occasional emotional disconnect to the plot and characters and the odd characterisation of Billie. I thought the movie oddly set up a lot of characters with a lack of set up or explanation into who they actually were, this made the pacing very clunky, because it was often very confusing who the characters were, and it too often felt the film was just expecting you to know who the people were so just skipped straight into them being in a relationship with Billie for months. I also felt like there was a lot of unneeded scenes that just felt too much like filler, there was scenes that could of simply been cut as they served no purpose to the overall message of the film particular examples would have to be the funeral of Billie's dog and certain scenes with Billie's and fans. For me there was an occasional emotional disconnect to the film especially in the first half, it felt like the movie was undecided on how to depict Billie as a person. One minute the movie was aligning you with her and her cause, the next the movie almost turned against her making Billie seem horrible, cruel and a burden to her community with certain characters attacking her about her issues and forgetting the impact she had. This just felt like very odd and inconsistent characterisation for me and I struggled to connect with the film, this became more focused for her character in the second half but they still felt a bit divided on how people should see her.My final few positives would be the chemistry between the cast, the powerful themes on racism and emotional weight, the excellent building of tension and the powerful ending. I thought the whole cast had excellent chemistry with Andra Day and they bounced off each other really well, all of their friendships were fun and believable and gave the movie some much needed light hearted humour. I thought the movie tackled its themes on racism excellently, it really went into great depths in the divide of races and how black people were treated, and even when they were in the police like Jimmy was they were still being manipulated for their own gain. This made the movie had a lot of emotional weight as it was truly horrifying to watch the actions people took just because of a difference in skin colour, it was executed authentically and powerfully, and Billie's spiral into ill health was also very well done and emotional, as she never lost who she was, and her legacy still remained. I also thought the movie-built tension really well for a hard-hitting final act. As the allegations and attacks against Billie got bigger and bigger, I genuinely didn't know what was going to happen to her and the negative impact it had on her health, it was heart-breaking to watch but also powerfully done, with a had hitting ending that stayed true to who Billie was as a person and had important messages on racism and linking to the modern day as well.My final few negatives would be the lack of sympathy to characters due to the glorifying of drugs, the clunky structure and pacing issues. I thought that the film made it fairly hard to connect to Billie and the other characters and to sympathise with them, especially in the first half, the movie didn't really portray drugs as a bad thing or the cause of billie's declining health instead it was portrayed more casually and was obsessively used in normal situations with friends, this for me creates a bit of a lack of connection to the people involved, it happened too often and could have been handled much better. I also thought that the movie had an extremely clunky structure and really bad pacing issues, the movie felt very episodic and just felt like a series of big events in her life. There was nothing in between and the film often cut into scenes that we didn't have a clue what was happening, or spoon feeding us information in the dialogue that we could of seen for set up and context. This made the whole film feel very clunky and rush and was fairly poorly structured.Overall, despite a truly Oscar worthy performance from Andra Day, bringing Billie Holiday to life in a fascinating character study, and the film hitting all of the right notes with its themes on racism. It far to often gets trapped in its clunky structure, misguided characterisation of Billie and occasional bad handling of some deeper themes, that the film often looses itself and its authenticity, therefore making it not as strong as previous biopics.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

As a film, it's not terrible, but as it goes along it slowly gets worse as it is quite poorly directed with a most uncinematic and clunky ending. But, and it's a big but, as has been mentioned by many, Andra Day is a revelation in the role. Her performance is bold and excellent and her singing is positively awesome. She makes some of this stodgy & poorly written stuff much more interesting than it should be. I know FBI Agent Jimmy Fletcher existed, but I haven't any idea if she was romantically involved with him, but he's written here as the love of her life which is somewhat doubtful. He's played charmingly by Trevante Rhodes of Moonlight fame. There are some other good smaller performances in the film, but Leslie Jordan isn't one of them. He gives a terrible performance in what I assume is a fictional character. But it is Day who carries this film from beginning to end and she is truly superb.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

I feel like that is what the filmmakers did too. It was insanity surface level.I think I wanted to know more about Billie's life as a person and what she was like. It was just like ""oh how sad is this!! Look how sad. She is just sad"". I can appreciate that because it is a sad story but I think it would have been nice to have peeks and valleys just so it wouldn't have been so one note. Billie seems like a fabulous person and there is so much more to her than just sad.I do think that it handled everything really respectfully and it wasn't scared about showing anything. Some of the scenes are extremely harrowing and upsetting.Andrea Day was fantastic though. She really had this sadness behind her performance. It was fantastic and definitely the best part of the movie.I think that it could have been trimmed down as well.

The first 40 minutes gave the impression that this movie has nothing substantive to offer, and with each passing minute thereon, you're left proven right.This doesn't mean that there aren't anything good about this movie, because there is Andra Day; whose portrayal of the famed Jazz Singer is very easily one of the best performances of the year.

33,ozjosh03,Lady Day vs Fake History,4,5 March 2021,"Lady Day deserves much better than this muddled, often tedious and substantially apocryphal ""biopic"" from Lee Daniels. In this telling of Billie Holiday's life the song Strange Fruit becomes central to the narrative, with government forces determined to stop her singing the mournful lament, afraid that it will ignite a civil rights movement. At one point she's even dragged from the stage after singing just the first few lines. The problem with all of this is it never happened. Federal Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger apparently claimed in letters that he ""asked"" holiday not to sing the song, but - even if that's true - that's about as far as it went. Holiday was never dragged off stage for singing the song; in fact, she sang the song in the very concert in which the film depicts this as happening. In any case, the civil rights movement was already a growing force long before Strange Fruit became a popular protest song. As for Billie, she was never especially political and was initially ambivalent about performing Strange Fruit. She was convinced more by the way it would be dramatically staged as a final number than by any notions about the political clout of the lyrics. So to make the song central to her life and have Billie so passionate about performing it any cost is in itself dishonest. But then so much of Daniels' film, from the weird Quentin Crisp-like Reginald Lord Divine character who interviews Billie (he never existed) to the romantic affair with FBI agent Jimmy Fletcher, for which there is zero evidence. At best the film offers brief glimpses into the reality of Billie's life, but they're so swamped with apocrypha that you'll have trouble identifying them. Which makes this a pretty messed up biopic, and an extremely half-assed tribute to the great singer. The only saving grace in all of this is Andra Day, who manages to look and sound like Billie for the most part. But even here there are caveats. Day's performances of Holiday's songs are more impressive as vocal impressions than they are for evoking the emotion and pathos that made Billie legendary. And, sad to say, her rendition of Strange Fruit is oddly stilted, almost bland. Not to mention severely truncated. Never mind that this is the song the entire film revolves around. Strange, indeed.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
34,stefstars,Andra Day Can't Carry The Whole Movie,4,3 March 2021,"It's unfortunate because some of my absolute favorite people in the industry worked on this film; Natasha Lyonne, Salaam Remi, Leslie Jordan. This movie was a hard watch, not because of the content but because it managed to make something that was interesting in real life, uninteresting. Another case of a story being brought to the big screen by the wrong hands. The film moves all over the place, it can't make up it's mind on what story it's trying to tell. We start off by seeing Billie Holiday (Andra Day) starting an interview with a gossipy southern radio host played by Leslie Jordan. I figured that would be the format the film would continue on with; everything she tells the interviewer gets shown on the screen as the film goes along. Needless to say, that's not what happened. The interview comes back here and there but it's not going in the order of what's happening.A lot of the scenes are tailored to show Andra Day's talents, the story gets lost in their focus to show her acting and singing chops. It worked, as she won the Golden Globe in the end, but in that case the film should have just been called ""Andra Day as Billie Holiday."" She's a good actress though and great singer, but I'm unsure if she truly caught Billie Holiday. Looks like she tapped into the idea of who we think Billie Holiday was rather than who the actual woman was. That's not her fault though, that's traced back to the directing and writing.As mentioned before, the movie can't pick what it wants to focus on. The movie is not exactly a biopic, it was supposed to focus on the U.S. Government's incessant attack on Billie Holiday due to her song ""Strange Fruit."" However, somewhere towards the end, the movie decides that it wants to be a biopic - showing her childhood, her first time trying heroin. It's done in vignettes, but it was one of many things in this film that felt unnecessary. The audience understands what the song ""Strange Fruit"" is about from the start of the film, but they really want to bring the point home with those vignette scenes. The poor dialogue doesn't help either, a lot of it is expositiony. I guess to put it best, the film doesn't trust its audience is smart enough to know what's going on so they have the characters tell you.There's a lot of singing scenes, which is a given since it's a Billie Holiday film, but they go on to the point that they're almost like music videos. There's a lot of sex and shooting up scenes than necessary. Some scenes happen that aren't relevant to the story happen as well. I can't stress enough how messy this film is, it got tangled up in its own hype. By that I mean, you can tell the director thought he had created some unapologetically raw masterpiece but he was so caught up in his own self grandeur that the movie got lost.Maybe someday we'll get a proper film about Billie Holiday, sadly this one is not it. I recommend it solely to see Andra Day's performance because in the end, that's the only thing the film focused on and that's all it has to offer.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
35,madanmarwah,A good biopic on a jazz singer,7,29 April 2021,"The Life of jazz singer Billie Holiday brought to life through an impressive performance by Andra Day.

Till her death she took a defiant stand and refused to cow down to FBI agents.The film is made well and Andra Day carries it splendidly on her shoulders. Her acting also improves as the film develops and the ending scenes see her emoting superbly.Lee Daniels's direction is admirable. He has captured the atmosphere well but his big achievement is in getting Andra Day to do a fabulous job.

38,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Go On Tour With Billie Holiday And Accomplices,6,1 March 2021,"Right back at ya, Streamers, and Black History Month is closing out with a bang. This weekend The United States vs. Billie Holiday premiered on Hulu. It is a sweet fruit that has ripened for viewing pleasure. Let's see what this film has for you.This prospective awards season darling follows Holiday, played by Andra Day, during her career as she is targeted by the Federal Department of Narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by a black Federal Agent Jimmy Fletcher, Trevante Rhodes, with whom she has a tumultuous affair. (If you want the full facts of this historical depiction, please check the link below the rating.) Nevertheless, how may times can we say in a review your skinfolk ain't always your kinfolk, but your skinfolk just trying to survive and thrive, too! More than that though, the film depicts struggle, love, addiction, talent, the power of words and the damage of drugs and unhealthy relationships. Many of us know the name Billie Holiday but have no clue who she was as a person. This movie brings some insight into what may have plagued her, but I can't say it does her quite justice. A beautiful person can really be such a damaged piece of artwork and, boy, does Andra Day gives us all of that. Her performance is probably the sole reason to really turn this flick on. Nominated for a Golden Globe award and I presume an Academy Award nomination is in her future as well, Day gives us everything. Can I say this is how Billie was? I have no clue, but now I can't go back. Some might say this is too much but without Day's performance this movie would be nothing. The rest of the cast is forgettable, but I will say they did have me cracking up here and there. I don't know whether that was intentional or unintentional, but who cares.What I think the movie misses is the real in-depth or historical facts about the actual case. Lee Daniels is such a strong director of acting, but somewhere in the mystic of Andra's performance he forgot to make the film cohesive. The title of this film is really taken for granted. In fact, the title isn't even necessary because the case really takes a backseat to all of what's really going on with Billie Holiday. The title is powerful and will pull people in to watch, but the execution of plot and storyline was the pits. You know what wasn't the pits, the wardrobe in this movie. When I say top notch, I mean top notch. A few scenes had me saying singers and celebs could never look this good today, forgetting this movie was literally filmed in current times. Hint: you celebs need to get whoever this wardrobe team is and hire them ASAP. I mean I don't want to harp on this point but dang Billie and cast were out here slaying it in every dang screen. EXCEPT ONE DANG-ON WIG ON THIS DUDE'S HEAD!!! You'll see it and it can't be unseen, but I digress.The United States vs. Billie Holiday feels like a missed opportunity to really do justice to ""the voice of the century"". Andra Day's performance is one for the decades, but the film as a whole is one that can be forgotten. I'd be remiss to say the film itself is just a handful of popcorn without noting that Andra Day as Billie Holiday is the biggest box of popcorn. Check it out for her performance alone but be prepared to be underwhelmed by the rest.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

I cannot speak for the accuracy of the events but I have to believe that, dramatized events aside, the story has some essence and faithfulness to her life, what I can speak however is the amazing acting by Andra Day, I mean she fills he whole screen, it's a powerful and visceral performance I dare to say the most likely best of this year Oscars for the best lead female price.This associated with the important underlying anti racism message makes the movie for me, again I fully agree that it's a bit all over the place and the director tries to focus on a lot at the same time losing sight of the movie's goal, but I've seen way worse editing and also way worse biopics with no soul or amazing acting like this one so props to Andra for carrying this one!",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
42,caramia2002,"Better to Watch ""Lady Sings the Blues""",3,26 February 2021,"Which is scant praise indeed, as that Billie Holiday biopic was mostly a Diana Ross vehicle complete with cover tunes. And while she gave an enjoyable, Oscar nominated performance, the film really sold Holiday, and especially her music, short. It should be noted that most of the lyrics of Strange Fruit were omitted. So much so that I didn't even 'get' that song when watching the film upon its release.But this film puts Strange Fruit right, although it takes an agonizing hour and a half to hear it. But it does little else right. It's a huge, huge disappointment. Within the first 5 minutes we have terrible acting (Jimmy's mom, clearly dubbed), a very kludgey script, and lots and lots of ho-hum-ness. Hard to believe that this was directed by the same person who did The Butler and Empire.It seems as if the director was trying to make a highly stylized, tongue in cheek film about Holiday's legal and political problems, and thus a less than obvious statement about America's sketchy racial past. Instead, it's too obvious, gratuitously anachronistic, as if only to please modern (young) audiences, and otherwise useless. With two, count 'em, two, big budget, high profile biopics about Holiday, you'd think one could get her right, esp this one, with the benefit of hindsight help from the first film.Andra Day is fine as an elegant Holiday, and my few stars are for her and some of the other cast. The sets and costumes are great, if much out of time. Day's gowns are real eye candy, for sure, and Day is stunning, from her perfect hair down to her perfect shoes. Unfortunately, none of this makes the plodding, clumsy, retread rote grade school wokeness (and I'm usually all about woke, but can't we have a smart, grown up approach?) of this film worth it.

As other have noted, it makes this unwatchable (I started to fast-forward about 90 minutes in).The production itself - despite its voyeuristic obsession with sex and violence - looks like it came from Disney. I feel disgusted to use this word, but it has been whitewashed beyond comprehension.Andra Day gives a credible performance and does an decent imitation of Holiday's voice, but it's all technique and no soul.I can speak with some authority on the disarray of her life: for 12 years I worked for the record company which owns the rights to a huge amount of her prime recordings, and the first that issued a 10-CD box when digital technology was new.

First of all, it's a biopic not a biography, if you don't know anything about the life of an artist watch a documentary first or read a book. Although going through the movie they feed you enough information about what happened to her in the past and even the future, so the storyline ""an sich"" is strong enough.The acting was very good and the production team was really able to catch that eerie atmosphere not only surrounding Billie, but coming from Billie herself too, without making it a dark alternative movie.

53,Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,Historical recreation with no dramatic structure,6,6 May 2021,"Jazz singer Billie Holliday struggles with addiction to heroin and men while being persistently harassed by the FBI for racist reasons.A spectacularly impressive recreation of a historical milieu, with settings, costumes, make-up, ways of speaking and cultural attitudes supremely realistic and immersive. Every scene is a magnificently composed world, but together they form no cohesive narrative, no complex thematic expression apart from a recreation in popular form of a racist history, and no interesting trajectory for a complex, inspirational, talented woman apart from self-destruction and degeneration. There is no depth, no overarching motivation, no transformation, just a pain explained in flashbacks of trauma. Like her controversial song ""Strange Fruit"", the painful and shameful recent history of racist America is being revealed, but is Holliday's strength and talent and legacy being honoured, is her story being given the depth it deserves? Andra Day's performance is the same, extremely impressive on the surface, powerfully lucid within an individual scene, but no dramatic shape. Perhaps the screenplay is to blame. It amounts to a glossy surface and no heart.The film's political theme is clear: lynchings have not yet been banned, even if her song about them was. But the more intimate theme is perhaps akin to Asif Kapadia's powerful documentary Amy: that we, from our distance, though the veil of the media, have some empathy and patience for the particular and real challenges faced by those who pour themselves into music for us.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
54,bobbiekostos,Sad but captivating...a must watch!,10,27 February 2021,"Where did Andra Day pop up and end up being an actress to watch?! She did such a phenomenal Billie Holiday and is an incredible actress. All of the cast were perfect and each one represented their characters with such finesse. Trevante Rhodes is another fine actor to watch bloom. Of course, the music was the pinnacle of excellence. Although slow in spots, all in all totally well done and entertaining. Bravo!",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
55,robnero,A mix of Rhythm and Biography,8,15 April 2021,"The movie hits on the cornerstones of Billie's life. The message and force her song Strange Fruit is the road it drives. There are some creative choices artfully done to get the viewer from chapter to chapter. With fictional elaboration on some things, we do get the ""heart"" of the expression. Some viewers just want the dry facts. This movie offers more than that. If you just roll with it without demanding less, you'll see a creative expression.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

While I am no hard-core fan of Billie Holiday, I did know a little bit about her so that was why I chose to watch this. I gotta say I wasn't disappointed at all watching this. It talks about her drug life and her life during the time she sang a certain song about the slaughtering of black people at the time. Tbh this movie really didn't not feel like a Hulu movie, it felt more like a movie that could come out in theaters but couldn't obviously due to the Covid pandemic.

The US vs. Billie Holiday really makes you frustrated in all the right ways and at all the right people but also inspires people like me who didn't know much about this history to learn more and educate oneself since those who don't learn from history...anyway...Andra Day gives an incredible performance and Trevante Rhodes balances the line of someone you want to smack in the face one second and kiss the next. Impeccable gowns and hairstyling add to the glamor and realism of the music being sung so beautifully by her swingin, emotional voice. Day expresses a lot in those eyes tender one minute and giving diva the next. Maybe it's not perfect from a filmmaking point of view but not in any innegligible way and the image of Andra Day screaming with joy and pride in her Golden Globe acceptance speech is enough to make me feel good inside knowing she gave this her all and that her idol would be proud.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

Those are simply shoes too big to fill.I liked that Director Lee exposed this little known story of Billie's trials and tribulations with the federal government, but the script could have been more polished. There were too many montage sequences in my opinion that took away from the film. The content examined in this version was too risky for the previous Berry Gordy production at that time.

You can feel the joy when she sings and performance, but also the sadness and pain of her past. She is without a doubt the best thing that comes out of this movie. Also, the soundtrack is amazing to listen to. I am a big fan of old jazz music, so it was a joy to watch these songs be performed. They did overuse the music a bit because some scenes became depended on the song that was playing. The big problem with this movie is the execution of the story. Everything was in place for this movie to be something special, but it's just very messy. You know some scenes are very imported, but you don't get that feeling because there aren't set up right. The storyline of Jimmy Fletcher is also very interesting, but very poorly executed. It just doesn't feel right. I doesn't have a consisted tone and feels all over the place. Even tho it wraps up the story nicely, you just feel disappointed at the end. I just keep thinking what could have been and that's never a good thing.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

61,syd9907,The 5 Stars are ONLY for Andra Day's Performance,5,27 February 2021,"I watched ""The United States vs Billie Holiday"" on Hulu, and this film literally left me drained. Andra Day nails her portrayal of Billie Holiday. She is sensational. But this film showcases what happens when a great performance ends up in an absolutely awful film.The only time The United States vs Billie Holiday comes to life is when Andra Day is on-screen. She took trite dialogue and made it magic. And her version of Billie Holiday's songs were powerful, but when she sang ""Strange Fruit"", it gave me chills.This biopic about the last years in Holiday's life, and how the authorities pursued and harassed her just because she refused to stop singing ""Strange Fruit"", is as average as it is lethargic. There is no real direction and Lee Daniels got lost and never found his way out of the weeds. There was no tension, no reason to be invested in any of these characters except Billie Holiday, and that was fully due to Andra Day. Then you had a way over-the-top dog's funeral, Roy Cohn ( Senator Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel) and an insinuated lesbian relationship between Holiday and actress Tallulah Bankhead. Who knows if they had a thing....this film was splintering off in every direction imaginable, and it never found its center.This was an ambitious film that never fulfilled its potential. Though Daniels has found his his niche in some areas, but this is not that niche. A truly skilled director and writer could have made a masterpiece, but Daniels and Suzan-Lori Parks, who wrote this schlock, never made the story and vision they had in their heads come to life, and that's a pity because the subject matter was there. I sincerely hope that Day wins an award for her performance, because she deserves it for making sweet tasting lemonade out of a hot mess of a film.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

There was one scene where as a young girl her prostitute mother sends her away, and something can be inferred from this, but it's not enough.

First let me take my hat off to the casting it was outstanding starting with Andra Day performance which nothing short of a showstopping in her portrayal of the late great singer Billie Holiday hands down one of the best if not the best performance this year and we have had some great ones by some newcomers.

I've seen ""Judas and The Black Messiah"", ""Trial of the Chicago 7"", ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"", and BBC's ""Small Axe"", over the past months, and I started watching this movie expecting the same racial inequality gut-punch. I got none of that.I mean, yes, the film does portray the racial inequality and dicrimination that Bille Holiday suffered, but it made no attempt to explain it, it didn't broaden the fight for civil liberties that Billy was a part of. It just made the whole thing about the song.And the problem with drug addiction was also just portrayed as an artist kind of thing. They missed a gigantic opportunity to talk about the connection between racial inequality and drug use.Andra Day, congratulations. The main actress duly deserves her nomination, but the entire movie just falls flat for me.

I did read that it picked up right as she went into prison for ""narcotics use"". I know previous movies went in and explained her start but this was about why she was the way she was, how she was the voice of her people, American people who were being burned and lynched. The. Government couldn't blame her for singing but they could for drugs so it's the suppression of making a statement but wrapped in a blanket rule breaking when it was blatant racism. I will say it starts slow and if you don't know her life you are getting an eyes wide view of a ""junkie"" but quickly escalates and you can see that sang people paid attention. Spoiler alert here: I watch horror movies and so in that context not much makes me jump but the scene when Billie stumbles onto a family whose house was burned and children crying because their parent was lynched, just watching as the words ""justice served"" shocked me. I still feel stunned and the feeling she felt and why she was the way she was just made sense why she pushed through and sang her song. What's more horrific is that anti-lynching laws have never passed congress to this day . You just feel like you know her through song and Andra Day did a terrific job conveying a story who lived a tragic life but left a piece of her soul through her music. Give it a chance, it will hopefully open you up to why ""Strange Fruit"" was epic to understanding civil inhumanity and why it needed/needs to be heard.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

It seems almost incongruous to include Ms Andra Day's jaw-dropping performances (singing and acting), perfect sets, and period accoutrements with the dark American realities of racial prejudice, segregation, lynchings, and Billie Holiday's ongoing, unethical, no holds barred, racially-motivated persecution by the US government. For singing a song!The U.S. vs Billie Holiday is a great must-see film that I, a Black American, almost passed on because I am wearying of one of the painful shrouded negative truths of African American history being constantly illuminated for entertainment purposes: famous and revered Black American icons (Billie Holiday, Fred Hampton, Malcolm X), persecuted by the US government while simultaneously betrayed (sometimes murdered) by their own (reminiscent of the adage Crabs in a Basket).

93,blaxblew,Andra Day gives a solid performance in a very poor screenplay,3,27 February 2021,"Andra Day is very talented and she definitely has potential as an actress with the right director and screenplay. Her singing is excellent in the film - she hits every one of Billie Holiday's hauntingly earthy inflections. The problem is the film itself. It is very confusing with characters in and out who are not explained. We don't learn a lot of substance about Billie Holiday's life - at least anything verifiable - except what we already knew from Lady Sings the Blues. Perhaps my expectations were too high, no pun intended, but I expected this film to give audiences a more intimate picture of her life - her as a complex woman, not just a singing caricature with a heroin needle in her arm. Instead, this is another one of those biopics where the lead actor or actress does more character imitation than provide true insights into the actual subject and her life. This is also one of those films where the singing goes on far too long, but when that happens you know it's because the writing and screenplay are usually thin and the music is used to overcompensate for that. One of the most disturbing things for me is that the film shows a lot of men in and out of her life, and even tries to create romance out of a viciously violent relationship, her and Lewis McCabe. I need films to stop pretending that Black women love to have their asses stomped by the men in their lives. That's NOT love so don't sugar coat it on film. It's even worse that this is a very light complected woman who never has a single bruise on her face when we see her, even as he's constantly smacking and punching her.

A jumble of scenes that seem oddly sequenced.The point of the movie (the government stopping at no means to keep Holiday from singing Strange Fruit, a protest song against lynching,) is so dumbed down it takes away from the true evil of what's happening.We don't get to see more of Holiday's childhood and how those experiences shaped her drug use and future abusive relationships since they're key to the story.Billie Hol",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

I can't believe there's negative reviews because the music and her story was on point, nothing like the inaccurate movie "" Lady Sings the Blues"" which was good movie with excellent actors but inaccurate material. Ms.Billie Holiday's music will be with us forever.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

Yes, it might be a bit out of focus every once in a while, yes... the cliches are used a bit too often, but the acting is very good and it took me by the balls.

I only watched this film because of her Oscar nomination and it really shows how much work she put into the character; nomination totally deserved. However the rest of the film is a mess to say the least. The screenplay is unbearable and makes you want to skip much of the story because it is all over the place. The directing and the editing simply weren't right for the story they were trying to tell. I am personally not familiar with the work of Billie Holiday beyond the movie however I have done some research into her life and I think this story deserves another chance, a better adaptation into what was a tragic and impactful life.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

About the journey of Billie Holiday and how the FBI successfully tore this woman down over a song that forced america to acknowledge it's demons.I do wish they didn't put as much emphasis on Jimmy Fletcher but i guess he was important to her story.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
111,aalreetmarra,Andra Day vs Diana Ross,8,1 March 2021,"I was ten years old when Billie Holiday died but it was not until a few years later years I would listen to Billie Holiday. In 1972 I was 23 years old and in anticipation, I went to the Cinema to watch ''Lady Sings the Blues'' I came away feeling disappointed, so I'm a little puzzled by reviewers holding up that film as better than ""The United States vs Billie Holiday'' as one film is a biopic and the other focuses on one period?As ""Lady Sings the Blues'' opens we see Diana Ross being thrown into a padded cell and immediately I notice that the hairstyle is instantly recognizable as Diana Ross and not Billie Holiday? Today many films based on the truth you find Directors selecting an actor who at least resembles the person they are portraying and this is what I see when I watch Andra Day playing Billie Holiday.
Both these artists are great singers in their genre but Diana Ross has a much sweeter tone in her vocal not to mention that she also has a much wider range which in truth the real Billie Holiday did not have. On the other hand, Andra Day has that huskiness to her voice that the real Billie Holiday also had at this point go to YouTube and listen to Billie Holiday singing ""All of Me'' then listen to Diana Ross and then listen to Andra Day. Diana Ross sang the song she didn't render it like Billie Holiday when Andra Day sings that song she makes the effort to include the inflection and phrasing that Billie Holiday had in her vocal.Diana Ross was only nominated for a Golden Globe for her role but today Andra Day was nominated for a Golden Globe and also won it, there is the difference! In 1972 ''Lady Sings the Blues'' came in at the bottom of the Top Ten movies for that year grossing about $19,720,490 in North America to date bear in mind that the budget was $15,000,000 and to give some perspective the Top Movie for 1972 grossed $93,300,000.As for The United States vs Billie Holiday believe it or not the clue is in the title Billie Holiday was one of many prominent African Americans to be targeted by Edgar J. Hoovers F.B.I. yes, this is the subject of this period of Billie Holiday's life. It is not a biopic of her whole life a fact that Lee Daniels stated in the press before the release of the movie. One has written they couldn't watch the movie and turned it off? How can you review it then? Another writes it is only when Andra Day is on the screen that the film is lifted? Given that she is in the starring role I don't find this surprising? Another doesn't like the portrayal of Billie being a victim but she was a victim of the F.B.I. she was manipulated and ripped off by men in her life and no doubt beaten up on occasion. However, she had a hard life from childhood upwards in the time that she lived in America was an openly racist society but not just that it was a two-tier society and African Americans were right at the bottom of that second tier. Being born a woman from her sort of background in this time was yet another disadvantage she came from nothing achieved fame in this discriminately racist period her lifestyle was one of music which will more than likely put you in the proximity of alcohol and drugs it comes with the territory.As for the movie moving back and forth through time, this is not a new feature many other biopics are filmed in this way you won't find one that is 100% accurate Hollywood is known for embellishments to make the story more appealing to audiences so cut some slack and get real.For this movie to be currently given a score of 6.3 is disgraceful it's not perfect but I rate it at 8 out of 10 as one reviewer stated the music went on too long the film dragged missing the point that Billie was a musician and I agree with others here that the music throughout the film was nothing short of outstanding!",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

I did not know much of Billie Holiday, so her background as shown in the film is painfully helpful. What a challenging and short life that she lead. She was strong, persistent, and had tons of talent. She was a survivor and she broke ground for others after her. Andra Day was very convincing as Holiday. I hope she gets her due.

The Feds chasing her down for her amazing song ""Strange Fruit"". Billy is special to me since my Dad met her while she was performing at a jazz club.
This is a great movie with Audra's performance as quite remarkable!",The United States vs. Billie Holiday
117,jmstm,A Fatal Flaw,4,7 April 2021,"I have to mark this film way down for calling Strange Fruit ""her song."" Billie Holiday is certainly associated with it more than any other, but she did not write the lyrics and calling it her song is a very serious error of judgement by director Lee Daniels. Her ownership in the public mind, or even in her own mind, is one thing, but for the filmmaker to make the claim in the manner he did (on a text slate to start the film) is essentially fatal for the film.The writer of the song is Abel Meeropol, aka Lewis Allan. Meeropol, son of Russian Jewish immigrants, seems an interesting person in his own right. In addition to writing what has been called the American song of the century, he apparently also taught high school English to James Baldwin and adopted and raised the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, famously executed by the U. S. in 1953 as spies for the Soviet Union.By that accounting alone he seems like a character who would bring interest to a movie. According to her Wikipedia page, Holiday claimed in her book Lady Sings the Blues that she co-wrote the music to the song with Meeropol. Unless that claim has been proven false, this would have been an entirely appropriate scene for the film, given its heavy focus on the song.Daniels ought to have pressed himself to rise to occasion and do right by Meeropol instead of trying to do him out of his claim to fame.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

121,rafajack-56549,A bad script vs. Billie Holiday,3,28 February 2021,"I read another review that said pretty much everything I wanted to say so I'll try to be concise. One could say that the movie is more about ""look how Andra Day looks and talks and sings like Billie Holiday"" than about the artist's life, I mean we all heard her songs a thousand times over the years do we really need so many musical numbers? We have the records silly! It's just a bunch of scenes stuck together with almost no continuity for 2 hours, not that linearity is a must for any picture but if you're telling the story of a person that actually lived you might as well have some, right? Andra Day is amazing and I hope she gets nominated for an Academy Award!

122,delilah_moon,Could Have Been Great,5,15 September 2021,"I was so excited for this film. Having worshipped Lady Sings the Blues With Diana Ross, I was looking forward to this new iteration which promise to be more realistic and take us on a deeper look into Billie's life.Unfortunately this film disappoints in many areas. There are serious continuity issues with the flow of the film and often times you're wondering what time. You just hopped into. There's an awkward scene with Billy telling her story to someone, but this only appears a couple of times throughout the story itself, thus seeming inconsistent with the narrative.The story of the United States government going after Billie Holiday it's captivating and very revealing about the state of the FBI during America's ""golden era"". Unfortunately this tail fails to take us into the deeper levels of that corruption.The story also heavily focuses on Billie's addiction and the subsequent emotional scars she carries that led her to addiction in the first place. Unfortunately between her brief moments of sobriety and addiction, the movie fails to really paint a picture of a human being who is suffering. The acting performances are wonderful in this film, but the editing and the story itself failed to deliver what could have been a masterpiece.This review is dictated, please excuse any typos or misspellings.",The United States vs. Billie Holiday

I must say this movie opened my eyes to life of Ms. Billie Holiday. To me she was treated unjustly. She didn't hurt anybody, she didn't steal. All she did was sing. She sang about what was happening and those who works in the Authority field such as (cops, feds) etc, didn't like to see a strong-willed black woman doing her thing. So what she did heroine, it's her life not yours. She ain't hurting you, only herself.Not everyone will like how this movie was made, portrayed etc., to each their own.

The facts were presented and while yall saw a political agenda(whatever that even means) I saw an experience that has affected black Americans since the beginning of this country.

As USA Today critic Brian Truitt wrote, ""Because Daniels filmed her singing live, 'Strange Fruit' and other old songs feel vibrant and resonant."" What other movie songs are performed and recorded live? It is ground-breaking. Sumptuous sets contrast with no-frills emotions of Billie Holiday and her entourage. . . Costumes, furnishings, and production values noted in the mainstream press would display well on large theater screens, the way director Lee Daniels intended, but watching online has its advantages. Subtitles and the ability to rewind rescue the many one-liners of the fast-paced dialogue. The United States vs. Billie Holiday is no light popcorn fare. It is an intense and dark journey of celebrity targeted by authorities determined to make an example, selfish hangers-on, drug pushers, and abusive men.

I know about Billie Holiday and I have seen Lady Sings the Blues (which fails in comparison to this version). This depiction was ""raw"" and seems to be more fact based. That not withstanding, I thought this was a excellent depiction of her life and the struggles that most blacks had to endure with a government that still has systemic racism.This is a movie about freedom of speech and a society that tries to silence that speech. It was in a time pre Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and others who had the same opposition.Some film critics have attacked the technical aspect of the film and the storyline, however the message is clear. Just as in the book, ""Free from Slavery not Free From Racism"", this problem still exists in 2021 as it did in the 1940's and 50's for people of color.I would highly recommend this movie for women and people of color.

The acting was great; sets were great, costumes and makeup great. Unfortunately the script was awful and the editing worse. There was almost no way that someone not already familiar with Anslinger and the FBI to comprehend why he went after Holiday.To my disgust, the film developed in such a way that it should have been titled ""Billie Holiday VS Herself"" or ""Billie Holiday's Men Vs Her"". Furthermore, the sex scenes were entirely unnecessary to the plot; I don't object to such scenes however graphic if they are integral to the plot. I ask viewers if such gratuitous scenes would have taken place had this been the US vs Doris Day, or Barbra Streisand, or Janis Joplin?Such a promising telling of a great injustice and a man's hatred and racism, ambition and corruption (Anslinger) totally messed up by a mistaken plot focus and incoherence in delivery.

Unfortunately it comes off as are confusing and poorly executed film directed by Lee Daniels. Lee Daniels attempts to distract a biopic on the legendary singer, but unfortunately seems to be confused about the time he wants to make. He doesn't know whether or not to make a film on the legendary singer and her life and struggles or a commentary on the drug war and it shows and over shadows the piece. What doesn't help matters is the cinematography of the film which looks like into a TV movie and not a theatrical release which is sad, because it has a great cast to make this work. If you're looking for a film that talks about the historical aspects of her life, then please focus your attention elsewhere. Understand, that when it comes to films based on people that actually lived, dramatic license will be taken that's just a fact. In this case, the mountain historical inaccuracies are too much to ignore.Of the fault of the film none should fall on the cast which does an incredible job in the roles that they are given, especially day as Billie Holiday herself. The work she's put in to create her own portrayal of holiday shines through and it's a highlight of the film. Her talents the talents of the cast in general are wasted in this confused mess that chooses to focus more the physical abuse from her male lovers and drug use and not her actual struggles with the government due to her song Strange Fruit.
