0,SnoopyStyle,Heat,7,19 October 2013,"Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a lifelong smooth operator bank robber. He escapes from prison with the help of Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames) and grabs US Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) on the way out. She talks her way out by convincing weak minded Glenn Michaels (Steve Zahn). Foley is after some diamonds, and Sisco is put on their case. Only she might be falling for him.Director Steven Soderbergh has narrow the focus. This is simply one hot sexual innuendo after another between Clooney and Lopez. It does get slow and J Lo does get too cool at times. But it's a slow cool burn that heats up the whole movie. Clooney is a perfect sly fox. The game play between the two leads absolutely sings.",Out of Sight
1,kosmasp,It's all in the trunk,9,18 April 2021,"If you've seen the movie you are aware of that trunk scene! Once seen it cannot be unseen! One of movie historys most infamous scenes - and one that can be considered sizzling hot! Two of the hottest alltime stars of Hollywood ... apparently there is a longer cut of the scene on the laserdisc ... now I want to see that too.That aside the movie is also a great crime/caper movie with an excellent overall cast. I'll say something controversial I reckon, but if Pacino and De Niro where in love or attracted to each other romantically in Heat ... maybe something similar would come out ... don't get it twisted though: there is not so much action in this, it is more the thriller aspect of it. The ending has some nice action and stunt scenes for sure though.And an ending that could not have been more perfect ... not giving you what you want, by giving you what you need/want ... may sound strange, but you'll get it once you see it.",Out of Sight
2,classicsoncall,"""You with the bad boys now, Baby!""",7,5 June 2018,"I liked the opening scene with Jack Foley's (George Clooney) clever bank heist. I wonder if anyone ever tried something like that? But Adele Delisi (Catherine Keener) was right, Jack should have used a car that had a reliable starter. For a smart crook, that was a pretty dumb move.Hard to believe this picture was made twenty years ago as I write this. Clooney and Jennifer Lopez make for an engaging couple, their brief fling in the story set up a momentous final confrontation that provided a not so subtle twist to the outcome. Good support is turned in by Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle and Dennis Farina, with an unnecessary cameo by Michael Keaton that really went nowhere. Although I did like the way Samuel L. Jackson showed up in the closing scene to ride off into the sunset and back to Glades with Jack.Anyone else notice - Clooney's character had the same name as pro wrestler Cactus Jack Foley. He just didn't look as scruffy.",Out of Sight
3,gavin6942,A Nice Crime Romance. Could Use Less Romance,7,29 April 2015,"A career bank robber (George Clooney) breaks out of jail and shares a moment of mutual attraction with a US Marshall (Jenny From the Block) he has kidnapped.First of all, this is an incredible ensemble cast. Michael Keaton, Ving Rhames, Steve Zahn, Dennis Farina. For a film that has grown increasingly obscure and forgotten, it has a fair amount of bigger names that people may want to see. Why did it become obscure? Was it as part of the anti-Lopez backlash? Who knows? Now, for me, I could have used more of Clooney as the suave bank robber who does not need a gun and less of the romantic angle between him and Lopez. Why complicate a good heist / crime story with phoney Hollywood emotions?",Out of Sight
4,lee_eisenberg,George Clooney switches from his 1997 career to his 1998 career (and I agree about those Faye Dunaway movies),7,29 December 2018,"At the end of 1997, George Clooney's career looked dead in the water, having starred in a cliche movie (The Peacemaker) and a crime against humanity (Batman and Robin). But in 1998, he rebounded with Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"". It's not a masterpiece, but you gotta love the dialogue between Clooney's character and his partners-in-crime. Jennifer Lopez's US marshal came across as a little bland, though; it seemed like she was more about her looks than her character. Nonetheless, I recommend the movie, as I do every cinematic adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel that I've seen. Good one.",Out of Sight
5,jboothmillard,Out of Sight,7,14 September 2005,"I had seen this film at least twice, but I always only remembered the car boot scene and a meeting in a bar, so I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch and judge it properly, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven). Basically, Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a small-time crook and career bank robber. Whilst visiting a Florida prison, U. S. Marshal, Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) witnesses various criminals escaping through an underground tunnel. During this, Jack escapes dressed as a security guard, his long-time friend Buddy Bragg (Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames) picks him up in a stolen car, forcing Karen to get into the trunk next to Jack. After completing the escape, Karen is let go, and Jack and Buddy, along with unreliable associate Glenn Michaels (Steve Zahn), make their way to the wealthy northern suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Detroit. There, they plan to visit the home of shady businessman Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks), who was incarcerated with them, and foolishly bragged about a stash of uncut diamond hidden in his home. Jack returns to his apartment to rest and have a wash. Shortly after, Karen has tracked Jack and enters his room with a gun, finding him in the bathroom with his eyes closed. Jack suddenly grabs her gun, and they smile at each other, and they start kissing and making out. Karen is abruptly woken up to find it had been a dream. Whilst in prison, Glenn told vicious criminal named Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle) about the diamond plot, and he makes plans to carry out his own robbery along with criminals Kenneth (Isaiah Washington) and White Boy Bob (Keith Loneker). Maurice and Jack agree to team up on the job and split the earnings. Before the robbery, Karen is in a Detroit hotel bar, and three businessmen attempt to strike a conversation, but she shows no interest and dismisses each of them. Then she is surprised when Jack walks in and offers to buy a drink, they start by using false names, ""Gary"" and ""Celeste"", when starting a conversation. Eventually, they talk about whether she is pursuing him to arrest him or for love. They then end up in a hotel room together and make love. Jack, Buddy, Maurice and the team all go ahead with the heist. Things turn sour when Maurice betrays Jack, wanting the diamonds for himself, and Kenneth attempts to sexually assault Ripley's housekeeper and lover, Midge (RoboCop's Nancy Allen). In the chaos, White Boy Bob accidentally shoots and kills himself after tripping on the stairs, while Jack shoots and kills Kenneth. The uncut diamonds are hidden in the fish tank, in amongst the gravel, and Buddy scoops them out. Karen, having followed the team of crooks, shoots and kills Maurice and arrests Jack, while Buddy escapes with Ripley's diamonds. The next morning, Jack is put in the back of a van to be returned to prison in Florida. Another criminal, Hejira Henry (Samuel L. Jackson), gets in and mentions to Jack that he has escaped from prison nine previous times, and was deliberately placed by Karen in the same van as him. Karen smiles as the van leaves for Florida. Also starring Dennis Farina as Marshall Sisco, Luis Guzmán as Chino, Catherine Keener as Adele, Michael Keaton as Ray Nicolette, and Viola Davis as Moselle. Clooney is cool and charismatic, Lopez is beautiful and determined, they have great chemistry together, the script is made up of flashbacks, witty and sparky banter and conversations, it is funny at the right moments, and the caper element is engaging, it is a fun romantic crime drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Film Editing. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Clooney and Lopez together in the car boot.

Yes, this is a strange cast.The movie....well, it's okay but not as wild as the cast. At least it's entertaining, which is the name of the game. It won't win any awards, but you won't fall asleep watching it for the full two hours. Just be ready for lots of profanity. It's a colorful movie, and this time I don't mean the cast.

7,rmax304823,Rough Ice.,7,24 January 2012,"The first time I tried to watch this, a few years ago, I got through the opening. A couple of hoods (including Clooney) break out of a Florida pen and grab a U. S. Marshall (Lopez) unawares in the parking lot. Two of the inmates leap into the car and drive off while Clooney is squeezed into the trunk with Lopez. The cheeky Clooney rather enjoys the enforced contact, while the equally cheeky Lopez as the innocent victim seems a little put out. Clooney spends the time telling her about his career as a harmless thief. There is some dialog that comes perilously close to cute. After a few minutes of this, a title tells us FLASHBACK: TWO YEARS EARLIER.That's as far as I got. I figured, Another comic romance involving a chase between the lady cop and the roguish hoodlum. There would be an argosy of wisecracks. There would be intermittent meetings during which they would fall in love. In the end, in all seriousness, she would talk him out of his last dangerous heist, help him capture the venomous villains who were forcing him to use his expertise in their behalf, and he would get a pardon from the governor, the Medal of Freedom, and unlimited access to JLo's cantilevered boom. There would be a sunset. A sailboat. A throbbing kiss. A final harmless one liner. Or Clooney may have been an undercover FBI agent all along.But I was wrong about the film in almost all regards. The structure was a bit complicated, true, and I was lost once or twice because JLo does, in fact, pursue Clooney and his two pals across the continent for a couple of years. But the general template was clear enough, and pretty close to what I'd expected. There is no sunset at the end but at least the warm promise of an ending that will bring Clooney and Lopez back into each others' arms.The photography (Davis) and art direction (Messina) are superb. The motel corridors in Miami are a dull flamingo pink. The snow across which an escaping dummy runs in a Detroit night scintillate under the street lamps, like a picture post card. It's really well designed and well shot.It's not a masterpiece. The baddest of the bad guys is Don Cheadle. His villainy is convincing, although his character is nothing but pure e-vil. He squishes live goldfish into pulp. Quite a few familiar faces pop up for a few lines -- Michael Keaton (my supporting player in the artistic gem, ""The Squeeze""), Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks in a thoroughly dramatic role, Louis Guzman, Nancy Allen, and Samuel L. Jackson.Of the two leads, Lopez handles her part well enough. She has a peculiar beauty -- hefty and with strong bone structure but very feminine. I like Clooney. His performances usually (not always) have an off-hand quality about them, as if he really were throwing away his lines. I suppose he's handsome too but I'll give him a pass on that and not hate him for it. He's rather like an urbane Burt Reynolds.If you're not in an especially demanding humor, you might want to catch this. It's slight but enjoyable. It has action, suspense, romance, and some surprising smiles.",Out of Sight
8,Tweekums,Clooney and Lopez sizzle in this crime drama,7,16 February 2017,"Jack Foley is a back robber who escapes from prison in Florida, Karen Sisco is a U.S. Marshal who just happens to be in the prison car park as Jack is escaping. He and his accomplice Buddy Bragg bundle her into the boot of a car, Jack joins her in the boot while Buddy drives them off. After a while they meet up with Glenn, a stoned friend of Buddy's. He drives off with Karen, leaving Jack and Buddy on the roadside.In a series of flashbacks we learn how Jack and Buddy spent time in prison with Richard Ripley, a businessman who let it be known that he had a fortune in uncut diamonds; inside their bought him protection; outside they make him a target. Jack and Buddy head to Detroit, where Riley lives, but they aren't the only people planning to rob him. Glenn has teamed up with Maurice 'Snoopy' Miller, another ex-con, who is more dangerous than Jack. Karen is also hot on the trail of Jack partly because she is determined to send him back to prison and partly because she appears to have developed feelings for the charming bank robber.This is a fun crime caper largely because of the great chemistry between George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez as Jack and Karen; he is naturally cool and she is effortlessly sexy in a way that makes then positively sizzle when they are on the screen together. They are ably supported by Ving Rhames as Buddy and Don Cheadle as the less than pleasant Snoopy. The story is well paced and is told in a way that right up until the end we don't know whether Karen will arrest Jack or ride off into the sunset with him. There isn't a lot of action but what there is is effective and surprisingly brutal, notably a sudden but brief scene where a man is stabbed in prison. There are plenty of good unforced laughs mixed in with the drama. There is a fair amount of strong language, which will bother some viewers but overall I'd recommend this to fans of caper movies.",Out of Sight
9,blanche-2,fun film,8,21 April 2013,"Steven Soderbergh's first foray into the big budgets was ""Out of Sight,"" a 1998 film starring George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, and Ving Rhames.Clooney plays a Jack Foley, a career bank robber. In the first scene, we see the amazing way he robs a bank. He informs the teller that the man talking to the bank manager is his partner who will shoot the bank manager if she doesn't cooperate. She cooperates. He then says he's leaving and if she sounds the alarm, the bank manager gets it. On his way out, he stops and says something to the man talking to the bank manager, and leaves. Of course he doesn't know who the man is.This time, however, Jack can't start his car and make his getaway, so instead he gets a ride to prison. Two years later, he breaks out of prison and is accosted by a beautiful Federal agent, Karen Sisco (Lopez) who is at the prison to follow up on a case, has seen the men escape, and informs on them. Jack emerges last, wearing a guard's uniform and informs prison officials that the tunnel is clear. Another escapee (Ving Rhames) grabs Karen from behind, and both she and Jack are soon in the trunk of the car. The two talk, Sisco remaining cool, and Jack remaining flippant.The film plays with time, so we go back and forth to Jack's time in prison and to the present, which involves the robbery of a Bernie Madoff type (Albert Brooks) who, while in prison, told one of the inmates that he has uncut diamonds hidden in his home. In the present, Karen keeps showing up. She and Jack are obviously attracted to one another, but one's a bank robber and prison escapee...and one's a fed.Really excellent film with lots of situational humor and excellent characterizations, particularly from Don Cheadle, for whom Jack has been a nemesis both in prison and out. Albert Brooks and his toupees are hilarious.I'm always amused that George Clooney is compared to Cary Grant. Here, he looks so much like Tyrone Power that it's scary. (Clooney told Power's daughter that he modeled his career after her father.) As Jack Foley, Clooney is ridiculously handsome, flippant, relaxed, sexy, and charming. It's one of his better performances. He tends to be very serious in many of his films; this one shows his lighter side.Jennifer Lopez is good as Karen, a real knockout. Someone commented that she's too glamorous. No doubt, but the script called for a sexy woman. She fits the bill.The script by Scott Frank based on an Elmore Leonard novel, is excellent, and you'll be highly entertained by the quirky characters and situations.",Out of Sight
10,Quinoa1984,Clever,9,29 July 2000,"Not too often does a cool and clever thriller/comedy come around like this. But what do you expect from author Elmore Leonard and director Steven Soderbergh.  And the cast is great as well, with George Clooney in great shape as a bank robber who falls for a FBI agent (Jennifer Lopez) while locked in a trunk with her.  A swerving plot, which may remind some of Pulp Fiction, but this time it is a little different (where else are you going to see Albert Brooks with a safe full of wigs).  Still, a blast to watch, with cameos from Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton.  One of the better films of 1998.  A+",Out of Sight
11,michaelRokeefe,Give just one more chance.,7,22 July 2006,"This movie is better than the reviews panning it. Steven Soderbergh directs this crime flick that has hints of comedy and romance. Jack Foley(George Clooney)has robbed more banks than he can remember. Upon escaping a Florida prison with bud Buddy Bragg(Ving Rhames)he has an encounter with a beautiful US Marshall Karen Sisco(Jennifer Lopez), who will later join a manhunt trying to foil Foley's next 'last' job. Jack and Buddy will join up with a former prison-mate(Don Cheadle)with a planned heist of uncut diamonds owned by another former inmate( Albert Brooks). There is enough violence and strong language to garner an R rating. The charming and handsome Clooney with the luscious Lopez make for some smoldering scenes. Its the not being able to really convey the feelings they have for each other that gives the scenes they share that special something. Others in the cast: Dennis Farina, Isaiah Washington and small roles for Nancy Allen, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson. For those Lopez bashers...this is one of her stronger performances.

13,Boba_Fett1138,good movie although not a must see.,8,29 December 2004,"Soderbergh goes Tarantino style. ""Out of Sight"" has a Quentin Tarantino like story, similar to a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"". In a way it is good but it just misses the brilliance that Tarantino knows to put in his movies. ""Out of Sight"" is a good movie but it doesn't really add anything, also the story could have been handled in a better way.George Clooney is always at his best in roles like this. The chemistry he has with Jennifer Lopez is surprising good and all of their sequences together are like fireworks, the trunk sequence is a classic in my opinion. The cast is filled with some more great stars such Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks and some small roles and cameo's by Nancy Allen, Luis Guzmán, Michael Keaton and the always cool BMF Samuel L. Jackson.Sodenbergh sure knows how to make a movie fun. The movie is more fun than violent or anything really, so if a movie like ""Pulp fiction"" is a bit too heavy for you, this might be the perfect alternative for you to watch.The story is most at the times only so, so. At times it comes close of being clever and brilliant but it never really gets to it.Yet the movie is perfectly watchable mainly because of the characters and the fun feeling the movie has.

14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,When Soderbergh arrived,7,4 January 2013,"Jack Foley(Clooney, with his charm turned up high throughout, you don't want him to go back to jail) has been robbing banks about as far back as he remembers, so when he abducts federal marshal Karen Sisco(like The Cisco Kid, only spelled different; Lopez plays the role well, some distance and authority, yet without being completely detached; I am not usually impressed with her performance, this is a welcome exception) and they have to be in the trunk of a car until his friend, Buddy(Rhames, very kind-hearted, underneath a small-time crook surface), gets them far enough from the prison he just broke out of, the romantic attraction wasn't entirely expected by either of them, and yet however they might want to, they can't deny that it was there. Soon after, she's trying to apprehend him, and he's working on a heist. And a thought lingers... what if they had met under different circumstances? I have not read the novel, nor any other by the author, only seen adaptations of his works. This is a quirky, light take on the crime genre, with many funny moments(if it is at times trying too hard), with a script, dialog and character introductions that are clever and sharp. It's a highly sexy film, always very naturally, as smooth as the 70's feel(aided greatly by the foot-tapping soundtrack). The acting is all spot-on, with both main cast and supporting players doing fantastic. Cheadle, Farina, Brooks... even Zahn, if he gets on your nerves at times. There are flashbacks to help set things up, establish relationships and the like. The 112 minute length sans credits(118 with) flows by nice and well, and though it could have been shorter, I didn't really want to do without any of what's in there. There is a little sensuality, strong language and mild to moderate violence(it tends to be sudden, quick and unpleasant, only one bit of it is graphic). The Collector's Edition DVD comes with an interesting, informational and amusing commentary track by the director and the writer, the 24 minute documentary Inside Out of Sight(which I will review on its own page here on the site), 21 and a half minutes of deleted scenes that are worth watching a theatrical trailer and music highlights.

I guess some producers feel that if they put enough known faces in a movie then it will do well... WRONG!! I admit I didn't finish watching the movie, it was just that bad in my opinion. It seemed to be going relatively well until the prison break scene and the relationship between agent and con that developed from the prison break. Jack Foley (George Clooney), for all of his smarts was just too silly to believe. He wants to woo a federal agent while he is a fugitive. He is so tough that he can make enemies in prison though he has no one to watch his back? It was just too ridiculous of a plot to continue watching.",Out of Sight
16,anaconda-40658,Soderbergh's Sights Set.,7,13 July 2015,"Out of Sight (1998): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Dennis Farina, Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle: Potential clever caper given great writing and detail until it starts to resemble Ocean's Eleven. Title isn't exactly focused unless it refers to a getaway plans that never work for the criminal in question. He flicks his lighter rapidly anticipating his options. A plan forms and he calmly holds up a bank teller. His methods payoff until he is arrested shortly thereafter. He spends much of his life in prison but another plan forms where he breaks out. Assisted by his partner the plan works until he finds himself in the trunk of a car with a female cop. Clever writing with a surprise ending involving sacrifice. Stylish directing by Steven Soderbergh who previously made Sex, Lies and Videotape. George Clooney brings charm to a clumsy criminal. Jennifer Lopez is superb as a cop torn between profession and romance but ultimately witnesses the ultimate sacrifice. Other roles are rendered to formula to typical capers. Dennis Farina plays Lopez's father who presents her with a gun on her birthday. Ving Rhames plays Clooney's loyal partner who will play through to the end. Don Cheadle plays another criminal planning to hit the same target. While there is potential for greatness here, the end result is an undemanding screenplay that is out of sight.

17,gradyharp,The Resurrection and Gradual Appreciation of a Classic Film,10,23 July 2006,"Steven Soderbergh knows his way around the bizarre, nearly impossible story lines and can translate them to film as few others can. OUT OF SIGHT is a little masterpiece of film-making despite the fact that when it initially screened in 1998 it seemed to slip by theatergoers' attention. Based on the inimitable Elmore Leonard novel the story begs indulgence in credible situations but shines in quality of script and characterization and an atmospheric cinematic capturing of a dark, film noir comedy drama that grabs you by the head and holds you glued to the screen for the duration.The story is rather simple on the surface - a jailed bank robber escapes with the help of his buddy and plans a major hit only to encounter a federal agent in pursuit of the two who becomes the love interest portion of this strangely convoluted tail. Subplots and sidebars are sprinkled throughout Soderbergh's telling of Leonard's story, serving to keep our minds alert and mesmerized by the plot development.The cast is absolutely first rate with George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez and Ving Rhames especially pungent in roles that seem written for them. The strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman , Isaiah Washington, Dennis Farina, and Albert Brooks. And for those who enjoy powerful sexual chemistry Clooney and Lopez offer some of their finest collaborative acting. This is a fine movie and one that doubtless in time will be considered and under appreciated Film Classic. Grady Harp",Out of Sight
18,Mr-Fusion,"Another in a long line of terrific adaptations; star power, all the way.",8,1 May 2013,"""Out of Sight"" hinges on the chemistry between its stars; a chance meeting between an escaped con (George Clooney) and a US Marshal (Jennifer Lopez) and the burning question of how things would've been under different circumstances. And in that department this does not disappointment (by any stretch of the imagination). Lopez and Clooney were two people born to play these roles, and their scenes together crackle with sexual energy. And it's not just the leads; the whole movie is well-cast. Albert Brooks plays against type as a weaselly Wall Street crook, Cheadle as the underhanded ex-con with delusions of being a major criminal enterpriser (and a hateful little prick), Steve Zahn as the small-time pothead, and Ving Rhames as George Clooney's sensible half. They're all terrific. Hell, even with two smaller roles, Dennis Farina and Michael Keaton steal their respective scenes. In his screenplay, Scott Frank ably brings these characters from page to screen, shifting the narrative and bringing Leonard's distinct tone and style to the proceedings. And Soderbergh injects the film with slow-burn energy and atmosphere, between the sunsoaked Miami palette to the falling snow in Detroit. But it's Jennifer Lopez who walks away with this movie, proving (in '98) she's ready for the big time. She's Karen Sisco personified, the tough- as-nails Leonardian badass lawwoman. For my money, it's her best performance.This is a seriously cool, sexy caper flick. And as an Elmore Leonard adaptation, it ranks with the best of them. Great movie.8/10",Out of Sight

Clooney and Lopez are excellent together and the film is well put together by Soderbergh. I liked the varied pacing and occasional visual trickery with freeze frames and back and forth action but it is the faithfulness to the book and the two stars that really make this so good. Strangely although I thought it a tad long whilst watching the disc extras I felt that several of the deleted scenes plus the extended car boot scene (wonderful) should have been reinserted. So a bit long but better longer sounds crazy, maybe some of the oddball scenes with Steve Zahn could have been reduced and although beautifully shot maybe we didn't need the boxing scene.

21,lasttimeisaw,Clooney is oozing his deadly charm in this average criminal drama,7,4 February 2016,"George Clooney's protagonist Jack Foley, is a handsome and extremely charming guy, an incurable romantic, not an advocate of violence and has the proclivity for being a modern-day knight errant, so maybe, bank-robbing is not such a fancy profession for him, but actually, he does it pretty well. In the opening scenes, it is all easy-breezy for him to talk through a young female bank clerk to give him the cash, only his exit plan hits a snag.During his prison-break, Jack and his loyal partner Buddy (Rhames) hold hostage Karen Sisco (Lopez), a U.S. Marshal, a burgeoning romance has been kindled between Jack and Karen, when they squeeze together inside the trunk of the vehicle on the exit route, the closeness of a confined space really works as a hotbed for sexual attraction, and they are talking about movies about Faye Dunaway and Robert Redford along the way.Karen manages to escape later, but becomes involuntarily preoccupied with him, she follows all the leads to track him down, and finally in Detroit, their simmering affections evolve into one night of passion, but Jack's real intention is to steal some uncut diamonds from a Wall Street millionaire, Richard Ripley (Brooks), a fellow prisoner whom Jack and Buddy have met three years ago. In order to furthermore strengthen that Jack is the bad guy we are rooting for, Maurice Miller (Cheadle) is introduced, a ruthless murderer, who is also eyeing for the diamonds, with his two underlings, a cretin White Boy Bob (Loneker) and a former boxer Kenneth (Washington). The climax is a home invasion with a taut suspense and a pretty up-tp-scratch happy ending.OUT OF SIGHT is Sundance wunderkind Soderbergh's seventh feature film and his first dalliance with mainstream production (for Universal), it becomes a critical success with 2 Oscar-nominations (for editing and screenplay), the editing job of Anne V. Coates is essential to integrate the intentionally disarranged story lines to a hipster fashion which perks up the golden-hearted criminal cliché; Scott Frank's adapted screenplay puts much weight on the comedic fodder out of the dangerous work from its source novel; also ornamented by a posh soundtrack and frisky cameos from Michael Keaton - who reincarnate as Ray Nicolette from Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN 1997, another Elmore Leonard's adaptation - and Samuel L. Jackson, as the kindred spirit inmate of Jack in the code. In retrospect, it has become a breakthrough for Clooney, who radiates both civilised sophistication and childlike nonchalance, a symbol of Clooney's own raw sex appeal in its peak, and incredibly heats up the screen with Jennifer Lopez, whose often problematic acting aptitude magically works this time. Don Cheadle gives a committed impression in the villain default, and it is always nice to see Catherine Keener and Viola Davis on the screen, but personally I find Steve Zahn's outstanding portrayal of Glenn Michaels, Jack and Buddy's cowardly partner-in-crime, stands out eventually, it is a sidekick who doesn't usually deserve our compassion or even attention, but Zahn supplies him with rather empathetic efforts to cement his feelings: fumbling frustration, palpable fear and an expedient sense of desperation.",Out of Sight
22,KineticSeoul,"Classy, sly and seductive film although it mostly focuses in on the heist",8,8 April 2013,"This is actually a well written and directed film that blends sly and seductive romance with a bit of heist to it. And the slight noir style of vibe and dialogue actually adds to this film. While also bringing back that old school classic vibe to it as well. The romance part is with two very unlikely people. It's between Jack Foley(George Clooney) who is a bank robber that gets what he wants by asking the right way. In another words he is a smooth talker that also has wits and is extremely prideful. But for some reason he is a guy that is still likable and I couldn't help but want him to succeed even if he is a selfish character. Maybe it's because of his easy going attitude and the fact that he has a code and also has class. The female lead is played by Jennifer Lopez and she plays a Karen Sisco who is a Federal Marshal. I will just say she is just right for this role since both the characters chemistry really does stand out. The romance part is a bit short between the two characters but when the chemistry between them picks up, it's sizzling. And how they first bond with each other by making movie references was just plain cool and interesting. Plus this was when George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez was close to their prime. The conversations between the different characters drives this movie. The romance kicks off a bit too quickly but the film explains...Sorta. But than again that actually kinda applies to real life. This film is directed by Steven Soderbergh and he really knows how to put in some classy dialogues. The editing was also really well done, not going in a complete chronological order but it makes the experience and the scenarios more intriguing. This is a classy, sly and seductive romance movie although it mostly focuses in on the heist and is all blended in so well, it's most definitely worth checking out. Few of the deleted scenes were also good although I can understand why some of them were deleted.8/10",Out of Sight
23,ThomasDrufke,Quite the Ride,7,29 August 2017,"It's not that Out of Sight is some sort of monumental motion picture, however, it's a perfectly harmless feature film that entertains from beginning to end. It's one of Steven Soderbergh's more dated films, being that it was made 20 years ago, but it's also one of the sharpest in terms of dialogue and performances.On the outside, the romance between Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney is flooded with clichés. An under-appreciated FBI agent falls for the very guy she's trying to take down. It's been done a thousand times over, and it's not like this time it's all that groundbreaking. But their romance is well-acted on both sides. Clooney does as good as he can playing bad-boy Jack Foley, but I'm not sure I can ever accept that face of his as an antagonist. And Lopez, who isn't known for her acting, is actually quite good as Karen Sisco.Unsurprisingly for a Soderbergh film, the cast as a whole is phenomenal. Clooney, Lopez, Cheadle, Zahn, Rhames, Keener, Farina, Brooks, Davis, Keaton, and the one and only Samuel L. Jackson round out one of the best ensemble casts of all time. The best part is, no one takes their jobs too seriously, but well enough to be effective.As I previously mentioned, Soderbergh's directing is a little dated. Part of it is because the way films were made in the 90's was way different than it is now. For one, the music they used seemed like something out of a cheesy adult film. I mean that in the most respectful way possible, it's just the vibe I got from it. The editing is also something I couldn't entirely get behind. It's obviously intentional on Soderbergh's part, but the weird pauses in shots before transitions to a new scene just seemed weird.With that said, Out of Sight is undeniably fun, smart, and re- watchable. There isn't a whole lot more you can ask from a movie. It's no Oceans' Eleven, but it's definitely something worth watching.7.7/10",Out of Sight
24,gbill-74877,"Great cast, but too much silliness",4,8 March 2021,"Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney make for magnetic leads, but they're trapped here in a script that reeks of mediocrity. He plays a bank robber who's really just a sweet guy (as if you couldn't tell from those twinkling eyes!), and she plays a federal agent who melts like butter after meeting him, despite it taking place at gunpoint and in the trunk of a car. Of course, she lets him go more than once and then sleeps with him, even though he's wanted. The film tries to show us how tough she is and how she can handle herself, but how she treats Clooney undercuts all of this, which was both maddening and ridiculous. There are several other really silly moments, adding to the confusion in tone that Soderbergh sets. The film wants to be a romance, crime drama, and comedy, but for me it ended up pretty lame in all categories. It's too bad because the cast is deep, also including Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Viola Davis, Albert Brooks, Michael Keaton, Catherine Keener, Samuel L. Jackson, Luis Guzmán, and Nancy Allen. I'm not sure if this was Tarantino-lite or just a mindless made-for-TV movie, but it felt like a waste of time. I wish these leads made something else together though.",Out of Sight

This Steven Soderbergh directed, George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez acted crime thriller is a cut above average by avoiding the over the top crime spree and keeping the movie relatively simple and straight forward. This is both a comedy, a drama, and a crime thriller with not that much action. The action is more or less reduced to brief, more realistic sequences that don't last too long. The music score, especially with the romantic scenes is sweepingly captivating, the cynical repartee a gem, one-liners, zingers that keep the movie entertaining while also fusing into this movie a more heavy element of criminal toughness.

The large cast of familiar faces is quite good but the actors are not given interesting things to do and say. Clooney and Lopez make an attractive couple and generate romantic sparks.

28,The-Sarkologist,An intelligent story about an intelligent crim,7,18 October 2013,"I was told that this was a really good movie, but after seeing a number of superb movies in the cinema recently, and more on video, I began to not expect too much from it. I did not get that much from the movie, but it was reasonably good considering some of the movies that I could have hired (though Object of My Affection is an overnight and I really don't want to pay $3 for it when it is supposed to be an inferior copy of Chasing Amy).Out of Sight is about a superb bankrobber named Jack Foley. He is a very intelligent robber as he gets the money without having to use violence. Instead he bluffs making his victim believe that there are armed men nearby even though there are not. The robbery that we see is evidence of that, and we later discover that he robs this bank without any planning whatsoever. The problem is that his car won't start and he gets caught - but that is only a minor inconvenience to Jack Foley as he manages to escape using a failed escape attempt as a cover. Unfortunately, he is confronted by a federal marshal, Karen Sisco, whom he kidnaps and escapes with.This is where the major plot turns up. Jack falls in love with Karen and vice versa. Both know that this is a difficult relationship, one being a federal marshal and the other being an escaped criminal. In fact this is aiding and abetting a known felon - but nobody other than Jack and his confidant and Karen's father know of this relationship.This movie is about relationships - that which exists between Karen and Jack - and the struggle that they face to come to terms with it. I guess it is an old story: two lovers who cannot love because of who they are. This dates back to Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is old, it is an intelligent plot as there is no clear cut solution. Karen knows her job, but she also knows her feelings for Jack. The bedroom scene is one that adds to the character of Karen as she begins to doubt Jack's sincerity, believing he is only doing it for a dare, but he is not. We know Jack and we know that this is not a simple one night stand for him.Jack is really a noble character. He is a bank robber, but he does not use violence, and in fact he has never fired a gun. He is also a very intelligent and observant character. When he sees the accountant in gaol who has a lot of money sequestered away, he protects him believing that he will benefit afterwards. He doesn't ask for money, but rather relies on his generosity - which turns out to be non-existent when he throws a security uniform at Jack and tells him to work his way up from the bottom.I guess, when I think about it, this is a very good movie as it develops the characters and gives them life. I like intelligent and honourable criminals, namely because I have never met one - I guess it is one of those fictions that don't really exist. The characters have their strengths and flaws and each of them is developed independently. The movie focuses on Jack and Karen, but the others, including Snoop (who is a bad guy in the movie) and Jack's confidant are also well rounded characters. What is interesting is the sister of Jack's confidant. She is a born-again Christian and Jack's Confidant tells her everything. She does turn him in, if the crime has not yet been committed, but he seems to owe her something.",Out of Sight
29,slightlymad22,One Of Clooney's Best,9,29 October 2014,"I can see why ""Out of Sight"" is one of George Clooney's favourite films on his resume. Even though it didn't do very well box-office wise, it is a really good film with a great screenplay. Based on the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard and excellently directed by Steven Soderbergh it's a joy.Plot In A Paragraph: An escaped convict (George Clooney) takes a female US Marshall (Jennifer Lopez) hostage whilst making a get away. They share an instant mutual attraction and it's not long before their paths cross again.Clooney and Lopez make a very sexy couple and the famous trunk scene is superb. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. George Clooney is at his charismatic best. Ving Rhames is solid support while Jennifer Lopez who I'm not really a fan of looks gorgeous and does a good job acting wise. Dennis Farina pops up as her Dad, and is as reliable as he always is. Michael Keaton reprises his role from ""Jackie Brown"" and seems to be having a lot of fun doing do so. Steve Zahn does his usual Steve Zahn routine, but here it works. Don Cheadle is also very good. This is the first collaboration between Soderbergh and star George Clooney, and give how well they worked together it's no surprise they re teamed several more times.",Out of Sight

The plot is that a bank robber breaks out of jail and meet a US Marshall who starts a race to catch him before he makes his next robbery.I liked this movie because of the plot and the nice direction of Steven Soderbergh who made a really good job on it. I also liked the interpretations of George Clooney who played as Jack Foley and Ving Rhames who played as Buddy Bragg and he reminded me another interpretation of him in Mission Impossible II.

33,Anonymous_Maxine,The interesting story and the quality performances (mostly from George Clooney and Ving Rhames) save Out of Sight from being a run-of-the-mill action film.,9,6 March 2001,"(SPOILERS) In an excellent opening sequence, George Clooney walks out of a large building, roughly yanks his tie off, and throws it to the ground with all his might in a way that only George can. This guy is one of the best actors working right now, and his characteristic performance in Out of Sight is clearly no exception. The unique bank robbery that follow the tie scene is both innovative and surprising, because you just don't expect George to get caught just because his crappy car won't start, especially after such a flawlessly executed robbery.The thing that sets Out of Sight apart from other action romance films is that it's got a sufficiently original love story that is propelled by a uniquely presented storyline. The way that time is twisted around in the presentation of the film makes it more interesting, because it gives the audience a way to go back and see what happens before that hilarious opening sequence. Jennifer Lopez provides the only downfall of the film, horribly miscast in her role but luckily the quality of the rest of the cast makes up for the terrible black mark that she causes. She's just too cutesy and too obviously put in the movie for no other reason than to have a good looking celebrity in her role in the film, despite the fact that she clearly doesn't belong. Casting her in this film parallels the absolute stupidity of casting Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist in The World Is Not Enough, the 19th Bond film which, sadly, was otherwise too weak to survive her laughable performance.Out of Sight not only presents excellent character development but also a very complex plot, which is one of the best parts of the film. The diamond heist that makes up the majority of the latter part of the film is particularly well done, even if the criminals were a little blown out of proportion. But at least the group of criminals presented is fairly diverse. You have a leader, a squirrelly know-it-all guy from whom the entire heist is nearly stolen, and they even threw in a clumsy fat guy who was more interested in the big steaks in the fridge of the house they had broken into than he was in stealing the diamonds. It was particularly amusing the way that that guy died, by shooting himself in the head after tripping on his way up the stairs to get George, who he had at gunpoint (which is weird, because I could have sworn that that scene was in Suicide Kings).At any rate, the thing that really made the romantic element of the film work (the tired theme of the law officer falling for the con) was that it was more realistically presented than they usually are. In general, you have the law officer pulling some strings or breaking the law in his or her own clever way to win the con's freedom, legally or not, but this was not the case in Out of Sight, and it's a good thing, too. Instead, in one of the best endings of any film in years, George is given a ride back to jail (after having been captured by Lopez after the botched diamond heist) in the back of a van with Samuel L. Jackson, who just happens to be a famous break out artist. It's not long before their brief conversation reveals to George the opportunity that Lopez put in front of him by pairing him up with Sam, and this sure as hell beats a riding-off-into-the-sunset ending. It leaves a huge hole for a sequel, but as much as I loved this film, I hope that they don't make a sequel. First of all, it would have to be DAMN good to do this movie justice, and second of all, a sequel just isn't necessary. Out of Sight leaves you with a smile on your face, because of what you can foresee about George's future as well as the cleverness of the entire film, and there's really no reason to go any further. Enjoy the film as it is, because quality cinema like this doesn't come along very often.",Out of Sight

And the female lead is Jennifer Lopez, that Puerto Rican glamour gal that everybody is always raving about, and whom I struggle to appreciate. (She doesn't look very Hispanic to me, though I know she is 100%. Maybe this all goes to show that Puerto Ricans are so much less Hispanic than, say Mexicans. I wonder if her parents danced around singing 'I Like to Be in America' when they arrived in New York. Wouldn't it be nice if they had?) The story is based on one of those endless novels written by the prolific Elmore Leonard, always good solid stuff. This time 'Jay Lo' is the cop and Clooney is the crook. Guess what? She can't resist him. So she is chasing him and sleeping with him at the same time. No physicist can provide an equation for such a combination of rest and motion at the same point in space-time, but the movies can do it effortlessly. There are some really witty lines in this film.

He's like a B list actor who thinks he's an A list and tries to take up more bandwidth than is called for in the story or the script.The movie tries to be artsy or cool by taking unusual steps in the story which is another thing that annoys me.Basically the story is pretty good, and if they didn't play with the script as much, and tried to deliver solid performance on the strength of the actors, and more focus on motives of the individual, the overall product could have been better.Jennifer Lopez gets it as she usually does on what needs to be done.

The fact that we're actually meant to take it serious is preposterous and if I'm honest this aspect alone sucked most of the life out of the film. Some of J Lo and Clooney's scenes together seem to show evidence of a director who may have been more in love with the leads than they were with themselves. In fact to call some of it 'self-indulgent' would be an understatement.Out Of Sight is another film with a non-linear narrative which again isn't a problem for me, but I did feel that certain scenes were included that served no real purpose in the story; the character of Snoopy Miller is given quite a large backstory from when he was in prison and about him being a boxer and how he met Foley etc. Yes I get that Miller is relevant to the story, but what relevance did all of the above have to the story? Would it have made any difference if Miller and Foley simply met on the outside? To me a lot of this felt like padding and I just felt that if Soderbergh stretched this film anymore it would snap. The same thing could be said for Michael Keaton who shows up in the film for about 10 minutes in a worthless role that added absolutely nothing to the film (it was an uncredited role according to IMDb).I'm always prepared to forgive some flaws within a film if it is either interesting or entertaining, but Out Of Sight doesn't even fulfil these basic needs. What story there is seems to be pretty much forgotten until about the last 15 minutes and prior to this you're left with an uninteresting and jarring narrative and J Lo and Clooney either stalking each other or making doe eyes at each other. The only things really running in this film's favour is Clooney and Rhames' chemistry and the film also benefits from good performances from the principal cast (particularly Rhames and Cheadle who rarely disappoint).Out Of Sight is pedestrian, meandering, sluggish and dull and even the sight of an impossibly attractive J Lo being in this film isn't enough for me to be able to recommend it.",Out of Sight

It has that easy, laconic, dialogue heavy yet not too dense way about it that just makes for easy watching. George Clooney, all effortless cool and swagger, plays Jack, an ex con who crosses paths with Federal Marshall Karen Sisco, a no nonsense girl who gradually finds herself attracted to Jack. Lopez is underrated as an actress and I get excited every time she has the chance to give a good genre turn (The Cell, U Turn). Their chemistry on screen is electric, especially in one sequence where they are locked in a car trunk, casually discussing movies as they each begin to become more comfortable in each other's presence. Leonard, also penning the books which would go on to become Jackie Brown, Get Shorty and FX's Justified, works with a naturalistic, free flowing form when creating his characters, and it's wonderful to see unfold on screen. Dennis Farina is sympathetic as Lopez's father, Michael Keaton shows up as another Marshall, and their is solid work from Steve Zahn, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, and a surprise cameo right in the end.

Jack and Karen hit it off big time, despite being on opposite sides of the law, but a bungled robbery at a rich man's house in Detroit pits them against each other. Will love overcome business differences ? A well-made, sassy, punchy crime-thriller based on one of Elmore Leonard's great pulp crime novels, this movie is a bit schizophrenic. Half of it is hard-as-nails bad-boy action, with Clooney as a latter-day Cagney, busting heads and trading quips. The other half is a smoochy romantic pot-boiler with him in his more familiar Cary Grant persona. It's good, but he's a bit sappy at times (unlike, say, Chili Palmer in Get Shorty, which was made by the same writer and producers), which dissipates the tension and pads it out a bit much for my liking. Lopez is good too, cool and remote, with too much attitude and lipstick, but she's not quite in the Lana Turner / Barbara Stanwyck league. Scott Frank's screenplay is full of quotable dialogue and the film does not want for style; there is particularly brilliant editing by Anne V. Coates, with plenty of aptly-placed fades and jump-stills. I'm not quite sure why I didn't like this movie more - it's got plenty of pedigree and all the performances are good, particularly Cheadle as the scary but dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks gangster. I think it's really just because I didn't know who to identify with; Jack and Karen are pretty slick but they're a bit too perfect and untouchable at the same time. Well worth a viewing though.

Once his escape the thought has gone as planned, Foley is hunted down by Sisco, while his accomplices which includes his trustworthy assistant Buddy (Ving Rhames) and his not so reliable ally Glenn (Steve Zahn) work their ways to one of the more wealthier suburbs located in nearby Detroit. There they join forces with a suspicious business dealer named Ripley (Albert Brooks) who once sent them to jail on account of uncut diamonds found in his home. A dangerous assassin named Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle) has plans to invade Ripley's mansion accompanied his posse which includes Kenny (Isiah Washington) an White Boy Bob(Keith Loneker). While this is happening, Foley and Sisco get comfortable with each other in a Detroit hotel room where their romance is put to the test concludes in showdown as Foley enters Ripley's estate which contribute to the fun that they were having together. The question is are they in love or is Sisco pursuing to have him arrested? The first thing that caught my eye when watching ""Out of Sight"" was that it was very cool. But ""cool"" can be very hard to evaluate. I've been around movies for over 20 years and there have been equally proportioned good ""cool"" and bad ones as well. In many way, Steven Soderburgh has captured the coolness of this film as a reminiscing of the old 1960's espionage heist film that had run rampant in that time period. The cat games seem to make it very obvious. For a film to succeed in being cool, you need to convey manipulative tactics to your audience to make them think that this movie truly defines ""cool"" so that they can demand for more. By the time this movie makes it to Detroit is when the cool factor really starts to kick in and that was when I was really starting to like this film.In this movie we can all appreciate the cool things about it, but the more specific definition of the cool factor of this movie is the sexiness it brought to the screen that both genders can truly pander about. I think we all now by now that J-Lo is not that great of an actress. At best she can come across as an average performer (it may not help that her career choices in films have not always been to kind to her). But in ""Out of Sight"" I'll let the blind squirrel find his nut. In other words, she actually was pretty good here. That's mainly because Mr. Soderburgh knew that at best Miss Lopez can excel if she doesn't do very much on screen. In reality, it's the camera-work that's the real star here and it gives J-Lo the chance to reveal her sumptuous physique without really do much of anything else.On the contrary, George Clooney is a very capable and more competent performer than J-Lo and his camera-work excels better because he can still convey sex appeal to the female audience while at the same time he could back it up with versatile acting. And instead he can takes more charge to the camera than J-Lo and never lets it usurp him. So his combination of suave and talent embodies the dynamics of Clooney's repertoire.Now in most films cool and suave would surely not churn out a film that is real. But much to my surprise, ""Out of Sight"" actually has a believable story nailed into the suave and sex appeal behind and is never upstaged by it. There are some implausible scenarios that are a bit far-fetched like the climactic heist near the end of the film. But the characters succeed in keeping it real and the situations they face give us that impression as the film progresses. There is great chemistry between J-Lo and Clooney and we feel for them all the way through the film even though they're from the opposing sides of the law (opposites attract). The other supporting cast were also convincing including Ving Rhames as Clooney's trusted accomplice, Steve Zahn as the screw-up assistant and Albert Brooks as the rich nerdy guy. Behind this heist film, we have lots to believe.The camera-work was really put together quite elegantly where the rural and the urban settings really cooperate quite nicely. I thought it was quite believable that Miami looks very vibrant and colorful and while the mean streets of Detroit has the darkness dominating the streets with the exception of the odd bluish tint. And for that the cool factor comes into play with the impression that Mr. Soderbergh chose style over substance in this movie. There are a lot of crime-dramas out there that either choose, style, substance or plausibility. But in ""Out of Sight"", we see all three come together and to me it really makes my days all the more better.",Out of Sight
46,philip_vanderveken,I expected more from this movie.,6,14 November 2004,"Perhaps I'm one of the few people who thinks so, but if you ask me this movie is a little bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, I did like most of the movie, but it isn't as good as I expected it to be. The movie started very promising but than it lost most of my attention until the last 20 minutes or so. I liked the idea behind the gentleman - bank robber who doesn't need a gun or a fast car to rob a bank. Clooney did an excellent job portraying this thief and I loved to see him play this role. I even liked Jennifer Lopez' role in this movie, even though she wasn't really exceptional if you ask me. She was too much the stereotypical female cop that has to prove she can do anything her male partners can, but than even better... ending up in bed and falling in love with the man she is supposed to throw in jail.It's probably not easy to make an original movie with this concept, but I expected more from Soderbergh. I give this movie a 6/10.",Out of Sight
47,Sergeant_Tibbs,Leonard and Soderbergh are a great team. Some of their finest work on screen.,8,12 September 2014,"I'm not usually a Soderbergh fan. I usually find him half-baked and half-interested in what he's doing. But Out Of Sight is his most pristine and complete picture. That doesn't necessarily equate to a winner, but with Elmore Leonard's source material, it's thoroughly entertaining and slick. From Get Shorty and Justified, his style has such an endearingly casual way to approach a colourful network of energetic and morally grey characters that it's just a joy to watch even in sinister moments. Their presence may be fleeting, but they add to the personality. Working off the back of George Clooney's charm here helps, firmly establishing his typecast role for a while of handsome crook. He does it well is why. But he has a hell of a cast behind him full of familiar faces. However, beyond the intricate plotting and witty dialogue, what makes Out Of Sight special is the thoughtful editing. Usually when a film designs its structure over cutting back and forth without justification it can be jarring, but here it adds so much texture to the film, especially in a memorable intimate scene between Clooney and J-Lo. Leonard's words is what makes the film delicious subversive and engaging, but it's Soderbergh's tight touch that does it justice. Definitely worthy of its cult status over the years and most likely his finest work. 8/10",Out of Sight
48,btreakle,Great movie,9,1 July 2020,"This was a well put together movie about a bank robber and a federal marshal and the chemistry that inevitably develops between them . Clooney and Lopez are great. And a great supporting cast.

49,seymourblack-1,Opposites Attract,9,7 August 2011,"""Out Of Sight"" is a crime thriller which neatly combines action, comedy and romance with dialogue which is sharp, scintillating and witty and characters who are fascinating to watch. The humour is extremely enjoyable, the action is full of surprises and the characters, with their various flaws and weaknesses provide the movie with its strongest element.Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a bank robber extraordinaire who's spent too much of his life in prison. His modus operandi involves the use of charm and intelligence rather than guns and masks but when his getaway car fails to start after his latest robbery, he soon finds himself incarcerated in a Florida prison.He joins some other inmates in a jail break but is suddenly confronted by Federal Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) who threatens to shoot him if he continues. Fortunately, Jack's friend Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames) had also been waiting for him outside the prison and quickly bundles Karen and Jack into the trunk of his car before driving off at great speed. Surprisingly, during their time together in this exceedingly confined space, the couple develop a certain rapport and it's quickly evident that there's a strong attraction between them.During his time in prison, one of Jack's fellow inmates was Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks), an ex-Wall Street man who'd been convicted for being involved in insider trading. He'd openly told others in the prison about the $5 million worth of uncut diamonds that were hidden in his mansion in Detroit, so after the jail break, some of the escapees make their way to Detroit with the intention of robbing Ripley's house.Jack, having reached a point in his career where he felt that he could never face another spell in jail, decides to take part in the robbery as it could provide him with one last big pay day before he retires from his life of crime. Karen, however, is determined to stay on his trail and their confrontation at the Ripley mansion turns out to be both tense and unpredictable.Jack and Karen are both repeat offenders. He's had a long career of robbing banks and spending time in prison and Karen has consistently been attracted to the guys who she should be bringing to justice. They're both intelligent but also have lapses where their normally good judgement fails them. Getting involved with each other is dangerous for Jack and unprofessional for Karen. Jack also aims to profit from one last job although, by his own admission, he's never known of any criminal who's successfully achieved such a thing.Clooney and Lopez are both very good individually and sensational together as they so powerfully convey the intensity of their mutual attraction. The supporting cast are also top class. Ving Rhames is superb as Jack's good friend whose weakness is his regular need to confess his wrongdoings to his sister. Don Cheadle is faultless as a vicious ex-boxer and ruthless murderer and Steve Zahn is funny and convincing as a slurring stoner who's not very bright and also totally unreliable.""Out Of Sight"" is a witty and offbeat film and the style of Steven Soderbergh's direction reflects this perfectly. The story about two opposites who attract each other is presented with great originality and the finished product is so engaging and enjoyable that it becomes one of those movies for which repeat viewings become irresistible.",Out of Sight
50,DunnDeeDaGreat,One of the best movies of summer 1998,9,24 May 2002,Out of Sight was one of the best movies released in the summer of 1998. Steven Soderbough is one of the best directors in Hollywood now and in this film he showed he could handle a lit star talent.

Popcorn fodder.",Out of Sight
52,jaredmobarak,Do you ever wear one that says 'undercover'?Out of Sight,9,6 August 2006,"If Out of Sight is any indication, I really need to watch more Steven Soderbergh films. This movie is great on many levels. I've seen and loved Traffic, The Limey is top-notch, and the Ocean's movies are enjoyable at times, however I never really jumped on the bandwagon. Maybe it was the boring, mediocre Erin Brochovich, or the fact that he left his indie roots to kick it with the big boys, I always pushed Soderbergh to the side, saying I'd get to him later. Well later has come. Out of Sight has pitch-perfect performances from every principal and supporting character on screen, the cross between drama, action, and comedy is flawless, and the style has just the right amount of flair.The film starts out by throwing us right into the middle of a heist. Through current happenings and scene specific flashbacks, we learn the back-stories of every character and learn to accept them for whom they are, while also allowing us to believe each one's evolution. George Clooney is great, as usual, playing himselfa smooth talking, slick ladies man, who gets the girl and the spoils. While Clooney could be knocked for not having much range as an actor, he sticks to his strengths and most times succeeds. His turn as a CIA agent in this year's Syriana was well-deserving of the Oscar win, and hopefully he will get credit for the work he has put forth throughout his career; that being solid performances full of natural charisma. Ving Rhames shows us why he is one of the best character actors working today. One of those guys that you don't mind seeing in every film, he doesn't have much to do here, (a part reminiscent to the one he reprises in the Mission Impossible series), he plays it right and never misses a beat. Don Cheadle also shows us the skill that he has finally been recognized for of late. The guy is great as the hero/good guy, (Hotel Rwanda, Manic), and here equal to the task as the villain. Cheadle shows some real malice here sadistic malice. You never know what he will do next because you actually believe he is capable of anything.Another thing this movie does is remind me how actors like Jennifer Lopez and Steve Zahn can really show skill when they have the right part. Zahn's crazy, naïve, vulnerability is exactly what is needed to play against serious sarcasm, like that thrown around by Clooney's character Foley. Zahn is seen too often in comedies where he falls flat and becomes redundant. He is the laugh man to any straight man, that is his strength and I wish we could see more of him in movies like this. As for Lopez, she really plays the role nicely. She exudes successful woman sexiness, quietly going through the movie, very low-key. This is before she became jack-of-all-trades, watering down her own image. As far as this film and Oliver Stone's U-Turn, she can pull off the gritty drama much better than the saccharine coated movies she churns out presently. Also, one cannot forget to speak of Albert Brook's chameleon-like performance. He is virtually unrecognizable until he speaks in the prison library. Expertly cast in the role, his serious tone lends itself well to the corporate criminal he plays, showing he means business while also letting some of his great comedic timing show through.Through it all there is a great heist story from accomplished author Elmore Leonard. Whether there are plot holes, I really don't remember. The brilliant performances draw you into their world completely and you go along for the ride without thinking twice. Soderbergh is an actor's director for sure. His use of large ensembles always shows off a comradery that is realistic; he allows his cast to have fun and it translates to the screen. He is an artist as well with these quasi-low budget cinematic stabs. Like The Limey, he films with some flair. The still-frame effect is used effectively as a dissolve between scenes. It gets a bit much at some parts where we are shown small hitches, but overall works well for the caper story narrative. When he cuts between Lopez and Clooney at the hotel bar and room, we are given an amazing visceral scene. This is the crowning achievement of the film. With the bar conversation voicing over the scene, we go back and forth between the sexual tension at the bar and the awkwardness of their almost school yard crush at bedside. It is a great sequence to be remembered for its delicate care.I hope to eventually see Soderbergh's recent film Bubble and its subsequent digital companions in the future. It will be interesting to see him direct amateurs and if his skills are as good as they seem when handling the egos of professionals. Sex, Lies, and Videotapes along with Schizopolis are entering the queue of movies to see, and hopefully his Ocean's 13, filming soon, won't ruin a good thing, especially since 12 came dangerously close to doing so already.",Out of Sight
53,mattymatt4ever,An impressive character study that works on many levels!,7,21 June 2001,"""Out of Sight"" is unlike the average crime drama of recent years.  I guess it's because the characters in this movie are actually DEVELOPED, and prove to be more than chess pieces in the plot to be moved around when conflict is needed.  Each character possesses their own sense of uniqueness.  And the interplay between each character is very interesting. 
I've never read any Elmore Leonard novels, but judging by this movie and ""Jackie Brown"" Leonard has a good knack for creating vivid characters.  The actors did a terrific job at inhabiting their characters.  I can't say anyone ""stole the show.""  The whole cast put their two cents into the film. George Clooney seems like he was born to play the role of low-key bank robber Jack Foley.  It's similar to his criminal role in ""From Dusk Till Dawn""--but with a lot more discipline and a lot less profanity.  Jennifer Lopez shows great charisma and dominance in her role as an FBI agent, who's committed to her job yet falls for Foley's (the criminal she's in hot pursuit of) charm.  This is one of her best roles up to date.  Ving Rhames is terrific as usual, as Foley's right hand man Buddy.  Of course, he plays his usual buffed-up bodyguard role, but I feel this one has more depth than his similar roles in ""Striptease"" and ""Entrapment.""  Don Cheadle, who I still feel is one of our best underrated actors, is great as an ex-con seeking to rip-off a snobby Wall Street broker (Albert Brooks).  Steve Zahn again shows his comic talent at playing the slow-witted accomplice.  Also look for Michael Keaton in a reprise of his role as Ray Nicolette from Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown.""  He has a hilarious scene where he interacts with Lopez's father (Dennis Farina, who gives another great, professional performance).  Finally, await a surprise cameo at the very end of the film. I REALLY hope that fellow IMDB users have not mentioned the cameo (That's very rude).  I'm sure you will be amazed and amused to find out who the mystery man is.  The dialogue is great and the characters exchange their words in a very down to earth manner.  This is the kind of film you watch and think to yourself, ""This is REALLY how people talk!""  Much like Soderbergh's debut sleeper ""sex, lies and videotape.""  Soderbergh's direction is vivid and lively, and is best demonstrated in the witty interaction between Clooney and Lopez in the bar, in which he intercuts between them staring into each other's eyes and them in the hotel slowly undressing, while their voice-overs narrate their thoughts.  I loved the music, including great soul hits like ""It's Your Thing.""  The flaws?  The film's episodic fashion gets meandering at points, and causes you to slightly lose interest.  In other words, it could've moved at a faster pace.  And maybe a few more minutes in the editing room. 
""Out of Sight"" is identical to a Tarantino crime caper:  vivid characterizations, vivid dialogue including moments of kooky small talk and hysterical comedy, use of great soul classics, etc.  Everything except the nonstop profanity.  Not to say that the language in this film is sanitized, but considering the standard R-rated flick, no one should be strongly offended.This is a smart, witty, funny, often engaging crime caper that is definitely worth a look.  And yes, the movie does prove to be OUT OF SIGHT!!!My score:  7 (out of 10)",Out of Sight

This has a little more than a connection with ""Jackie Brown"", with Michael Keaton reprising his role which is something that doesn't happen very often in movies made by different people. This though isn't nowhere near as good as ""Jackie Brown"", the characters aren't as well crafted, it doesn't have the depth, and the plot in general is not as good or well told.

56,Bob-45,Confusing and Artsy,5,16 June 2000,"George Clooney plays a smug, smooth-talking (now THAT'S a stretch!) bank robber turned convict.  Jennifer Lopez plays a luscious strong-willed ""daddy's girl"" federal marshall. Was I expecting HAMLET here?  No, what I was expecting was a sensuous, electric, pulsating movie.  Well, I didn't get it. I felt there was little chemistry between the two stars, and that is killer in this kind of movie.  The most laughable scenes have Clooney standing up to genuinely dangerous looking black and white cons (isn't Clooney afraid he is going to break a nail?) This movie could have been a hoot if it didn't contain Elmore Leonard usual mean spiritedness.  The best performances come from the peripheral players, Ving Rhames (like THAT is a surprise!), Don Cheedle, Catherine Keener, Dennis Farina, Nancy Allen (looking surprisingly fetching) and, especially Albert Brooks.  Michael Keaton is also a hoot in an unbilled cameo as Lopez's thick, adulterous boyfriend; however THAT relationship undermines the credibility of Lopez's character. The movie is confusing.  It starts with a botched bank robbery, which ends with Clooney incarcerated in the Glades Prison in Florida.  Clooney escapes, with the help of Rhames, but Lopez just so happens to be on the scene.  Lopez apprehends Clooney but is overpowered by Rhames coming up behind her (like Lopez wouldn't have been sweeping the area with that shotgun, duh?) Lopez and Clooney wind up locked in a trunk together, and they talk, as Clooney gets familiar with her thigh (like real romantic, guys.) Rhames and Clooney talk about a botched robbery (not the same robbery as the beginning, mind you), then are left behind by Lopez as she talks another thick partner into running off with the getaway car.  We then see Clooney and Rhames arriving at the hideout. Clooney soaks in a hot tub, as Lopez sneaks up, stands over Clooney with her gun drawn. She then bends down, and Clooney kisses her, essentially pulling her into the tub.  Suddenly Lopez wakes up in the hospital. What the hell is going on? Ah, dream sequence, duh... The film flashes back and forth in time with very little sense of transition (thankfully there are no more dream sequences).  The director gives us quite a few flashes of ""razzle-dazzle"" photography and editing, none of which really adds to the excitement. I found myself squirming before this was over.

59,spookyrat1,Is this your first time being robbed?,7,22 July 2020,"Critically acclaimed, but definitely not universally seen, I can see both sides of the reasoning behind the attention Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight may, or may not have received. Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough with indie drama Sex, Lies, and Videotape lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry itself, but didn't gift him the commercial appeal of a Spielberg or Lucas. This was especially apparent after a number of commercial failures following Sex, Lies and Videotape. Out of Sight, represents his first self-acknowledged attempt to gain a foothold amongst the multi-plex masses. As such, in my opinion, it's a very well made, entertaining film. Not a great one, as some would have you believe, but a good one, worth seeing.Out of Sight features many of the Soderbergh hall marks, in that it is a crime/heist thriller with multi-dimensional storylines, some nonlinear storytelling and quite distinctive lighting and cinematography. But nothing to the degree that finds the story being overwhelmed by pretensions to arthouse significance, as might be claimed of much of his earlier work. It also has a terrific cast, boasts a killer soundtrack and has a couple of really appealing cameo appearances. Michael Keaton bobs up midway through, as a cross pollinating character, both for this film and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown. Then Samuel L Jackson emerges unexpectedly to wrap the movie up on a realistically positive, if not traditional Hollywood ending.What it does have is a narrative based on an Elmore Leonard novel. Leonard novels translated to the screen invariably mean plenty of dialogue, albeit clever and humorous in a frequently blackish way, but a surfeit of dialogue that may conversely lead to perceptions of a lack of action. Think Get Shorty! Be Cool! The afore mentioned Jackie Brown! The list is extensive. Out of Sight is one of these movies; a 2+ hour film with lots and lots of dialogue and earnest discussions surrounding shady ""jobs"", both carried out in the past and planned for the future, but no big set action pieces. It's the storyline and the characters which are the focus here and none more important than the relationship between non-violent career bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney) and US Marshall (runs in the family) Karen Sisko.Their chemistry in their (surprisingly only) 2 key scenes is palpably intense and enjoyable. Both are very good with Clooney consolidating his growing A-list status at the time and Lopez proving, with a deliberately understated sexiness, she can really act and is more than capable of carrying a picture as the lead actress. Terrific support from the likes of Ving Rhames kind of doing what he does in Mission Impossible, Don Cheadle convincing as the jocular, but clearly dangerous key villain and Steve Zahn, as the nervy, out of his depth, comic relief who is the instigator of much of the later action. The bench is just full of abundant talent.For this writer, Out of Sight, whilst not quite deserving of its critically showered, monumental status, is still a very entertaining, though talky, professionally made, fun, movie experience. It certainly deserved a greater audience on its initial release and likely needed to be promoted/handled better by its studio.",Out of Sight

I think neither of these stars have since had as strong roles as Foley and Sisco, respectively. The casting was perfect. The supporting cast is also superb and all the characters have at least one scene in which to shine. It is unusual to have secondary characters that are so memorable.

There ought to be a law in Hollywood that from now on, only Scott Frank should adapt Elmore Leonard novels.

I like George Clooney, even in films that people dismissed like ONE FINE DAY and THE PEACEMAKER(okay, BATMAN AND ROBIN sucked, but that wasn't just his fault), and he was great here, showing both his charm and the danger behind that charm.

66,Offworld_Colony,Out of Sight is perpetually a film that I want to love.,7,17 February 2020,"I actually think I should love it. But I don't. I keep watching this movie to try and find out why. It has everything I love in it, hard boiled source material, slick George Clooney, badass Jenny from the Block, a funky soundtrack and more. However watching it in scratchy, sometimes out of focus, but undeniably beautiful 35mm (which is leaps and bounds above the flat DVD release) I sat back and lived in its whimsical and hypnotic, sometimes quixotic world.
It's got some wonderful little quirks; the idea of using language is thick in this movie, manipulation and coercion and to express intimacy. The tone shift from Miami to Detroit takes us from the hot sticky LA inspired noirs to the hard cold NY ones well as the movie darkens and becomes moodier and sexier. The trunk scene is still a wonderful exchange married with the bar scene. The film can't hold a candle to the relaxed but fiery patter of Oceans 11 but it's certainly a sexy film. Also there's a nice repeated motif of having side characters talk absolutely unrelated nonsense conversations that intercut with the main material, I don't know why but I like it. Toss in Keaton as a recurring role and some tremendous bit part actors, and you've got a slew of cool.
But maybe I can't live it because it's neither full 90's hardcore neo noir with whipsmart Tarantino dialogue, nor is it fully realistic and grounded as a crime caper. Maybe because it's a split of these tones and because Soderbergh's always made films of his time, this film has dated in many ways. Maybe it's everything about this movie that's great is also exactly the thing that doesn't work for me. I get that this movie is critically acclaimed but I can only enjoy it as a beautiful, moody, sexy little bit of fun. It's a one night stand flick, not wife-ting.",Out of Sight
67,chrisbrown6453,Probably the best forgotten movie...,8,27 July 2000,"Not too many people would rank this movie very high, but I definetly think it deserves the 9 stars that I gave it.  George Clooney is fast becoming one of the best actors around, and I know watching Ms. Jennifer Lopez might be hard, it's well worth it. Although the whole movie is great, I actually think that the best part was the last 3 minutes.****WARNING SPOILER AHEAD****They better make a sequel, because when it ended with George Clooney talking with non other than the bad ass himself Samuel L. Jackson, WOW!  What a combination!",Out of Sight
68,chrisbrown6453,This was a very cool movie.,8,21 June 2002,"It had cool actors, a cool script, and some very cool music. George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, so needless to say, with him and Jennifer Lopez in the same movie, I was in for a good time. And I was not disappointed. While the movie did slow down a little half way through, the rest of it was a lot of fun to watch. Clooney stars as Jack Foley, a bank robber who has the distinction of robbing the most banks probably in history, without ever using a gun. His style is shown within the first two minutes of the movie, as he spots a bank from across the street, and just decides to go ahead and rob it. He would have gotten away with it had his car started. So he's off to prison, where he realizes he can't stay because he doesn't want to get old. He enlists his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames) to help him break out. But the escape is almost foiled when lovely Federal Officer Karen Sisco (Lopez) happens upon them. Buddy and Jack decide to take her with them, and Jack and Karen are thrown into the trunk of her car for the getaway. Well, they sort of fall for each other, a la `love at first sight,' while in the trunk, and the rest of the movie involves whether or not they can, or should, get together.  Oh yea, they also plan to do a home invasion of a man with millions of dollars of uncut diamonds. With a cast that includs Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, Dennis Farina, and Steve Zahn, Out of Sight is a well acted, well written story. The movie doesn't go from point A to point B. Sort of like Pulp Fiction it starts at point A, goes back in time to show how we got to point A, veers off to follow another story, comes back to the main story, and continuously jumps back and forth to see what happened in the past, and what happened in previous scenes we never saw finish. But it's not as confusing as what I just wrote. It all makes perfect sense, and it's very interesting. Now, some people are going to say, how is it possible that a Federal Officer and a three time convicted bank robber would possible get together? Have you seen these two people? Besides, their characters are both hard driven people, and I don't really care how unlikely it is, the path they take to try and get together is fun to watch. Clooney's character is very smart; he just decides to use his brains to steal. But he has a heart as well. Lopez's character is also very smart, and all she wants to do is prove that she can make it in what is generally considered a man's job. This is really a different kind of movie. More low-key, better acted, no big explosions, and one very funny death scene on a stairwell. Definitely one to see.",Out of Sight

It's not a movie that bores but from the moment starts you know in whose arms Lopez will end and before the arrival, the director thinks it's necessary to tell the viewer some complicated tales (the movie has so many flashbacks that a box of aspirines is better on the table) and as said you can easily skip some minutes of the movie, you wouldn't have a miss a thing...

Now, I know Clooney isn't the most terrific actor out there, but if there was a movie that he should be nominated for, then this is it.And to take it a step further (though you'll really hate me for this) Jennifer Lopez plays her part passionately and yes, I believe she should have been nominated too (it still being the only good role she's played.).Great movie, 8.5/10.",Out of Sight
74,bh_tafe3,A star is born in Classy action flick,9,27 June 2014,"As well as being a classy movie with great duologue, wonderful chemistry between its two leads and a great plot, Out Of Sight was also a significant touchstone in 90s and 00s film as it was the movie where both George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez came of age. Up until this film both had shown promise, Lopez with her turn in the biopic Selena and Clooney in his roles on ER and in From Dusk Til Dawn. But neither had really established themselves as either quality big screen actors or as stars.One magical scene in the trunk of Lopez's car changed all of that. As soon as that scene was over you knew both were going places and by the end of the film we were looking at two of the biggest stars in Hollywood. For both actors, this was the role they were born to play. Clooney as a cool, charming, fatalistic crook Jack Foley and Lopez as sassy, sexy, tough and yet vulnerable FBI agent Karen Cisco.Adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, the film is essentially about an FBI agent attempting to track down a master thief that she is infatuated, possibly even in love, with after being locked in the boot of her car with him during his escape. It's a premise brimming with possibilities, and in this case is executed perfectly, in no small way thanks to superb direction from Steven Soderbergh and an excellent cast.Lopez and Clooney's career- defining turns are joined by great supporting performances from Dennis Farina, Steve Zahn, Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames and Luis Guzman, with cameos from Michael Keaton and a big name African American star (who I won't name here) at the film's end to up the enjoyment still further.Out Of Sight was a great film when it came out in the late 90s, and is still just as entertaining today. Well made, well acted, timeless, sexy and classy. A great piece of Hollywood film making and one of the best films of the 90s.",Out of Sight
75,kgprophet,The Best Film of Soderbergh's Career,7,1 July 2012,"Watching this film again in 2012, I realise this is Soderbergh's best film. There is so much that is done perfectly, from the screenplay to the editing. Any filmmaker can take chances, but to have the intelligence to determine what works and what doesn't is a more difficult thing to pull off. In this case a risk was taken to have a long scene near the beginning of the film take place with the two lead actors laying inside a truck. It turns out the scene didn't work.. at first. But the filmmakers went back, reshot and recut the scene, and the right choices were made and created the right mood and chemistry. This film was early in the careers of Clooney and Lopez (and Soderbergh), and there is an undeniable sizzle in the way the actors are dressed and photographed. Don Cheadle is also a standout, creating a menacing screen presence as a fast-talking and reckless hood. This film also propelled Steve Zahn's career, playing a gullible stoner whose life gets more frustrating scene after scene. Albert Brooks shows a sinister side in a small role as a rich businessman, which he reprises to a degree in 2011's ""Drive"". Based on a novel, there is a series of set pieces, featuring unique outcomes that resemble ""Pulp Fiction"", which no doubt had a heavy influence as it did other films during this era. There is a hit 70's soundtrack, Ving Rhames, with editing back and forth within the story. Again, these could come off as just gimmicks, but in this case it creates a more entertaining approach, primarily to add background to a character on the spot, instead of presenting the character earlier in the movie in a traditional linear way.The story has a good deal of ""Pulp Fiction"" elements, where not-too-small hoods try to commit a crime, in this case stealing a pile of diamonds hidden in a house. The film opens with a scene that actually takes place halfway through the story. Soderbergh had developed a reputation of working with A list actors intelligently, and here, he sculpts dialogue and storytelling by selective details and editing, creating character depth and growth in smart ways. He allows the actors to improvise when the spontaneity can create a spark of realism and unpredictability. This is why the approach to the love affair between Clooney, a bank robber, and Lopez, an FBI agent, works. They deal with the in-congruency of the relationship with abrupt mood changes and indecision. The same goes for the build-up to the big heist at the end. It is hard to tell who will prevail, who will die. A less smarter script might have put the female FBI agent in danger where our lovable bank robber comes to her rescue. Instead, the gender twist on the FBI agent is only briefly addressed in a more subtle way.There are many memorable lines, and some are due to the well seasoned script, that layers nuance on the characters. Rhames plays a bank robber with a soft side, and tells Clooney he needs to talk problems out by calling his sister. This makes a climactic moment between the characters at the end of the film more meaningful when Clooney tells Rhames ""You'll be talking to your sister for a month"". All supporting characters have weight in this film, even though it ultimately is a romantic comedy. But it is the layers in storytelling that make this film many things at once; a thriller, a character study, and an art piece.",Out of Sight

SO many useless scenes and exposition...And for a movie about convicts and ex convicts, I am surprised that a rated R movie did not have a single nude woman considering how many chicks were constantly in the film. IT was 1998, Jennifer Lopez could have still done with a nip slip or something.

79,bix171,The Chemistry Is Not Quite There,5,31 October 2015,"Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Scott Frank mix up the sequencing of the usually straightforward-to-a-fault novelist Elmore Leonard but that's about the only thing that sets it apart from other films taken from Leonard works. I have not read the novel on which the film is based but Frank's script hews closely to the Leonard oeuvre in its utter predictability in character, plotting and the sophisticated banter between criminals and cops that lacks any real world credibility. George Clooney plays an escaped bank robber who develops a relationship with the federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) on his trail. (Typical of Leonard's cool cucumbers, the word ""love"" is never mentioned.) Soderbergh seems to be seeking the same kind of off-kilter, casual chemistry between his leads that Stanley Donen was able to find with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in ""Charade"" but Clooney and Lopez don't seem to jell--they seem to be nervous around each other. When they meet-cute in the trunk of a getaway car, it should be a tense and electric moment the film can expand from but instead comes off as awkward and strained with Lopez in particular unsure of how to react. The rest of their interactions are spent trying to recover from that failed moment. As usual, Soderbergh knows how to entertain his viewers with visual flair; he gets great support from Anne V. Coates' fluid editing and while Elliot Davis' camera-work is not as eloquent as Soderbergh's own, it does have its flashes, particularly in the night scenes. Lopez and Clooney are surrounded by a powerhouse cast that includes Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks, Steve Zahn, Luis Guzman, a wasted Michael Keaton, an uncredited Samuel L.

80,mhasheider,A solid piece of good filmmaking.,8,29 July 2000,"I originally thought ""Out of Sight"" was going to be another flop because George Clooney had a leading role in it.  After watching the film, I may have been a bit harsh on Clooney.  The movie is based on an Elmore Leonard novel where a highly-skilled bank robber named Jack Foley (Clooney) breaks out of a Florida prison with the help of a friend, Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames) and takes a woman who has a loaded shotgun hostage.  Foley and the woman are forced into the trunk of her car and he finds out that she's Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), a beautiful federal agent.  The conversation that they have is quite interesting and it's very different from the one that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have in ""Heat"". The supporting cast in this movie is terrific.  Clooney, Lopez, and Rhames give nice performances.  But I enjoyed Steve Zahn, who is wonderful as the ill-minded Glenn Michaels and Don Cheadle is superb as the mean ex-boxer Maurice Miller.  Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks, and Catherine Keener are included in the solid cast.  Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson are unbilled.   The movie was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who's past directing credits include ""sex, lies, and videotape"", ""The Limey"", and ""Erin Brockovich"".

She's kinda cute, actually. Strongest point in this movie however are the supporting roles: the gang of stupid criminal losers like Snoopy and White Boy Bob really steal the show. George Clooney is OK too, the story is quite refreshing and sometimes even a little funny, and the direction is very slick and stylish.

His chemistry is great with Ving Rhames and even more electric with Lopez (who is so good she makes you forget she's much too young for her character, and for Clooney), and perhaps best with Albert Brooks, never missing a beat in straddling buddy-action-patter, torrid romance, and ironic comedy.  I also loved Nancy Allen's bit as Brooks' friend.My favorite inside-joke was having Michael Keaton show up at Dennis Farina's house playing the same FBI agent (Ray Nicolette) in the same manner that he played in ""Jackie Brown"".  Having Samuel L. Jackson show up in the final scene was simply classic.  The bit about Rhames and his sister was also just the right touch.  And Don Cheadle stole every seen he was in.

I was pleasantly surprised and truly felt that this had 'Jam' to it's game. Clooney brought the character into a beleivible place. He brought it into living color. The style and sharp spoken dialog, with his partner in crime, made this one a fun and especially tasty performance. Displaying that typical Clooney-charm that has made him a house hold name, and for good reason. George lacked nothing in my view. Along with Michael Keaton, Ving Rhames too, let us not forget, but most of all a lovely performance that made the romantic opposite grade, with Jennifer Lopez. When she was still wit diddy, ""Puffy"". However the distraction of the front page of the Natiional Inquirer, this film, was a pace setting action dramedy, with enough clout to offer to making a sequel.

He was an idiot anyhow. All who were involved, including the always awesome Dennis Farina, made this one stand out with other epic pictures, that will remain standing well into the future, when other movies have gone by the wayside.I really had a satisfying time with this one.

89,Pavel-8,"Yes, that's right...this movie is ""Out of Sight"".",9,15 December 2004,"When released in 1998, ""Out of Sight"" was Steven Soderburgh's most mainstream film to date, after he burst onto the indie scene a decade earlier with ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"". Based upon the novel by Elmore Leonard (""Get Shorty"", ""Jackie Brown""), the movie tells the tale of odd couple Jack Foley (George Clooney), a career criminal, and federal marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). After a unique first encounter, their paths continue intersecting, with various degrees of intent, to comprise the bulk of the story.Similar to the Soderburgh-helmed ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""Out of Sight"" blends the standard apples and oranges of genres into a delicious smoothie. This is a drama, minus the driving intensity, light-hearted enough to pass as a comedy. It's a comedy, but not of the HAHA sort. The humor lies in things like Clooney's glances, JLo's relationship dilemmas, the paradox of Ving Rhames' self-righteous thief, and the sheer absurdity of Don Cheadle's gangsta. It's also a romance and a cop-and-robber story, but neither love nor crime is the whole point. All of these pieces unite to form a fantastic puzzle of a picture.The tasty complexity is further deepened by the non-linear storytelling technique. Flashing backward here and there throughout the film is a good choice because the viewer can only fully understand the previous events with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. Plus it eliminates what could have been a painful first half hour of exposition, instead spreading the backstory through the rest of the film.The stylistic singular color palettes for different locations that Soderburgh later used magnificently in ""Traffic"" are present here as well. From bright sun-drenched Florida to the ice cold blues of Detroit, this technique serves as virtual atmosphere, allowing one to determine the geography even without the convenience of titles. In a non-linear film like this, that ease in recognizing time and place facilitates comprehension of what is happening when. Unique among Soderburgh's work (to my recollection) is the film's use of occasional freeze frames. Stopping the picture for just a second or two, Soderburgh gently identifies poignant moments, obvious or not, allowing an extra moment to deservedly linger on them.With the high technical accomplishments, the acting almost doesn't matter, but the slightly understated method works wonders. Clooney is his usual suave self, complete with snappy dialogue and a cornucopia of confidence. In a role that ""Enough"" can only dream about, JLo almost looks like a real actress (joke). She is absent her too-common ditziness and easily holds her own, despite being a tad too glamorous. Rhames, Cheadle, and Albert Brooks are their usual solid selves, playing parts both similar and drastically different from their wheelhouses. Everyone seems to have perspective in their parts, not utilizing excessive gravity or levity, but rather hitting the appropriate notes as they inhabit their roles to perfection. Ultimately you believe all of these actors in their parts, even if JLo's skirts are entirely too short for a federal agent.Like ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""Out of Sight"" is a very good film, merging quality in all aspects of film-making into a fully enjoyable two hour experience. The main themes of crime and love are basic, so the movie doesn't soar to remarkable heights. But if you're looking for a brilliantly made film that you might have missed on its theatrical run, espy Out of Sight and settle in for a quirkily involving night. If you saw it a few years back, check it out again to see Soderburgh's foundation for his own excellence.Bottom Line: A wholly absorbing movie that serves as a film-making clinic of brilliance. 8 of 10.",Out of Sight

93,Don-102,Elmore Leonard story scores again...,7,8 January 1999,"OUT OF SIGHT is the latest Leonard crime story successfully adapted to the screen. Along with Jackie Brown and other predecessors, you can add this to an ever-growing list of stylized films of the crime genre that put a spin on narrative, as well as showing a freshly dark and humorous side. Almost all of the characters could be on both sides of the fence, and with OUT OF SIGHT, you're never entirely sure how the lead characters, bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney) and FBI Marshall Karen SiSko (""that's Sisco with 2 s's, Jack"") played by the gorgeous and engaging Jennifer Lopez, will end up.Thankfully, the script does not take the usual Hollywood path of deciding against a character's realistic intentions. They do not exactly ride off into the sunset together. The film's ending is a clever way of balancing the action out, not to mention featuring a huge cameo by a rather famous star of these types of films (Look at the cast list and figure out who's missing). The love scene between Clooney and Lopez is absorbing and their chemistry is solid.

94,IamROCKAS,Charismatic heist comedy with a lot of good vibes,8,27 November 2020,"Two things can be said about the career of the director Steven Soderbergh - he has a willingness to fail and he has a constant routine of creative decisions. A process-rather-than-results person, he has been one of the most daring, unpredictable, and restless filmmakers around, as said by Indiewire, an online publication covering film, TV, and digital news. The spectre of Soderbergh's output includes everything from indie relationship drama to star-packed heist movies, from experimental, micro-budget thrillers to philosophical sci-fi, and from melancholy coming-of-age to kick-ass action. Out of Sight (1998) is a crime comedy and my first introduction to Soderbergh's filmography. The first impression was quite good, I can definitely agree that the process was more enjoyable than the result.Out of Sight left me in a position where I must try to somehow quantify and discuss how cool of a film it was. It might sound vague but it is the best word to describe the film. It reminded me of those sleek 1960's spy movies in a way that Out of Sight plays games with us, the audience. It teases us a lot throughout its run. Two major factors that make this movie cool is the charming (or should I say sexy) cast and an amazing soundtrack, which compliments the filmography and post-editing. The chemistry between Karen and Jack, portrayed by Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney, was utterly charismatic, Ving Rhames as the loyal friend Buddy was awesome and Steven Zahn as Glenn, the screw-up with the mean mustache, was comedically pleasing. The soundtrack doesn't provide any big artists but the choice of performers adds a lot to the cool vibe of the movie. The inclusion of performances by Dean Martin, The Isley Brothers, Willie Bobo, and Al Cooper kind of gave me the same vibes Miami Vice did back in the day - I didn't find anyone talking about the soundtrack of this movie in-depth and I would like to watch this movie again just to focus on each song and how they were used throughout the movie just because nobody else did yet (or at least I didn't find any information regarding this).",Out of Sight
95,ereinion,Disappointing,6,16 September 2003,"I had expected more of this film.I expected a great plot,charming characters and lotsa suspense and romance.Instead it turned out to be just a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez to show her acting skills and George Clooney to play a smartass charmer(hmm,isn't this familiar?).The story starts out well,but then it takes a 180 degree turn into a rather boring robber story.First flaw with the film is the character of Glenn.What is the point with this awful,annoying character?!?This is where the film first starts to show signs of typical Hollywood stupidity.There is no need for this guy and he doesn't do ANYTHING.He was a major pain in the ass to me and I found it hard to keep myself from changing the channel every time I saw him.Second flaw is that there is no point with all the flashbacks, the use of them was exaggerated by the cocky and over-ambitious Soderbergh.The background story with Jack Foley and his inmate friends really fails to make a meaningful connection to the rest of the plot.The pluses of this picture were Lopez and Catherine Keener,both good to look at and solid in their roles.Also Ving Rhames was quite good as the faithful pal Buddy.The showdown scene in the end where White Boy trips and shoots himself in the head was worth watching.Don Cheadle was OK,although not impressive.But George Clooney,although he didn't give a bad performance,failed to impress and really show himself as actor the way he did in ""From dusk till dawn"",""One fine day"" and ""O brother where art thou?"",and also ""ER"".Samuel L. makes a nice cameo at the end.So my conclusion is that this film tried to be too much somehow.It betted on one horse too many.I had liked it better if it was more focused on romance than all the robbery schemes and the dark past of its main male protagonist.For me,who had expected it to be a hidden gem of late 90's,it was a disappointment(although not major).What the heck,at least we got to see Clooney and JLO do it.;)",Out of Sight

Not that I mind when a director decides to be visionary or to turn the pop-corn screenplay he is given into a high art movie but... Well, let me say it like that. This movie could have been a great action comedy. It had the right screenplay and the right actors for that. But... Here is the problem - Steven Soderbergh did not have a clue how to make it entertaining. You know, that is what an action comedy is supposed to be - entertaining. But 'Out of Sight' is far from being an entertaining movie. There are visual experiments. There are long pseudo-meaningful scenes which do not add anything to the story. This movie is pretentious. But! There is just one problem but it is HUGE! The screenplay of the movie is not meant to be turned into a high art. There are some ""buddy-cop"" jokes for Christ's sake! Had this movie been directed by Richard Donner or some director like him it would be a lighthearted action movie. But no, Soderbergh wanted to be Serious. But the seriousness of his direction just doesn't go well with the jokes. This movie had to be fast paced. Instead it's pacing is incredibly slow. This movie had to be entertaining. Instead it is boring. This movie had to be funny. But it is not.I don't know why it is rated so high. I guess many people gave it good ratings because the were afraid they would look stupid if they didn't. There is no other explanation.",Out of Sight
98,Criticalstaff,A Prequel to Ocean's Eleven.,7,27 April 2020,"This movie is okay, it did not provide me much excitement. It is a noir-love story buried inside a heist movie inside an action film.However the movie is more interesting for everything that surrounds it rather than what happens in it. It is funny to see how similar it is to the Oceans' movie. They share all the same ingredients, except for the brutal violence that is in this movie. But the rest is pretty much on point, the camera work, the music, the dialog, the characters, even the tone with the witty funny light hearted lines.The actors are what elevates the film : the plot is very simple but it has this old-school-hustlers charm to it. The film has flashbacks and attempts to do non-linear storytelling, but it is not necessary, the characters actions drive the movie.George Clooney is suave robber Jack Foley, a character that is suave and cool, but not too much. He is street-wise and self-aware, he is the thief with a heart of gold. He is smart but that does not prevent him to fail in almost any of his schemes. We root for him not only because he his cool but also because the odds are against him. A character so efficient so relatable, so compelling that it will be the basis for glamour-superstar Danny Ocean.Jennifer Lopez is young try-hard Jennifer Lopez. It is endearing to see the freshness and naivete of her character. She is basically the female love interest and her role revolves around being obsessed with Clooney. Again the contrast modern Jlo is the most enjoyable.Don Cheadle plays the over-the-top villain. It works because is roughness and brutality play off against Clooney's smoothness.The heist barely matters really, and that is where the film achieves balance. The universe is grounded and realistic (very violent and raw), but the characters effortlessly glide through it. I think that it gives the edge that was lacking in the Oceans' and therefore made those movies rely more heavily on swagger and bravado rather than charm and wit. In Ocean's the world is effortless and cool and suave, the characters are cool and effortless and suave : it deflates the tension somewhat. In Oceans defence, it make the film more palatable for the mainstream. This film on the other hand cannot really escape its genre. It stays in the bounds of the action movie.This movie really acts a stepping stone for Clooney : it is part Dusk Till Dawn with the gruesome crime story and part Ocean's Eleven with the light hearted heist with no stakes.
The movies sexuality is also somewhat interesting. It is very difficult to watch in a post-me-too world. But in a strange way, it reinforce the overall sexual violence that the film portrays.
All in all it is a reflection of its era. I believe it stands next to Heat, Reservoir Dogs and others as part of the 90s golden age of heist-movies. The lost art of a simpler time.Also the best-scene of the film is when a van drives up a snow-covered alley. The mesmerizing way the tires plow through the fresh snow is something I don't recall having seen in film. (Was it special effects ? was it one take ? we may never know)",Out of Sight

I mean, come on, it's just a modest little caper movie for crying out loud, let's not get carried away. The main problem I had with it was the central relationship between Clooney and Lopez; I don't know, I just didn't buy it, they didn't convince me that they were so all-consumingly attracted to each other that they would jeopardize themselves the way they did. I think the initial conversation they had in the car would have needed to be A LOT better for me to go along with it all (although I couldn't say exactly how).Of course, since I didn't buy the central relationship, the fact that I still liked the film is a testament to how well everything else in the movie works. The cast is uniformly great - from Ving Rhames as Clooney's guilt-plagued assistant to Steve Zahn's memorable stoner of a crook. The look of the film is superb, and the chopped up editing works exceptionally well. Of course, it's easy to get the sense, while watching, that a great deal of craft and style has been expended to cover up what is essentially a mediocre story. So be it. It still works, if just barely, and is good for an evening of light entertainment. But as far as Elmore Leonard movies go, it doesn't hold a candle to Get Shorty.",Out of Sight

Personally, I love looking at that man - especially when he smiles so I enjoyed the opportunity to indulge there. He has a class and style I've not seen to appreciate since Carey Grant.

105,MadReviewer,"Smart, slick, and very entertaining",8,16 April 2001,"`Out of Sight', a fairly faithful adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel, is a clever, slick, sexy flick loaded with charm and wry humor.  Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a career bank robber who recently escaped from prison, Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is the Federal Marshall that Jack took hostage for a brief time in order to escape - and who's now trying to bring Jack back to jail.  Besides the obvious cat-and-mouse game of hunting down the illustrious Mr. Foley, there's a certain romantic connection going on between Jack and Karen that complicates things, as well as a plan to rob a Michael Milken-esque criminal of over one million dollars' worth of diamonds.The dialogue is vintage Elmore Leonard - lots of dry humor, lots of wisecracks, and perfect comic timing.  The chemistry between Clooney and Lopez is great; you actually find yourself caring a lot about what happens and will happen between the two.  The situation they're put in is slightly implausible (Federal Marshall falling in love with a career criminal . . . not exactly realistic); I don't know if the movie could've survived without the deft romantic tension between the two.  Also of note in the film is Don Cheadle as Maurice `Snoopy' Miller, the cold-blooded criminal who thinks he's a lot smarter than he really is.  `Snoopy' moves effortlessly between being laughably stupid and heartlessly cold-blooded, sometimes within the same scene.  His performance alone makes the movie worth watching.Soderbergh's direction is very good, if a little uneven - I think he was still finding his voice with this film and with `The Limey'.  A lot of the quick cuts between scenes are meant to be edgy, but wind up just being irritating.  Still, the story moves at a crisp pace, and some of the scenes (such as a meeting between Jack Foley and `Snoopy' Miller at a boxing gym) are brilliant.A highly entertaining film - I'm amazed this didn't do better at the box office when it was originally released.

Inside of this mirroring crime frame the mirror of the lady Marshall and the bank robber, the mirror of Karen and Jack, mirroring Garys and Celestes timeout. It is Karens luck but U.S. Marshall Karen Siscos bad luck, that she comes to the right place, but untimely too early, being involved against her will in the jail break, being suddenly Jack Foleys hostage, a career bank robber who prides himself on never having robbed a single bank with a gun. Leaving their own getaway car behind, Jacks partner-in-crime Buddy hides both in the trunk of her car. On their way to meet another partner-in-crime, Sisco and Foley talk, Karen and Jack stumbling into a love-trap. After her escape from Jack, she is his hostage  and he hers, love chained to each other as the hunted hunter, hunting the hunter. From now on they seek each other.

Karen as executing U.S. Marshal Sisco, chains Jack, the career bank robber at the stairs landing, facing the entering SWAT-team. Karen answers quickly the complaining Jack,""I am sorry, I wish it would have been different."" Karen Sisco, the U.S. Marshall, represents the executing part of Law, never forgot her duty, inside this frame as Karen Sisco, pleasured as Celeste the timeout. What she did as Karen and Celeste never was corruptious. And phone talking to her father, ""He knew what he was doing. Nobody .

111,AdFin,"Although it saw a step down for Soderbergh, there is no accounting for the subtle brilliance of this film.",8,23 February 2002,"Steven Soderbergh began the nineties hotly tipped as the next big thing, largely down to his debut film Sex, Lies & Videotape.  But Soderbergh decided that his films would not be mere Hollywood pap, that he would take that success and put his name to smaller, more personal projects.  Oh dear! The result was two of the most underrated films of the last decade, Kafka, and King of the Hill.  Following those set backs, and the wildly different Schizopolis Soderbergh began to make his way back to the mainstream, and although some would hail his new Hollywood movies as remarkable, I would argue that they in-fact show a step down for the director.  And the first step was out of sight.Based on Elmore Leonard's novel, it's easy to see how drab the film would have been were it not for Soderbergh's unique story framing, and the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez.  But it's hard to watch the film and not pick up on the subtle points in which Soderbergh is trying too hard to be Tarantino.  Tarantino was of course the director that had made the most fuss on the independent circuit following Soderbergh with Reservoir Dogs, and he himself probably saw ripping of the Pulp Fiction helmer a safe bet for success.  Foreshadowing what would follow with the seventies homage The Limey, Julia Robert's Oscar vehicle Erin Brockovich, and useless issue flick Traffic, Out of Sight showed a new Soderbergh, a Soderbergh all to ready to become the one-trick pony, using the same flash-back structure and jump-cut rhythm in all his subsequent films and sacrificing his once great talent.Out of Sight however, is early enough in the scheme of things to still count as a great picture.  The script is sharp and fast, and Soderbergh's loose direction fits the theme of the film.  Jennifer Lopez had not yet become that annoying cardboard singer J-LO, whilst Clooney manages to get through the film without a squint from under his brow.  There's also fine support from Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, Ving Rhames, Nancy Allen and the very funny Steve Zahn.  Add to that the excellent photography from Elliot Davis and you have a great romantic caper.  Sadly, at date of writing this is Soderbergh's last great film.  8/10",Out of Sight

Steven Soderbergh uses all kinds of directorial tricks to create a style that is at once a throwback to the gritty crime dramas of the 70s and a new style all of its own. The acting is first-rate. George Clooney perfectly nails a role that seems tailor-made for him. Jennifer Lopez is wonderful as the federal marshall who is pursuing and falling in love with him at the same time.

Jackson drops in, but you'll have to wait a while...Ving Rhames is great as Clooney's sidekick, and the writers use a wonderful handicap device for Ving's character that just tickles you. Luis Guzman is hilarious.",Out of Sight
116,mhoney-1,I used to like this better,10,28 November 2003,"""Out of Sight"" is the definitive George Clooney movie, and the one time I really liked something with Jenifer Lopez in it. I also have enjoyed the series ""Karen Sisco,"" spawned from this film. But to my surprise, reading the book made me hate things about this movie.When I read ""Get Shorty"" and watch the movie, I enjoy them both equally for their differences as well as their similarities. Not so with this movie. I have problems when a film decides, rather than to just change certain parts, altering how the characters get to where they're going, that they actually change the outcome of the story.Aside from character descriptions (in the book Foley was 47, Karen was blonde, and Buddy was white) it seems that they felt they had to ""Hollywood-ize"" the story. Most of the humor in the movie was absent in Elmore Leonard's novel. One thing I did enjoy, that was a stroke of original demented genius, is in the way that White Boy Bob is killed. But the drugged-up serial rapist character of Kenneth, and the sociopathic tendencies of Chino (Luis Guzman) are not so well drawn as in the book. Some scenes were just outright deleted, making the movie just a little more improbable.Don't get me wrong, I love the movie for what it offers. It's the things that are changed that make me feel like I was cheated. Through and through I'd give this a 7/10",Out of Sight

What a pleasant surprise too, to finally find someone with the talent and ''moxy'' to step up to the plate in complimentary fashion to Clint Eastwood.  On TV Clooney doesn't seem far from the ordinary, but has impressed in both films in which I've seen him.  López isn't upstaged or intimidated either, and does her share to make this duo dynamic.  This film's got great awards potential too, and the nominations come out next month.  The story is uncanny, but holds you from start to finish.  VERY well done (rating = 4 stars of 5).",Out of Sight

119,dcshanno,Good Little Movie,8,15 October 2004,"Ah, 1998 Bill Clinton was still in the White House, the Gulf War had no sequel, gas was under $2.00 a gallon, and a kinda-known actress was in her pre-J. Lo/Jenny from the Block/Bennifer/media whore phase.Back when she used to have a little (now she has a lot), Jennifer Lopez was actually enjoyable in Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight.' I saw this in the theater when it came out and remember thinking it was one of the better films I'd seen that year. I watched it again last night on DVD, and I have to say that it still holds up. Clooney is finally given a worthy vehicle, and he and Lopez have actual, undeniable chemistry on the screen. The supporting players (especially the incomparable Don Cheadle) are perfectly cast. Soderbergh effortlessly knocks this one out of the park.One critic gave the film two and a half out of four stars and claimed 'Out of Sight' was in need of a 'shot of adrenaline,' but I have no idea where he's coming from. When you think of all the bad movies that are released in any given year, you'd think you'd appreciate something like this.",Out of Sight
120,MatBrewster,Outta Sight (Outta Mind),8,2 March 2005,"Like when I first began buying VHS movies, when I purchased my DVD player, I wanted to only own the old classics and excellent new, indie films. The first DVD I purchased was Steven Soderburg's Out of Sight. It had the indie cred I desired, plus it was by a director I admired. And I am the type of person to admire directors over actors, genres, and type. Plus it didn't do well at the box office so I could feel justified in my ability to overlook the big blockbusters and snuggle into something small and arty. I have since realized that trying to impress some film buff that will never show himself at my house is both immature and not very practical. After a few additional classics (2001, Taxi Driver, and Evil Dead II) I came to realize that there are some extremely popular DVDs that are must haves. It's hard to claim indy cred when you're picking up Jaws and Animal House. Plus my DVD player came with free copies of crap like Michael and Basic Instinct. Add that to the odd assortment of movies I keep picking up as gifts and swiping from my brother via Mom and you have a whole heap of DVDs not worth bragging about.All of this is simply to say I like Out of Sight a great deal. I have watched it every six months or so since I bought it 5 years ago and have never been disappointed. It is a crime story more interested in characters than crime. Though some of the plot points are on the implausible side, the film is so overwhelmingly enjoyable it is easy to forgive such faults.Soderburg is a talented artist, though as a director he is a bit of a mixed bag. He has created some truly brilliant films (Traffic, the Limey) but also a few bombs, artistically speaking (Full Frontal, Oceans 11). After starting the indie revolution with Sex, Lies, and Videotape he created the first of several experimental films, Kafka. Thus developing a theme for his films: smart, original films followed by artistic experiments that mostly fail. With Out of Sight he began what I would call his attempt at being main stream. It is based on a Elmore Leonard novel, produced by Danny DeVito and Barry Sonnefeld, and stars a couple of up and commers looking for a hit. For those of you that scoffed at my labeling this movie ""indie"" do understand that this movie was pre Erin Brokovich, Traffic, or the Oceans series for Soderburg. George Clooney was a television star from ER, but had yet to have a successful movie. And Jennifer Lopez was still Jennifer Lopez rather than J.Lo, Jenny from the Block, or Bennifer. In 1992 it was, well, not exactly an indie movie, but it definitely was not a sure fired block buster. Point of fact, it rather bombed at the box office.Soderburg tends to be his own director of photography on his pictures. By his own admission, this is more because of his method of producing pictures quickly, than at his own expertise at this skill. Though he does do a good job at it. In fact, one of the first things I noticed about the picture, was its use of light. There are two prisons seen in the picture, and both are given a different enough look that you can easily tell them apart. During the scenes in Miami, the lighting is very bright and sunny. Soderburg intentionally over lighted the windows for interior shots to give the outside a particularly sunny look. Detroit is shot in a lot of blues that give an added feel of cold and separation.Each character is given a chance to shine. There are no flat characters designed to move the plot along. Rather they are fleshed out and appear real. Clooney and Lopez show real chemistry on screen and you begin to believe that a US Marshall could actually fall for an escaped bank robber. I have never seen an episode of ER and my buddies and I used to make fun of Clooney for his charming good looks and general star quality. This is the film that began to change my mind and understand him for the fine actor he has become. This film also made me believe that Jennifer Lopez was a fine actress and someone to look out for. But, of course, she quickly became a caricature of herself and has not done anything since then to make me a believer.I love this film. It is a crime drama that pays more attention to character than crime. It is romantic, without being schmaltzy. It is funny, without shooting for gags. It is a well made, competent movie that holds up on repeated viewings. I can still brag that it holds a place on my DVD shelf.",Out of Sight

Therefore, my own prejudices against action movies, especially ones starring George Clooney lingered on. But it seems, even Pulp Fiction was too ""pulp"" compared to this beautiful movie. With some Tarantinoesque touches, one can find all the essential factors for an action movie: guns, blood, gangsters, love, money, sex, cops, prison, murder... but all so very humor enhanced or grotesque. George Clooney looks and acts good, as well as Jennifer Lopez. Michael Keaton is superb, even though he's only seen for a min.

OUS is an extremely rare combination of good crime caper stuff mixed with a really compelling romantic story. Usually in action or crime movies the romance seems out of place and tacked on but it actually is the heart of this movie, the engine that makes it go and makes you want to watch more. Jennifer Lopez is HOT-She is cute as hell and made the best of her great role. Clooney is worthy to be called the new Cary Grant, with his effortless charm, charisma, and confidence-he's fun to watch and you want to be just half as smooth as some of his characters.

128,youdontsmellbad,A blast to watch,9,2 January 2002,"Out of Sight is a brilliant little movie with big characters a nice plot to hold them, and though it's not a comedy, it has a couple jokes that are side-splitting.  Movies like this make me wish there was a broad acceptance of a little distinction of mine.  I think people should view ""films"" differently from ""movies"".  If you are like me you watch them in two states of mind; films tend to be driven by a theme and are a little bit of work to watch, but worth it.  These are the really great works of cinema like Schindler's List and such.  Movies are the ones where you relax and have fun, like The Rock, or Rush Hour or Big or something.  Well, anyways I wish other people thought like this because then i could give this a four star rating (out of four)on the scale for movies only.  But there is none, so I can't give it a perfect rating because then it would be up there with Traffic and the like.  But when it's Friday night after a long week and you just want to watch something to take your mind off it you don't want The Bridge on The River Kwai, you want Out of Sight.

130,Mark-201,The best of the Elmore Leonard trilogy,10,3 January 1999,Out of Sight is one fantastic movie.  Who knew George Clooney had it in him to make a good movie.  I now can respect his acting ability.  Jennifer Lopez is also terrific in her role (and looks magnificent).  The direction and pretzel-like time structure makes the film even better.  Much above Get Shorty and Jackie Brown.  Note also the reference of Michael Keaton's character in this film.  He plays the same role in Jackie Brown.,Out of Sight
131,Pelagia,Masterpiece of Character Development,10,10 July 2000,"This movie is so unique, and so utterly amazing in its ability to present us time after time with real, believable characters.  And there are lots here, and even though they may appear for about 5 minutes (e.g. Michael Keaton, Albert Brooks, etc.), somehow we get to learn a little bit about them, to catch a small glimpse of their life.  Even the three ad guys at the bar seemed like the type you'd meet up with in real life.  If their parts were totally irrelevant to the movie, somehow they just fit anyway.How do the filmmakers achieve this effect, and how do they do it so seamlessly?  I thought the technique was by not presenting the characters to through their great accomplishments, but by their natural human faults.  I know it is wrong to love someone for their errors, we should rather love them for their virtues, etc, etc.  But I feel there is an aspect of imperfection in an individual's failures that is a major quality of what makes us human.Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a graying bank robber who, despite a sense of good nature and intelligence, does unplanned, and unarmed, bank heists and consequently spends most of his time in prison, no doubt scheming up new plans to get out.  Foley doesn't seem like the typical criminal who'd blame his anti-social habits on a bad childhood; rather, he carries a cocky, comical air of someone who does it for the heck of it, or maybe, to quote Foley, he's just not a nine-to-five kind of guy.  Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is Foley's feminine equivalent, who ignores her conscience and carries her cat and mouse games to the fullest extent, jeopardizing her career.  Sisco is very firm and bubbling with self-esteem, yet she's dating an married FBI agent who carries an arrogant, macho look on his face.Of course, I could go on forever, from Buddy's (Ving Rhames) certainly dull-witted habit of calling his sister to confess of jobs, especially one confession that got him and Foley busted, to White Boy Bob, who you'd write off as a basic bad guy character, until he does that thing to himself near the end of the movie.Now, there are many who will fault the movie for lagging, having too much dialogue, etc.  But I felt that if the movie was slowed down in any way, it was because the filmmakers took the guts to devote a little bit to create and flourish each character.  And that is why I love this film so much; this was made for an intelligent audience, for an audience that wants a little more out of dialogue, wants to get aroused without explicit sexuality on-screen (styles director Soderbergh is known for), and enjoy a good crime movie without the repetitive, drawn out gun battles.Soderbergh wanted to go mainstream with this movie, but you can only see him going deeper and deeper into film avant-garde.

More interesting is the fact that it was the first of five great movies in a little more than three years, ending with ""Ocean's eleven"" in 2001. In this film are playing a lot a very good actors. There are a lot of great lines in it, especially between George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Her performance in this is certainly one of Lopez best in her movie career. A lost of actors are playing characters they will do again in former films, but never better: Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Steve Zahn and Luiz Guzman for example.

It tries to take all the great elements of the genre, and make them work in a modern-day context---and it succeeds!  Example: the femme fatale figure is not very politically correct in the 90's; it's not acceptable to blame all the evils of the world on a woman, is it?  Soderbergh twists this by making Lopez the antagonist, but as the law enforcer this time, not the law breaker.  This sensibility holds throughout the film, as we feel like we're watching a Film Noir, but without having to remind ourselves of what year we're in.The sight and sound in the film are top-drawer, including a fantastic, funky soundtrack.

One: An ambitious professional who feels lonely all the time, and two: a good girl (in her case, a cop) who falls for the wrong kind of guy.Clooney is passable, but mostly he's just there to be sexy.

These are common excuses for films like this, films with murky plots, bad characters, and all the meaning and substance of a cheese sandwich, and which try to cover it all up by pouring on the ""style"".If you want to be entertained, watch something else.

155,dr. gonzo,more to this film than snappy banter and a hip soundtrack...,10,10 May 2000,"""It's like seeing someone for the first time. You can bepassing on the street and you look at each other and for afew seconds there's this kind of recognition. Like you bothknow something, and the next moment the person's gone.And it's too late to do anything about it. And you alwaysremember it because it was there and you let it go. And youthink to yourself, what if I stopped? What if I said something? What if?""This bit of dialogue from ""Out of Sight"" perfectly capturesthe essence of the relationships between characters in thisfilm. ""Out of Sight"" is about what ifs and what could havebeens. What the characters do and more importantly whatthey don't do directly shapes their fate.As the film begins, Jack Foley (George Clooney), an agingcareer criminal, escapes from a Florida prison with thehelp of his loyal accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames). In theheat of the moment, they kidnap a beautiful Federal Marshall named Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). She and Jack are stuffed in the trunk of her car as the trio make ahasty retreat. Trapped in such a small, confined space, thetwo of them have nothing to do but engage in idle chitchat.Even though they are on completely opposite sides of thelaw there's a spark, an initial attraction that blossoms intosomething more as the film progresses and their paths inevitably cross again.And so begins one of the finest Elmore Leonard adaptations ever put to film. Where ""Get Shorty"" was a littletoo goofy and ""Jackie Brown"" was a little too Tarantino,director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frankachieve a perfect mix with ""Out of Sight."" The film is fast andloose when it needs to be but knows when to slow it downand savour the moment as well. The result is a smart, funny and stylish character-driven story.It doesn't hurt that the film features two very attractive leads.After a series of so-so films, George Clooney finally hitspaydirt with ""Out of Sight."" His style of acting is perfect forthis role as he plays Foley with the perfect amount oflaid-back charm. This is typified by his character's introduction -- the most pleasant, non-violent bank robberyever committed to film. Clooney has such a likable screenpresence that you just want to see his character succeed.Conversely, Jennifer Lopez is his perfect foil as a smart,tough law enforcement officer who can't help but fall in lovewith this charismatic criminal. She is a very attractivewoman but not above wielding a shotgun to apprehend a fugitive.There is a genuine chemistry between the two actors thatmakes their romance work. And it is this relationship thatgives ""Out of Sight"" its depth. There is more to this film thansnappy banter and a hip soundtrack. It's a film about making choices and taking chances despite the sometimes inevitable, painful consequences.

Best of all, Clooney and Lopez have genuine sexual/romantic chemistry together.A minor box-office disappointment when it came out, this very underrated film was nevertheless the one that made Clooney a genuine movie star. Special mention should go out to screenwriter Scott Frank, who also did a masterful job of adapting Leonard's Get Shorty. (It only looks easy -- witness, for example, the execrable Be Cool.) Kudos also to director Steven Soderbergh, who showed a previously unsuspected knack for delivering a well-made star-driven commercial entertainment without condescending to the supposed stupidity of the mass audience. Soderbergh quickly went on to cement his reputation with a string of commercial and artistic hits: Erin Brockovich (2000), Traffic (2000), and Ocean's Eleven (2001).This is the sort of movie that Howard Hawks or Michael Curtiz might have directed if they'd been born 50 years later.

This it does so smoothly that it is completely undervalued by audiences, yet how often have we seen this done badly - or not even attempted.It is one of the first proper revivifications of the noire/caper genre, and is done so slickly, with great music, little quirks in editing, great pacing and simple understated performances that it seems easy to overlook these things and just enjoy it.If you look beyond the plot (which is fun btw, it has several different strands that unfold at different paces using a mixture of flash back and time shifts alongside conventional plot devices which was quite unique for the time) there is something put together really fluently which few film makers achieve nowadays. Suspense, character development, romance, action and intrigue.Personally I consider this a far better film than the Oceans films and it helped me fall in love with J'Lo as a teenage lad, despite her never really making another good movie, and really me falling in love with the character and the situation.",Out of Sight

Jennifer Lopez and the rest of the cast were uniformally excellent.  (And it was nice to see Nancy Allen again, even if for a few moments.  Where's she been?)  All the characters were well-written and well-played. This is one of the few cases where the screenplay was better than the already-good book. Crime movies, full of shooting and other violence, cruelty and profanity, are so commonplace that I've become jaded and almost desensitized to them. But occasionally, something like this comes along that concentrates on character instead of plot, and makes up for all the heartless, mindless, garbage they keep endlessly remaking and recycling. That this gem of a film died at the box office the same summer that the stupid, inept, intelligence-insulting ""Armageddon"" became the biggest hit of the year says more about the quality of moviegoers than of movies.

Good director, good writing, good actors, great sound track, but by far, my favorite aspect of the movie is the editing.  This is one of the most well edited movies I have seen in some time.  There are lots of great Godard-style jump cuts, melding together of scenes that take place hours later, cutting back and forth between 10 years...it's great, and it all works, wonderfully.  You can tell in alot of this movie (especially the trunk scene) that Soderbergh just shot the scenes like a hundred times from different angles and then just handed it to the editor to figure out.  I don't know how long it took to edit this movie but i'm willing to bet it took a while.The acting in this movie is pretty good too.  George Clooney did a great job, and was one of the few characters that stayed true to the novel's characters (for instance, Ving Rhames's character was a white guy, and Jenifer Lopez's character was a blond white girl).

In fact, it is so assured, so easy to watch that it is easy to forget how meticulously it is constructed and how every detail is spot-on.  The cinematography is cool, detached and luxurious.  The script is subtle in its twists, and negotiates some tricky flashbacks without losing the narrative flow.  There's a excellent score, laid back but funky. Finally, of course, there are the performances.  Clooney and Lopez have both been in some terrible films, but here both generate a remarkable chemistry, despite only having a few scenes together.  Lopez, indeed, is a revelation - intelligence, smouldering sensuality, and an effortless charm entirely in keeping with the film's aesthetic.  Of course, this effect will be ruined the next time I see one of her tacky music videos on MTV.  However, it is a mark of the film's quality that smaller roles are no less accomplished - note the estimable Catherine Keener, who only has two scenes to make an impact, but adds a deliciously quirky presence.  Also, Steve Zahn, as the pothead loser, is funny throughout - note how his look is based on Dennis Hopper in ""Easy Rider"".  As I say, the details are everything.",Out of Sight

175,rookie-3,coolest film in 98,8,18 November 1998,"'Out of Sight' is cool, stylish and intelligent.It's been a long time since I watch a crime-themed movie like this.I always get annoyed when the protagonist does something ridiculous and he can get away with it, which happens a lot in this kind of film. This doesn't happen in this film. For example in the beginning of the film, Jack Foley (Clooney's character)tried to be a smart-wise and rob a bank without any guns, knives or any preparation, he just use his head and his charisma. You may find it pretty smart but you wouldn't believe he can just get away like that don't you? Well, 'Out of sight' regards us as intelligent enough so Jack gets caught. I started to like the movie and like it even more when Karen Sisco ( Lopez) comes on screen. The relationship between Sisco and Foley is very sexy although there's not much physical contact between them.

The comedy in this movie is just genius it has this dark vibe and these larger than life characters while maintaining realism to an extent .

179,YuunofYork,Occasionally clever but mediocre script elevated by Soderbergh's direction and strong cast before they were A-list,6,30 November 2016,"If Soderbergh has a style, it's bookish pacing and an undercurrent of realism in hyperbolic situations. His choices of scripts are uneven, if not typically on the bland side, but that's okay, because the writing is usually elevated by his choices in above-the-line crew (editing, cinematography, score) and knack for consolidating their work into a single voice. He also usually gets the best performances he can out of his actors, even if it means long hours or re-shoots. Out of Sight typifies this rocky marriage of stylistic integrity and dime store story. Soderbergh has called this film perhaps the most complete of his pictures, and in a structural self-contained way that might be true, but it is far from his best.Jack Foley (Clooney) is a man in his third act. A bank robber committed to his lifestyle, who following his third stint in the penitentiary, has lost any wide-eyed preconceptions he might have had about big scores settling all debts and landing him richly propped up on ""some island"". He drifts from job to job, annoyed but not surprised things are getting harder, looking not for a swansong, but more of the same. Yet the character is underwritten. He's a well-adjusted prisoner confident around and commanding the respect of tougher types, despite never having used a gun (even for show). He's a ""good guy"", who doesn't have a problem feeling up a woman at gunpoint, and doesn't worry over the safety of his partners in crime, except for Buddy (Rhames). Personality contradictions like these can be realistic, but they can also be bad writing. Karen Sisco (Lopez) has the same problem, a marshal who pursues men as bounties, lays, or if you're Jack Foley, both. Where does her allegiance lie? To everyone, apparently. Contradiction is the theme here, with former enemies in prison collaborating together on the outside, Buddy, whose commitment to a criminal lifestyle is intact only through a compulsion to confess for hours to his spiritual adviser/sister what he has just done, Sisco's investigator father who disapproves of one of his daughter's unsavory conquests, but not a more dangerous one - and so on. Contradictions may better mirror real life, but even in real life they are often frustrating to us pattern-recognizing humans who prefer to blur away such sharpness to make some sense of the world.The first half is told non-linearly; we see Foley and friends in prison, out, and back in again as we piece together the events that led them to the present, where sadly the story runs straight on until the end. It's a good trick to make an ordinary story more interesting and invests the audience in finding out what is essentially mundane detail, but once it behaves itself it gets far less interesting. There is some plot about uncut diamonds that everyone thinks is true despite telling each other is a lie, but this is secondary to character studies where the characters have no arc and wind up exactly where they were at the beginning.Still, all would be well if these characters, in the end, still felt like real people. Both Foley and Sisco are for the most part written too soft and fluffy for how hard they are supposed to be. This isn't the fault of Lopez or Clooney, although if they did have a choice which way to play it, both certainly went with cotton candy here. Still, this is some of their best acting, as are the performances from Cheedle, Rhames, Guzmán - at the time none of them exactly A-list, but certainly at their peak. One is tempted to say Rhames and Guzmán have become all but typecast in this kind of role, which is a shame, as are Lopez/Clooney's unfortunate excursions into broad, unsubstantial rom/coms.There is a tonal discrepancy marring the picture as well. It is an odd choice that nearly all of the humor is delivered by the most despicable characters, and it comes right before or after they do or were to do rape/murder. It worked in Pulp Fiction, where we see everyone both at their worst and their best, but in Soderbergh's film these are tertiary people who we differentiate in relation to each other rather than their actions and whose names we barely remember scene-to-scene, and whose only redeeming qualities are the two minutes they play the clown before going back to playing the monster. It's just jarring. I'm not sure how much creative control Soderbergh had over the Leonard story, but I wish he had subjected it to rewrites. There is some light entertainment here, but Out of Sight is not so much flawed as rough, like uncut diamonds decorating a fish tank. 6/10",Out of Sight

His cool flick of a zippo lighter symbolises a man who lives life on the edge, clearly struggling with the fact that the chance of that one big score is decreasing with age.Jennifer Lopez promised so much in this role as a woman whose dedication to the job has left her stuck in the dating game with hothead cops and FBI agents. She's a survivor in a man's world but when she finally finds that spark, her code of honour plays second fiddle to her search for real love.This performance was pre J-Lo and suggests that if the 37-year-old actress could have been prevented from chasing the mission of urban cool, she may have delivered other well-rounded performances and developed into a leading actress for the higher echelon of dramatic cinema.The characters' desire for one another and their respective professions make the pursuit for justice a thrilling and sexy series of brief interludes in a range of seasonal locations across America.Soderbergh excels in his direction, especially the 'Time Out' scene where he bends time and space to splice talky seduction and silent disrobing episodes together into something much more intimate than any mere sex scene.The style of Elmore Leonard is evident in the script as it flashes back to Foley's time in prison: he becomes involved in a diamond heist on a dirty banker's home, which leads to the inevitable double cross by Don Cheadle's violent gangster, Snoop.The friendship of trust between Clooney and his accomplice Buddy, played by Ving Rhames, works on the understanding that through bad luck or conflicts of conscience they have wasted the best part of their lives in prison and this one last heist presents an opportunity, despite their cynicism, to get their hard earned ticket to happiness.A story of circumstance that asks if things were different, if we had followed a different path, how would things be? Foley can't face another prison stretch but can't change who he is and in a moment with Karen, he declares what meeting her has done to him: ""It's like seeing someone for the first time, and you look at each other for a few seconds, and there's this kind of recognition like you both know something. Next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it."" The chance encounters and romantic rendezvous come to an end when Foley's conscience betrays him and by going back to the scene of the diamond heist, he saves a woman from Snoop's gang, but puts himself in Karen's gun sight. What if she wasn't a federal marshal? What if he wasn't a bank robber? What if?",Out of Sight

The last 30 minutes or so are atrocious--and a clear indication that Soderbergh had only a passing interest in the material at best.  As the bullets fly and the bodies pile up, it becomes all too obvious that neither Soderbergh nor we in the audience really give a damn about these characters.

Everyone simply fit their stereotype and moved accordingly.  Foley had never met Sisko before, and now he wants to bring her along on the prison break?  Get real.  I can't believe that this many people thought this movie was good or clever.  The two main characters were obviously NOT in love, and didn't have any reason to be. There was no chemistry.  Perhaps because they're both attractive, we are to assume that they can't help but love each other, but I didn't see that. If she is a law enforcer, it would take a hell of a lot longer to fall for a criminal - even if she has a penchant for picking the wrong man.

The direction, script, cinematography, design and costumes disply such an acute and almost natural flair for bringing Elmore Leonard to the screen that it should be made illegal to film any of his novels without these people. But the acting is in a world of its own.  Farina, Keaton, Rhames, Cheadle and Zahn all bring depth, comedy and intelligence to their roles. All are eclipsed however by the irresistable pairing of Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney. Clooney has finally managed to act without peering beneath his eyebrows and the effect is electric.  This is the part he was born to play.  His charisma is tangiable, but there is also a sense of fatalism whihc makes his character all the more compelling. Lopez, after her screaming shit-fits in the woeful 'Anaconda' proves that sexuality must also equal intelligence.  Her Cisco is a mouth-watering mix of sass, beauty and cut-throat determination.

Soderbergh elicits the first truly great performance out of Clooney, an underrated actor, and Jennifer Lopez really never has been better. The supporting cast really shines, with Ving Rhames, Catherine Keener, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks (who is nearly unrecognisable for most of the film) and Luis Guzman all doing stellar work.Overall, a great comedic action-drama for adults.

This was the movie that announced Clooney as a film star and Lopez showed that she's easily a better actress than singer, though you wouldn't know it these days.A great script coupled with a cracking Elmore Leonard story and a soundtrack that suits the mood of the film perfectly. And of course, direction that serves to tell the story in the best way possible (the shifting timescale wasn't written in  originally but was conceived by Soderburgh and screenwriter Scott Frank, after they felt the straightforward adaption didn't do the book justice).

His on-screen presence and charisma lifts this film to heights which it wouldn't reach without him. The trunk scene with Jennifer Lopez, an obvious example of what you can accept from Clooney that wouldn't be as easy to accept from any other actor.

He plans to burgle a wealthy fellow inmate, now on the outside, who holds over five million dollars worth of uncut diamonds in his house.  However, he falls in love with the female hostage, who just happens to be an FBI agent.There's plenty of scope there for a brilliant film, and I'm sure Elmore Leonard's book is a great base.  But there seems to have been a breakdown in the transition from book to film.  The film is desperately slow, moving at a snail's pace.  This film could easily have been cut down from 123 minutes to 90-odd, without any significant sacrifices.  I was longing for it to end after about the first hour.The main characters lacked chemistry - I found the 'love' scenes cringeworthy and forced.  Also, having spent so long concentrating on character development, I found some of George Clooney's motivations baffling.  Why was he so dead against going back to jail?  He didn't seem to have too bad a time of it, we never see him getting picked on or beaten up, in fact he stands up to some of the hardest guys in the jail without so much as a flinch.The film does tend to flash backwards and forwards in time, and this is clumsily executed, especially when tied in with a dream sequence.  I was totally confused as to what was going on for a good ten minutes at one point, and I suspect this was due to poor direction and editing, also evidenced in the excessive length of the film.That's not to say that this film doesn't have points to recommend it - the cinematography was very good, as was much of the acting.

Then... Plot is weak and unconvincing, acting, directing, cinematography, music and edit would be great for a B movie. I gave it a 4 because it was ultimately not that annoying and I could watch it till the end, although in two different days.",Out of Sight

232,stuartC,Go see it!!!,9,7 December 1998,"The humour of this film, and the Pulp-Fiction/Reservoir Dogs-esque flashbacks really did it for me. I was quite surprised at how good this film really was, but now I have seen it, I reckon that it is one of THE films of 1998. So there, take my word for it!",Out of Sight
233,karen-37,Jennifer and George WOW,10,8 December 1998,Out of Sight has got to be the best movie of the summer. George Clooney was spectacular! I love the steamy scences he did with Jennifer Lopez! They were excellent together. I am a fan of both actors. This was the best thing that could have ever happened! I am waitng for a sequel.,Out of Sight
234,ClarkeT,The best movie since Pulp Fiction?,10,11 January 1999,"I would like to know why this movie didn't receive so-called critical acclaim while in theatres.  This brilliantly written movie had a clever twisting plot, outstanding cast & cameos, a modest amount of well-placed violence, and hilarious scenes which will have anyone laughing out loud.While some might say that this movie was nothing but another attempt by a writer/director to imitate Q. Tarantino, I say ""Get over it!"".  This was based upon on equally terrific book by Elmore Leonard and has sufficient distinctiveness to warrant being judged on its own merits, not only as being Quentin-esque.",Out of Sight
235,yvette-3,That Don't Impress Me Much,1,17 January 1999,"Being a fan of Clooney and Lopez I was very disappointed in this movie.  The 2 of them played their parts great but I just don't think they were meant to work together.  I think it would have been better to see Clooney work with Pfeiffer for this movie rather than Lopez.  They just didn't seem to click together, but that's just my opinion.",Out of Sight

What a waste of time !  What makes me wonder though how can this movie get average of 7 stars out of 10 ?   It's not even worth 3 stars in my book.  Don't bother renting.... Shak.",Out of Sight
238,lila-8,Yawn,1,2 July 2002,"This movie was a disappointing lame grab bag of stereotypes coupled. The talent-challenged Ms. Lopez was unintentionally amusing as a cop horny for the villain, and it was an insult to viewers' intelligence to always have clooney's character, a bank robber, always coming out smelling like a rose. Did you notice we never actually see him do anything mean? come on.Lame!",Out of Sight
239,wertzy,Out of Sight is a very enjoyable film,10,12 October 1999,"Out of Sight stars George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez (my favorite actress). These two electrify the screen and make the movie one of my favorite movies of all time.  The cast is loaded with people who do a great job in this movie.  Great story, good cast, and Jennifer Lopez all come together to create a nice package.  Yes, I admit having Jennifer in it was a plus for me, but this movie is truly really good.  Out of Sight is a very well made and entertaining movie that will leave you feeling good after watching this movie.  Out of Sight will keep you glued to the television screen with its good storyline and quality acting.",Out of Sight
240,akcacy,One of my favorite films,9,1 November 2001,"I love this movie!  The story is compelling - two people from opposite sides of the law have an immediate attraction to each other, and despite the fact that they know their relationship is impossible, they both feel an irresistible need to see each other again.  Jennifer Lopez is cool, George Clooney is hot, and together they have great chemistry.  The other actors are also terrific.  Each one brings humor, eccentricity and a unique twist to the character.  The plot plays with the timeline, in the mode of Pulp Fiction, but in a way that adds to your understanding of the characters and the story line.",Out of Sight
241,mehargreaves,Intoxicatingly sexy,9,16 January 2001,"One of the sexiest movies made. The on-screen coupling of Clooney and Lopez produces a chemistry not often demonstrated by leading men and women. Soderbergh's working of the bar/bedroom scene is a welcome return to the sensual sex scene rather than the gun-ho lets all jump into bed scenes that are all too frequent in todays movies. For me this film represents one of Clooney and Lopez's finest performances (a performance surpassed by Clooney only recently in O'Brother..). A superb film, a firm favourite in my collection.",Out of Sight
242,Dee99,Didn't get the joke,2,5 December 2000,"Well, I guess I was in a bad mood when I saw this (on video, which didn't help either). I was totally underwhelmed by the famous Clooney charm, didn't buy the romance, nor the plot! Was I the only person to find the ""love in the trunk"" ludicrous? And how many FBI agents make a habit of going out with bank robbers? I've always been happy to buy this sort of romance in the past, going way back to ""Klute"" (thrilling) through ""Raising Arizona"" (hilarious). I guess the problem was I didn't realise it was meant to be funny, so just didn't get the joke interspersed amongst all the violence and flashbacks. OK, I admit Steve Zahn was comic, and Ving Rhames put in a solid performance but for me, it was neither thrilling nor hilarious.",Out of Sight
243,vah28,"Smooth, sexy, and oh-so cool",10,13 February 2003,"People look at me funny when I say that this is one of my all-time favorite films... I think it's the Jennifer Lopez factor. But once I force them to watch the film, they usually change their tune.Soderbergh takes a winning story by Elmore Leonard and turns it into something better by tweaking the timeline, using music and cinematography brilliantly to establish mood, and relying on an outstanding cast to do the rest. In addition to the chemistry between the two leads, Out of Sight has a supporting cast that is simply perfect, not a weak link to be found. It's hard to choose a favorite among Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, and Steve Zahn, but even the smaller parts are played to perfection by the likes of Dennis Farina, Luis Guzman, and Catherine Keener. Without such a solid cast, a lesser film would have seemed too stylized, but instead it's an exercise in Cool.This film is a pleasure to watch from start to finish, and you'll find yourself going back for repeated viewings (catching subtle bits of humor each time -- like Steve Zahn and the weights).",Out of Sight
244,BWalshcz,really romantic and fun,10,8 May 2001,"This movie tries to look like comedy, drama, romantic. Someone can say that he doesn´t know what kind of movie it´s exactly. I know. For me it´s one of the most romantic movies in the history. And also it´s fun. The scene when Clooney and Lopez meet each other in the bar and which continues in the hotel room is wonderful. Electrifying music and really good edit makes it very hot and romantic at the same time. I would like to see more such movies.",Out of Sight
245,azmissy12,An entertaining thriller,7,8 July 2001,"It was a fantastic thrill ride. it made you wonder what was going to happen next. Jennifer Lopez was beautiful, and George Clooney was hot. They obviously made the movie. Without them it wouldn't have been worth seeing.",Out of Sight
246,lisette-d,Awesome,10,31 December 2006,"I think the key to the film is the sexual tension between Goerge Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Add to that a brilliant cast, Don Cheadle, Steve Zahn, Ving Rhames and you've got a fine looking recipe for a film. The soundtrack sets the tone and mood, that packaged through the eyes of a brilliant and fantastic director means for a pretty fine movie going experience.In summary, great story, great dialogue, great acting, great directing, great music = Great movie and worthy of 10! Thanks and Enjoy!",Out of Sight
247,banana_skin_feet,Pure cinematic pleasure!,10,26 January 2003,"What does it mean to 'get' a film? I ask because reading some of the comments on here, I can't believe that we've all watched the same film.
To me, this film has it all: terrific leads who generate REAL heat, unlike so many 'romantic' movies; a brilliant and diverse supporting cast; dialogue which can be both witty and poignant; music and camera-work which build up the atmosphere and an all-pervading sense of cool. It's simply a pleasure to watch from start to finish - I wouldn't change anything about it. This really is accomplished and intelligent film making. Soderbergh transformed Clooney in this film, from an uncertain wobbly-headed B-list lead into a genuine movie star. Of course, Lopez hasn't even approached these heights since and Soderbergh hasn't bettered it.I can understand that some people might find the direction and editing a bit too tricksy and it doesn't really have an emotional punch. But that's hardly the point. Leonard's world is full of ultra-cool criminals, with all the lines and bags of charm. It's not the real world but, to be honest, I don't always go to the cinema hoping to see the real world. Some films leave you with a spring in your step as you walk out of the cinema, realising just how cool life can be. This is definitely one of them.",Out of Sight
248,solaris2,The Day that ER Died,10,3 April 2003,"It was Out of Sight that first endeared me to Clooney and Soderbergh. A well-crafted, art house film for the masses. It deserved the accolade received and should have won or, at the very least, been nominated for several Oscars. (I realize that Anne Coates was nominated for the editing, but it deserved Oscar's kudos in other categories as well.)The film takes risks in the way it is crafted. I think that is what moved me the most. It is a fun film, but it is a clever film too. It was not your average Hollywood fare.In this film, as well, Clooney emerges from tv stardom to feature film leading man. I enjoyed the entire cast. Yet, there was no way that Clooney's career could be saddled on the small screen anymore. The fact that George could hold his own and carry a film of such quality was evidence enough that it was time to leave ER. (And so he did.)Scott Frank's brilliantly crafted script was both funny and just too cool. Check out the colloquy between Viola Davis and Isaiah Washington. Now, that is how urban dialogue really sounds! I liked Tarrantino's Jackie Brown released that year. However, Frank's script was better. (Sorry Quentin!)And then there is Soderbergh... Oh, just see the film; enjoy the sound track too. A laid-back, edgy heist film that is so hip and delivers so much more.",Out of Sight
249,charliethetunamiles,"Hands down, one of the best films ever made.",10,14 January 2004,"As funny as it is entertaining, Out of Sight is an example of beautifully crafted filmmaking. The script is ingenius and the casting amazing. Every actor ignites on the screen with true charisma seen so rarely in a film with an all-star cast, but the film goes beyond that. The music is perfect, the cinematography is perfect, the editing pulls the story together in an inventive way that keeps the audience guessing and, at the same time, so involved in the story. George Clooney, gleaming with charm, and Jennifer Lopez, in her best performance to date, are a perfect couple thrown into a unusual romantic connection. The movie is hilarious, tragic, touching, extremely romantic and full of surprising insight. I love every minute.",Out of Sight
250,mike-1863,A (Major) Minor Masterpiece,10,3 December 2005,"I only watch movies that I love more than once, and there are only about 15 in that category, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourgh, Ophree (1949), 12 Monkeys, Brigadon, Vertitgo, The Sound of Music and Out of Sight, which I have watched over and over and over probably twice as much as any other movie. I discover more to love about it with each viewing.I initially went to see the film because I was an Elmore Lenord fan, and had read the book. I was NOT a Clooney or a Lopez fan, but after the movie, I became one...of both. Steven Soderberghshines, shows just the right amount of restraint. Of the films I have seen of his, I love Out of Sight, Solaris and Traffic. I did not particularly like The Limey. Oceans Eleven was great for what it was and shame on me for going to Oceans Twelve. Have not seen any of his others.If you have not seen this film, don't be put off by the negative reviews, this is an incredible story of the human spirit put together perfectly. Just watched Out of Sight yet again, and am once more floored by what an perfect film this is. The cast, the score, the editing, the screenplay. It is almost scary how perfect this move is from the first scene to the last. And I know that I will watch again and again. Wow!",Out of Sight
251,Louisaa,I love this movie!,10,18 December 2004,"I love this movie, its one of my favorites. I think it has a lot of style, good humor and a good cast. Normally I'm not that fond of Jennifer Lopez, but in this movie she's good. She plays a smart and tough police officer, that falls for the charms of a criminal (George Clooney). The soundtrack of the movie is also good. David Holmes made most of the music, he makes funky music. The music brings a lot of style and image to the movie.George Clooney is playing an intelligent crook. Hes a famous bank robber, he robbed loads of them. But he never uses guns. His character is kind of the same as the 'Daniel Ocean' he plays in Oceans 11 & 12. So if you love his character in Oceans 11 & 12, you'll love Out of sight.So for the comment above me that claims that this movie sucks, shut up!",Out of Sight
252,princessleia4,Could this movie be worst?,1,24 July 2005,"This is one of the worst movies of all times. The acting was horrific, the dialogue was appalling and the characters stereotypical and boring. Jennifer Lopez is one of the worst actresses I have seen in my whole entire life and she should stick to dancing since its the only thing she's good at.Anyone who honestly believes that this is a great movie needs their head examined. This is just another example of Hollywood taking a great idea for a story and turning it into boring, worthless drivel that people are *supposed* to like just because it has Jennifer Lopez in it.If you had a choice out of watching this movie and flushing your five dollars down the toilet, in my advice flush the money. At least then, you wouldn't have wasted two hours of your life which you could have spent doing something constructive or interesting.",Out of Sight

The ending really elevates it over its source material, I think.Its got everything - drama, humor, action, romance, heists, buddy story and several surprises. Plus - late-90s Clooney really is the coolest Clooney. And I honestly can't think of any female character in any movie who's cooler than Karen Sisco.One of my all-time favorites.",Out of Sight
