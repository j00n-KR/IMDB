0,bkoganbing,"""If Everyone Were On Television We'd All Behave Better""",9,11 June 2010,"In a black comedy loosely based on the infamous Pamela Smart murder case, Nicole Kidman takes her obsession with becoming a celebrity to the ultimate extreme. That she was one high maintenance woman Matt Dillon must have known when he married her. But bow completely amoral she was, who could have guessed? After all she was a woman To Die For.To Die For is one of the best film commentaries on the culture of celebrity and what we will do to become one, at least some of us. If you don't think there is a lot of truth here, just think about what certain people are doing right now to become a lackey for Donald Trump and a best friend of Paris Hilton. And they're doing it on television for millions to see.Nicole Kidman is at her most beautiful and most amoral in To Die For. She's married to working class guy Matt Dillon who helps run the family restaurant owned by his father Dan Hedaya. Nicole works too at the local television station run by Wayne Knight and starts out as a receptionist, but works her way up to weather girl. But she's got ambitions for so much more. But all she sees is her average guy husband standing in the way.To aid in her ultimate plan she befriends three misfit teens, Casey Affleck, Alison Folland, and Joaquin Phoenix and uses sex with Phoenix as a drug. He becomes obsessed with her and soon he and his friends are willing tools in her schemes.I have to say that in this film Nicole Kidman gives what I think is her best performance. Director Gus Van Sant really brought a good one out of her. There isn't anyone who watches this film who wouldn't be a willing tool for her. The three teen accomplices are all good and stand out individually with Folland who was making her screen debut and Phoenix both touching in their own way.But I do like Dan Hedaya in this also who uses some old fashioned methods to get his vengeance, old fashioned family style vengeance I might add.Anyone who is interested in the cult of celebrity as both a serious study and entertainment should not miss To Die For.",To Die For
1,Leofwine_draca,Maybe you had to be there...,4,12 August 2021,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this one but never actually saw it. Now I have, and I'm not impressed. Maybe you had to be there at the time. The faux documentary stylings are interesting and could be seen as a precursor to the found footage wave of modern cinema, but other than that...so so. The black comedy aspect works well and the acting isn't half bad from across the cast, but I did find it rather long winded and obvious, taking a very long time to get anywhere.",To Die For
2,SnoopyStyle,Nicole Kidman is great in this,7,20 July 2014,"Suzanne Stone Maretto (Nicole Kidman) is a TV weathergirl and an infamous tabloid sensation suspected of enticing teenagers Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix), Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland) and Russel Hines (Casey Affleck) to kill her husband Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon). She is driven and would stop at nothing to achieve fame. His sister Janice (Illeana Douglas) didn't like cold Suzanne from the start.It has the noir style with characters doing interviews with the camera. Director Gus Van Sant has more style than a simple narrative. Talking directly into the camera adds to this dark comedy. It is the performance of Nicole Kidman that is the most interesting. She can be sweet and innocent in one moment. Then she's manipulative and ambitious the next. She delivers one of her best performances ever. It is a dark indictment of the modern obsession for fame.",To Die For
3,claudio_carvalho,Ambition and Manipulation,7,13 June 2016,"In Little Hope, New Hampshire, the beautiful and hot Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) wants to be famous and is an aspiring TV personality. She marries Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon), whose father owns a restaurant, and convinces him to use this savings for the university buying a Mustang for her and a condo. Then she accepts to work for the local station receiving minimum wage to develop her own projects, including one with youths in a public school. She meets the punks Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix), Russel Hines (Casey Affleck) and Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland) and records hours of tapes interviewing them. When Larry invites her to work at the restaurant in a talent show that he wants to implement, Suzanne sees a threat to her planned career and decides to get rid of her husband. She seduces Jimmy and convinces him that she is in love with him. Then she tells that Larry is a brutal man and Jummy decides to kill him. What will happen to Larry?""To Die For"" is a great tale of ambition and manipulation. Gus Van Sant uses the documentary style to show a beautiful and sexy woman that uses her limited intelligence and her body to reach what she has planned for her career. The cast has great performance and Nicole Kidman is perfect in the role of Suzanne Stone. The screenplay has a sort of black humor and the conclusion is ironical. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Sonho Sem Limites"" (""A Dream Without Limits"")",To Die For
4,gavin6942,Seems Like a Misfire,6,9 March 2016,"Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) is an aspiring TV personality who will do anything to be in the spotlight, including enlisting three teenagers to kill her husband.I had expected to like this one, but it just seemed okay and nothing special. Kidman is far from her best, and Matt Dillon is not given enough screen time. Seeing Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix in early roles is nice, but neither really stand out all that much. Phoenix does a nice job acting like he is stupid, but it comes off as rather weak.The real redeeming feature of this film? David Cronenberg. Although he only has a minute or two on screen, the moment I saw his face I just lit up inside like a jack-o-lantern. Unfortunately, the rest of the picture couldn't compete.",To Die For
5,lee_eisenberg,people will do anything for fame,8,10 March 2006,"Gus Van Sant directed another really good movie with ""To Die For"", focusing on the true story of a woman's vicious obsession with having a career. As fame-starved weather reporter Suzanne Stone, Nicole Kidman radiates a kind of iciness missing from most of her movie roles. As her husband Larry Maretto, Matt Dillon shows the audience an admirable man truly oblivious to his wife's scheme. I had never seen Joaquin Phoenix in anything before this (although it turns out that he'd had previous roles), but he brings to the screen an unctuous teenager with whom we almost want to sympathize. I can't believe that this didn't get any Oscar nominations; I think that it was one of Van Sant's best movies up to that time. Not a movie that you're likely to soon forget. Also starring Casey Affleck, Ileana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Kurtwood Smith, and Buck Henry.",To Die For
6,jboothmillard,To Die For,6,22 September 2005,"From director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Psycho remake) comes a quite interesting idea for a film. Telling a story about a woman who is willing to do nearly anything to be recognised and considered beautiful, or ""to die for"" in this case. Basically Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Nicole Kidman plays Suzanne Stone Maretto who is a normal everyday house wife married to Matt Dillon as Larry Maretto. She wants to get a really high paid job presenting the news, or at least being a weather woman. So one day she goes to Ed Grant (Basic Instinct and Space Jam's Wayne Knight) for a job (being a weather girl) and she lets her have the job. She starts off well, but I think it's house problems and not being too popular making her go a little mad in places, or something. Also starring Joaquin Phoenix as Jimmy Emmett. Nicole Kidman's performance as a bitch is terrific and there is great music from Danny Elfman. Nicole Kidman was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",To Die For
7,ccthemovieman-1,Now Here's A Strange And Fascinating Story,9,30 August 2006,"This is a different story and definitely interesting. The movie is listed as a comedy but it's more of a drama. Yes, the comedy is there but it's dark humor and there is violence and tragedy here. Nicole Kidman is very good as the beautiful and ruthless blonde who has big television ambitions. I don't know if I ever saw Kidman look this pretty, which is saying a lot. Matt Dillon co-stars and is excellent, too, as are the two young no- name actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Allison Foland. Ironically, Phoenix, has become a big star, most recently playing the legendary Johnny Cash in ""Walk The Line."" When this movie came out, few people knew him.Illena Douglas gives an underrated performance and I always enjoy the odd Dan Hedaya. Anyway, if you want to see something different in the way of a story, this movie falls in that category.",To Die For
8,rmax304823,"Ready for my closeup, Mr. Van Sant.",8,18 June 2004,"Everything about the movie is pretty much supersized. The only reasonably naturalistic performances are given by Matt Dillon and his family. The rest are caricatures and not always funny ones, nor are they intended to be. Nobody, but NOBODY, is a devastatingly beautiful as Nicole Kidman, perfect in every respect, without any idiosyncratic features, no cross-eyes, no prominent incisors, just simply flawless, like a Vargas illustration. (To die for is right.) When she speaks to people, or to the camera, she is at the same time revealingly intimate and thoroughly manipulative, the same qualities that Lyndon Johnson had. Phoenix goes beyond dumb into some airless intellectual limbo, a mortuary of the mind. He can hardly string two words together. The plump and deluded girl is slightly better. She can string two words together. Buck Henry, as the principal, apparently knocks his students down for being rude.The target here is TV. Nothing is real, argues Kidman, unless it is on television. (This is akin to Walker Percy's notion of ""certification."") We get lots of TV. Kidman is a weather person at a local cable station. Dillon watches basketball games during important family meetings. Reporters and cameras are all over the place. Kidman tapes auditions for the big networks. At the end, the plump girl who despises herself ruminates: ""Everybody should be on TV. But if everybody was on TV, there'd be nobody to watch."" Then her image splits into a logarithmic progression of pixellated pictures. The movie is funny enough, but not laugh-out-loud funny. The disgust isn't thrown into the viewer's face. He or she must bring the emotion up by itself like a cow and its cud. Van Sant treats the audience like adults, able to figure things out for themselves. And the serious undertones, this being based on real events, undercuts the comedy. It's a more demanding and far more complex movie than Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Fifteen Minutes."" The writer and director don't shout that these students are apathetic and ignorant. Instead they give you pictures of the open-mouthed stares and let you listen to the inquisitive puzzled grunts. Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow? Whose breath blew out the light within this brain? The film makers let you decide. The movie doesn't provide facile explanations, nor does real life.There is an abundance of originality on display, from the expert use of the semi-documentary interviews to the editing. I'll mention one relatively insignificant instance. Just before the end credits, with no preliminary set-up, Ileana Douglas faces the camera on ice skates, a frozen lake behind her. As she wiggles backwards onto the lake and Donovan begins ""The Season of the Witch,"" the credit finally begin to roll, and for all the time it takes, Douglas twirls and pirouettes behind them, a tiny doll-like figure swirling around on a flat surface glazed with frost and snow, with a dead body under it. It isn't a riotously funny movie and it doesn't pulse with drama, so at times it seems to move a bit slowly, but its moral question is worth listening to. ""Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?""",To Die For
9,Tweekums,A dark comedy about celebrity,7,3 July 2009,"Nicole Kidman does a great job playing Suzanne Stone a girl who will do just about anything to become a big time TV personality, possibly including involvement in the murder of her husband. The film is told in flash back with herself and family members telling us how she and her husband met and how she set about working at the local television station. She is only employed as the weather girl but persuades her boss to let her work on her own project interviewing teens at the local high school about what their lives are like. Things start to go out of control when she enters into a relationship with one of them and learns that another has access to a gun. Her marriage isn't going according to plan either; Larry the man she fell for was a drummer in a local band but after they married he sold his drums and started working in his father's Italian restaurant, not the sort of profession for the spouse of a celebrity on their way to the top as far as Suzanne is concerned.As well as Nicole Kidman performing well in the lead role Matt Dillon is good in the smaller role of her husband. I wasn't so sure about Joaquin Phoenix as her teenage lover Jimmy, it wasn't that his acting was at fault, he just didn't look young enough to be sixteen. While the film is a comedy it isn't full of laugh out loud moments nor should one expect witty one liners, the humour is fairly dark, such as when one character says that he will be in jail for the rest of his life plus thirty years... if he lives that long. Director Gus Van Sant has done an interesting job combined straight to camera comments from all the main characters looking back at the events and the more conventional showing of the events themselves. I'm not sure that I'd recommend buying this unless it is in the bargain bin but it would be worth watching on TV.",To Die For
10,moonspinner55,"Rather a sly satire, though the handling is sometimes precious...",6,29 December 2002,"Nicole Kidman hit an early career-high with her riveting portrayal of a self-obsessed suburban nutcase who has big dreams of finding fame and fortune, even at the expense of her husband. Icy, satirical black comedy, adapted from Nancy Maynard's book by Buck Henry, begins strongly, though Gus Van Sant directs in his usual cobbled-together manner (he uses hoary quasi-documentary devices to propel the story, and these artifices--flashbacks and direct-to-the-camera nods--grow tiresome quickly). However, Henry's screenplay is amusing, Kidman is intensely watchable, and the solid supporting cast is first-rate. **1/2 from ****",To Die For
11,dbdumonteil,ambition knows no bounds,8,19 May 2007,"Gus Van Sant is part of the fixture in American independent cinema and although ""To Die For"" was a piece of work that came from the studios, he films the story of this female go-getter ready for anything to accede glory and fame in a very personal way.It's built on an alternation of present moments in which various characters who crossed Nicole Kidman's path talk about her and flashes-back that relate the turn of events. Characters including her parents, her former young lover and friends express their thoughts about her without succeeding in understanding her. There, appears the first quality of Van Sant's work: the somewhat elusive personality of her main female character who especially manipulated her close relatives to go up the social ladder and to achieve her ends.Manipulation is very present throughout the work with the conspicuous presence of TV and camera. And you have to see the contrast between the dynamic Suzanne Maretto (Nicole Kidman) and her rather listless husband Larry acted by Matt Dillon and especially the teenagers who hang around us like Jimmy Emmett (a young and good Joaquin Phoenix) or Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland). There, appears Van Sant's signature. ""To Die For"" includes some of the filmmaker's obsessions revolving around an American youth who is adrift and lacks of marks for their future and security. What Jimmy and timid, hung-up Lydia need is true love, something that Suzanne can't really give them. And her plan to report on an American high school is only a means to establish a little more her galloping ambition. Van Sant will resume his set of themes about a ramshackle American youth and will hone it with his masterful ""Elephant"" (2003).The choice of the scenery (Moretto's house) and the brightness of the cinematography, Nicole Kidman's make-up fuel the somewhat quirky side of the venture and Van Sant doesn't deprive himself of gently laughing at her female heroine. I dig the moments when she goes to the office held by Wayne Knight to ask for a job and ends up hosting the weather forecast on a little local area. A task she painstakingly fulfills. Nicole Kidman holds her role at arms' length and has a tremendous screen presence. It's just a shame that Van Sant doesn't emphasis enough on the madness that seizes Suzanne after the murder when she is interviewed by the journalists.But see it anyway for Kidman and the manner Van Sant tells this story of ambition, manipulation and hypocrisy. And David Cronenberg has a surprising cameo at a well-appropriated moment in a vital step of the heroine's fate.",To Die For
12,Quinoa1984,"an All-American Story, done as pitch-black comedy",10,29 March 2010,"There's a few ways one could approach the material of To Die For, and one of those is to make it a straight melodrama, the saga of a woman who was an ambitious, sweet-faced and psychotic woman who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted. But director Gus Van Sant, by way of Buck Henry's incisive and daring screenplay, eschews melodrama for a really dark comedy perhaps not too unlike Network, only this time we don't feel sorry for the lead character the way we do here. Suzanne Stone is no Howard Beale. She's an All-American Girl, Waspy, beautiful (stunningly so), and has that look in her eyes that could kill a kitten if it needed to. And she wants to be famous - really famous, since she's on TV. She doesn't want to be a great journalist like a Mike Wallace, but a personality, like Connie Chung (""Not Povich"", as she points out), and will do anything to get it, which includes recruiting unwitting (and kinda outright spot-on dumb) teenagers into a murder plot to off her husband.Oh, this could be such Lifetime material looking just at the plain synopsis. But it's the ingredients that count, what the actors, director and writer do that make it a unique blend that, actually, has some genuine pathos to it. Henry, coming at the material in a slightly similar way to that he had with The Graduate, makes these characters flawed, even quite unlikeable, but they're also painfully human. Suzanne may be a control freak and just possibly as stupid in her own right as the teens she gets in her 'documentary' she's yet to finish. One of them, played by a young Joaquin Phoenix, falls genuinely in love with her, and he's perhaps the ultimate victim (not to mention the husband, played by Matt Dillon as a kind if ineffectual and, contrary to what Suzanne wants, painfully average Italian-American guy). She's like a perky spider who can reel in anyone she wants, and they won't be able to leave her web. Some of them wouldn't want to, like Lydia, who just wants a friend.To Die For is a blistering comedy, shot with a pseudo-documentary feel where from the start (like Fosse's Star 80) we know that a murder has occurred, and her family, ex-in-laws, and ex-friends and co-workers talk about what she was like, how things were. It's a comedy of attitude and mores, and of a certain frame of mind. I felt uncomfortable laughing during some scenes with Suzanne, as she's certainly a disturbed woman, but it's Kidman's ironic perkiness, that is suffused with a genuine quality about her. This pervades the rest of the cast, and potential caricatures (the Italian family with Hedaya, the wasted teenagers played by Affleck and Phoenix) are given some life and depth, in part because of the structure of the documentary. We also get some really knock-out supporting work from Ileana Douglas, Phoenix (especially him), and subtler but no less impressive work from Folland, who we haven't seen in a while in a role as good as this.This is a film with something to say about media attraction and the disease of fame, of the infectious quality of it that, in a way, works even more revelatory as a satire, albeit one based in some facts and truth (I can't say I knew the whole case going in, except that a newswoman really did collaborate with a 15 year old she was sleeping with to kill her husband). The style is off-beat and unpredictable, with a real sense of getting the audience to look a certain way at the characters and at settings and form. Perhaps because of its approach of fake-documentary, including those interspersed clips of Suzanne talking to the audience (which, as it turns out, is just into another camcorder by herself), we don't know where it will go as a story. This is one element that's absorbing, but it's the characters and their direction, and important scenes with acting that make it stand out.One such scene I must mention is a turning point in the film, and it's quite frightening: Suzanne comes home and Larry wants a talk - he goes on about wanting to get his restaurant together, and he pitches to her that she should tape some of the musical or whatever acts that perform there, edit them, maybe get them on TV or to producers somewhere. During this scene, Kidman sits on a chair and her eyes literally glaze over as he goes on and on and diminishes her already huge ego by telling her that the TV thing probably won't pan out, etc, and how Van Sant goes in for the close-up on her - and the reverse on Dillon as an iris shot - is something of a mini-masterpiece of a scene. Like Network, like The Graduate, like Star 80, but all unto itself, the film suggest much darker layers of the human condition, but all for the sake of entertainment. It's a master's class in laugh first, think/feel second film-making (or doing them at the same time).",To Die For
13,wes-connors,Gus Van Sant Makes it Big with Nicole Kidman,9,7 February 2010,"Little Hope, New Hampshire is rocked by scandal when self-absorbed TV sexpot Nicole Kidman (as Suzanne Stone) manipulates moody teenager Joaquin Phoenix (as Jimmy Emmett) into killing her husband, baby-minded bartender Matt Dillon (as Larry Maretto). Mr. Phoenix' young accomplices are bored-as-hell classmates Casey Affleck (as Russell Hines) and Alison Folland (as Lydia Mertz). Lending support to Mr. Dillon's side is figure-skating sister Illeana Douglas (as Janice Maretto).In a ""To Die For"" role, Ms. Kidman more than rises to the occasion; her performance is worthy of ""Best Actress"" notice, and her sex appeal invites comparisons with Marilyn Monroe and Ann-Margret. Moreover, as directed by Gus Van Sant, everyone performs exceptionally.

15,sunwarrior13,Weird And Awkward Story,9,21 December 2011,"The price of fame is murder.Or at least it is in the mind of one woman in New Hampshire.That is the plot of the movie entitled,To Die For. It stars Nicole Kidman, Matt Dillon, and Joaquin Phoenix. Major supporting roles feature Illeana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Casey Affleck, Kurtwood Smith, Dan Hedaya, and Alison Folland.It was dark comedy film, made in a documentary format based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard, which in turn was based on the Pamela Smart story. It was written by Buck Henry and directed by Gus Van Sant.Suzanne Stone has spent most of her life wanting to be famous; she's attractive, speaks well, and imagines herself to be intelligent, so she has set her sights on becoming a TV anchorwoman. However, opportunities for female broadcasters are hard to come by in Little Hope, New Hampshire, and she's convinced that her husband, the once handsome but now flabby restaurant manager Larry Maretto, is just getting in her way. Suzanne gets herself a spot hosting a weather report on a local public access station, and is preparing a documentary called ""Teens Speak Out,"" which puts her in touch with a trio of high school students -- Jimmy, Russell, and Lydia -- who are even more desperate for attention than she is. When Suzanne hatches a plot to get Larry out of her life once and for all, she uses Jimmy, who has developed a serious crush on her, to do her dirty work, but Larry's sister Janice, who has long believed there was something fishy about Suzanne, eventually begins to realize what happened to her brother. Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance in this film as she won a Golden Globe award for her portrayal of Suzanne.This was a smart and wicked delight that one may truly enjoy inspite of its weird and awkward story for it was wonderfully told and brilliantly acted.It is a must-see not only for Nicole's fans but anyone who loves good films.",To Die For
16,Hey_Sweden,What's the point of doing anything worthwhile if nobody's watching?,8,21 September 2017,"Nicole Kidman is right on target in this notable dark comedy, an adaptation of the Joyce Maynard novel which was itself inspired by a notorious real life story. Nicole, looking absolutely ravishing throughout, is a completely self-serving sociopath named Suzanne Stone who's simply hellbent on achieving her personal American dream of being a TV personality. When she realizes that her nice guy husband Larry (Matt Dillon, in a solid change of pace performance) is going to be an obstacle in her path, she turns on the heat and convinces dumb as dirt, lovelorn teenager Jimmy Emmett (Joaquin Phoenix, in his breakthrough performance) to bump off Larry. She then proceeds to play to the media to her hearts' content.22 years later, this film version remains pretty damn relevant, in the era of reality television where just about any person can become a celebrity for no really good reason, and fame & fortune is still seen as a worthwhile goal. Working from a screenplay by actor Buck Henry, director Gus Van Sant gives us a thoroughly absorbing film with a fair amount of ideas to mull over. Just like any good dark comedy, it's funny in a twisted sort of way. I'm sure some people who've followed the story, or read the book, or seen the movie, must know one or more people like Suzanne Stone.An exceptional cast full of familiar faces is the real drawing card: Phoenix, Casey Affleck as his degenerate ""friend"", Alison Folland as the awkward girl who hangs out with the two of them, Dan Hedaya and Maria Tucci as Larry's parents, Kurtwood Smith and Holland Taylor as Suzannes' folks, Tim Hopper and Michael Rispoli as investigating detectives, Wayne Knight as the manager of a local TV station, and especially Illeana Douglas as Larry's sister, a cynical sort who has Suzanne pegged right early on. Making cameo appearances are author Maynard (as Suzannes' lawyer), screenwriter Henry (as a huffy teacher), and filmmaker David Cronenberg as the mysterious man at the lake. Kidman is a marvel as she really struts her stuff for the camera.Ultimately, one does feel somewhat sorry for Jimmy when it's seen just how pathetic he really is.

17,preppy-3,Excellent drama with powerful performances,9,27 January 2010,"This movie is (loosely) based on the Pamela Smart case. Ambitious Suzanne Stone Maretto (Nicole Kidman) is determined to make it big on TV. However she thinks her laid-back loving husband (Matt Dillon) is standing in her way. She sexually seduces a very dumb and ugly high school student (Joaquin Phoenix) and tries to convince him to kill her husband.Great drama that was a big hit in its day but now seems fairly unknown. Even the opening sequence which sets up the entire story (with great music by Danny Elfman) is beautifully done. The script is incredible--it expertly balances humor, tragedy and drama effortlessly. Gus Van Sant's direction is just unbelievable. He keeps your eyes riveted to the screen using various camera techniques and tricks but never lets them overpower the story (like Brian De Palma does). Also he has characters talk to the camera narrating the story (in a way). It's risky but he pulls it off. It's a crime that he didn't even get nominated for an Academy Award for this. There are strong supporting performances by Dillon (doing wonders with nothing to work with), Phoenix (the interrogation sequence is heartbreaking), Illeana Douglas and Casey Affleck. But Kidman is phenomenal. She takes this role and runs with it. She acts like she's a sweet woman in public but you see the evil inside her waiting to spring out. Even when she lashes out she does it in a quiet but VERY scary fashion. She won numerous awards as Best Actress...but wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award! Her marriage to Tom Cruise at the time might have had something to do with that.

Stylishly directed by Gus Van Sant who previously made Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho, and he is backed with a smashing performance by Nicole Kidman with charm and sarcasm. She speaks directly at the camera trying to convince us and perhaps herself that she is the victim, but her crime bore consequences. Joaquin Phoenix plays a student guided by lust without realizing where he is headed. The reality of this is too severe when dealing with self esteem issues and the need to belong. Matt Dillon plays her husband who desired the American dream and had it vanquished. Casey Affleck plays one of the students with a low self esteem who is easily led by the influence of a hottie like Kidman. Illeana Douglas steals scenes as his sister who speaks to the camera before descending on ice skates across a lake that marks another meeting place. Intriguing film about damaged lives led by the illusion of fame. Score: 8 / 10",To Die For
23,AaronCapenBanner,She May Be!,7,10 December 2013,"Gus Van Sant directed this sly satire starring Nicole Kidman as ambitious but cold-hearted woman named Suzanne Stone, who has plans on becoming a television star and news anchor, and will do anything to make that happen. When she realizes that her husband Larry(played by Matt Dillon) is holding her back, she concocts a scheme to use teenage admirer Jimmy(played by Joaquin Phoenix) to murder Larry, and uses the promise of sex to accomplish this. What she didn't count on was the determination of Larry's father(played by Dan Hedaya) and sister(played by Illeana Douglas) to avenge his death... Nicole Kidman is stunning, delivering a believable(and sexy) performance, and the whole cast is fine. Quite funny yet also tragic look at wasted lives is also an ironic commentary on fame, and what people are willing to do to get it.",To Die For
24,The_Void,"Interesting, but not entirely successful",7,23 June 2006,"Gus Van Sant strikes me as a director who thinks he is a lot better than he really is. Art flick 'Elephant' may have won awards, but wasn't as good as the director clearly thought it was; while Good Will Hunting worked thanks to it's script and actors than Van Sant, and I won't even go into the Psycho remake. To Die For is a mockumentary about the life and death of a prospective weathergirl, and while the film is well written and artfully brought to life, it's never all that interesting; and the documentary style way in which it is filmed doesn't benefit it, therefore, as what it lacks in characters isn't made up by the plot. Actually, the film takes influence from a range of sources and once the film begins; it's not difficult to see where it will end. The central character of Suzanne Stone is indeed an interesting lead, and she is well brought to life by the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman; but the script doesn't allow for any 3D characters to emerge, and even though most of them are brought to life by other people's reactions; it all feels a little flat.The commentary on fame and how some people will do anything to obtain it is well felt through the lead character, and Van Sant does a good job in ensuring that her actions are shocking by way of showing us her friends' and family's reactions to her actions. The film plays out by skipping backwards and forwards through the different characters as each gives their verdict on events, and the film does feel like a real life documentary most of the way through. It's lucky for Van Sant that he managed to obtain a talented set of actors. Nicole Kidman, who I've already mentioned is every bit the vindictive bitch, and scenes such as the one set to 'Sweet Home Alabama' help to ensure a darker side to her character, while being sexy at the same time. The likes of Matt Dillon, Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Afleck are good in their supporting roles; but it's the character actors such as Wayne Knight that really make the film what it is, with small but memorable appearances. Overall, this certainly isn't a bad film; but it's not all that great, and the ending, ironically, is very cold indeed.",To Die For

27,blanbrn,"Wickedly, stunning and cunning satire of fame obsession and media power, and Nicole Kidman's most brilliant and sexy performance ever.",8,23 November 2008,"No doubt about it 1995's ""To Die For"" is one of the most underrated films of the 90's, and certainly it has it's place in film history for it's critique of the media and the theme of fame obsession. Some may see it as a black hearted and tragic comedy type, and true it mostly is still the film is blended well enough with humor, drama, and sex from a tremendous screenplay from legendary screenwriter Buck Henry. Also the direction from director Gus Van Sant is in top form as the way the scenes were shot it moves the film along just fine with the script. The bread and butter of the film is Nicole Kidman's performance(why she wasn't Oscar nominated is a mystery)her selfish, cunning and extremely talented and brilliantly sexy performance is clearly her best work ever and in my book one of the cinema's best works of history.Nicole Kidman is Suzanne Stone a small town New Hampshire girl who has big dreams and has the ambition and success to shine in front of the TV camera. Believe me this woman is dead set on achieving her goals from using her talents even if it means scheming a murder plot nothing will stop her quest for fame and stardom of the glaring lights of broadcast TV news. Suzanne first meets her love and marries Italian hunk Larry Maretto(Matt Dillon) to become Mrs. Maretto only this eventually turns out to be an obstacle that interferes with Mrs. Stone's journey on the love of fame. Never fear this clever and sunny and stormy weather girl reporter forecast a plan after working at the local small town station she meets a dopey and slacker group of teen high school kids named Jimmy(Joaquin Phoenix) and Russel(Casey Affleck) in which she does documentaries on their poor and useless living. Slowly after getting their hopes and dreams up of escaping poverty, Suzanne uses her wile and charm to seduce Jimmy and she makes him be her gun for hire! All during this film despite it's cunning plot and wicked charm the focus and highlight of how society has become obsessed with fame and TV is well displayed here with this film. As it proves TV is important we as people are very visual and the masses of society like to stay informed and it proves those behind the camera will try any means to obtain that fame and power. And once again Kidman really makes the film showing and proving that being sexy and being beautiful really helps to deliver info on TV not just her talents of acting, but being able to speak a US accent so well when she's a born Australasian, but her cunning beauty and sex appeal shines so well. Clearly her best performance and this role was really sexy for her. I just love the scenes of her changing into those sexy multi-colored bras! That glimpse and scene of her in the purple bra and panties is so memorable! Her performance made the film.Overall ""To Die For"" is a great picture proving just how obsessed that people have became with TV and media fame, proving that it often leads to scandal even murder. Also just a note Illeana Douglas is good in a supporting role as Larry's cynical and upset sister. In the end though success many times comes at a price as turnabout is fair play as you will see in a cold way in the end fame is ""To Die For"" literally and figuratively.",To Die For
28,ThomasDrufke,"""What's the Point if No One is Watching""",6,20 October 2019,"A young Nicole Kidman here reminded me of the off-kilter performance from Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler a few years back. The film is just strange enough to be enjoyable, even if it's hard to see the ultimate point of the film. I appreciated the semi-mockumentary style approach and early performances from Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix, but time hasn't necessarily been kind to the film. Other movies since have done a more efficient job of presenting a story with similar subject matter.6.0/10",To Die For

All the characters are great, and the ending was quite awesome as well, plus Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix are simply incredible in this!. Kidman is incredibly sexy in this one,and this is very well made and written as well, plus there is a very tense scene when Dan Hedaya (Larry's (Dillon) father) smashes the TV screen and bar glasses with a baseball blat because of Kidman's lie. Kidman's character is very hard to like, but she was just so incredibly convincing, and it had some great bizarre scenes as well, plus Joaquin Phoenix ,Casey Affleck and Alison Folland are very believable as the teenagers (especially Phoenix). It's pretty unpredictable throughout, and it's also got some very funny scenes as well, plus I was surprised by the suspense as well. This may not be for all tastes though, and all the characters are extremely likable (except Kidman's, but she wasn't supposed to be), plus Matt Dillon is very good as the husband. This is a clever little film, that's a really nice mix of Comedy and thrills, with an engaging story and amazing performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Gus Van Sant does a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at an engaging pace. The Acting is amazing!. Nicole Kidman is amazing as always and is incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely sexy, plays an incredibly convincing witch, had an awesome character which was very hard to like,gives one of her finest performances, and just gave it her all she was amazing! (Kidman Rules!!!!!!!). Matt Dillon is very good as Kidman's husband he was charming and quite likable I dug him. Joaquin Phoenix is also incredible here, he is extremely likable just had this innocent look on him, and I really felt sorry for What Kidman's character made him do, and what she did to him as well, he was amazing (Pheonix Rules!!!!!!!). Casey Affleck is great as the disgusting teen, he was morbidly funny, even though he was quite rude, and played his role extremely well. Illeana Douglas is great as Dillon's sister I liked her lots, she's also a fine figure skater!. Alison Folland is cute and was incredibly likable, she just wanted some friends, so I really felt for her, as I liked her a lot. Dan Hedaya is very good as Dillon's father and has one intense scene with a baseball bat. Wayne Knight is excellent here in his role, and surprisingly didn't remind of Newman one bit. Kurtwood Smith is decent as Kidman's father and did his job adequately. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",To Die For
30,atlasmb,Nicole Shines,6,10 November 2014,"This film has a great cast. Nicole Kidman, who plays Suzanne Stone Maretto, is amazing in this film. Talk about committing to a role! So why do I feel so lukewarm about the film? Maybe because it is considered a black comedy, but I find little funny in it. More probably because the story is not very compelling. We have seen other films with this basic premise. I think it is easy to lapse in caricatures when filming a black comedy. In this case, some characters did feel like caricatures while others seemed totally real. The juxtaposition of those two types of entities is distracting.It has been suggested that ""To Die For"" is a satire that skewers reality TV and the idea that television grants importance to a person or subject. The director hits the viewer over the head trying to sell that theme. But that's not how I perceive the story, which feels more like a character study.The structure of the film, while interesting, eventually proves tiring. Interspersing montage, faux interviews and a documentary-style is innovative, but they undercut the scenes that are straight narrative.This is not a grest film. It is not one of the season's best. But it is interesting. I would view this film just to watch Nicole Kidman walk her tightrope of a performance and deliver a memorable portrayal.",To Die For
31,The-Sarkologist,Going to extreme ends to succeed,7,21 December 2013,"Well, I sort of expected something a little different, but what I did get was pretty good anyway. I expected her to be clawing her way to the top through lies, trickery, deceit, and murder. She was clawing her way to the top, but she really did not seem to get anywhere.This movie is about an obsessed woman named Susan. She is obsessed with being on television, and will do anything to get there. We are not sure if she went all the way with one television producer, but as far as she gets is a small cable channel in her home town. She has dreams of Hollywood, but she never really gets there, and I think that this is the main thrust of the movie - the fact that she is obsessed with something that she can never have.The movie is told from the point of view of the characters looking back. It begins with the death of Susan's husband, and the characters look back to see how this happened. Her husband's parents had connections in the mafia, which is a very bad thing when it came to her lies and deceit to get her off of the murder charge.She is a smart girl, but she is obsessed with one thing so much that she will kill for it. At first she seems to love this guy immensely, but as the movie drags on, she becomes more distant from him in pursuit of her goal - to the point that when he tells her to give up, he is no longer somebody whom she can look up to. He goes from being an encouraging friend to an arch-enemy.This is a somewhat strange film, but it has been crafted well. I haven't seen many movies by Gus Van Sant, but after seeing the brilliance of My Own Private Idaho, I decided that I liked his work and will generally take an interest in movies that I know that he has made. This movie does not change my mind about him, but rather strengthens my view that he is an above average filmmaker.",To Die For
32,Dr_Coulardeau,Nicole Kidman makes that film a poem of entertaining absurdity,9,20 August 2014,"Nicole Kidman is such a good actress that, even in 1995 which was early in her career, she was able to carry a film that had very little plot indeed and no suspense since we knew from the very start that she was confessing a crime and the real killer, James, was in prison paying for the crime. We also knew the victim very fast because it was obvious anyway. And the end is what she deserves in the world of direct justice of retaliation. And yet what makes this film something more than just a plain tricky entertainment?The first thing is the woman this Nicole Kidman is personating, Suzanne Stone Maretto. That woman is a sociopath and apparently no one sees it. What's more she is an exhibitionist and everyone is blind to it. She marries for the money and the connections (with the Italian mafia). She is only in love with one single individual: her dog, and nothing else. She dares go to a high school class for some talk with the students and she sits on the teacher's desk, more or less facing the students with a mini-skirt (at eye level for the sitting students) that definitely does not reach under half her thighs. And no one, not even the teacher, tells her anything, discreetly of course, but that would seem necessary, especially in 1995, and though Monica Lewinsky was not yet an affair that kind of soft-cum-hard exhibitionism was not exactly kosher, at least in schools.Her desire to be on TV was an obsession and her mafia connections due to her marriage were naturally an argument understood by everyone without anyone having to mention them. So she got her two minutes of TV time at the highest of all peak hour time: the supreme prime time, the weather forecast.The second thing is the vision given in hat film of teenagers. Three are picked as the only ones we'll see, hence they are asserted as being representative, and in their class practically no other student is really visible, I mean shown in any way. Teenagers are easy to manipulate for sure, especially when they have penises that are bigger than their brains. Suzanne Maretto turns them into victims in one single instant and each one is the accomplice of the others. She picks the one who has the least brain and she has her puppet on her strings. The most surprising element is that no one seems to see anything nor to care – if they see something. The third thing is the fact that she manages to go through the whole assassination of her husband and the police and justice procedure unharmed because she tells a tall tale about her husband being addicted to cocaine to which the teenagers she has manipulated had introduced him, and they became feral when he decided to drop the habit. It is a pure lie but she can manage to get it through as if it were holy water or Saint Emilion wine. What's more she manages to practically have a press conference on the steps of the police station or court when she is apprehended for questioning. The cops are by far more lenient than they should be. You can beat about the bush as much as you want but something is fishy in this community (that reminds me a lot of Twin Peaks, echoed by ""Teens Speak Out"") where an unknown woman who marries the son of a mafia family is a social climber and gets her TV time that makes her locally famous, and from this moment onward she can do anything she wants even the most incredible capers and everyone let her do it and go on to doing more. Her blabber about ""America, liberty and all the rest"" is nearly an insult to the public who takes the tone of the declaration as a true American heart-deep truth and belief.Is it the very dark, octopus ink dark sense of humor of Gus Van Sant that makes all that incredible fable believable? Probably, plus the mesmerizing presence of Nicole Kidman and her partly denuded body under her mini-skirt probably that defuse any kind of inclination to protest. Give them the thighs they like and you can tell any kind of rant: they will accept it and believe it.A great actress in spite of all in a rather unfathomable rave-movie of the rave-party family.

33,johnnyboyz,Interesting look at the desperation for fame through a media based medium that rings as true today as it might've done back then.,6,4 February 2009,"To Die For is all over the place, but I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film takes on three different approaches to telling a story and criss-crosses two very different genres in order to follow that through. One third of the equation is told in flashback form of one person's meeting, consequent marriage and continuation into brief married life with another person. Additionally, Nicole Kidman's character named Suzanne Stone tells us first hand and directly into the (or 'a') camera these events that she indulged in with the other half of the relationship already described  he is Matt Dillion's Larry Maretto. Kidman sits in front of a bright, blank and slightly blinding white screen, perhaps a visual representation of her conscience. Thirdly, members of Larry's family talk directly into the camera, but I get the feeling it is 'the' camera and not 'a' camera, about Suzanne and Larry's relationship in a downbeat and somewhat regretful manner that is linked to things later on.Purely from a pitch point of view, To Die For has a lot going on within it. The film is a blend between two genres I haven't had the fortune of coming across as being previously blended; Larry and Sharon's romance, marriage and story about hapless young adults getting involved whiffs of film noir. Whereas the other two components of the piece are firmly set within the realms of the documentary but with that added bite that the film has already established itself as one that will incorporate scenes during which the characters are NOT aware of the camera watching them and consequential events will be played out. On top of all this is the fact the film was based on true events anyway.I liked To Die For overall, even if I had a couple of reservations about the flicking between concepts and it is one of those films that puts its ideas across in such an off the wall and postmodernist way that it sort of blinds you as to the very basic narrative that is unravelling within this bizarre world of deceit and ruthlessness. There is a point where you realise that given what's happened to these people so far, the film really isn't going to end on a happy note.The film is a tragedy, a tragedy that does no favours for anybody and given there are three different parties involved, that's a lot of destroyed souls through an individual's greed. Kidman plays Suzanne with an odd, balanced feel to her; the sort of person who does what she does because it's just simply the clearest cut way to get to where she wants to be but she doesn't play her as necessarily someone naive. Where she wants to be is as some sort of national icon made famous through television, the sort of goal or aim that was becoming more evident it was possible to attain as television grew and grew at the time the film was made and continues to flourish  whether you enjoy the medium is beside the point, the ever growing number of channels and popular talent shows goes on and on, echoing the ideas Van Sant puts into this film.Stone sees the marrying of Larry Maretto as a financial bookmark, the sort of person whose organised crime involved family will see them live in a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood and generally enjoy a wealth of some sort. Initially, Larry sees Sharon in the manner in which he wants to see her as this slightly less than bright but determined and hard working and quite attractive woman but the early signs that he may be drastically wrong are put across by his sister, who has her complaints about the woman. Following the wedding and several diversions into the future as Maretto family members and television network work colleagues vent with decided regret their opinions on Sharon and her actions; the film enters film noir mode and has an out and out, upfront seduction involving said woman and hapless young adult Jimmy Emmett (Phoenix) who doesn't know any better.One of the thrills of the film is watching it all unfold in the manner it does but like I said, the documentary side of the deal does sort of frustrate after a while as some narrate from the future and Stone talks, quite literally, into her own camera about who she is and what she's doing and while the intentions are good, it does sort of grate. But the study is there. Stone's tape is eerily similar to any one of those many recorded reality TV auditions as young, less-than-bright adults try to talk about themselves in a desperate attempt to get onto television and by that automatic token, hopefully achieve fame.While this is all well and good, Van Sant hurries his final act due to the realisation things must round off soon. He allows Stone to allow Jimmy's female friend Alison (Mertz) to overhear the sex they have, piling on a rather obvious sensation that Sharon's in danger of giving the game away and on one such occasion in a very crowded public place, she spills out the entire plan to her. Regardless, Van Sant has made something that's a fascinating study at times; illogical at others and gives us a few too many post-modern touches for it to be wholly satisfying but Kidman sparkles in a role that demands a ruthless but rather dim persona and you do come away with a bizarre, indistinct reaction to it all of satisfaction; sadness; anger and frustration all at once.",To Die For
34,filipemanuelneto,A simple yet effective story with Kidman in great shape.,6,17 June 2017,"This film by Gus van Sant is based on the ambitions of Suzanne Stone, a weather girl from a local TV station who wants to achieve fame and success at any cost. When her rich husband becomes a problem, she decides to arrange a lover to kill him. A simple plot, but with good premises for what Van Sant wanted: a kind of black comedy about sex, ambition and manipulation. He skillfully presents most of the film as a documentary, using cinematography and some visual and sound tricks to give more authenticity to that illusion. Nicole Kidman carries the film in her back with grace and malice, and seems very ease with her character, a girl who uses all the weapons to get what she wants. The remaining actors make a good supporting work, but are completely overshadowed by her talent.This movie is likely to appeal to black humor lovers. It's not a thriller or mystery movie, it's all pretty obvious to the public since the beginning. However, Kidman's performance is already a reason to make the film worth watching.",To Die For
35,st-shot,90's Masterwork,9,9 March 2008,"Gus Van Zant's wildly original take on the pursuit of fame at any price is a gruesome black comedy that works flawlessly on every level. Van Zant comes at his story from the viewpoint of a series of narrators who see through media lusting Susan Stone Marretto as she stops at nothing to bask in it's spotlight. The media in turn is more than willing to accommodate.Nicole Kidman as Susan is intimidating beyond the screen as she narrates much of her story into the camera. In addition to her remarkable seductive charm being put to use she also intimidates with a convincing icy coldness. She is the bold and the beautiful and Kidman is perfect to the role.Having bullied her way into a job as a weather forecaster at a small audience cable station Susan never stops shooting higher. She enlists three aimless high schoolers in a plot to kill her husband so as to unburden her to pursue her career. With sex as a tool it is easy to convince the moronically dim Jimmy who masturbates to her late night forecasts to come on board. The three teens Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Allison Foland are uniformly brilliant particularly Phoenix as the clueless doomed Jimmy. Her husband Larry (Matt Dillon)it might be said is in the same boat. Dillon along with Ileana Douglas and Wayne Knight fill out the solid supporting cast as narrators and victims of Susan.Buck Henry's biting script shows he has not lost his edge since his Graduate days. Director Van Zant's vision of a fin de siecle cross section of America is brutal and original. From those laboring for the American Dream to the bleak Lidsville existence of the teens Die burns with both nervous energy and tragic-comic farce. Accompanied by an all inclusive period music score Vant Zant's wide angle is both brazen and revealing from gaudy colored suburban drab sterility with hints of incest to tragic siding housing and an auto graveyard landscape that serves as a playground to the teens. Told in flash forward and back Van Zant's pace never lingers for a moment as it rapidly presents an in your face comic and tragic pastiche of dark Americana. Van Zant admirably expresses it with a bold visual flair keeping scenes lean and sharp that over a dozen years later still retain there power and energy. It is a vibrant piece of film making and a 90s classic.",To Die For

39,gcd70,Not to die for at all,3,16 March 2008,"Does anybody remember the T.V. movie ""Murder in New Hampshire""? No? Well it's hardly surprising, considering it was a terribly dull, forgettable show based on a true story of a scheming, manipulative teacher who enticed one of her young students to kill her husband because she didn't like him any more.With that in mind, it's hard to understand why a director of Gus Van Sant's calibre (""Drugstore Cowboy"") would believe there was more to be gained from remaking this film with a slightly different angle, that of black comedy. Unfortunately Van Sant's film is not black, not humorous and not the slightest bit effective.Nicole Kidman is really the only thesp worth watching, justifying all the rave reviews with probably her best performance to date as the ambitious, deceitful bombshell who wants nothing else but to be a TV. star. And if that means bumping off her strangling husband, then so be it.In support of Nicole is an impressive cast headed by the hunky Matt Dillon, who plays the victim, a likable Italian guy with a big heart who falls for the gorgeous Sue Stone. Also stars Dan Hedeya, Illeana Douglas, Casey Affleck, Alison Folland and a most impressive Joaquin Phoenix, who gives the flick's other strong turn as the confused, unsure, but totally love struck teen whom Sue bends to her own will with ease.What a shame the performances from Kidman and Phoenix are the only strong points of the movie. In his attempt to make a hip, observant film from Joyce Chopra's original, bland drama ""Murder in New Hampshire"", Van Sant has completely missed the mark. Having seen it all before doesn't help, but even if this isn't the case, our director has failed to create humour from any of the situations presented, and the script from Buck Henry hasn't nearly enough to get your teeth into. Kidman does her best in a role that, like an oasis, is surrounded by wide expanses of nothing.Even the talking to the camera trick has no impact.Sunday, March 10, 1996 - Knox District Centre",To Die For
40,I_Ailurophile,Eye-catching modern classic,7,26 July 2021,"I recall very well seeing 'To die for' plastered on the TV screen in ads when it was first released in theaters, then again as it began airing on cable channels. I think the slant of those ads gave me a false impression of what the movie would be like, but I'm pleasantly surprised as it is. This is a dark, dry comedy, crafted well and anchored by a solid cast.This is a movie about style above all else, and that's echoed in almost every aspect of its construction. The storytelling is split between apparent interviews with all characters involved, and flashbacks laying out the narrative in a more conventional arrangement. 'To die for' wasn't the first movie to employ this angle, and it definitely wasn't the last, but its use here is especially dazzling given the tone of the film, and the high variation in offered perspectives.Just as important here are the technical aspects of the feature, as everything is geared toward making 'To die for' pop out as vividly as it could. Director Gus Van Sant arranges some outstanding shots - an iconic moment of Nicole Kidman dancing to ""Sweet home Alabama,"" or even just a wide-angle image of Matt Dillon sitting in a living room. Costume design and wardrobe, makeup, set design and decoration, and art direction are all visually arresting, realized with sharp colors and patterns that are strikingly prominent throughout.Then of course there's the cast, including an unexpectedly large number of very familiar faces who are all swell in their roles. But Nicole Kidman, starring as Suzanne Stone, absolutely takes center stage. Hers is a fascinating character, both naïve in her aspirations and shrewdly calculating in her sinister scheme. Kidman shines in the camera's eye just as Suzanne would want, and deftly shifts between the protagonist's plucky, enterprising, go-getter attitude and her more cold and severe moods.With all this said, the narrative is written well and duly captivating, not least of all for the way it's conveyed, and the morbid sense of humor to the whole picture further works to keep our attention. At the same time, the very dry delivery is somewhat off-putting. And there are a lot of scenes - especially early on - that aren't funny as much as they are awkward and cringe-worthy. As well as the film is put together generally, it doesn't feel as immediately engaging as it should be - it's entertaining, but not truly fulfilling.Don't take that to mean I don't like 'To die for,' though, because I do. I love the emphasis on style in its craft, and from an overall standpoint of narrative, acting, and technical build, it's solid. While not necessarily as fetching as it wants itself to be, 'To die for' is still an original, enjoyable film that holds up pretty well all these years later - worth checking out.",To Die For
41,ferbs54,She's On TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,7,24 June 2008,"The phenomenal success of programs such as ""The Jerry Springer Show"" and ""American Idol"" amply demonstrates that people in this country are more than willing to suffer any number of indignities just to get their kissers up there on the TV screen. But who would be willing to go to the lengths that Suzanne Stone resorts to, in 1995's ""To Die For""? Based on Joyce Maynard's 1992 novel, which was itself based on the real-life story of Pamela Smart, a teacher who got four kids to liquidate her husband in 1990, the film takes place in the appropriately named town of Little Hope, N.H., where Suzanne, superbly played by Nicole Kidman, seduces a dim-witted teen (Joaquin Phoenix) to do away with likable but too family-oriented hubby Matt Dillon, all so that she can continue on with her job as weathergirl at a jerkwater cable station. Kidman is in full sexpot mode here, and her remarkable performance--requiring her to be by turns sexy, sly, conniving, manipulative, tough, dumb, pathetic and bitchy--is an Oscar-worthy one. (She had to settle for a Golden Globe.) Buck Henry's darkly comedic script is fascinating and slyly funny, and supporting players such as Illeana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Dan Hedaya and (the uncredited) George Segal all get their moments to shine. The film ultimately leaves the viewer with a feeling of sadness, as we realize that the cult of celebrity and 15-second fame has claimed several more victims. ""What's the point of doing anything if nobody's watching?"" is Suzanne's credo, and, as with Norma Desmond in 1950's ""Sunset Blvd.,"" the television cameras that point at her, as she descends the courthouse steps, are their own reward. Who cares if she's just been indicted for murder? She's on TV!!!",To Die For
42,Agent10,An interesting take on the news industry,8,25 April 2002,"To Die For was well ahead of its time, a sort of exploitive montage of intrigue and passion spliced with eroticism and seduction. Gus Van Zant should have stuck to making films like this, instead of rehashing garbage like Psycho. Nicole Kidman was exceptional, a rarity considering her limited capabilities as an actress. But what reallymade this film was the supporting cast. People like Matt Dillon, Kurtwood Smith, Joaquin Phoenix, Ileana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Casey Affleck and Dan Hedaya. Certainly a movie worth repeated watchings, one which clearly presents the fickle nature of broadcast news.",To Die For

This movie is not just good, it is excellent. A Sharp, intense film with extraordinary character development and Nicole's performance is one of her best ever.This movie easily makes my top 100 movies of all time and is both disturbing and riveting. Matt Dillon who most commonly portrays bullys and creeps, plays against type as Kidman's sweet, devoted husband. All he wants is to love his wife.

45,Spleen,To DIE for? Not worth crossing the road for.,3,29 August 1999,"A black comedy that is neither black nor a comedy, this is no more a satire of, or any kind of comment on, the media, than `Melrose Place' was a satire of ... well, at least `Melrose Place' had the grace not to pretend to be about anything.  The presence of video cameras in every shot does not give this empty movie even a theme, let alone a message.  And if I hear the American national anthem being played ironically one more time ... I mean, really, is there any more sure sign of intellectual bankruptcy?  Irony by itself is of no value; and Van Sant doesn't even get so far as to be ironic. We have the shell of irony without the flesh.  We have people going through the motions of telling a joke or making a pointed remark when there's no joke and no point.A story that might have served as the basis for a good movie is stretched out interminably with videotaped narration, pauses, rewinds and fast-forwards; although to compensate for all this mularky it ends abruptly, as if Van Sant ran out of tape.  Characters are coldly slapped before us like bodies in a morgue.  Perhaps someone mistook this lack of warmth for comedy, although I don't know that anyone actually laughed.I admit it's hard to fault the acting.  (Almost no film is ever spoiled by a poor performance - almost always a film is spoiled by something else instead.)  The character of Janice even manages to elicit some sympathy now and then, partly due to the actress (Illeana Douglas), partly because most of the writing is, in a sort of a way, good, if you focus on the individual sentences and ignore the pattern they fail to form.  Lydia, played by Alison Folland, would also be sympathetic if her character even approached consistency.  She's the trailer park resident who's allegedly unattractive. I'd like to take this opportunity to remark that the attitude this film has to the poor is a sickening one: contempt masquerading as sympathy.The movie would be distasteful enough to watch in any event.  I've read over my comments and they strike me as being far too mild - this really is tawdry rubbish.",To Die For
46,aimless-46,Season of the Witch,8,24 November 2005,"In contrast to ""Direct Cinema"" (a documentary style in which the filmmakers do not involve themselves in the action- the camera being all seeing and unobtrusive-even hidden), ""Cinema Verite"" permits the presence of the camera to make a difference in the reactions of those being filmed. Both documentary styles allow a degree of narrative freedom not permitted by the conventional Hollywood-style of a chronologically ordered series of dramatic scenes.The unique feature of ""To Die For"" is the use of both the ""Cinema Verite"" and the conventional narrative styles in the same film. Van Sant inter-cuts a traditional dramatic storyline with simulated documentary style commentaries by the principal characters. The commentaries are not just retrospective, they jump around in time and it is not entirely clear the order in which the interviews took place. Four years later ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" would be made entirely out of simulated interviews.The interplay of the two narrative styles in ""To Die For"" is critical to the advancement of its theme about the contrasting public and private faces each of us constructs. The irony is that the faces presented in the documentary interviews are much more human and revealing than their counterparts in the dramatic scenes. Perhaps not surprising given our ""camera whore"" compulsion, these characters are guarded and private when interacting with each other but liberated, open, and out-there when being interviewed.The most interesting aspect of all this is the plausibility of Kidman's character. At times Suzanne comes across as narcissistic, manipulative, complex, and sophisticated; at other times shallow and naive-dumb. This contrast is because to Suzanne every waking moment is an on-camera moment, yet she is only vulnerably human during her actual on-camera moments. She embodies, to an extreme degree, feelings we have all had in smaller and more subtle ways. She simply lacks the skill and/or desire to conceal them. Almost everyone has encountered someone who, while a skilled manipulator, is utterly clueless as to the transparency of their motives to everyone but the person being manipulated.Kidman's performance is inspired. Her clothes, her speech, her makeup, her hair, and the way she carries herself all make for a unity of complete self-absorbed superficiality. Suzanne pities us mere mortals  not because we are mortal but because we are not her.The producers seem to have gotten a little confused about just who was their target audience, which would account for the film's poor performance at the box office. Although not exactly ""high-brow"", the movie is obviously geared to a relatively sophisticated audience who can relate to black comedy, parody, and its psychological message. But instead of giving their film a unified style (which consistently connects to that audience), they throw in a lot of crude humor and gross cartoonish behavior more appropriate to a teen comedy. Their target audience and even the type of teens who might enjoy this movie are more put off than amused by this stuff.Which gets into the issue of trimming. The pace of the film is a little slow and the scenes where Suzanne seduces James are embarrassingly moronic and unconvincing; although the seduction dance is exceptional. If they trimmed 10-15 minutes from the middle of the film it would have better unity and would move along faster. The seduction angle would work better if kept off screen, there is enough explanation of these events in the various retrospective on-camera interviews. And they should lose some of the Buck Henry crazy teacher stuff-it works once but then becomes repetitive and unfunny.Illeana Douglas is wonderful as Suzanne's disgusted sister-in-law, who closes the film skating on the frozen lake containing Suzanne's body as the credits roll and Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"" plays. Very cool!",To Die For
47,PredragReviews,"""You're a nobody if you're not on TV""",9,13 May 2016,"""To Die For"" is a great little gem of a movie that, in my opinion, ranks as one of the best dark comedies of the 1990s. Nicole Kidman, in one of her finest performances, is stunning as Suzanne Maretto - her maiden name is Stone - a completely self-absorbed, amoral, and utterly ruthless young woman who will let nothing stand in the way of her obtaining her goal of being a ""television news star"". The film is shot in the style of a slightly wacky TV documentary, which only adds to the fun, as we see the ""post-tragedy"" interviews with those who were involved with the late Miss Stone. Stone is an attractive but cold-blooded blonde in a small New England city who is desperate to become a celebrity on a national TV News Network.Other inspired performances include George Segal in a splendidly cynical cameo, succinctly summarizing TV business reality. But the real sleeper is Illeana Douglas, narrator and Ms. Stone's sister-in-law. She smells a rat long before anyone else, and her wise-acre sarcastic delivery is terrific, especially as she gracefully skates over the evidence. That's cold! The movie seemed to move all over the place at points for no logical reason. Because of the somewhat jarring approach the ending seemed to be a forgone conclusion. This movie, featuring an unnerving performance by the late River Phoenix, was chilling, haunting, beautiful, and absolutely brilliant. Van Sant is certainly capable of greatness, and Kidman is also.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",To Die For
48,philip_vanderveken,"Very dark, just the way I like them",7,5 May 2005,"I know that there aren't all that many people who enjoy it, but I really like dark comedies a lot. I guess it's the fact that things like a murder are so serious and repelling, that many people believe you shouldn't laugh with it or make jokes about it, but when done in a proper way, this can be excellent cinema (think of the Danish movie ""De Grønne slagtere"" aka ""The Green Butchers"" for instance).However, this time the movie isn't about butchers, but about a woman who will do anything to reach her goal: becoming a famous TV personality. Really nothing will stop her from getting in the spotlights and certainly not her husband... She's cold and tough to get rid of and will persist until she finally gets what she wants, even if that means that people have to die for it.I really liked the story and I was pleasantly surprised by some actors. I never thought Nicole Kidman could play the role of Suzanne Stone in such a convincing way. She was really excellent as the hard and cold and not very intelligent woman, but also Matt Dillon did a very nice job playing her husband. Next to the acting and the story, I also liked the humor. Normally, all present comedies seem to have only one common theme: farting, vomiting and all other kinds of toilet humor and I really don't like that. So when finally seeing a comedy that didn't use that kind of jokes, I was already very pleased. And perhaps this dark humor is exactly the reason why not many people will like it, but personally I did and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",To Die For
49,DeeNine-2,This one will stay with you a little bit,9,4 August 1999,"Clever story with more depth that appears at first blush, directed with irony and a sardonic sense of humor by Gus Van Sant. Nicole Kidman plays an especially shallow TV weather person who gets some grunge kids to kill her husband for her. Her motive is, as Illeana Douglas, who plays the sister-in-law, says, ""he got in her way."" This is a nice study of narcissism metastasized into psychopathology. She is headstrong, motivated and rather stupid. She thinks only of herself and would do anything for herself and would do anything to anybody who got in her way. And amazingly, she does.Matt Dillon is wasted as the husband (in more ways than one). I'm surprised he agreed to do the part. Kidman is mesmerizing and makes us believe in a slightly unbelievable character. We've all known narcissistic little darlings who would kill you for the right shade of eye shadow, but to see it acted out so coldly and with such appalling stupidity, yet with a psychology so bizarre that it has to be real, fairly takes your breath away. It was especially apt that she had him killed so that her pointless little docu-drama ""Teens Speak Out"" could become newsworthy enough for national exposure. Consicously she doesn't realize this: she has no introspection; she just acts.Also cute is the way the picture is framed: a pseudo-documentary within a pseudo-documentary. Everything is so well orchestrated that when Kidman gets her surprising, but entirely appropriate comeuppance at the end, we are quite pleased.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Told appropriately in the style of a television documentary, it satirizes society's obsession with fame, celebrity and television in a way that's sharp and smart but also incredibly funny. The idea to make use of flashbacks and interviews with people who talk directly into the camera is also extremely effective.One of the movie's strongest points is its dialogue, which contains lines that make an immediate impact either because of their wit or because of the way in which they succinctly encapsulate the state of mind of a young woman who thinks that ""You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV. On TV is where we learn about who we really are because, what's the point of doing anything worthwhile if nobody's watching? And if people are watching, it makes you a better person"".Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) lives in Little Hope, New Hampshire and is determined to become a top broadcaster on TV. She's attractive, smartly dressed and thoroughly self-absorbed. Her commitment to making progress in the TV industry is so strong that, on her honeymoon, she takes time out from being with her new husband to attend an industry convention where she meets and subsequently sleeps with a top network executive. After returning home she gets an entry-level job at a local cable station where, through her persistence, she soon becomes the station's evening weather girl and also starts work on a documentary about high school kids called ""Teens Speak Out"".Suzanne's husband Larry (Matt Dillon) is a thoroughly nice guy who's deeply in love with her and manages his father's Italian restaurant. After being married for nearly a year, he thinks they should settle down to running the business together and raising a family. This idea doesn't sit well with Suzanne whose sole focus in life is to make it to the top in television. She decides that she needs to remove any impediments to the progress of her career and so, to that end, plans to have Larry murdered.Suzanne is very manipulative and becomes increasingly friendly with three of the students who are participating in her documentary so that she can use them to kill Larry. All three students have their problems which she exploits to achieve her ends. She seduces Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix) who's not very bright and is supportive to Lydia Mertz (Alison Folland) who's an overweight misfit and the promise of money wins the support of their friend Russell Hines (Casey Affleck). After the murder has been successfully carried out, Suzanne's documentary seems to provide the police with some useful clues but actually convicting Suzanne for the crime proves to be impossible.The quality of the acting in this movie is so good that some of the most memorable contributions come from the supporting cast. Matt Dillon is tremendously natural as the guy who can't say no to Suzanne and says ""she's it. She's the golden girl of my dreams"" and Illeana Douglas as Larry's cynical sister who's not fooled by Suzanne, even for a minute, says she can describe her in four letters starting with a ""c"".....""cold"". Dan Hedaya as Larry's Italian father makes a huge impression. He looks totally sceptical about his son's relationship with Suzanne and through most of the film looks as if he's going to explode with anger at any minute and there's also a superb cameo appearance from George Segal that's not to be missed.Importantly, Nicole Kidman is sensational in her role. The way in which she portrays her character's combination of perky attractiveness and utter ruthlessness is tremendously well balanced as is the way in which she conveys how clever she thinks she is, whilst also demonstrating convincingly that she's a complete airhead.""To Die For"" is a great piece of filmmaking about a tragic character who, after being seduced and corrupted by the media, became so obsessed by its superficial values that she ultimately developed into a delusional, sociopathic monster. The fact that this kind of story could be made into such a successful comedy really is a great achievement.",To Die For

Luckily, 'To Die For' isn't one of those movies. I remembered individual scenes, how the actors reacted, different key plot points etc. The movie is that good.

Well, watch this, and in a neat twist, watch what happens. This film is just so masterfully directed by Van Sant. The actors here are so good.

54,petra_ste,Beware the Siren's song,8,6 August 2007,"Nicole Kidman is a fine actress. That was obvious long before her Academy Award - in fact, ever since her breakthrough role in Noyce's disturbing Dead Calm. While she does have range, she is at her best when she has to project icy, duplicitous haughtiness. Maybe that's why, of all her roles, I prefer this one.In this Gus Van Sant movie she plays Suzanne, a narcissistic weather anchor who works for a measly local television but aspires to super-stardom and manipulates a trio of dumb teenagers (Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, Alison Folland) into getting rid of her dead weight husband (Matt Dillon).Nicole is fabulous here - so shallow and self-centered she is outright creepy, with the kind of low cunning displayed by smug people who don't really plan things through. But she never falls into caricature: there is a nice little moment right after she is hired when she is breathless with relief and embarrassment as the sexual favours she was expecting to be asked (and was ready to perform) never materialize. And she does look dynamite - for those legs I'd probably shoot Matt Dillon too. Hey, I'd throw in even Kevin Dillon for free. Just kidding. Maybe.The supporting cast is uniformly great too, from a wonderfully dense, glassy-eyed Phoenix as the teen killer to Illeana Douglas as the sister-in-law Janice who quickly sees through Suzanne's prim facade - when the two women meet and Suzanne suggests the work of a qualified plastic surgeon to get rid of Janice's facial blemishes, you know this means war.7,5/10",To Die For

Inspired by a real life case celeb - although it doesn't follow all the steps that case took, in case that might act as a spoiler.(Look up Pamela Smart on crimelibrary dot com after seeing this piece.)To generalise American's (the world's biggest film audience) don't make many films like this. Irony and understatement are not natural to them -- nor is black comedy. We have a couple of stars (or perhaps more a star and a half -- Matt Dillon doesn't fill many cinema seats!) and great performance from Nicole Kidman and even then it barely registered at the box office.Anyone who has anything to do with television (or even stood very close by) knows how important people involved think they are. They put up with the long hours and the poor pay but it is important because they THINK it is important -- and heaven help anybody that suggests otherwise.The central problem with Kidman is that she is not really in a relationship with husband Dillion at all. She is in a relationship with herself and her career. This is clever and funny (when she is on the way up) but doesn't really give us a any kind of tit-for-tat plot development.Dillion is a big kid that decides to grow up and join the real world and for Kidman that was his main appeal. He sells his drums and becomes Joe 9-2-5. Ironically the opposite of what most women want! (Heavon help any man who has a lifelong hobby that partners can't see a thing in!) The cast divide themselves in to who sees through her act and those that don't or won't.

56,Ben_Cheshire,Psychotic drama student (Kidman) plays psychotic weathergirl bimbo Suzanne Stone.,1,29 July 2004,"Strained and forced attempt at black comedy manages to be neither particularly dark or funny - just awkward. Its always a worry when the few jokes in a comedy are aggressive and mastubatory. The main thing i was trying to figure out was why a viewer would want to keep watching this movie. What is the purpose? What is the narrative drive? What keeps us watching past the credits, where we find out Kidman kills her husband, and in her eyes is the fact that she's psychotic. Its certainly not to find more out about this character - b.c she's pretty nauseating and reprehensible. Is it just to find out why this TV weather girl was accused of murder?This aim may have seemed more interesting if Kidman seemed a little more balanced. Nicole Kidman makes me nervous as a viewer: i'm always conscious of the fact that she's acting. Painfully so. The artificiality of her performance might be fine for black comedy, but in practical story terms, I just don't see why anybody would be fooled by her. She's clearly unbalanced from the get-go. What works about this is that there's a feeling of an inescapable fate - people marry the wrong person all the time, so that was the one interesting thing about it, that a person can actually be so blind to the fact that a person is wrong, when we know she turns out being very wrong, but we can't stop him from marrying her.The talking to the camera was so gimmicky it made me sick.

The script is shallow, the characters are corny and plastic, so the film really just never gets off the ground.  It has a lot of well known actors in it, but thats about it.  ** out of ****.",To Die For
65,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Intelligent and hilarious dark satire.,7,4 February 2012,"If you had told me that one of the greatest black comedies of the '90s was going to come from the director of Gerry and Drugstore Cowboy, I wouldn't have believed you. But man, Gus Van Sant really delivered here in what I think is easily the most unique work of his career. This isn't something that I would have expected from him at all and I really wish he would delve back into this genre because he is aces. From the genius opening credits sequence, which laces hard rock, razor-sharp editing and a fairy-tale score, you can tell that this is going to be a unique and bizarre experience.Unlike many films, Van Sant fully delivers on the promise from those opening minutes. I've never been a fan of structures that rely on using interviews with the characters to retrace the steps of the story, but I didn't seem to mind it as much here, probably due to how many laughs those interviews were able to pull out of me. It also helps that using that style plugs directly into the satire of the whole piece, a real biting commentary on the dangers and absurdity of popular media.Suzanne Stone, played with groundbreaking skill by Nicole Kidman, is one of the worst possible outcomes of our media-obsessed culture; an ignorant, vain and truly hopeless woman that couldn't be less likable if she tried. She is our plug in to the satire here and what follows is a delightfully twisted and bleak tale of a horrible woman doing horrible things. Looking up the film after watching it, I was amazed that it was actually based on true events. Van Sant creates an excellent style here, along with the help of a dreamy, unsettling and utterly hypnotizing score from Danny Elfman, but the true star is absolutely Kidman.I mentioned how I wanted Van Sant to do more films like this, but I desperately want Kidman to do more as well, because she is on fire. Suzanne Stone is an absolutely abhorrent creature and the best part of the film is that Kidman doesn't try to make her anything else. Most actresses, especially that early in their career, would feel the need to add something likable to the character or give some sort of a wink to the audience to let them know that she's in on the joke too, but Kidman goes for broke and dives into this character so completely.She's one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen in film, but Kidman is so absorbed in that role and the writing is so good that you can't look away from her, just having an urgent need to keep watching in the hopes that the bitch gets what's coming to her. A wickedly sharp, intelligent and brutally funny film with impressively unique work from everyone involved. It also features a David Cronenberg cameo that is my new favorite thing.",To Die For
66,Brian-272,Nicole You Take My Breath Away! Nicole Kidman is to die for!,8,26 May 2000,"Gus Van Sant's ""To Die For"" a dark satire which blends humor, tragedy, and sex this movie has different appeals for everyone and is well worth a watch. The real reason to watch this movie is the stunning erotic and completely captivating acting of Nicole Kidman. Kidman definitely should have won an oscar for her acclaimed performance of sultry TV personality Suzanne Stone. Nicole Kidman is by far the most underrated actress in Hollywood this film showed her many talents. Kidman's most impressive talent to me, is her ability to speak American no problem while she was born with a totally Australian accent that she speaks all the time in interviews and in other films, but in this film she speaks the American language like she was naturally born with it. My favorite scenes are Nicole Kidman's seduction scene of Joaquin Phoenix, and Kidman's dressing and undressing in sexy colored lingerie. Nicole Kidman is one of the most beautiful women in the world. The message of this film is to be ambitious and dead set to make your dream come true, even if it means murdering your loved ones. Success and fame is to die for literary, but a reality also as seen in the film's ending remember what comes around goes around. Fame really does have a price.",To Die For
67,Pookyiscute,One of the best films of all time,10,16 January 2006,"Superb is not a strong enough word. Excellent, doesn't even begin to cover it. Phenomenal, may do it some justice, but no word could describe just how brilliant this film really is. You could say that no wonder it's good, it was originally a book...but I tend to think it's the work of director Gus Van Sant, who really makes the film as good as it is.Nicole Kidman, really is 'To Die For' in this movie, and her performance is as well. She gave it her all, and I don't think I've seen in her in a better role or done a better job since. Although I never argue that every other movie I've ever seen her in, she is exceptionally good, this one captures her brilliance, just a little bit more than any other piece she's ever done.Based on the book, and fictionally re-created from the original true-crime story, the story is set on the east coast in a small town, called, Little Hope. After recently being married, Susanne (Kidman), begins working at a news station - her life-long dream - as an evening weather girl. She also, starts working on a documentary entitled, ""Teens Speak Out"", with three local high school students as the stars. One, is a young boy named, Jimmy (Pheonix). Having more than a bit of a crush on the beautiful, sexy older woman, he becomes infatuated with her. She, however, is having problems with her non-supportive husband at home (Dillan), and decides, that in order for her to move on with her career, she will need to get rid of her husband. So, with the help of her new lover, Jimmy, and two other young mis-fits, they plan to kill her husband.The description is dark, and in a way that is the film's basis. It is a dark film, with a lot of light colors. The interesting thing about the film, is that Van-Sant, takes a very suburban-American neighborhood, and family and makes them very light and colorful, while the music and facial expressions and sense of the movie remains cold and dark.Illeana Douglas also costars as Susanne's sister-in-law, and is also very entertaining and great in the film.This is not a film suitable for anyone under sixteen, but is very noteworthy. It shows how sex, and fame, can lead to some pretty awful things. It's a film that I would most definitely recommend. And, it is by far, one of the best films of all time.",To Die For

69,Jerique,All she wanted was a little attention,9,14 January 2009,"Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) would die for fame, whereas her husband, Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon) would die for her love. Suzanne plans to be the next Barbara Walters, but she has an obstacle put in front of her. After landing a small-time gig as the weather reporter at the local news station, Suzanne attempts a documentary of ""Teens Speak Out"" using three teens from the high school: Lydia (Allsion Folland), Russel (Casey Affleck) and James (Joaquin Phoenix). When Larry begins to pressure her with wanting to start a family of his own with her (a career suicide for a journalist), Suzanne takes matters into her own hands.The plot is intriguing and entertaining while the characters are engaging and surreal. The supporting cast does a wonderful job to glue you into your seat and make you stick for the entire presentation. The ending is shocking but does a good job to close up all the lose ends and leave you satisfied. The film is cut in an interesting way weaving between past and present.It's no surprise that Nicole won a Golden Globe for her wonderful performance. I must strenuously agree that she deserves it. She's sexy, clever and the performance is, in my opinion, an Oscar-worthy one. To Die For is one of the best films to grace audience's screens from the 90's era.",To Die For

Nicole Kidman's spot on, layered performance deserved an Oscar nod, and Alllson Folland, Joaguin Phoenix and Casey Affleck as three unsentimentalized teens are remarkably persuasive. Matt Dillon as Kidman's blinkered husband, and Ileana Douglas as his sister head a first rate supporting cast that includes brief appearances by David Cronenberg and George Segal. Appropriately, Van Sant's direction is tongue-in-cheek. To Die For is compelling, funny and frightening; Hollywood has never produced a better satire. One of the key films of the 90's, it's that rare film that gets better with repeated viewings.",To Die For
71,ThomasColquith,A Cringefest,5,3 October 2021,"""To Die For"" is an odd movie, it is sort of a mix of ""UHF"" meets ""Nightcrawler"" meets ""Dateline NBC."" It is also partially based on a true story which I did not know until after viewing it. Nicole Kidman was excellent, so believable; she looks great, very much the temptress. The story basically explores what will a man do to have a beautiful women, and what will a beautiful women do to fulfill her wishes. How much will each compromise morally and degrade themselves in order to achieve their aim? A poignant question and one which is relevant to everyone. While murder is the extreme case, there are many lesser ways men and women compromise themselves or their values in order to achieve certain material things. ""Love"" is a noble concept but is precariously close to lust, infatuation, and obsession; hormones can run amok and cause trouble quickly. Though sometimes ""Love"" can push someone to do great things, however that same feeling can compel someone to do awful things as well, especially when the feeling is one-sided and manipulation is at play. A scenario all prospective lovers fear -- the women the Lothario and the man the seductress. Some choose to take this risk and search for love, whereas others may be more shy and unwilling or unable to open their heart.""To Die For"" explores another important issue as well -- the affect of media and the human desire for acceptance, achievement, greatness, fame, etc. This relates to the current social media issues affecting younger people especially, such as the assumed need to document everything you do digitally, or it's as if it never happened. Addiction to social media is real and its deleterious effects including lowering self-esteem, stoking jealously, providing another avenue for bullying is well known now. This obsession with TV and media has not gotten better since ""To Die For"" was filmed, in fact it is probably much worse now with the spread of the internet and cell phones. So it is a somewhat thought provoking film with Nicole Kidman and Matt Dillion in their prime (though his role is much smaller) but it is not great. I just call it average. The somewhat explicit scenes between Kidman's and Phoenix's characters are just uncomfortable, as is the whole plot really. So for those reasons I rate this film a 5/10, not a must watch.",To Die For
72,daoldiges,"To Die For, Really?",6,22 July 2021,"I recalled this movie and what came to mind was the attention given to Kidman's performance. Based on that and Van Sant's direction, I thought I would finally check it out. I agree, Kidman does give a solid performance, practically carries the film. There are however mostly strong performances from the entire cast as well. There's a bit of humor here, nothing all that funny really, but touches of humor exist. Despite all the positives the results are fairly flat and nothing really is as dark or funny or engaging as I think Van Sant hoped for. Not a bad film but not a must see either.",To Die For
73,PCT1970,Kidman is To Die For,8,26 March 2019,"Van Sant helms one of the best dramedy / mockumentary films in recent memory. Adapted from the novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard, which was inspired by the true story of New Hampshire high school teacher Pamela Smart, the film closely follows the novel. Excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, setting, costume, soundtrack and acting. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Kidman, Dillon, Phoenix, Affleck and Douglas stand out. The plot revolves around an extremely ambitious women named Suzanne who, through continuously harassing her boss, lands a job as a weather anchor at her small town's local cable station. Suzanne won't stop there however, as she has dreams of grandeur. Suzanne recently married a local average joe named Larry who works at his family's restaurant and is just seeking to live a conventional life. Suzanne soon, in her obsessed psychotic mind, sees Larry as being an obstacle to reaching her goal of stardom. She soon devises a plan to remove Larry from the equation, which is spawned by giving a lecture to students at the town's high school. She enlists the help of a group of teenagers to help her in her murderous plan. This includes the seduction of a naïve young man named Jimmy and by befriending his group of friends. Suzanne's performance seducing Jimmy is so convincing the young man falls in love with her and would do anything she asks for, including murder. Soon Suzanne starts spinning wild tales of about Larry abusing her and telling Jimmy if Larry was no longer around, they could live happily ever after. So Jimmy and his friend Russell do the dirty deed and take out Larry, but very soon after Larry's family becomes extremely suspicious of Suzanne due to her behavior after the funeral and lack of remorse. At the same time Suzanne has gotten what she wants to out of Jimmy, so she immediately distances herself from him and his friends. This spurns a web of rumors that start to spread rapidly and eventually in a small town everyone knows what everyone else is doing or has done. The combination of shooting the film in the present and then including interview footage of the aftermath is captivating. The plot is crisp, clever, witty, insightful, intriguing and has a poetic ending. To this day this viewer can hear Suzanne saying, ""You're not really anyone in America if your not on TV"". That has never rung more true than in today's world. This is one of Van Sant's best films. It is memorable, mezmorizing and one of the very best in it's genre.",To Die For

75,Shaolin_Apu,Either you hate it or adore it...,8,27 October 2005,"It's just the few words by Kidman in the beginning of this film that give you a shattering effect. ""...My OWN name... is Suzanne Stone."" You just have to love her for doing such a normal thing as presenting your name in that irritating manner. It becomes instantly clear that there will be nothing good in that woman and makes you to watch the film to the end.The whole film is actually a fictional documentary on this woman played by Kidman, who is perfect in this role. It may be difficult to grasp everything that is present in this film, because the storyline is not linear but jumps from present to past and makes all scenes to 'discuss' with each other. For this reason the film is not particularly pleasant viewing and with a shallow looking you may mistake it for being just malicious hype. Good thing in this is that you still find pleasure in it after viewing it several times.Special item in this film is the role of Jimmy by young Joaquin Phoenix. He's just great to play this idiot for a young man. So tough and still so fragile Jimmy is made blind and seduced by Suzanne for her purposes that you have to feel sorry for him.

Done in mock documentary style, the film satirizes ambition, television, youth, and even documentaries.Nicole Kidman is perfect as Suzanne Stone, a young, cunning, but not terribly bright woman who is obsessed with the idea of being a television personality.  Matt Dillon plays her ill-fated husband who makes the mistake of not taking her seriously enough.  Other notable cast members include Joaquin Phoenix as an addled teen who becomes as obsessed with Suzanne as she is with television, Wayne Knight as her 'station' manager, Dan Hedaya, Kurtwood Smith, Casey Affleck ... all of them excellent.  The plot is taken from the Pamela Smart case in New England (by Buck Henry, who also appears), but the movie is less a murder mystery than a look at people's obsession with the media, and the media's obsession with the odd and criminal among us.Look for a great cameo from George Segal, and amuse yourself by guessing who Buck Henry and Gus Van Sant had in mind as the object of Segal's humorous anecdote.",To Die For

This twisted and riveting film has an extremely smart screenplay by Buck Henry and solid direction by Gus Van Sant, but most of all, it has a dazzling, 1000-megawatt starring performance by Nicole Kidman that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Kidman plays Suzanne Stone, an ambitious, self-absorbed, not-as-bright-as-she-thinks-she is, selfish career-driven woman who marries a nebbish (Matt Dillon)but when he begins to get in her way in her drive to become the next Barbara Walters, she cooks up an elaborate scheme to get him out of the picture. Yes, the story smacks of Pamela Smart and many other stories we've all heard but Henry, Van Sant, and Kidman put a delicious gloss on this story that makes it hard to resist. Kidman is brilliant as one of the most cold-hearted yet still sympathetic characters created for the screen. Joaquin Phoenix makes a strong impression as the high school student she talks into murdering her husband and Illeana Douglas is amusing as Dillon's sister. Kudoes also to Dan Hedaya who is chilling as Dillon's father who seeks his own justice regarding his son's murder.

Writer Buck Henry has changed the characters name, occupation, and a number of the irrelevant details, but this is unmistakably the Pamela Smart story.Played as dark comedy...! The heretofore unimpressive Buck Henry redeemed himself in my eyes with this wickedly amusing script.While peppering us with the kind of mirroring observations about the shallowness and stupidity of the media and the society it reflects which makes us both laugh and squirm with more than passing discomfort, the top-notch cast masterfully play out the excellent script in such a mesmerizing fashion you simply will not believe nearly two hours are gone when it is over.Nicole Kidman in particular displays intelligence and acting prowess I never imagined her capable of; she is in practically every frame of the film and while her character is truly despicable, you can't stop watching. The three teens, played by Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, and Alison Folland (who stands out as the easily led girl with a not too subtle lesbian infatuation on Suzanne Stone) are engaging. Perhaps the best of the cast after the lead is Illeana Douglas as the deliciously smart ass sister-in-law, she had me in stitches!

Nicole Kidman gives the performance that put her over the top as an american movie icon and she earns every kudo with her flawless turn as a woman driven mad by her lust for fame. Buck Henry's script is a perfect pitch commentary on america at the end of the 20th century and our ever increasing obsession with our fifteen minutes of fame. But to look at this film strictly as a moral lesson is to miss out on the beauty of Gus Van Sant's most fully realized stylistic achievement. all the parts add up, particularly the acting. the trio of young actors that play the henchmen(Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, and the revelatory Alison Folland-the film's christ symbol) Kidman lures into her twisted plans shine brighter than any of the older solid actors, though no one is doing a toss off on this one.

90,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,A great performance by Nicole Kidman,9,15 May 2005,"If you would like to see a really great performance by Nicole Kidman, pick up a copy of ""To Die For"" at your local video store. Directed by Gus Van Sant, screenplay by Buck Henry from the book by Joyce Maynard (both Henry and Maynard have bit parts in the film), ""To Die For"" is a wicked little gem of a film.Kidman won the Golden Globe award for Best Actress for her performance, and frankly I thought she should have gotten the Academy Award (unless I remember incorrectly, I don't think she was even nominated for an Academy Award for it). But she is absolutely brilliant in it: chilling, funny, scary, sexy, and horrifically evil.Kidman portrays Suzanne Stone-Maretto: a devious, calculating, self-centered woman who manipulates Larry Maretto (a very sympathetic performance by Matt Dillon) into marrying her, quickly tires of him when he tries to stand in her way of her greatest ambition in life, which is to be the next Diane Sawyer, and soon convinces her teenage lover to kill him for her. Sound familiar? ""To Die For"" was loosely based on the real-life story of Pamela Smart, who seduced her 15-year old lover into murdering her husband.Joaquin Phoenix is Jimmy Emmett, the hapless student who becomes Suzanne's lover; Lydia Mertz is Alison Follard, a young girl who idolizes her; and Casey Affleck is Russel Hines, another student who gets caught up in the scheme. Illeana Douglas is great as Larry's acidic, loving sister Janice, who also gets one of the best lines in the film, and at the very beginning, no less; and Dan Hedaya is Larry's father, Joe Maretto. Dan Hedaya is a master of the ""Believe me, you don't want to see me mad"" performance, with obvious menace just under a calm surface. The casting is great, and the performances are all right on target.Look for uncredited cameos by George Segal as a conference speaker, and David Cronenberg as...you'll just have to go see it.",To Die For
91,nunyerbiz,Above average satire + Nicole's best gig ever...,7,13 February 2001,"A quick breakdown on the plot, if you havn't read it already....Kidman's character wants nothing more than to be a big name TV personality, ala Oprah or Diane Sawyer or Susan Powder. She will do anything to reach this goal: manipulating, lying, killing etc. I won't go into anymore detail... as watching the movie itself (which I recommend) will fill in the blanks.This is one of those movies for me... You know... the kind that you'd never rank in your top 10, but you sit there and watch it whenever it appears on HBO...The acting in the film was excellent, even though the characters were somewhat stereotypical (dumb ambitious blond, trailer trash white kids, italian mob boss, etc). Nicole Kidman gave her best performance to date that I can recall. The supporting cast is also top notch all around. Supporting standouts included all of the 'trailer teens',Illeana Douglas as the 'mob sister-in-law', and Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) as the station manager.Many other reviewers here have a ""love-it"" or ""hate-it"" view of this movie. I have neither... I thought it was an above average film that succeeded much more than it failed. The success of the social satire aspects of the film more than outweigh some lapses in plot and story consistency.If you enjoy black comedy/satire, rent this movie. It will be more worth your $4 than ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" or ""The Patriot""I give it 7/10 overall. While the plot does have some holes, it has that odd ""Fargo"" quality that keeps you interested...",To Die For
92,timmyhollywood,Breakthrough for Joaquim...,8,27 April 2000,"Joaquim Phoenix is the true gem of this twisted yarn, nailing the depiction of a troubled, white-trash but typical teen replete with salacious, albeit innocent desires for the sexy Susanne Stone. Matt Dillon is the quintessential not-too-bright hunk husband for Stone to manipulate and thwart, and the rest of the gang fills out the ensemble like an exquisitely decorated trailer home. This movie is probably best recommended to any young man whose had his heart squeezed and popped like a bullfrog by a scintillating older woman or even same-age girlfriend. Even for someone who has just had a crush, gotten in too deep, or has ever known anyone (and we all have) that is as simultaneously seductive, wickedly loveable and atrociously cold as Kidman's Stone, this flick's got the goods.

94,alafolle,"Terrible, terrible film that fails on almost every level",2,15 June 2000,"A brief disclaimer:  I usually enjoy weird indie films, black comedies, and social satire.  So my distaste for this flick runs much deeper than a simple matter of personal preference, or not ""getting"" the point.When I first saw ""To Die For"", I almost walked out of the theater.  Upon viewing it years later, older and wiser, I liked it even less. Ordinarily, I would not waste my time panning an old movie, but I was appalled to see several slanderous reviewers comparing this piece of pretentious trash favorably to ""Election"" and ""American Beauty"", which were two of the best films of 1999.  This heresy cannot be left unchallenged.""To Die For"" tries very hard to be a satirical black comedy, an art film, and a meaningful commentary on the sordid, media-obsessed culture we live in.  It fails badly at all of these goals and rapidly degenerates into self-parody.First of all, the movie had no characters... it had caricatures-- 2-dimensional, cardboard cutouts.  While certain forms of satire can successfully utilize caricatures to represent certain types of people in society, these 2-D characters still have to display a certain amount of humanity in order for the viewers to see a reflection of something familiar. Nicole Kidman's character is such a cartoonish and transparent villain that it undercuts the point of the movie, and eliminates any chance at humor. I don't see anyone I know reflected in her character... I see Cruella DeVil or Natasha from Bullwinkle-- without the charm.  Even the trashiest, most manipulative TV anchor trying to sleep/murder her way to the top would have to occasionally convince someone that her intentions are pure.  Kidman doesn't.  Reece Witherspoon in ""Election"" portrays an exaggerated, but recognizable character, and the satire succeeds in that film.Apart from Joaquin Phoenix, the acting was atrocious.  Kidman gives an uneven, wooden performance and appears to be reading from cue cards.  Not a single character other than Phoenix was sympathetic or likeable.  While this may have been exactly the message Van Sant wished to convey about America, he goes too far and the satire completely fails.Van Sant wants to be taken seriously as an indie ""artist"", so he uses arty editing, sudden scene changes, and postmodern kitsch.  But all of these efforts are so clicheed and ham-handed that it just comes off as pretentious.  He wants to create an art-film parody of the American media. Instead he unintentionally creates a SNL-alum-type B-movie parody of art films.""To Die For"" does succeed somewhat at being sleazy, but not in any satisfying way.  In the seduction scene, the lighting is so bad and Kidman's demeanor so cold and rigid that I felt the horniest teenage male in the world would be turned off in spite of her hot bod and racy lingerie.This isn't even a ""good"" bad film which would be fun to gather around with some friends and a case of beer and watch in order to mock it.  It's just plain terrible.  I give it a 2 out of 10, merely out of respect for Joaquin Phoenix.Of course, that's just my opinion.  Some folks obviously feel otherwise.",To Die For

But there are worse ways to spend a hundred minutes if you've got nothing better to do.I kept waiting for a surprise, a twist, or maybe a bit of humor that would make me burst out laughing, but there's none of that here. This is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) at its simplest. And what you see in this case is blonde, ambitious, fluffchick (Nicole Kidman), obsessed with getting a career in television, marries likable dolt (Matt Dillon) and plays with him till marriage gets to be a drag, then happily offs him with help of three slackers who are even dumber yet.Most of the scenes seem to be played for laughs and there's definitely humor here, but everything is so clichéd, it falls pretty flat. There's no comic timing, no surprises, just fluffchick, dolt, slackers and ... well, you get the picture.As others have pointed out, yes, it is well acted, and yes, it kinda is well-directed (except for the part about it not quite working).",To Die For

97,cathyyoung1,"Smart, chilly, brilliant satire",8,11 May 2000,"""To Die For"" is a sharp, pitiless commentary on the modern media/celebrity culture in which real life is eclipsed by image. As the film's anti-heroine says, nothing matters unless it's on TV.  The movie is distinguished by an intelligent, witty, fast-moving script, very good direction, and superb performances by Nicole Kidman (I've always found her to be a rather cold actress, but in this role that quality is just right), Joaquin Phoenix as her dim-witted teenage lover, and Ileana Douglas as her no-nonsense sister-in-law.  (Matt Dillon is OK too, in a rather pallid role as Suzanne's husband Larry.)  The rest of the cast is very competent.  The material is handled deftly and inventively -- the scene in which one of the boys Suzanne hired to kill her husband is arrested while clam-fishing with his dad, and the detectives wade into the water to pick him up, is a truly inspired touch.  The scenes from the ""Teens Speak Out"" documentary Suzanne is shooting are hilarious.Some people who didn't like the film think it's implausible that the super-ambitious Suzanne would stay in a small town rather than going, say, to New York and trying for a job in broadcast journalism, and marry a laid-back guy like Larry Moretto.  Well, maybe she thought it would be easier for her to get her start in local broadcast journalism where the competition isn't quite as stiff.  And maybe she was genuinely attracted to Larry.  I think one of the things people miss is that while Suzanne is driven to succeed at any cost, she isn't particularly talented or intelligent.  Regardless, even if this part of the plot is less than convincing, the rest of the movie still works.If there is one thing to criticize about this movie, it's that it is relentlessly cold and never shows any sympathy for any of its characters, virtually all of whom are contemptible in one way or another.  (For a contrast, see the 1997 film ""Boogie Nights,"" which also satirizes its characters and their dreams of glory, but still treats them with a certain degree of affection and never loses sight of their humanity.)  ""To Die For"" never rises above the level of satire.  The satire, however, is intelligently conceived and brilliantly executed.",To Die For

Nicole Kidman is convincing and amazing, Matt Dillon unlikely than the other roles he's been playing and Joaquin Phoenix sweetly innocent (in one of his best roles). Casey Affleck is also co-starring in a small role of Russell. Amusing as well as a serious movie, based on true events. Suzanne (Kidman) has just married Larry Mazetto, but she doesn't let her marriage stop her dreams of draw a little attention and becoming a big TV profile. In her way to the top, she must start from the bottom... and as time pass by, she becomes all more fixed by the thought of becoming TV star.

101,Jeope!,"It's All About the Acting, Baby.",8,7 February 2001,"""To Die For"" is a wonderful example of superb acting chops.
Directed by the Gus Van Sant with balls (egs. ""My Own Private Idaho"", ""Drugstore Cowboy"" -- later replaced by Gus Van Shmaltz of ""Good Will Hunting and ""Finding Forrester""), this is a dark and savvy picture, disturbing and funny, boasting one of the decade's finest acting performances by a member of the fairer sex. The presently available Nicole Kidman churns out her best role to date, delicately switching emotional channels between empowerment and ruthlessness. Often looking directly at the camera, her sense of confidence is overwhelming as she guides you through her story. And while ""To Die For"" adopts a familiar tale, that of one-woman's-rise-to-fame-and-what-not, the steps it takes to get from Point A to Point B are truly original, tip-toeing through a virtual garden of backstabbing, deceit and murder.Backed by a fine supporting cast including Matt Dillon, Joaquin Pheonix (watch out for this guy, right?), Casey Affleck, Wayne Knight (!) and Kurtwood Smith (!!!), ""To Die For"", in the end, is a woman's movie. Not to the kickass nth degree of ""Thelma & Louise"" mind you, but it is apparent navigating through this film that the ladies rule the coop. Alison Folland fleshes out a true-to-life teenager (having never acted before in her life, she, like ""Dancer in the Dark""'s Björk, can only 'be'), and Illeana Douglas is more than a worthy adversary for Kidman. The men, it seems, are merely here to get screwed around. And it is lovely to watch.Check it out.",To Die For
102,trickrider,Excellent!,8,20 December 2003,"I remember when this flick came out back in '95 I ignored because I basically  I wasn't that impressed with Nicole Kidma..err.Mrs. Tom Cruise! I mean really! Tom marries this cute aussie girl he meets on the set of Days Of Thunder and next thing you know they're hitched! I don't recall anything she was in after that until To Die For came out. That and the fact that she looked like a carbon copy of my ex-girlfriend in looks and attitude...people would actually stop and ask my ex for her autograph sometimes when we are out..she would politely say ""I am not nicole but thanks for the compliment"".  But all in all my opinion of Nicole's acting talent changed with Moulin Rouge. In that movie she showed great range and dramatic believabilty. So I went ahead and watched To Die For for the first time the other day. I did enjoy it..somewhat. It dealt with the emptiness of small town life. Especially if you had big city aspirations. In this day of Reality shows and the  ""doanything to get on TV"" attitude that prevails in our world, this show was ahead of it's time. Of course I don't think reality TVwill ever ask anyone to kill someone to be on TV! But the characters in TDF were all wanting something, even if they weren't aware of how much they wanted it. And in the end it cost them the very future they were hoping to secure. Joqauin wanted a life with Nicole and Nicole wanted to be Connie Chung or Barbara Walters or whoever. Was this supposed to be a message movie or just a picture of what life is like for desperate ambitious people? It seemed like a documentary at times.

Nicole Kidman is chillingly fantastic as a media wannabe who'll stop at nothing to reach her goals, even motivating three misfit teens into murdering her husband. After having seen -Gladiator-, I was especially interested in paying closer attention to Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of one of the troubled trio; he, too, is a standout. -- There are parts of this movie that I found rather laugh-out-loud funny; some of it is witty; the portrayal of society and its obsession with fame/notoriety, getting ahead, etc., is scathing at times. But I must confess that I did not particularly like the film as an entire package, for reasons I cannot quite define.

106,wrcong,Art imitates life,5,15 June 2005,"This is a so-so film. It is reasonably entertaining and has some good performances. I am struck by something in reading 20 or so of the 92 comments on this film. None of them have noted one of the more important facts about this story: that is that ""To Die For"" is loosely based on a real-life drama that unfolded in New England involving a teacher's aide named Pamela Smart who was convicted of having enlisted her teen-aged lover and some of his dull-witted school mates to murder her husband. A&E's series ""American Justice"" ran a very good episode on the subject which they, in true A&E fashion, re-air periodically. It is fascinating to see what Buck Henry did with that true story in ""To Die For."" Jimmy Emmett, as written by Hery and portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, comes very close to Pamela Smart's real-life boyfriend (and I use the term BOYfriend advisedly). The real life teen was obviously smitten by the attractive older woman (Pamela Smart is no Nicole Kidman, but she was reasonably attractive and, more importantly for a teen-ager, willing). The scenes of his testimony during the trial of Pamela Smart are riveting because he was obviously so naive as to have believed that Ms. Smart was in love with him and wanted to be with him. Phoenix captures the mind of that teen confused teen brilliantly. In this case, seeing the real life story helped me as a viewer better understand Phoenix's take on the character.On the other hand, Henry makes Suzanne a reprehensible character, too dim-witted to understand how little she actually knows; ultimately she wasn't even smart enough to realize that manipulating less-than-brilliant teens into an act of murder was not likely to end well. Henry, I think, took more liberties with the 'real life"" character here than he did with Jimmy Emmett. The primary attribute Suzanne has in common with Pamela Smart is a willingness to manipulate teen agers to do her bidding. Nonetheless, Henry's take on Suzanne is Buck Henry at his leeringly sardonic best.Nicole Kidman is not one of my favorite actors, but she does well in this role of Suzanne, largely due to Henry's wonderfully caustic take on the ambition to be a television personality. Suzanne's only talent is her looks, but the only people she can find who readily agree that has sufficient looks to be a TV news personality are a small group of troubled teen agers. No one else is fooled other than her equally love-struck husband (Matt Dillon).""To Die For"" is not a great film by any means. At times the story slows to a crawl as Henry tries to delve into some depth in the relationships. Of course that is not really what the film is about -- it's about Henry's acerbic take on celebrity in America circa the final decade of the 20th century. On that level the movie works. Where it doesn't work so well, despite the strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix, is in the portrayal of the teenagers. Their motivations are complex (more complex than simply having sex with the gorgeous older woman) and neither the screenplay nor the direction manage to pull off the merger of the dramatic story of Jimmy Emmett with the dark comedy of Suzanne.",To Die For
107,kgehebe,You're Nobody if You're Not On Television,9,30 January 2020,"I watched this movie again following the death of Buck Henry. I'd forgotten how good it was and even more relevant today than it was 25 years ago. Henry's adaptation was taken from a book by Joyce Maynard (which I just ordered yesterday) based on the real life case of Pamela Smart. Smart has made headlines recently because of the 30th anniversary of her trial and that of her teenage lover who she recruited to kill her husband. It was one of the first sensational murder trials that was televised...before O.J there was Pamela Smart.The movie hammers themes bigger than a sensational murder case and is savagely funny. Vapid celebrity worship, empty values and narcissistic Me culture...Suzanne is the personification of the best and worse of the decade that was on a holiday from history, the 90s. Nicole Kidman is brilliant in her starring role as Suzanne Stone, a beautiful, plastic china doll who is ruthless in her ambition to become the next Barbara Walters. Nothing will get in her way, and God help the fool who says No to her. The story is told in flashback which gives it the correct irreverant tone. From the very beginning we see through Kidman's (who's never been more beautiful in any role since then) phony warmth, a thin veneer that most everyone sees through except for the men she used for her own ends. She wears a cheezy Miss America exterior with not much else underneath.Kidman is surrounded by an outstanding supporting cast giving memorable performances in their own right. Matt Dillion is spot on as Suzanne's kind hearted but clueless husband who pays the ultimate price for daring to question Stone's goals. Joaquin Phoenix is zombified perfection as her sex obsessed teenage lover who is ultimately betrayed by Suzanne. Illeana Douglas is terrific as Dillion's sister who ""never got the Suzanne thing."" Buck Henry has a cameo as a school administrator and makes the most of his brief screen time.

108,simmmz,Kidman creates one of the most memorable sociopaths in the history of cinema in this richly textured satire,9,11 April 2011,"Gus Van Sant's richly textured satire of the media is an engaging and dynamic cinema experience. Even the Nicole Kidman skeptics (and I know there are many of you out there) should enjoy this star-making performance.Kidman plays the ambitious Suzanne Stone. She has stars in her eyes with dreams of making it big as a TV journalist. She marries the well connected Larry Maretto (Matt Dillon) to keep her financially sound, but her marriage takes a sinister turn as her career becomes to 'blossom'. Suzanne Stone is a character with a few screws loose. She is not as intelligent as she thinks she is, but smart enough to fool the stupid. She will do anything to get anywhere. She is a ruthless go-getter who knows what she wants and knows exactly how to get it.and the result is deadly. This is a film that employs the use of various dynamic devices that give it a rare energy. Conventional film-making is inter-cut with fake- documentary interviews – and whilst this can be jarring in some circumstances (I'm thinking Infamous), it is seamless, and apt considering the themes of To Die For.Nicole Kidman is absolutely fantastic in this, owning every scene. Suzanne Stone is a character any actor would kill to play, and she makes the most of it, eating it up with relish. I'm a sucker for characters with Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Kidman creates one of the most memorable sociopaths in the history of cinema. What a breakthrough. The hair and makeup for Suzanne's character also deserves special mention. There is this strange mixture of sexiness, and something so repulsive, with those excessive finger nails, hot pink lipstick and clownish blush it's so over the top. There's something nonhuman about her look, and it is fantastic. The writing is sharp, but this is not a realistic screenplay. There are some genuinely unsettling moments, creating a unique blend of black comedy/satire/thriller that flirts with the boundary of farce, but with enough depth to keep it grounded. What really stood out when viewing To Die For in 2011, was the relevance of the satire in the new millennium. Being swept up by the self- indulgence and vanity inherent in Facebook and Twitter myself, I think there's a bit of Suzanne Stone in all of us.and that makes To Die For all the more powerful.",To Die For

After watching ""Murder In New Hampshire: The Pamela Smart Story"" I expected a lot more than this. In fact I never made it to the end. Though Nichole Kidman was good not to mention Wayne Knight who stole every scene he was in couldn't save this. The kids were slow learners but the way they are portrayed here one would think differently. I do understand that the movie wasn't based on the actual case but inspired by it yet it followed the TV movie perfectly.I think this was the first movie where the entire cast had really nothing to do. The casting was way off, zero chemistry or character development. Nicole Kidman is more of a dramatic actress and doesn't shine in comedies. The best actor here was Wayne Knight as for what I stated earlier stole the movie. Joaquin Phoenix looked like he was high on drugs in every scene and the girl had complex and self esteem issues but hear they had her as if she was totally unmotivated.Now I don't leave movies unfinished but I couldn't torture myself any longer with this one. I think the director was unsure which way to go or wasn't too experienced. I say that cause each time the camera faced a character that talked about what was going on then they shown it made it pretty hard to follow. They didn't give good cause to have her husband murdered, the issues with the marriage was brought on by her working long hour's not him changing his character for a job. I'll continue with if they wanted to cash in on a headline case they should have followed the numbers and not make it some dark comedy. I have followed that case and read the book plus watched the Helen Hunt TV movie so when I realized this was based upon that I finally opted to watch it.Now several have gave this movie some really good ratings but myself can't see what they saw in it. Was any of it Oscar Material ""no"" did any star stick out ""yes"" but not any of the main characters (Wayne Knight who had a supporting role) even Tim Hopper who played the studio cameraman stood out.

Jimmy falls into the hands of the dangerously fame-hungry TV Weather Girl Suzanne (Nicole Kidman) and finds himself in more trouble than he could ever have imagined back in his previously uneventful life, dragging his loser friends with him.

118,jigeeshu23,Good Movie,8,4 May 2010,"To die for is a very good movie but not the one to die for. the message is conveyed using subtle characters. i liked the idea of each family member and few acquaintances expressing their opinion about the controversial weather woman, Suzanne Stone Maretto; which includes people of different ages and with varied taste.i believe, in contemporary societies, prize is only given for achievements and not for personality which, indoctrinate Suzanne to believe that she must do something occult to become a celebrated personality or qualify her as a famous person. and thus she says ' what's the point of doing anything worthwhile if there's nobody watching? So when people are watching, it makes you a better person.'this movie is even more relevant in 21st century because with advent of the concept of reality shows on world television, it has become an easier and lucrative way to catapult into limelight. but this is always followed by several sacrifices. more than often people fail to strike a balance and the result is always catastrophic. Again this is well said with a quote : 'if everybody was on TV all the time, there wouldn't be anybody left to watch, and that's where I get confused.'Nicole is at her best and so are others. however, i believe the end is not very impressive except the music and skating girl on the ice.",To Die For
119,ewa-12,Excellent!,10,21 September 2003,"This film is fantastic and Nicole Kidman was made to play Suzanne Stone.It's an acute satire on American obsession with television and unreal picture of life that comes with it. It's extremely funny, moving and shocking at the same time. Also the way it was filmed and put together is quite original and suits the movie's main theme perfectly! Must see!",To Die For
120,tperry-indiana,Based on the murder of Greg Smart by his scheming wife Pam,7,8 November 2009,"Gregg Smart was murdered in 1990 when his wife, Pam, convinced high school students, one of whom she was having sex with, to kill him for her. Billy Flynn though he & Pam were in love with each other and she convinced him that they could be together forever if Gregg were dead. When Billy Flynn testified, he described the actual killing of Gregg Smart. He stated in his testimony that he said ""God, forgive me"" and pulled the trigger. This is word for word what Joaquin Phoenix's character said before he shot Matt Dillon's character.There are many similarities between real life and this movie. Young wife, unhappy in her marriage, seduces and has an affair with a high school student while working on a video project with high school students. Gregg had given a Shih Tzu to Pam, just as Matt Dillon's character gave Nicole Kidman's character a dog. Gregg Smart worked with his father in the insurance business, Matt Dillon's character worked with his family in the restaurant business. Both Pam and Nicole Kidman's character had aspirations of becoming a famous news reporter. Both Pam and Nicole Kidman's character jumped right in front of every camera they could after the murder. Both Gregg & Matt Dillon's character were shot & killed in the foyer of their home.There are a few differences between the actual murder of Greg Smart and this movie. The main difference is that this movie is kind of a black comedy and there was absolutely nothing funny about what actually happened to Gregg Smart and his family. One other difference is that as shallow as Nicole Kidman's character was, she managed to make it to her first anniversary with Matt Dillon's character...Gregg did not live long enough to make it to their first anniversary. In the movie, only two boys & one girl are involved in the plot & murder. Pam ended up having involved, directly or indirectly through Billy Flynn, five students, four boys and one girl in the plot & actual murder. The main difference is that, in the movie, Matt Dillon's family gets an eye for an eye justice. Nicole Kidman's character disappears but is shown at the end frozen in a lake, dead! For Pam Smart life goes on. Yes, she is in prison, where she deserves to be but she still gets to further her education and visit with family & friends. Gregg is gone, his family has only a tombstone to visit.",To Die For
121,lisuebie,well-made cardboard cutouts- awful movie,4,16 February 2007,"The protagonist is completely unmotivated- she is merely pure evil. Her victim-lover is given nothing more than stupidity and the simplest base sexual desire as his motives.It is based on a novel based on a real story. The reality was tragedy- for the young man used, for the woman who for whatever reasons in her life arrived at the moment where she decided to kill by proxy and manipulate. We are given no understanding, no exploration. We are given toying around with cinematic method, pretty pictures, excellent acting by Kidman and Phoenix.But that is not enough when dealing with issues that deep. Sorry. The movie absolutely sucks for me because of its disrespectful treatment of its characters. Their humanity, their frailties and failures are reduced to sneered-at, pitiful cardboard cutouts.Bah.",To Die For

No question that if this film came out now, it would sweep every major award out there. I still can't believe it got zero Oscar nods back in the day.Van Sant is a much unrated director, and Illeana Douglas is always so cool.

125,atlasfalcon,One of the most underrated films of the 1990's,8,29 March 2003,"A lot of people dislike To Die For.  The film's detractors largely find fault with its tone and subject matter.  It is really the epitome of black comedy, and anyone expecting either pure comedy or pure suspense will be very disappointed.That said, To Die For deserves a place in film history as one of the sharpest satires of television and fame, ranking alongside films such as Network.  Forgive the cliche, but Nicole Kidman's performance is truly a revelation -- she shows talents that were clearly invisible in earlier travesties such as Far & Away and are only now beginning to resurface. But the real discovery in this film is the magnificent Illeana Douglass.  It is scandalous that few people mention her amazing work when discussing To Die For.  If for nothing else, the film should be seen for the work of Kidman and Douglass.  (Note also that To Die For has one of Joaquin Phoenix's earliest roles.)As other commentators here have suggested, you are not guaranteed to love this film.  Nonetheless, as far as I'm concerned, it's required viewing if you're a film fan.",To Die For

I believe it is a highly original and funny comedy, with good acting (well, maybe Nicole just plays herself on the film) and a great atmosphere. I saw it quite a long time ago, so I cannot remember too well why I liked it so much, but the CHARACTERS of Suzanne (the shark: deadly, cold and greedy) by Nicole Kidman, Larry (innocent, catholic, primary and with really bad taste, but really in love with Suzanne-Nicole) by Matt Dillon and Jimmy (even more primary, slightly retarded, a tool for Suzanne's ambitious dreams) by a magnificent Joaquim Phoenix (his best role so far) will stay in my film memory forever.

Actually, I remember more about where I sat in theatre than the plot.  This movie may be the most boring movie I have ever seen in a theatre.  Never have I walked out of a movie, but this was the one time I considered it. There is nothing to like about this movie, except having the choice not to see it.  Avoid like the plague.

Some of them you make it through and some of them you walk out on and demand your money back. This one is something that you would really have to sit through and pay attention in order to get the whole vision. Here we have a spoiled little woman that has always gotten what she wants. She seduces a humble gentlemen into marrying her never really looking past her initial goal of being on television. The way that the director chose to shoot this film is gives it a timeless feel to it. There is nothing here that has not been in the media already. Nicole gives a sexy dominating evil yet innocent performance that you really have to pay attention to.The thinks that happen in this movie are completely plausible.

135,Perturbed27,An Above Average Contribution to a Well Worn Theme,7,2 January 2011,"Nicole Kidman is fantastic as Suzanne Stone Moretto, who just needs to be on television because if you're not on TV nothing you do can ever be considered important. Right? Well, obviously we are dealing with satire here, and most of it is pretty successful. Sure, by now we know we live in a celebrity-obsessed culture in the U.S., and no new ground is broken here. Some might even say Kidman's character is trite and one-note (self-obsessed, evil, stupid, portrayed in an utterly unnuanced way), and they could be right, but she also interprets the material with a great deal of intelligence and savvy. I've never really been a Joaquin Phoenix fan (always found him annoying, this is no exception), but he doesn't get in the way too much.This is one of those rare Gus Van Sant movies that doesn't have a homosexual subtext (at least not one I was able to detect), thank God.

The only thing that kept me in my seat was the anticipation that the plot would finally take an interesting twist, or that something interesting at all would happen on the screen. After the movie was over I looked at my friend and asked him ""Was that as bad as I thought it was?"" he answered ""Yes, that was the stupidest movie I've ever seen."" It's not like I don't like dark comedies - I loved Heathers, but this is no Heathers. I guess if you really like movies where you basically know what is going to happen next, and there are no characters even close to being likable or pitying, then you will like this movie.

The only actor I liked was Matt Dillon and I'm not much of a Dillon fan. BUT, As he gets older, he is getting better roles, like CRASH, which he does a great job!! I love Joaquin! No matter what he stars in, he really gets into his role. He has more than just an acting job, he just transforms himself to his character like no actor I have seen!
